Burnley striker Chris Wood had opened the scoring six minutes before half-time thanks to a fortuitous close-range finish. However, the visitors hit back in the second half, with first Joshua King equalising (74), before Wilson won it in the third minute of stoppage time.

The contest did not really come alive until the 20th minute when England hopeful Nick Pope had to be alert to keep out Lys Mousset's low drive after nice build-up play down the right by Jordon Ibe. However, it was Burnley who went in ahead at the break thanks to a fortuitous goal from Wood - in for the injured Ashley Barnes - the striker's 11th in all competitions this season. Joshua King celebrates his goal with team-mate Charlie Daniels after equalising The hosts worked the ball around nicely, before Ashley Ward escaped to the left-hand byline and pulled the ball back for the waiting Ashley Westwood. The midfielder - who has not scored all season - saw his goalbound strike deflect off Wood and into the back of the net, the New Zealand international's 11th goal in all competitions this season. Burnley's Matthew Lowton (left) tackles Bournemouth's Lys Mousset Bournemouth turned the game around in the second half, though, with two goals in the final quarter of an hour, the leveller an absolute beauty from King. The visitors were initially unlucky not to equalise through substitute Jermain Defoe's bullet header, only for Pope to deny the substitute with an outstanding reaction stop. Team news Scott Arfield and Dean Marney - who both leave Turf Moor this summer - joined Ben Mee, Ashley Barnes, Steven Defour and Robbie Brady on the sidelines. Meanwhile, Harry Arter (Achilles) and Adam Smith (knee) missed out with injury, while forward Junior Stanislas remained absent with a knee problem. However, Bournemouth kept the ball alive, before King curled an unstoppable shot into the top right-hand corner of the net, before a terrible mistake at the back gifted Howe's team their winner. Burnley centre-back Kevin Long slipped over, allowing Defoe a clear run on goal, and the striker then drew in the final man before releasing the unmarked Wilson, who made no mistake with a composed finish. England watch Burnley No 1 Nick Pope gave England boss Gareth Southgate a reminder of his undoubted abilities with a string of eye-catching saves at Turf Moor, the best of which to deny Lys Mousset in the first half. James Tarkowski, meanwhile, turned in another solid display at the back for the hosts. As for Bournemouth, Jermain Defoe’s late cameo off the bench - the veteran striker was unlucky not to score with a close-range header, before creating Callum Wilson’s winner – may have also given Southgate a timely nudge before he names his final 23-man squad for Russia.

Selhurst Park. Palace finish the season unbeaten in their last six matches as second-half strikes from Wilfried Zaha and Patrick van Aanholt helped the hosts to a deserved three points against Darren Moore's side. After a scrappy first half, Zaha broke the deadlock in the 70th minute before Van Aanholt scored for the third successive match (78') to ensure Palace finished the campaign on a high note. Moore suffered his first loss as caretaker manager of West Brom, who will be playing Sky Bet Championship football next season. Player ratings C Palace: Hennessey (6), Wan-Bissaka (7), Sakho (6), Tomkins (6), Van Aanholt (8), McArthur (7), Cabaye (6), Loftus-Cheek (7), Milivojevic (6), Zaha (8), Townsend (6) Subs: Benteke (6), Lee Chung-Yong (N/A), Souare (N/A) West Brom: Foster (7), Nyom (5), Dawson (6), Hegazi (5), Gibbs (4), Brunt (5), Krychowiak (6), Livermore (5), McClean (4), Rodriguez (5), Rondon (5) Subs: Chadli (N/A), Robson-Kanu (N/A), Sturridge (N/A) Man of the match: Patrick van Aanholt West Brom almost took the lead in the third minute when James McArthur's cross was stabbed towards goal by Chris Brunt, but Ben Foster did well to reach down and batted it away. Moments later at the other end, Grzegorz Krychowiak's driven volley whistled narrowly wide of Wayne Hennessey's right post. The closest chance of the half fell to Zaha who, off-balance, poked a shot on goal from close range which Foster stopped with his trailing leg in the 17th minute. Palace continued to stroke the ball around for the remainder of the half but lacked the finishing touch as West Brom soaked up the pressure in a scrappy opening 45 minutes. Team news Aaron Wan-Bissaka came in for Joel Ward at right-back. Grzegorz Krychowiak replaced Matt Phillips in the West Brom starting XI. In the 55th minute, Ruben Loftus-Cheek's shot was caught by Foster from close range six minutes before Andros Townsend missed a golden opportunity to put Palace a goal up. With the West Brom defence scrambling, he slipped over when he tried to connect with Zaha's squared pass. But fortunately team-mate Zaha atoned for Townsend's error by putting Palace a goal up. Van Aanholt drilled the ball across for the 25-year-old to deftly volley home his fifth goal in his last six matches. Then, just eight minutes later, the provider turned goalscorer as Van Aanholt latched onto Townsend's incisive pass before rounding Foster and slotting away to complete what has been a remarkable turnaround by Roy Hodgson and his side in the second half of the season. Opta stats West Bromwich Albion have finished bottom of the top-flight for a record 10th season and the second time in the Premier League era (also 2008-09). Crystal Palace won three consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since April 2017. Wilfried Zaha has been involved in six goals in his last six Premier League games (5 goals, 1 assist). Patrick van Aanholt has scored five goals in his last 10 Premier League games and scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time.

In the first half, we had a lot of possession but they are a hard team to break down. They work very hard and are very organised defensively but I was hoping if we could up the tempo a little bit and keep going. The longer the game went along the more chances opened up and I'm really proud of the players. We've been safe for two games.

Wenger acknowledges the crowd at the John Smith's Stadium Meanwhile, Huddersfield, who secured their survival with a draw at Chelsea in midweek, can look forward to another season of Premier League football despite their final-day defeat, confirming a 16th-place finish. Wenger was greeted by a guard of honour and marvellous reception ahead of kick-off in what was a party atmosphere at the John Smith's Stadium. Arsenal and Huddersfield fans alike applauded the Frenchman as he walked over to acknowledge the away end before the match, bowing in front of the travelling supporters. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Hadergjonaj (6), Jorgensen (7), Schindler (7), Kongolo (7), Lowe (6), Hogg (6), Mooy (7), Pritchard (7), Ince (8), Mounie (7). Subs: Depoitre (6), Billing (6), Whitehead (n/a) Arsenal: Ospina (8), Bellerin (6), Mustafi (7), Holding (7), Kolasinac (7), Ramsey (6), Xhaka (7), Iwobi (6), Mkhitaryan (6), Lacazette (7), Aubameyang (7). Subs: Welbeck (7), Monreal (6), Maitland-Niles (6). Man of the match: David Ospina Huddersfield started the brighter of the two sides and they should have been ahead in the 11th minute when Alex Pritchard's cut-back picked out Tom Ince, but the winger's shot sailed high over the crossbar. The tributes to Wenger continued to come during the game as two planes flew over the Stadium, carrying messages of support for the Frenchman. \"Merci Arsene, we will miss you too,\" one read in response to Wenger's goodbye speech last week, while the other read: \"#OneArseneWenger\". A banner was flown over the John Smith's Stadium in support of Wenger Then, after 22 minutes, the entire stadium rose as one to applaud Wenger - marking the length of his reign - with chants of \"there's only one Arsene Wenger\" also springing up throughout pockets of the home support as well as the entire away end. There was even more for Wenger to smile about when his side took the lead with what was their first real clear-cut opportunity of the game. It was a goal that Wenger would certainly have approved of as Alexandre Lacazette and Henrikh Mkhitaryan combined with some slick one-touch passing before Aubameyang slid in to convert Aaron Ramsey's cross to score his ninth Premier League goal. Team news David Wagner made four changes for the visit of Arsenal. Florent Hadergjonaj came back into the side, replacing Tommy Smith, who dropped to the bench. Alex Pritchard also returned to the side for Rajiv van La Parra, while Tom Ince and Steve Mounie also returned. Arsenal also made four changes as Arsene Wenger named his final starting XI. Petr Cech, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Danny Welbeck and the suspended Konstantinos Mavropanos were replaced by David Ospina, Hector Bellerin, Shkodran Mustafi and Alexandre Lacazette. After the break, Huddersfield went close to an equaliser through Ince, whose low shot looked destined for the bottom corner until David Ospina got his fingertips to the ball. There was almost a final sting in the tail for Arsenal but Aaron Mooy's powerful strike clipped the top of the crossbar and Laurent Depoitre's header was snaffled by Ospina as the Gunners held on as Wenger signed off with a victory. Arsenal fans pay their respects to Wenger Opta stats This was Arsene Wenger's 1235th and final game as Arsenal manager - his final record with the Gunners was W707 D280 L248. The John Smith's Stadium was the 48th different ground Wenger won at in the Premier League - more than any other manager in the competition (Alex Ferguson 47). Huddersfield have failed to score in 21 different Premier League games this season - only Derby (22 in 2007-08) have ever failed in more in a single campaign. This was the first away game Arsenal won in the Premier League in which Alexis Sanchez didn't score since October 2016 (1-0 at Burnley thanks to Laurent Koscielny's goal). It was also the first time Arsenal kept a Premier League clean sheet on the road since December (0-0 vs West Ham), having conceded in each of their last nine before today. 1-0 was Arsene Wenger's third most common scoreline in Arsenal games in all competitions (124), after 1-1 and 2-1 (127 each). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in 14 goals in just 13 Premier League games (10 goals, 4 assists). Only Alan Shearer (16), Mick Quinn (16) and Kevin Phillips were involved in more in their first 13 in the competition. England Watch There were not many contenders for Gareth Southgate’s squad on show at the John Smith’s Stadium. Danny Welbeck appeared from Arsenal bench to play the last 23 minutes and he used his pace to good effect on the left flank, but his finishing wasn’t quite up to scratch.Meanwhile, Jack Wilshere wasn’t named in Arsene Wenger’s final squad. Man of the Match - David Ospina David Ospina will continue in goal in cup competitions, says Arsene Wenger Huddersfield bombarded Arsenal with crosses into the box but Wenger's defence was helped out by a commanding performance from Ospina. The Colombian goalkeeper dominated his penalty area to great effect and his handling was excellent. He also made a couple of crucial saves, in particular to deny Laurent Depoitre right on the goal line in stoppage time."}, {"date": "13/05/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 50752, "home_team":

the Premier League with a thrilling 4-0 victory over Brighton at Anfield on the final day of the season. Mohamed Salah's 32nd goal of the season - a record in a 38-game Premier League season - got the dominant Reds going on 26 minutes before Dejan Lovren doubled their lead five minutes before half-time. Brighton offered little by way of a response and Dominic Solanke's stunning first goal for Liverpool and a maiden strike from Andy Robertson added further gloss to the impressive performance. The victory, coupled with Chelsea's defeat at Newcastle, means Liverpool will be playing in Europe's premier competition next season, regardless of the outcome of their Champions League final date with Real Madrid on May 26. Player ratings Liverpool: Karius (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Van Dijk (7), Lovren (8), Robertson (8), Wijnaldum (7), Henderson (7), Solanke (7), Salah (9), Mane (8), Firmino (8).

Subs: Gross (5), Murray (5), Goldson (5). Man of the Match: Mohamed Salah. In a straight shootout with Chelsea for the final Champions League qualification spot, Liverpool entered their final league game of the season simply needing to avoid defeat to finish in the top four, but a tense and frustrating first half unfolded. After Solanke failed to punish Shane Duffy after he under hit a back pass, Liverpool were denied two penalties as the Brighton centre-back's handball and challenge on Salah in the area went unpunished by referee Kevin Friend. Sadio Mane failed to convert Liverpool's first clear opening on 19 minutes before Virgil van Dijk glanced a header wide shortly after. Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring against Brighton But 26 minutes of frustration finally came to an end when Solanke poked the ball through to Salah and he fired his record-breaking goal beyond Mat Ryan. After Roberto Firmino fired over, Salah should have had a second on the half hour but Ryan thwarted him after Mane's selfless square pass and Duffy blocked his follow-up off the line. Team news Dominic Solanke replaced the injured James Milner in the Liverpool line-up while Sadio Mane allayed pre-match fitness concerns to start. Chris Hughton made three changes for Brighton as Jurgen Locadia, Solly March and Beram Kayal were recalled. Ryan prevented Georginio Wijnaldum from added a second but his defences were soon breached again as Lovren rose high to head Robertson's cross home. Solanke clincally finished a scintillating counter involving Salah and Firmino to finally break his Liverpool duck on 53 minutes before Robertson made it two first-time scorers for the afternoon as he rifled a shot home after Lewis Dunk failed to clear Danny Ings' cross. England watch Trent Alexander-Arnold strengthened his claims to be included in Southgate’s 23-man squad with a flawless performance at right-back which would have yielded a number of assists on another day. Jordan Henderson was solid in midfield while Adam Lallana got more precious minutes under his belt as he continues his comeback from injury. Opta stats Liverpool have finished in the top four in consecutive Premier League seasons for the first time since a run of four between 2005/06 and 2008/09. The Reds have remained unbeaten at home in a top-flight season for the seventh time in their history, more than any other side has managed. This was the fourth time Liverpool won both Premier League games against an opponent by a 4+ goal margin, and first since doing so against Spurs in 2013/14. Liverpool have had 16 different Premier League goalscorers this season - only in 2015/16 have they ever had more in a single campaign (17). Mohamed Salah now holds the record for most goals in a 38-game Premier League campaign, with 32 this season. Salah has also scored against 17 different opponents in the Premier League this season - no player has ever scored against more in a single campaign. Dominic Solanke scored his first ever goal for Liverpool in all competitions, in what was his 27th game for the club. Man of the Match - Mohamed Salah Mohamed Salah celebrates after giving Liverpool the lead The Egypt international paved the way for Liverpool to secure their place in the top four. Salah's 32nd league goal - his 44th in all competitions - settled whatever nerves may have been lingering around Anfield and took him past the milestone for a 38-match season shared by Alan Shearer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suarez.

Liverpool travel to Kiev on May 26 in search of a sixth European crown when they take on Real Madrid in the Champions League final."}, {"date": "13/05/2018", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance":

final game for Manchester United ended in victory as Marcus Rashford's goal earned United a 1-0 win over Watford. Carrick was instrumental in United's opener in the 34th minute, as he played the ball over the top for Juan Mata, who then laid it off for Rashford to score his seventh league goal of the season. Watford should have levelled on the stroke of half-time through Richarlison, but the Brazilian headed too close to United goalkeeper Sergio Romero from point-blank range. Both teams had very little to play for, with United having already made sure of their best Premier League finish in five years following the 0-0 draw with West Ham on Thursday, meaning the second half had a real end of season feel to it. The defeat means Watford dropped a place and finish 14th. Player ratings Manchester United: Romero (6), Bailly (7), Rojo (6), Blind (6), Darmian (6), Carrick (7), Mata (6), Young (6), McTominay (6), Rashford (6), Sanchez (5).

Subs: Mariappa (6), Deeney (6), Chalobah (N/A). Man of the match: Michael Carrick There was no Anthony Martial in the United squad, with the club insisting the France international picked up a late injury, and the much-changed hosts were laboured in his absence in the opening exchanges. It took until the 34th minute for the game's first meaningful chance, which was converted by Rashford, after Mata had laid the ball across. The pass to play into Mata from Carrick gave the Old Trafford masses a reminder of what they will be missing next season. Watford remained undeterred, though, and should have levelled 10 minutes later, but Richarlison could only head Daryl Janmaat's cross too close to Romero, who flung out an arm to make a smart stop. Team news After Mourinho stated that Anthony Martial would be starting in his pre-match press conference, the France international was conspicuous by his absence as he did not even make the squad. Are his days at Old Trafford numbered? Nine changes in all for United, with only Alexis Sanchez and Scott McTominay retaining their places from the draw at West Ham. David de Gea was rested. Heurelho Gomes, Gerard Deulofeu and Richarlison came in for Orestis Karnezis, Etienne Capoue and Troy Deeney for Watford. Nathaniel Chalobah returned to the bench after eight months sidelined by injury. After the break, the tempo faded, as the long season seemed to have taken its toll. Mata did have the ball in the net again, but he was denied by the offside flag. Carrick's final farewell came late in the match, as he was substituted to rapturous applause, and will now undertake a coaching role at the club. Watford did press in the dying moments, but could not find a way past Romero as United saw out the season with another win, finishing with 81 points. Juan Mata is tackled by Abdoulaye Doucoure Opta stats Manchester United have won each of their last seven home league games against Watford, keeping five clean sheets. The Red Devils won all 21 of their Premier League matches this season when they scored first, only the second team to achieve this in a Premier League season (also Portsmouth in 2007-08). Watford are now goalless in each of their eight away Premier League games - their goalless run stretches to 728 minutes on the road. Under Javier Gracia, the Hornets have attempted 61 shots in away Premier League games without scoring. Rashford has been involved in 17 goals in his last 18 starts at Old Trafford in all competitions (9 goals, 8 assists). Michael Carrick made his 481st and final Premier League appearance - this was his first start in the competition for 364 days (May 14th 2017 against Spurs). Sergio Romero has kept six clean sheets in seven Premier League matches for Manchester United. Since the start of last season, Manchester United have kept more Premier League clean sheets than any other team (36). England World Cup watch Marcus Rashford got an early goal on his return to the starting line up, but he was otherwise quiet up front for United. Ashley Young, playing in a more advanced role, failed to deliver any of his trademark pinpoint crosses. Man of the match - Michael Carrick He just had to be involved in the winner, spraying one of his trademark passes over the top of the defence for Mata to set up Rashford. On an afternoon of little other quality, Carrick continually picked out his man as he rolled back the years on his Old Trafford farewell. What's next Watford's season is done and dusted, but United have the small matter of next weekend's FA Cup final against Chelsea to come, as they look to end the season with some silverware."},

3-0 Chelsea Newcastle ended their season on a high and extinguished Chelsea's slim top-four hopes with a comfortable 3-0 win at St James' Park on Sunday. Newcastle bossed the first half, going ahead through Dwight Gayle's close-range header (23), before Ayoze Perez doubled their lead by sweeping home Jonjo Shelvey's initial shot after the break (59). Perez was on hand again to tap home for 3-0 (63), and with Liverpool comfortably beating Brighton 4-0 at Anfield, Chelsea were already out of the hunt for a Champions League spot. N'Golo Kante and Ayoze Perez battle for the ball at St James' Park Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Yedlin (6), Lascelles (7), Lejeune (7), Dummett (6), Diame (8), Shelvey (8), Ritchie (7), Perez (8), Murphy (7), Gayle (7) Subs: Joselu (6), Hayden (6), Haidara (NA) Chelsea: Courtois (5), Azpilicueta (5), Christensen (5), Cahill (5), Emerson (4), Kante (5), Bakayoko (4), Moses (4), Barkley (4), Hazard (5), Giroud (5) Subs: Morata (NA), Willian (NA), Pedro (NA) Man of the match: Jonjo Shelvey The result means Newcastle finish 10th in the Premier League, while Chelsea end up outside of the top four for only the third time in 16 years. Newcastle dominated the first half, with Chelsea failing to register a shot on goal as a top-four spot ran away from them. Thibaut Courtois made two decent saves from Jonjo Shelvey and Mo Diame's long-range efforts, before reacting well to keep out N'Golo Kante's poke towards his own goal from close range. Newcastle went ahead on 23 minutes through Gayle, who headed home after Jacob Murphy's looping effort had been tipped off the line by Courtois only to fall kindly into the striker's path a few yards out. Team news Chelsea made eight changes from the 1-1 draw with Huddersfield. Courtois was back in for Caballero, Cahill, Emerson, Bakayoko, Hazard and Moses also came in, while Giroud replaced Morata and Ross Barkley got a rare start. Just the one change for Newcastle as Jacob Murphy replaced Kenedy. Newcastle United's Dwight Gayle celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game Shelvey blazed over from 12 yards a minute later after dodging two Chelsea tackles, and the visitors' first effort on goal came on 54 minutes as Olivier Giroud's fine improvised touch with the outside of his boot was tipped over by Martin Dubravka. Newcastle doubled their lead through Spaniard Perez, who was on hand 12 yards out to get a touch on Shelvey's low drive from the edge of the box, leaving Courtois with no chance. Ross Barkley saw a clear opportunity from close range well blocked by Dubravka minutes later, before Perez made it 3-0, turning into the net from under the crossbar after the unmarked Florian Lejeune had squared from Shelvey's deep free-kick. That's how it ended in what could be Antonio Conte's last Premier League game at Chelsea, with the FA Cup final against Manchester United to come on Saturday. England World Cup watch Jonjo Shelvey gave yet another reminder of what he can bring to an England midfield, and it looks to be a toss-up between him and Loftus-Cheek for a spot in Southgate’s 23. The same goes for Jamaal Lascelles, who was a rock again in Newcastle's defence, though he remains an outside bet to make the squad on Wednesday. For Chelsea, captain Gary Cahill wasn't the biggest offender from a woeful performance, while Ross Barkley was largely anonymous. Opta stats Newcastle are only the third team to score 2+ goals in five successive Premier League home games against Chelsea after Liverpool (6 between 1992 and 1997) and Leicester (5 between 1998 and 2002). Chelsea failed to find the back of the net for the first time in their last nine top-flight games, since losing 0-1 to Manchester City on March 4th. Rafael Benitez registered his first-ever win in the Premier League against a club he used to manage. Dwight Gayle has scored 29 league goals for Newcastle since the start of last season, 12 more than any other player. The managers: 2:56 Rafa Benitez says it was the best possible way to finish Newcastle's season Rafa Benitez says it was the best possible way to finish Newcastle's season Rafa Benitez: \"When you have the whole season, the fans behind the team, it's the best way to finish. I'm really proud of the atmosphere and the performance of the team. We started with a high tempo, kept the fans behind the team, which was key, as it has been the whole season. That is always an extra motivation.\" Antonio Conte: \"When you are at the end of the season, it can happen, but when there is this situation, the first person to answer for this is the coach. If we didn't have the spirit, this will, this desire, I am the first person to answer for this. The other team was more determined than us.\" 4:26 Antonio Conte admits Newcastle played with more determination Antonio Conte admits Newcastle played with more determination The pundit Jamie Redknapp: They were so poor, that's as abject as a performance as I've ever seen, especially when people re playing for places in an FA Cup final team next week. Bakayoko didn't break sweat, I didn't see him sprint once to the ball, and it was a big opportunity for him today. Ross Barkley at times tried, but it just wasn't his day. Newcastle wanted it more, it's just as simple as that. Man of the match - Jonjo Shelvey Yet again, Shelvey was Newcastle's main man at St James'. He made a team high 74 passes, 45 of which were in the Chelsea half, and patrolled the midfield area with his trademark swagger. But he's more than just a ball-player; Shelvey was not afraid to get stuck in, winning the ball back eight times, second only to Mo Diame. What's next?

took Premier League champions Manchester City to an unprecedented 100 points as Southampton secured safety despite the 1-0 defeat at St Mary's Stadium. City's sensational season appeared to be ending with a stalemate, but Jesus brought down Kevin De Bruyne's pinpoint ball forward before lobbing Alex McCarthy to score their 106th league goal in the fourth minute of added time. The victory sees Pep Guardiola overtake his own record of 99 points with Barcelona (2009-10), while City also break the record for the most away wins (16) and points (50) in the Premier League era, as well as the biggest winning margin (19 points). For good measure, they also achieved the most wins in an English top-flight season (32). Here are the records set by @ManCity this season #PL pic.twitter.com/W5l92rCGQR — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 13, 2018 Meanwhile, Southampton survive by three points, with Swansea taking the finally relegation spot after losing 2-1 at home to Stoke. Manchester City became the first English top-flight side in history to reach 100 points and 32 wins Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (7), Yoshida (7), Stephens (7), Hoedt (7), Soares (5), Hojbjerg (6), Romeu (6), Bertrand (6), Tadic (6), Redmond (6), Austin (5) Subs: Long (6), Ward-Prowse (7), McQueen (6) Man City: Bravo (6), Danilo (6), Laporte (6), Stones (6), Delph (5), Fernandinho (7), Gundogan (6), De Bruyne (6), Silva (5), Sane (7), Sterling (6) Subs: Jesus (7), Diaz (6), Foden (6) Man of the match: Maya Yoshida With Swansea needing an escape act Houdini would have been proud of, Southampton knew it was about containment against City, no mean feat given the champions' haul of 105 league goals going into the match. However, it was the Saints who went closest to breaking the deadlock early on, with Wesley Hoedt's header cannoning off the bar from Dusan Tadic's corner. As news of Stoke taking a first-half 2-1 lead at Swansea filtered through at St Mary's, the home supporters finally broke out into chants of 'We are staying up!' - confident a 10-goal swing was now, finally, an impossibility. Southampton's survival was confirmed as Swansea fell to a 2-1 loss at home to Stoke Team news Southampton made one change, with Maya Yoshida coming in for the injured Jan Bednarek. A quartet of City changes saw John Stones, Fabian Delph, Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling replace Vincent Kompany, Gabriel Jesus, Alexander Zinchenko and Yaya Toure. After no attempts on target from City in the first half, they ramped up the pressure after the break, and went close to scoring just after the hour-mark, but Raheem Sterling saw his shot deflect onto the post before McCarthy tipped over John Stones' header. After Fernandinho cleared Dusan Tadic's effort off the line, and following the introductions of Brahim Diaz and Phil Foden for City - who made their fifth league appearances of the season to earn winners' medals - it was the turn of another substitute, Jesus, to cap off City's remarkable season. Following a campaign of free-flowing football, it was ironic, though somewhat fitting, that De Bruyne grabbed an assist with a long ball forward. Jesus' first touch miraculously brought it down, while his second deftly lifted the ball over McCarthy and into the net. Cue scenes of wild jubilation, from the players, from the fans, and from Guardiola on the sideline. And with Southampton safe, there was cause for celebration from both sides as the full-time whistle sounded. Pep Guardiola reacts to Gabriel Jesus' late winner with Man City's backroom staff England World Cup watch Ryan Bertrand captained Southampton but was largely unimpressive, though another competitor for left-back, Fabian Delph, did little for the visitors. Raheem Sterling endured a frustrating afternoon too, but did go close when hitting the post in the second half. Opta stats Man City trailed for a total of just 153 minutes in Premier League matches this season - the fewest by a side in a single campaign. The Citizens set a new Premier League record for the biggest goal difference in a single season (+79). Before becoming Manchester City manager in 2008, Mark Hughes was unbeaten against them in the Premier League (W4 D4 L0). Since leaving, he's won only two of his 14 league meetings against the Citizens (D3 L9). Kevin De Bruyne provided more assists than any other player in the Premier League this season (16). He also set a record for most wins by a player in a single PL season (31). 2:41 Pep Guardiola says he has no words to describe how it feels, after Manchester City hit the 100-point mark following their 1-0 win against Southampton. Pep Guardiola says he has no words to describe how it feels, after Manchester City hit the 100-point mark following their 1-0 win against Southampton. Man of the match - Maya Yoshida Despite City's record-breaking feats, Southampton deserve praise for not only securing safety, but also keeping the visitors at bay for the majority of the match. City piled on the pressure in the second half, but Yoshida was central to Southampton's resistance, making a match-high nine clearances and four interceptions. Though Jesus stole a winner late on, it was a commendable display from the Saints defence. The managers Mark Hughes: \"It has been a huge effort from everybody. It wasn't an easy situation that I found when I came here - clearly we had difficult fixtures as well, not least this one to finish. \"You always thought, 'Goodness me', we didn't really want it to come to this day and have to win, but I thought we played very well today and arguably had the better of it in the second half. \"But with the quality they have, it only takes one moment. Congratulations to City, they've been absolutely magnificent this season. For them to get all the records they've achieve this year, it's evidence of an outstanding team.\" 1:32 Mark Hughes says Southampton need to swiftly appoint a permanent manager now their Premier League survival is all-but secure.

The Swans came into the final day clash needed a win and a 10-goal swing with Southampton to survive relegation but the great escape never even came close to materialising. Andy King slid Swansea in front (14) but Paul Lambert's side struck back before the break through Badou Ndiaye (31) and Peter Crouch (41).

Subs: Fletcher (7) Man of the match: Badou Ndiaye In Premier League history only two teams have ever survived when entering the final round of fixtures three points from safety but Swansea gave their fans hope with an early goal. Andre Ayew flicked a ball over Ryan Shawcross and King waltzed through before sliding a tidy finish into the bottom corner. Team news Swansea shuffled their pack, making five changes, including bringing back in Angel Rangel for his farewell game. Also, Tom Carroll, Nathan Dyer, Wayne Routledge and Mike van der Roon returned. Stoke made just one change from their defeat against Crystal Palace and with a debut for 18-year-old defender Lasse Sorensen. He replaced Glen Johnson. Half-chances then fell to Wayne Routledge and King - but both were spurned which never gave Swansea the momentum they were looking for. Eventually, it was Stoke that struck on 31 minutes. With the Swansea defence pushing up, Shaqiri lifted the ball through for Ndiaye, who skilfully lofted the ball over Lukasz Fabianski. Swansea's balloon was now very much burst and Crouch headed Stoke in front just before the break. Teenage debutant Lasse Sorensen curled a delicious set-piece into the danger zone and Crouch was on hand to power home his 199th goal of his career. Badou Ndiaye (C) celebrates his goal with team-mates Swansea threw on Leon Brittan for his 461st and final appearance for the club before his retirement - and his influence improved the side. Andre Ayew somehow managed to miss from five yards out when his goalbound effort hit team-mate Tammy Abraham on the goal-line and away to safety. Jack Butland came to Stoke's rescue on a couple of occasions in closing stages, denying Andre Ayew and Sam Clucas as Swansea wastefulness in front of goal haunted them once again. Man of the match: Badou Ndiaye The midfielder has attempted more shots and completed more successful dribbles and tackles than any Stoke team-mate since his Premier League debut in February - and he will have plenty of top-flight suitors over the summer judging by this latest showing. He took his goal - his second of his Stoke career - with real class and a force in midfield throughout. Opta stats Swansea collected 17 points in their first nine matches under Carlos Carvalhal (W5 D2 L2) - in their subsequent nine, they've collected just three (W0 D3 L6). After saving just one of his first 15 penalties in the Premier League, Fabianski has saved three of his last six in the competition. Crouch's header was the 1000th goal in the Premier League this season. Sorensen, who assisted Peter Crouch's goal, became the youngest player to start for Stoke City in the Premier League (18 years, 204 days). This is only the second time in Premier League history that two teams beginning with the letter 'S' have been relegated in the same season - also 1993-94 (Swindon and Sheffield United). Manager reaction: Carlos Carvalhal \"The owners called me yesterday about the possibilities of next season,\" he said. \"We will speak again on Monday - at this moment I will have reflections about myself, the club. After, I will make a decision. As you understand, it's very early to talk about that. \"I will talk with my agent. I was happy with the conversations yesterday. I must think about my life, talk about it with my family and make the best decision. \"This club is very special - they deserve to be in the Premier League as soon as possible.\" Jordan Ayew and Carlos Carvalhal shake hands at the final whistle as Swansea City are relegated Manager reaction: Paul Lambert \"I love the club but what happens next week I don't know,\" Lambert said ahead of expected talks with Stoke owner Peter Coates about his future. \"Football is a great game for one day you're there and the next day you're away. \"But I could not have done any more, I gave it everything, and the support has been right behind us. \"The chairman said a couple of weeks ago that I was [staying] but whether that remains we'll wait and see.\""}, {"date": "13/05/2018", "arena":

Leicester Tottenham 5-4 Leicester Harry Kane's double was not enough to snatch the Golden Boot in an eventful 5-4 win over Leicester at Wembley. Neither side looked like teams with little to play for, with Jamie Vardy nodding in Riyad Mahrez's free-kick inside four minutes. Kane levelled (7) but found themselves 3-1 down thanks to a classy Mahrez finish (16) and Kelechi Iheanacho's superb long-ranger (47), before Erik Lamela's close-range finish (49) and a Christian Fuchs own goal (53) made it 3-3. Just when Spurs looked to have sorted themselves out as Lamela doubled his money (60) to put them in front, Vardy beat the offside trap to level again (73). Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Walker-Peters (7), Dier (5), Alderweireld (6), Rose (6), Wanyama (5), Sissoko (5), Moura (6), Eriksen (7), Lamela (8), Kane (8). Subs: Alli (6), Sanchez (7), Son (na). Leicester: Jakupovic (5), Simpson (5), Maguire (6), Morgan (5), Fuchs (4), Mahrez (8), Iborra (6), Silva (6), Gray (5), Iheanacho (7), Vardy (9). Subs: Diabate (7), Choudhury (5), Barnes (na). Man of the match: Jamie Vardy. But Kane curled in his 30th of the season (76), and Spurs' fifth, to leave them third in the table and Leicester ninth, but with the Golden Boot heading to Liverpool and Mohamed Salah's mantelpiece. Kyle Walker-Peters, a surprise inclusion in the hosts' line-up, was caught out early on when he tripped Demarai Gray out wide. Mahrez's free-kick then found an unmarked Vardy at the near post to nod beyond Hugo Lloris. Tottenham's reaction was immediate and they levelled through Kane, trailing Salah in the Golden Boot race by three before the match, when he paced away from Danny Simpson and beat Eldin Jakupovic at his near post. Team news Tottenham made six changes, with Kyle Walker-Peters among those entering the fray and Jan Vertonghen, injured in the warm-up, replaced by Victor Wanyama. Claude Puel named only two changes from the Leicester side that beat Arsenal, bringing in Vicente Iborra and Demarai Gray. But their defensive frailties were underlined by a sucker-punch second from the visitors, with Mahrez hammering into the bottom corner once Vardy was tackled. Any hopes of a Tottenham revival after half-time were hit when Iheanacho held off Victor Wanyama before his effort rocketed into the top corner from 20 yards. But they hit back within 60 seconds when Lamela turned in Walker-Peters' low cross, and were level when his shot struck Fuchs' outstretched knee and went in. England watch Vardy and Kane both ended the season with doubles, but Kane was understandably greedy given the personal accolades up for grabs. Maguire had a good game at the heart of the Leicester defence, despite the scoreline, making five interceptions and as many clearances. His opposite number Dier struggled against the quality of Mahrez and Vardy, but was left exposed by his team-mates – especially Rose, who was impressive going forward but all-too often missing when Leicester broke. They took the lead for the first time as Lamela completed a first double in English football, Walker-Peters again feeding his Argentine team-mate, but Leicester soon equalised when Vardy raced away from the home defence and fired high into the top of the net. Three minutes later, Spurs retook the lead for what would be the final time, Kane cutting inside and bending the ball around Jakupovic for his second of the day, and once he missed Danny Rose's cross from the left altogether late on he knew his Golden Boot chances were up. Opta stats Tottenham's 5-4 victory over Leicester equals the most goals scored in a competitive club match at Wembley Stadium (Chelsea 5-4 Man City in the 1986 Full Members Cup Final). This is the eighth occasion Tottenham have come from two goals down to win a Premier League game and the first since March 2014 against Southampton (3-2). In contrast, the Foxes have lost after leading by two goals in the top-flight for the first time since October 2003 (3-4 v Wolves). Harry Kane has scored more goals in all competitions versus Leicester City than against any other side in his career (13). Harry Kane is the first Spurs player to score 40+ goals in a season in all competitions since Clive Allen in 1986-87 (49). Kane has reached 30 Premier League goals for the first time in his career - the first Englishman to do so since Kevin Phillips in 1999-2000 (also, 30). Riyad Mahrez has assisted seven of Jamie Vardy's Premier League goals this season - no player has assisted another on more occasion during this campaign. Since his Premier League debut in August 2014, Jamie Vardy has scored 26 goals against the big six sides - six more than any other player during this period (Sergio Aguero, 20). Vardy has been on the losing side in nine Premier League games this season when he has scored, extending the record in a single campaign in the competition. Man of the match - Jamie Vardy Vardy deserved his 21st and 22nd league goals of the season in a typically-energetic performance, scoring two well-taken goals and had more shots than anyone else in the game. He also made two key passes, ran for everything on offer from any ball forward from a Leicester man, and didn't deserve to be on the losing side."}, {"date": "13/05/2018", "arena": "London Stadium",

Everton 3-1 at the London Stadium to seal a first home league win over their opponents since April 2007. Sam Allardyce endured an unhappy afternoon against his former employees as Lanzini gave the hosts a deserved lead (39) before Marko Arnautovic's swerving shot doubled the hosts' advantage (63). Oumar Niasse pulled a goal back with a close-range finish (74), but Lanzini capped a scintillating display with a brilliant strike past Jordan Pickford via the post (82). The Hammers finish in 13th place while the Toffees remained in eighth spot on the final day of the Premier League season. Manuel Lanzini celebrates his opening strike as West Ham defeated Everton Player ratings West Ham: Adrian (7), Cresswell (7), Masuaku (5), Zabaleta (8), Ogbonna (6), Rice (7), Noble (7), Kouyate (7), Mario (7), Lanzini (9), Arnautovic (8).

Subs: Klaassen (5), Walcot (6), Bolasie (n/a) Man of the match: Manuel Lanzini Attention will now turn to the respective futures of David Moyes and Allardyce, who praised Lanzini after a standout performance, but his side were second best during a tired display in the capital. Mark Noble was denied early on as Pickford produced a brilliant save low to his left after, before Niasse pounced on a mistake by Angelo Ogbonna to force Adrian into a smart stop with his legs. Niasse's miss proved costly as seven minutes later, West Ham were in front. There was an element of good fortune about the goal as Cheikhou Kouyate's intended pass for Arnautovic ran through for Lanzini to stroke his shot low to the right of Pickford's dive. Joao Mario on the ball as the Hammers ended their season in style Team news West Ham were unchanged from the side which drew 0-0 with Manchester United. Everton made two alterations to the team which drew 1-1 with Southampton as Oumar Niasse and Ramiro Funes Mori replaced Nikola Vlasic and Yannick Bolasie. Everton began the game by playing three at the back, and duly changed to a more familiar formation at the interval with Ramiro Funes Mori withdrawn, but they only marginally improved before West Ham extended their lead. Edimilson Fernandes, an early substitute for the injured Arthur Masuaku, fed Arnautovic and the former Stoke City forward rolled Michael Keane before unleashing a venomous shot from 25 yards that moved in the air on its way past Pickford. Everton responded as Adrian tipped a powerful shot from Niasse onto a post, and from the resulting corner the Senegalese forward was rewarded for his endeavour, taking down Morgan Schneiderlin's header to fire in from five yards out. But any hopes they had of salvaging something were ended in fine style by Lanzini as he picked up Pablo Zabaleta's pass, cut inside Seamus Coleman on the left and bent a superb right-foot shot that curled beyond the outstretched Pickford and in off the post. Oumar Niasse fires Everton back in contention but they were well beaten in the end England watch Aaron Cresswell: There remains an outside chance that Aaron Cresswell could be named at least as one of Gareth Southgate's standy options given his versatility and concerns over Danny Rose's fitness, and he produced another assured display. He wouldn't let anyone down if he made the plane, but there appears stronger options when everyone is fit. Jordan Pickford: One of Everton's better performers again, Pickford could do very little about West Ham's first and third goals but he may feel slightly at fault for Arnautovic's goal, with the dipping shot flying past him. He made a brilliant stop from Noble with the scores level, and he looks set for the No 1 jersey. Michael Keane: Any faint hopes the former Burnley defender may have had of making a late dash for Russia were surely ended here after he was tormented all afternoon, in particular by Arnautovic. Man of the match - Manuel Lanzini The Argentine was at it from the first whistle as he combined brilliantly with Arnautovic to stretch Everton on a day they were punished for experimenting with three at the back. Two defenders were dragged towards Arnautovic as Lanzini fired in the opener, and the diminutive midfielder ended the contest in typical fashion, finding the top corner with a brilliant strike. The 25-year-old has endured an injury-ravaged season, but this was a timely reminder of the difference he makes to this West Ham team when he's on song. Lanzini has been directly involved in 11 Premier League goals this season (five goals, six assists), his best ever figures in an English top-flight campaign.

The visitors had the better of the chances but only came close to beating Adrian in the West Ham goal when he deflected Luke Shaw's drive onto the post before half-time. United's toothless makeshift attack found life difficult against a generally organised West Ham back three, as they failed to score in back-to-back games for the first time since March 2016.

Player ratings West Ham: Adrian (7), Zabaleta (6), Rice (7), Ogbonna (7), Cresswell (7), Kouyate (7), Noble (7), Joao Mario (6), Masuaku (6), Lanzini (6), Arnautovic (7). Subs: Carroll (6) Man Utd: De Gea (7), Valencia (7), Lindelof (5), Jones (7), Smalling (5), Shaw (7), Herrera (7), McTominay (6), Pogba (6), Lingard (7), Sanchez (6). Subs: Rashford (5), Young (na), Bailly (na) Man of the match: Mark Noble West Ham had the better of the opening exchanges but once United found their feet they dominated the chances, with Scott McTominay firing just wide and Jesse Lingard forcing Adrian into a smart save. Adrian then turned a powerful drive from Luke Shaw - who has never scored a senior goal - onto the post. Paul Pogba Marko Arnautovic was again West Ham's best outlet, using his power and pace to test David de Gea from 20 yards early on, before Aaron Cresswell's deflected cross caught him off guard and he tipped over the bar. As the interval approached Adrian again beat away an ambitious long-range effort from Lingard, and soon after the break it appeared United had forged an opening - but when Pogba's flick set Sanchez beyond the goalkeeper, he could not force the ball home from a tight angle. Team news West Ham kept the same team that beat Leicester on Saturday, in the 3-4-3 David Moyes has preferred in recent weeks. There were eight changes made by Manchester United, with only David De Gea, Chris Smalling and Paul Pogba retaining their places from Friday's loss at Brighton. Pogba then nodded wide and Arnautovic miscued a tricky dipping ball over his shoulder wide from inside the box in a rare home attack. Late on Noble was left incensed by an intentional trip by Pogba and pushed the United midfielder in the face, which earned only a caution for both players from referee Moss. United earned the point to leave them second but produced another drab performance - while West Ham could still finish as high as 10th, if an unusual set of results go in their favour on the final day of the season on Sunday. Opta stats Manchester United have guaranteed second place in the Premier League, their highest position since winning the league in 2012-13. The Red Devils have kept more clean sheets than any other Premier League side this season (18). West Ham kept only their third home Premier League clean sheet against Man Utd in 22 matches against them (also August 1998 and December 2006). Jose Mourinho has managed more matches against David Moyes without losing (13 - W8 D5) than against any other manager in his managerial career. Manchester United have won just five of their last 18 away Premier League matches in London (D4 L9). Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of the 2012-13 season, no Premier League team has drawn more matches nil-nil than Manchester United (19, level with Southampton). England watch Chris Smalling struggled to deal with West Ham's Marko Arnautovic all night. Phil Jones was less tested, but could easily have given away a penalty had Arnautovic gone down under his lunge late on. Man of the match - Mark Noble He was lucky to remain on the pitch for the full 90 minutes, but captain Noble was strong at the heart of the West Ham midfield which stifled United, winning back possession seven times and making five interceptions - more than anyone else on the pitch. Mark Noble put in a good shift for the Hammers Noble made 68 passes on the night, connecting with almost 90 per cent of them, and made two key passes as part of his contribution. What's next? United host Watford on Sunday in their season-ending game at Old Trafford on Sunday, while West Ham will welcome David Moyes' old club Everton to the London Stadium."}, {"date": "09/05/2018", "arena":

Huddersfield secured their Premier League status for next season and severely dented Chelsea’s top-four hopes by battling to a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. This latest performance of grit and outstanding defensive organisation, plus a famous goal by Laurent Depoitre (50), all-but relegates Swansea City, who need a 10-goal swing on the final day to turn the tables on Southampton. For Chelsea, Marcos Alonso's equaliser (60) wasn't enough to deny the tenacious Terriers, who survived a late onslaught from the Blues, with goalkeeper Jonas Lossl in fine form - including an incredible one-handed save to deny Andreas Christensen. The result leaves Antonio Conte's men needing Brighton to beat Liverpool at Anfield on the final day for any hope of finishing in the top four. But this night was all about Huddersfield and the masterful David Wagner, who has kept his side up against the odds and only spent a remarkable eight days in the relegation zone all season despite their minuscule budget. Player Ratings Chelsea: Caballero (4), Azpilicueta (7), Christensen (6), Rudiger (6), Fabregas (6), Kante (6), Zappacosta (6), Alonso (6), Willian (6), Pedro (6), Morata (5). Subs: Hazard (6), Giroud (6) Huddersfield: Lossl (8), Smith (7), Kongolo (8), Zanka (8), Schindler (8), Lowe (7), Hogg (8), Mooy (8), Billing (7), Van La Parra (7), Depoitre (8). Subs: Pritchard (7), Hadergjonaj (7), Malone (7). Man of the match: Jonas Lossl Fresh from their defensive masterclass against champions Manchester City, Huddersfield started where they left off at the Etihad Stadium. Chelsea bossed the ball but created little in open play. Set-pieces seemed their best route and Anthony Rudiger somehow turned a Cesar Azpilicueta flick-on wide from two yards out on 13 minutes. Team news Antonio Conte decided to rest Eden Hazard in one of six changes from the win over Liverpool as Willian, Pedro, Andreas Christensen, Davide Zappacosta, Willy Caballero and Alvaro Morata were handed starts. There were three changes made by David Wagner with Phillip Billing, Rajiv Van La Parra and Laurent Depoitre replacing Alex Pritchard, Steven Mounie and Florent Hadergjonaj. With Jonathan Hogg and Aaron Mooy spearheading Huddersfield's bite and organisation in midfield, the hosts were becoming frustrated. Alvaro Morata skipped through on goal 40 minutes but failed to find a decisive finish after rounding Lossl. Willian and Jonathan Hogg in action at Stamford Bridge After the break, Huddersfield sensationally took the lead with their first opening of the game. Cries for a foul on Willian were ignored by referee Lee Mason and Mooy charged forward. His ball was bravely attacked by Depoitre, who bounced off Willy Caballero and gleefully tucked the ball into the empty net. Conte called for reinforcements from the bench as Eden Hazard and Olivier Giroud entered the fray. The pressure told on 62 minutes when Azpilicueta's cross was smacked clear by Zanka, but only straight into the face of Alonso, who knew nothing about it but had equalised for his team. Huddersfield’s draw against Chelsea means that this is the 3rd season in PL history in which all 3 promoted teams have avoided relegation, after 2001-02 (Blackburn, Fulham, Bolton) & 2011-12 (Swansea, Norwich, QPR) #PL pic.twitter.com/iqXRDcK4QF — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 9, 2018 From then on Chelsea set up camp in Huddersfield territory. Azpilicueta and Willian were providing great service on the right but both Morata and Giroud couldn't force a winner home. When the hosts did find a route to goal, Lossl was there to deny them - and in spectacular fashion on 83 minutes. After an almighty scramble a half-clearance fell to Christensen but his header was somehow tipped onto the post by Lossl. Huddersfield needed their goalkeeper again in the final stages as he beat away a powerful attempt from Morata while Giroud also hooked a close-range effort wide. Huddersfield negotiated the six minutes of added time. Cue wild celebrations, led by their quite marvellous manager. The managers Antonio Conte: \"We must be focused to finish this season. We have another game and an FA Cup final - then the club will do their best to improve their situation. 3:42 Antonio Conte says it is not the first time this season that Chelsea have not been clinical enough following their 1-1 draw with Huddersfield Antonio Conte says it is not the first time this season that Chelsea have not been clinical enough following their 1-1 draw with Huddersfield \"I think for this season, for sure, it is my last home game. Not only me, but the players too. I don't have anything to add. It is not my task, there is a club to judge the situation and then take the best decision.\" David Wagner: \"It's a bigger achievement than the promotion - last season we were predicted to get relegated and we won promotion. \"Tonight, I think we have seen everything that counts for us and this is desire, passion, effort, attitude and togetherness and I am a strong believer that if you have the passion and desire and the spirit, you can compete sometimes with top quality.\" 4:32 David Wagner says his team have shown the desire, passion and togetherness to compete against top quality sides David Wagner says his team have shown the desire, passion and togetherness to compete against top quality sides Man of the match: Jonas Lossl If ever you needed an example of how important having a top-class operator between the sticks is, then this was it. Lossl's save from Christensen was quite simply, extraordinary. With the ball heading into the top corner, the goalkeeper flung every inch of his being towards the ball and somehow got a strong enough touch on it to divert it onto the post. He's conceded just one goal in 180 minutes of football against Manchester City and Chelsea in the last week - and an unfortunate one at that. Sublime stuff. Opta stats This is the third season in a row that the reigning Premier League champions have failed to secure a top-four finish (Chelsea 10th in 2015-16, Leicester 12th in 2016-17 and Chelsea 5th this term). The Blues mustered 22 shots in this match, though most of these came from central defender Rudiger (5). Depoitre is only the second player to score home and away against Chelsea in the Premier League this season, after Watford's Robert Pereyra. What's next? Chelsea face a final day trip to Newcastle ahead of their FA Cup final date with Manchester United on May 19, while Huddersfield host Arsenal in what will be Arsene Wenger's final game in charge of the Gunners.

Leicester City beat 10-man Arsenal 3-1 at the King Power as Arsene Wenger's side remained the only team without an away point in English league football in 2018. Leicester opened the scoring after just 14 minutes thanks to Kelechi Iheanacho's second league goal of the season, before the striker was then brought down by Konstantinos Mavropanos when clean through on goal. The young Greek defender was shown a straight red card by referee Graham Scott, Arsenal's 78th sending-off in the Premier League under Wenger, only for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to level matters eight minutes after half-time. Leicester: Jakupovic (6), Simpson (6), Morgan (6), Maguire (7), Fuchs (6), Diabate (9), Silva (7), Choudhury (8), Mahrez (7), Iheanacho (9), Vardy (8) Subs: Gray (7), Dragovic (6), Barnes (6) Arsenal: Cech (8), Maitland-Niles (8), Mavropanos (6), Holding (6), Kolasinac (7), Ramsey (7), Iwobi (7), Xhaka (6), Mkhitaryan (7), Welbeck (6), Aubameyang (7) Subs: Mustafi (6), Nketiah (6) Man of the match: Kelechi Iheanacho However, the home team took all three points thanks to Jamie Vardy's 76th-minute penalty - the striker's sixth goal in seven games against the Gunners - and Riyad Mahrez's last-minute effort. As a result, the Foxes stay ninth in the table thanks to a first top-flight win in six matches, while Arsenal remain sixth after a seventh straight league defeat on their travels for the first time since January 1966. Arsenal started the match on the front foot, only to fall behind just before the quarter-hour mark after the visitors failed to clear a left-wing corner. Jamie Vardy scores from the penalty spot The Foxes recycled the ball, before finding Fousseni Diabate at the far post and the midfielder then picked out Iheanacho, who drove the ball past Petr Cech from close range. Iheanacho was also the player involved in Mavropanos's dismissal as right from the re-start, the striker closed the centre back down, before stealing possession and being hauled to the ground as he broke clear. The referee had little choice but to send off the 20-year-old, with there being just 92 seconds between Iheanacho's opener and the red card. Team news Leicester made three changes from the side that lost 2-0 at home to West Ham on Saturday, with Eldin Jakupovic - for his full league debut - Danny Simpson and Kelechi Iheanacho recalled. Arsenal made four changes from the team that thrashed Burnley 5-0 at home on Sunday, with Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Rob Holding, Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck starting.However, the visitors were still missing Mesut Ozil (back), Laurent Koscielny (Achilles) and Jack Wilshere (personal reasons). The visitors, though, drew level when Aubameyang scored his ninth league goal since joining the club in January after good approach play by down the right by Ainsley Maitland-Niles. But it was Claude Puel's team who emerged victorious after two goals in the final quarter of an hour, the first coming from the penalty spot after Henrikh Mkhitaryan tripped substitute Demarai Gray in the box. Vardy kept his cool to rifle the ball home from the spot, the England international's 18th league goal of the season, before Mahrez sealed the points late on after dummying Cech and scoring into an empty net as the Foxes beat Arsenal for the first time in the league since 1994.

As for the visitors, Danny Welbeck endured a quiet night at the King Power as the forward tries to win a place on the plane to Russia this summer.

They gave their best and it was important to finish (at home) with a strong game. \"They played with strong conviction and quality.

However, the Nigeria international was given an opportunity against Arsenal, and he did not disappoint with an impressive attacking display. The 21-year-old opened the scoring with an excellent first-half finish, before being involved in the pivotal moment when Mavropanos was dismissed for bringing the frontman down seconds later. And maybe now the player will be given more regular game time going forward at the King Power.

Brighton Highlights: Manchester City 3-1 Brighton Manchester City bade an emotional farewell to Yaya Toure with a record-breaking 3-1 victory over Brighton at the Etihad Stadium. Danilo fired the champions ahead 16 minutes into the Ivorian's final home game as a City player, but the lead lasted just four minutes as Leonardo Ulloa equalised after Claudio Bravo vacated his goal. Bernardo Silva restored City's lead on 34 minutes with their 104th goal of the season - eclipsing Chelsea's record tally of 103 in 2009/10 - before Fernandinho wrapped up the points with a third on 72 minutes. The victory sees City become the first English side to win 31 games in a 38-game top-flight season and moves them onto a record 97 points with one game remaining. Player ratings Man City: Bravo (4), Danilo (7), Kompany (6), Laporte (6), Zinchenko (6), Fernandinho (7), Toure (6), Gundogan (6), Bernardo (7), Sane (8), Jesus (6).

Subs: March (5), Kayal (5), Locadia (5). Man of the Match: Leroy Sane. Ilkay Gundogan had the first opportunity, having a shot blocked by Shane Duffy before Anthony Knockaert fired a shot wide in response for Brighton. But City claimed a deserved lead when Sane drove forward and released right-back Danilo with an inch-perfect pass. The Brazilian raced through and coolly converted past Mat Ryan. Bernardo Silva celebrates after restoring Manchester City's lead Brighton responded immediately as they pounced on an error by Bravo. The Chilean raced off his line to pressure Davy Propper, who shifted the ball away from the wandering City 'keeper and crossed for Ulloa to head the equaliser. City reclaimed the lead by scoring their record-breaking 104th goal of the season, Sane cutting the ball back for Silva who took a touch before rifling a low shot home at the near post. Team news Yaya Toure was handed the captain’s armband for his final home game at Manchester City. Fernandinho, Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus were the only players to retain their places from the draw with Huddersfield as Pep Guardiola made eight changes. Leonardo Ulloa got a rare start in place of Glenn Murray as Brighton made one change from their victory over Manchester United. Bravo had another moment to forget early in the second half when he spilled a Jose Izquierdo shot. The ball rebounded awkwardly off Danilo but Knockaert let him off the hook by firing over from close range. The game had a testimonial feel for most of the second half but City claimed a third goal 18 minutes from time when Gundogan took a short corner and Sane pulled back for Fernandinho to fire past Ryan. Fernandinho celebrates scoring Manchester City's third goal Toure was denied a farewell goal with his last involvement as Ryan saved his shot from a Sane pull back, before Danilo struck the bar with a late free-kick. Opta stats Man City now hold the outright record for most goals in a single Premier League campaign (105) - overtaking Chelsea's total of 103 goals in the 2009-10 season. Pep Guardiola's side have won 31 Premier League games this season - the most in single campaign in the competition. In fact, they've equalled the all-time English top-flight record for most wins in a single campaign (31, Tottenham in 1960-61). Manchester City have won 97 points in 2017-18, the most by a Premier League team in a single season. Furthermore, City's 97 points is only bettered in the English top-flight by Liverpool's haul of 98 in 1978-79 (adjusting 3 pts for a win). England World Cup watch Raheem Sterling, Kyle Walker and John Stones had a watching brief from the stands after they were all given the night off by City manager Pep Guardiola. Man City have conceded in seven of their last eight Premier League home games against newly-promoted sides - only keeping a clean sheet against Huddersfield at the weekend. Leonardo Ulloa scored his first league goal for Brighton in 1467 days, last netting for the Seagulls against Nottingham Forest in May 2014. Leroy Sane has been directly involved in more league goals this season than any other German player in Europe's big five divisions (10 goals, 15 assists). The managers Pep Guardiola: \"We cannot deny, we are so proud [of the records]. I am not saying we are the best [PL side] but we did the best season ever. Nobody scored more goals, more points. Now it's 97 so if someone wants to beat that record they have to be good and win a lot of games.

News of Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Huddersfield at Stamford Bridge was met by a deafening cheer at Wembley, and the hosts held on for a narrow victory to guarantee Champions League football next season at their new home. In a nervy encounter full of chances for both sides, Kane put Spurs ahead five minutes after the break with a fine curling effort into the top corner, taking his Premier League tally to 28.

Things didn't go for Spurs in a nervy first half; Christian Eriksen forced a fine save from Martin Dubravka from a free-kick, while Jonjo Shelvey hit the outside of the post from his own set piece, before Jamaal Lascelles' header was brilliantly saved by Hugo Lloris. Dwight Gayle spurned a fine chance from close range, heading over as he got in-between the Spurs centre backs, and at the other end Kane produced an air shot from 15 yards after racing through one-on-one with Dubravka. Team news Tottenham made three changes and switched back to a back four following the 1-0 defeat at WBA; Davies replaced Rose, Sissoko camein for Alderweireld and Son was in for Lamela. Newcastle made two changes after the 2-1 loss at Watford, with Ritchie replacing Murphy and Yedlin back in for Manquillo. Harry Kane took his Premier League tally to 28 Kane made amends on 50 minutes, stroking his effort into the top right corner from just inside the box after a neat exchange with Heung-min Son. Ayoze Perez's produced an air shot of his own shortly after with the goal gaping, and Kenedy struck wide from range, before sub Jacob Murphy blazed over a fine opportunity from close range having wrestled free of Davinson Sanchez. Rafa Benitez claimed Newcastle should have had two penalties in the game; Matt Ritchie appeared to be brought down by Hugo Lloris as the goalkeeper rushed out, while Ayoze Perez also saw half-hearted appeals waved away by Neil Swarbrick. After the Chelsea result filtered through, sub Danny Rose should have wrapped up the win in stoppage time, but he hit straight at Dubravka with his weaker right foot after being played through on goal by Erik Lamela before huge relief at the final whistle. Newcastle have now lost four league games on the spin Opta stats Spurs have won their last 18 home Premier League games against promoted sides since a 2-1 defeat to Norwich City in April 2012. Newcastle United have now lost four consecutive Premier League games on three different occasions this season. Since losing their opening Premier League home game at Wembley this season, Spurs have lost just one the last 17 (W12 D4). This was Spurs' first league double over Newcastle since 2004/05. After failing to score in his first four Premier League games at Wembley, Harry Kane has since netted 13 in his last 14 appearances. England World Cup watch There was plenty for Gareth Southgate to feast his eyes upon at Wembley. For Spurs, Harry Kane gained a much-needed confidence boost with his fine winner, but Dele Alli struggled to impact the game again. Kieran Trippier went off with a worrying-looking knee injury, and Danny Rose missed a fine chance to double Spurs' lead in injury time. For Newcastle Jamaal Lascelles was impressive again, and Jonjo Shelvey produced some trademark long-range passes, but both are a long shot for Southgate's squad. The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"This type of game is impossible to have a pretty performance. We played with the pressure to win the game, a must-win game. Against a team who played for nothing, played so deep and played counter attack, and didn't take risks. For us sometimes we take some rash decisions, and it was difficult to have patience, to play and build with good actions.\" Rafa Benitez: \"I think we had 14 attempts against Tottenham at home, and two penalties not given, so I think we deserve something here. Today we are doing almost everything well, against a good team, but two decisions, when you see the replays, it's a pity.\" Man of the match - Hugo Lloris Not a stellar display by any Spurs men, but Lloris made some telling contributions in both halves. His fine stop in the first from Lascelles header, when Newcastle were firmly on top, was world class, and he stood up to the challenge in the second half as Newcastle began to go direct. What's next?

Relegation permutations Huddersfield need just a point against Chelsea or Arsenal in their last two games to confirm safety, while Swansea need to beat Stoke in their final game and hope Huddersfield lose their last two games, OR Swansea need to beat Stoke and hope Southampton lose heavily against Man City with a 10-goal swing to go with it. Gabbiadini's substitution was a result of luck and a brave move by Mark Hughes, with the Italian striker replacing defender Jan Bednarek, who had concussion but did not want to be taken off. Shane Long missed a chance to wrap it up late on, hitting into the side-netting when the square pass to the unmarked Gabbiadini seemed the better option, but after a nervy finish, Mark Hughes' side held on. Team news Carlos Carvalhal made three changes for the Swans, bringing in Naughton, King and Clucas from the side that lost 1-0 to Bournemouth at the weekend. Van der Hoorn, Carroll and Dyer all dropped down to the bench. Southampton made two changes from the side that drew 1-1 at Everton last time out. Stephens came in for the suspended Yoshida, while Redmond was also recalled in place of Lemina, who dropped out of the squad. Man of the match - Alex McCarthy After largely spectating in the first half, McCarthy was called into action early in the second, producing a world-class save from Jordan Ayew's dipping volley. The 28-year-old, who replaced Fraser Forster as Saints' first-choice goalkeeper earlier this season, also commanded his area superbly, particularly late on as Swans peppered the box. The managers Carlos Carvalhal: \"At the end of the game we had the feeling that we deserved a little more, a minimum of one point. But we played to win. Now we are in the position where we rely on others but we are not relegated yet. Mark Hughes: \"I have to say, to a man, they've worked their socks off, every single day, every single game. Some games we've had things go against us and have had to pick ourselves up, but I thought we were immense today, we weren't going to be denied.\" Oriol Romeu takes on Clucas in the first half Opta stats Swansea have failed to score in eight different Premier League home games this season, more than any other side. Seven of Southampton's last 11 away Premier League victories have been against sides starting the day in the relegation zone. Only Stoke (13) are on a longer winless run in the Premier League than Swansea (8 - D3 L5). Swansea have failed to score in eight of their 12 Premier League clashes with Southampton, scoring just five goals in total in those matches. Manolo Gabbiadini has netted two goals in his last four away league games for Southampton after failing to find the back of the net in the previous 12. What's next? Swansea host Stoke on Sunday in their final Premier League game, while Southampton welcome champions Manchester City to St Mary's."}, {"date": "06/05/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance":

Huddersfield defence held firm at the Etihad Huddersfield Town boosted their Premier League survival hopes with a gutsy goalless draw against champions Manchester City on Sunday. City were looking to set a host of domestic records before capping their sensational season by lifting the Premier League trophy. But with City's eyes perhaps on post-match celebrations, a dogged and resilient Huddersfield outfit seized the opportunity to secure an unlikely point in their battle against the drop. The Terriers remain 16th in the Premier League, three points clear of the relegation with two games to play, as David Wagner's men inched closer to another season in the top flight. Manchester City lift the Premier League trophy Player ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (6), Stones (6), Otamendi (6), Delph (6), Fernandinho (6), De Bruyne (7), Sane (7), Silva (6), Sterling (7), Jesus (6). Subs: Gundogan (6), Bernardo (6), Mendy (6). Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Smith (6), Kongolo (7), Zanka (7), Schindler (7), Hadergjonaj (7), Lowe (7), Hogg (7), Mooy (8), Pritchard (8), Mounie (6). Subs: Malone (6), Van La Parra (6), Depoitre (6). Man of the Match: Aaron Mooy. There was a carnival feel around the stadium ahead of kick-off, which culminated in City receiving a guard of honour from Huddersfield and members of City's title-winning squad from 1968. But with just three games to secure their Premier League status, Huddersfield were intent on spoiling City's party, creating two clear openings inside 11 minutes. Former City midfielder Aaron Mooy, making his first appearance at the Etihad, fizzed an effort just wide on 10 minutes before Alex Pritchard's clever free-kick released Florent Hadergjonaj, only for the defender to shoot straight at Ederson. Leroy Sane and Mathias Jorgensen in action during the at the Etihad Stadium on May 6, 2018 Huddersfield were almost made to pay for those misses three minutes later as City captain David Silva combined with Leroy Sane and found Kevin De Bruyne on edge of the area, but the Belgian whistled a shot wide of goal. And it was not long until the Terriers were back on the attack, Pritchard's 25-yard drive drawing a save from Ederson before Mooy released the returning Chris Lowe on the overlap, and he blazed wide at the near post. It was all hands to the pump for Huddersfield from there on. After Jonas Lossl had seen them into the interval on level terms by thwarted a rasping De Bruyne drive on 35 minutes, the visitors had to withstand wave after wave of City pressure. Team news John Stones made his first Premier League start since late January, replacing Aymeric Laporte, while David Silva returned to captain City in place of Ilkay Gundogan in the one other change from the side that beat West Ham. David Wagner made two changes following Huddersfield’s defeat to Everton. Chris Lowe returned for his first Premier League appearance since January, while Tommy Smith was also recalled. Christopher Schindler hooked the ball off the line the after Lossl spilled a Sane delivery, but having come up with the right answer time and time again this season, City could not find a way to unpick the Huddersfield lock. Gabriel Jesus drifted a header onto the roof of the net with 10 minutes remaining, before substitutes Bernardo Silva and Benjamin Mendy went close with efforts, but focus soon turned to the trophy celebrations on a sun-drenched afternoon. England watch John Stones Stones made his first Premier League start since late Janaury and if the young defender thought he was in for a relaxing Sunday stroll, Huddersfield's high press would've come as a shock. But Stones was calm under pressure and good in possession before City withdrew him in search of a winner. Guardiola admitted afterwards that the centre-back was substituted due to fatigue rather than any injury recurrence. Kyle Walker The marauding full-back tried his best to inject some urgency into a game that lacked intensity, and his delivery from the right caused problems to the Huddersfield defence especially in the first half. Gareth Southgate will just hope the defender avoids injury in the final two games of the season having recently recovered from a knock. Raheem Sterling Sterling entered the game fresh from his manager defending recent claims of him going over inside the box too easily, and the forward very nearly won his side a spot-kick in the opening period after a challenge from Terence Kongolo. The in-form winger was close to another far-post tap-in in the first half - denied by a deflection off Mathias Jorgensen - and he worked tirelessly in search of an opener which never came. Opta stats Manchester City are without a home league win against Huddersfield since November 1987 (D2 L2 since), though this was the first such meeting since 1999. Man City have only failed to score in two previous home Premier League games under Guardiola - vs Stoke in March 2017 and vs Man Utd in April 2017. This was only Pep's 25th 0-0 draw as a manager of Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, in what was his 519th game. Huddersfield are the first side since Chelsea in April 2014 to stop the team at the top of the table from scoring at home in the Premier League (Liverpool 0-2 Chelsea). The Terriers are also the first promoted side to stop Manchester City scoring at the Etihad since Reading won 2-0 in February 2007. Huddersfield have failed to score in 20 of their 36 Premier League games this season. Only two sides have ever failed to score in more - Derby County (22 in 2007-08) and Leeds United (21 in 1996-97). The managers Pep Guardiola: \"The Premier League is special, England is so tough. We did it. You win, you lose, but you always have to try to do what you believe.\" 3:34 Pep Guardiola spoke to David Jones, Thierry Henry, Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp following Manchester City lifting the Premier League title.

Man of the Match - Aaron Mooy The Australian had a point to prove on his return to Manchester City, and so nearly fired Huddersfield to an unlikely victory. His industrious performance saw him set up two chances in the first half, which should have yielded at least one goal, before running himself into the ground as the Terriers secured an unlikely point.

0 Burnley FT Arsenal 5 - 0 Burnley Arsenal secured sixth place in the Premier League on Arsene Wenger's final home game as manager as they saw off Burnley 5-0 on Sunday. On an emotional day at the Emirates, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened the scoring from close range (14), and his strike partner Alexandre Lacazette doubled Arsenal's lead (45+3) after good work from Hector Bellerin. A full house at the Emirates, all donning red 'Merci Arsene' t-shirts, saw Sead Kolasinac make it 3-0 on 54 minutes, driving superbly into the far corner following a burst from midfield by Jack Wilshere. Arsene Wenger is given a guard of honour by both sets of players after the game Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (7), Bellerin (8), Chambers (7), Mavropanos (7), Kolasinac (7), Xhaka (7), Wilshere (7), Mkhitaryan (6), Iwobi (7), Aubameyang (9), Lacazette (8) Subs: Ramsey (6), Welbeck (6), Mertesacker (6) Burnley: Pope (4), Lowton (4), Long (4), Tarkowski (3), Ward (4), Lennon (5), Cork (5), Westwood (5), Gudmundsson (5), Hendrick (5), Barnes (NA) Subs: Vokes (5), Nkoudou (5) Man of the match: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Alex Iwobi made it four with a thumping effort in space from 12 yards out (64), and Aubameyang got his second with 15 minutes remaining, poking home from close range. The result means Arsenal will enter the Europa League at the group stage next season, while Burnley will finish seventh. After Wenger was given a guard of honour by both sets of players before the game, Arsenal took the lead on 14 minutes through Aubameyang's seventh in 11 games, tapping in from close range after Lacazette's cross-shot. Lacazette made it 2-0 in first-half stoppage time, converting from eight yards with his outstretched left leg from Bellerin's cross, with Arsenal in complete control for the first 45 minutes. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette had Arsenal 2-0 up at half time Burnley's first chances came after the break; Sam Vokes could only head at Petr Cech from close range, and Aaron Lennon forced Cech into an awkward save at his near post, but Arsenal got going again shortly after. After Wilshere broke out of midfield with a quick turn of pace, Kolasinac finished off from the left of the box with a thumping left-footed drive past Nick Pope. Iwobi continued the procession, firing into the roof of the net after Burnley gave him too much space in the box from Aubameyang's square pass, and the creator then turned scorer again as Aubameyang turned home in between the Burnley centre-backs from eight yards after Bellerin's cross. Sub Danny Welbeck hit the crossbar with a fine long-range effort late on as Arsenal entertained the home fans for the last time under the 22-year stewardship of Wenger. Aaron Lennon collides with Jack Wilshere in the first half Managers Arsene Wenger: \"It's very emotional. It's the last time and it's such a long time. Such a big love story, and of course you don't want to end it - but everything comes to an end. \"I think it's a season of contrast, we've won 15 of 19 home games and have scored a lot of goals - it might be our best home season in my 22 years. But it didn't end like we wanted it.\" Opta stats This was Wenger's 606th and final home game in charge of Arsenal (W415 D120 L71), with this the 27th time that his team have won by five or more goals on home soil. Indeed, no manager has taken charge of more Premier League home games than Wenger (414), winning 286 of those; only Sir Alex Ferguson has won more in competition history (305). Arsenal will finish the season having scored 54 league goals at the Emirates; their joint-highest tally of home goals in a Premier League campaign, along with 2004/05 (54). Sean Dyche suffered his 50th defeat as a manager in the Premier League, however only 11 of those have come this season; compared to 19 in 2014/15 and 20 in 2016/17. Man of the match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Plenty of contenders, but the Gabonese striker did everything right on Sunday. His two finishes were poacher-like, but it was not just his prowess in the attacking third which impressed Arsenal's fans responded very well to Aubameyang tracking back on several occasions, showing that the left-wing role, and the running that comes with it, may suit him.

Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool Olivier Giroud scored the only goal of the game as Chelsea kept their top-four hopes alive with a 1-0 victory over Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. The Frenchman's flicked header just after the half-hour mark was enough to see off a Liverpool side who appeared jaded following their midweek Champions League exploits. The result moves Chelsea to within two points of Tottenham in fourth and just three behind third-placed Liverpool with two games remaining. Liverpool missed the chance to secure Champions League football with a game to spare but are still in a strong position courtesy of their superior goal difference and, barring a 15-goal swing, a win against Brighton next weekend will see them qualify again for the competition they could win later this month in Kiev. Player ratings Home Team: Courtois (7), Azpilicueta (7), Cahill (6), Rudiger (8), Moses (7), Fabregas (7), Kante (7), Bakayoko (6), Alonso (6), Hazard (8), Giroud (7).

Subs: Henderson (6), Solanke (6), Moreno (N/A) Man of the match: Eden Hazard Jurgen Klopp's side started brightly and Roberto Firmino saw his third-minute effort saved by Thibaut Courtois after Trent Alexander-Arnold's ball over the top. Chelsea slowly grew into the game but Liverpool maintained a threat on the break with Sadio Mane particularly lively coming in from the left. The Senegalese had two firm efforts from the edge of the box kept out by Courtois but two minutes after the second of them, Chelsea took the lead. Victor Moses reached the byline before checking back onto his left foot, his cross took a slight deflection and Giroud beat Dejan Lovren to the ball at the near post and guided it past Loris Karius and into the far corner. Olivier Giroud salutes the fans after opening the scoring at Stamford Bridge With Chelsea largely happy to sit back, protect their lead and look for opportunities on the counter, there was a lack of intensity to Liverpool's play and they struggled to create any clear openings. Eden Hazard was becoming more influential for Chelsea and nearly added a second for the hosts after dancing past three Liverpool defenders, his near-post effort just rebuffed by Karius and with 10 minutes to go Marcus Alonso's spectacular left-foot volley whistled just past the post. Klopp sent on Dominic Solanke to provide more of a physical presence up front and the Liverpool youngster had the visitors' two best efforts in the closing stages, firstly heading just over from 12 yards and then nodding wide in stoppage time. England watch Gary Cahill marshalled the Chelsea defence well and helped restrict Liverpool to shots from distance, in the main, as he tries to force his way back into Gareth Southgate's World Cup plans. Trent Alexander-Arnold showed his versatility as he started in midfield for Liverpool but produced an up and down performance against a disciplined Chelsea midfield. Nathaniel Clyne put in a steady first half display in his first start of the season but tired in the second and could have left it too late to make it to Russia. Jordan Henderson replaced him for the final half an hour and moved the ball quickly as Liverpool pressed in vain for an equaliser. Chelsea held on though and can turn up the pressure on both Liverpool and Tottenham further with victory over Huddersfield on Wednesday, live on Sky Sports Premier League. Man of the match - Eden Hazard The Chelsea playmaker just edges out Antonio Rudiger, who kept Mo Salah quiet all game. He started slowly but as he found his feet in the match, so did Chelsea. Eden Hazard came close in the second half with a shot from a tight angle He was a constant threat to the Liverpool defence, particularly in his favoured left-hand channel and in the second half showed his strength to hold up the ball and help Chelsea get out as the away side tried to keep Conte's men penned in. Opta stats Liverpool have only lost more Premier League games against Manchester United (28) than against Chelsea (20). This is the first time that Liverpool have failed to score in consecutive Premier League games under Jurgen Klopp. Antonio Conte is the fifth manager to have faced more than 20 Premier League teams and beaten them all, after Alex Ferguson, Arsene Wenger, Jose Mourinho and Gordon Strachan. After going unbeaten in each of Jurgen Klopp's first eight Premier League away games against the rest of the 'big six' (W4 D4), Liverpool have lost four of the last five (D1). What's next? Chelsea have another home game, against Huddersfield, to look forward to on Wednesday before ending their league campaign at Newcastle next weekend. Meanwhile, Liverpool have a week to recover before taking on Brighton at Anfield and then a further two weeks to prepare for the Champions League final against Real Madrid."}, {"date": "05/05/2018",

Palace Stoke 1-2 Crystal Palace Stoke's relegation from the Premier League was confirmed after a crushing 2-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace on Saturday. Xherdan Shaqiri put the Potters ahead with a brilliant free-kick in the 43rd minute but James McArthur levelled for Palace after half-time. Patrick van Aanholt then capitalised on a defensive error to score a late winner and end Stoke's 10-year stay in the top-flight.

In total, they have now lost 18 points from winning positions this season while Paul Lambert has managed just one victory since he was appointed manager in January. Stoke had not finished below 14th in their previous nine Premier League seasons, but they could not get the victory they needed against a Palace side who have been revitalised under Roy Hodgson. Patrick van Aanholt is congratulated after scoring Palace's winner Neither side created much in a tight first half at the bet365 Stadium, with Mame Diouf glancing a header wide from Shaqiri's cross in the 22nd minute and Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Wilfried Zaha missing the target for Palace. However, Shaqiri broke the deadlock late in the first half when his free-kick deflected off Loftus-Cheek and flew into the top corner. Xherdan Shaqiri celebrates scoring for Stoke Victory would have seen Stoke survive in the Premier League for at least another day, but Palace dominated possession after the break and saw their pressure pay off in the 68th minute when McArthur slid past Jack Butland. Zaha and Christian Benteke wasted excellent chances to put Palace ahead before Van Aanholt struck the winner with four minutes remaining. Team news Stoke made one change from their draw at Liverpool as Johnson came in for Martins Indi. Crystal Palace named an unchanged XI, which meant Benteke started on the bench again. Ryan Shawcross slid to block Zaha's pass but only succeeded in playing it through for Van Aanholt, who finished under Butland. Stoke had hardly threatened in the second half and they could not muster a late push as their fate was sealed. Opta stats This is Stoke's first relegation from any division since the 1997-98 campaign, when they were relegated from the second tier alongside Reading and Manchester City. Crystal Palace are mathematically safe from relegation, and are therefore the first top-flight team since Liverpool in the 1899-1900 season to avoid relegation despite losing their first seven matches of the season. Since beating Huddersfield in his first Premier League match in charge, the Potters have collected just seven points from 13 games under Paul Lambert (W0 D7 L6). Crystal Palace haven't lost any of their last 13 Premier League games against sides starting the day in the bottom half of the division (W5 D8). Palace have won three of their last seven Premier League games in which they've gone in at half-time trailing (D1 L3). England World Cup watch Jack Butland didn’t have much to do aside from the two goals, but will this be his last home game for Stoke? There have been reports that newly-promoted Wolves are interested in signing England’s potential No 1 goalkeeper at the World Cup, and relegation could affect his future. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was impressive again for Palace and surely must be in with a chance of making Gareth Southgate’s squad. Man of the match - Wilfried Zaha Zaha continued his strong run of form with another positive display. He played a part in both goals and looked dangerous whenever he ran with the ball. The only negative was his miss in the 77th minute when he blazed over the bar from inside the box. What's next?

increased after Ryan Fraser's first-half strike handed Bournemouth all three points at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday. The hosts scored the only goal of the game eight minutes before half-time thanks to a well-worked free-kick routine, as Fraser swept the ball home from the edge of the penalty area for his fifth league goal of the season. Victory sees Eddie Howe's side move past the 40-point barrier and up to 12th, but for Swansea, defeat sees them drop into the relegation zone following Southampton's 1-1 draw at Everton on Saturday evening. Carlos Carvalhal's side face a crucial game with Southampton, live on Sky Sports, at the Liberty Stadium on Tuesday in a clash which could decide the fates of both teams before finishing with another home game against relegated Stoke.

Man of the match: Josh King. Boosted ahead of kick-off by events at the bet365 Stadium, where Stoke's defeat to Crystal Palace saw their relegation confirmed, Swansea had the chance to take a significant stride towards safety with victory at Bournemouth and they were nearly ahead in the 11th minute with Mike van der Hoorn and Nathan Dyer denied by a smart double save from Asmir Begovic. The hosts had chances of their own, the best of which fell to Callum Wilson, who sliced wide after being picked out at the far post by Fraser's inch-perfect cross. Martin Olsson could only head Andre Ayew's cross over the crossbar as Swansea spurned yet another chance and they were soon punished when Fraser stroked home a smart Bournemouth free-kick routine, after Alfie Mawson had dragged Wilson down on the edge of the penalty area. Bournemouth players celebrate after Ryan Fraser's goal against Swansea Swansea continued to create chances and Jordan Ayew wasted a glorious chance, slicing horribly wide after being played in by his brother Andre. Jordan Ayew was straight into the action after the break and he did better with his next effort, forcing Begovic into another smart save, but after that the chances dried up for the visitors. Team news Howe made two changes from the side that lost 2-1 to Southampton with Surman and Pugh replacing Gosling and Mousset. Swansea made three changes from the side that lost 1-0 to Chelsea with Fernandez, Carroll and Dyer coming in for Naughton, King and Clucas. Carvalhal turned to Tammy Abraham from the bench and they sent bodies forward in search of an equaliser but lacked quality in the final third of the pitch. The defeat could have been heavier for the Swans but Steve Cook missed a good chance to double the Cherries' lead when he headed over, while Lukasz Fabianski made a stunning save to deny Wilson from close range at the death. But Fraser's goal proved to be enough and left Carvalhal with big concerns as his side went a seventh game without a win, and a third in a row without a goal. Opta stats Bournemouth registered their first win in six Premier League games (D2 L3), and their first clean sheet in 12. The Cherries ended a run of 11 Premier League games without a clean sheet, which was the longest current conceding streak in the competition. Only Huddersfield (19) have failed to score in more Premier League games this season than Swansea (17). Ki Sung-Yeung and Marc Pugh battle for the ball Swansea have lost three consecutive Premier League games without scoring for only the second time ever, since a three-game run in September 2012. The Swans have conceded the opening goal in 22 of their Premier League games this season, a joint-high figure along with Bournemouth. Ryan Fraser has registered his best-ever goal tally in a single league season (five goals). Man of the Match - Josh King Josh King burst past Nathan Dyer He did not get the goal his display deserved but King produced a performance full of energy against Swansea. The 26-year-old combined well with Wilson and their pace caused Carvalhal's side all sorts of problems. And but for better finishing, he could have had a couple of assists to his name. England Watch Lewis Cook played the full 90 minutes in Bournemouth’s victory against Swansea. Alfie Mawson didn’t have his best afternoon for the Swans, giving away the free-kick which led to Ryan Fraser’s37th minute winner.

The Hammers were deserving of their win at the King Power Stadium as Joao Mario opened the scoring in the 34th minute before Mark Noble (64) produced a superb volley to seal a vital three points. Leicester - the day after Puel was given backing by the club's chairman - offered little in terms of a reply and did not have a shot on target until the 86th minute. Player ratings Leicester: Hamer (6), Benalouane (6), Morgan (7), Maguire (7), Fuchs (6), Mahrez (5), Silva (7), Iborra (5), Choudhury (7), Diabate (6), Vardy (6). Subs used: Dragovic (6), Iheanacho (4), Gray (5). West Ham: Adrian (7), Rice (6), Ogbonna (7), Cresswell (7), Zabaleta (7), Kouyate (6), Noble (7), Joao Mario (7), Masuaku (7), Lanzini (6), Arnautovic (8). Subs used: Carroll (6), Fernandes (4), Evra (n/a). Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic. The Foxes remain in ninth place but are now winless in five Premier League games, while West Ham have moved five points clear of the relegation places with two games left to play. With 17th-placed Southampton to play Swansea in 18th on Tuesday, victory for the Hammers means they will remain a top-flight club next season. West Ham began the game well, but could not really test Leicester goalkeeper Ben Hamer until the half an hour mark, with Manuel Laznini sliding Marko Arnautovic through in the area but his shot was well blocked by the legs of the stopper. Team news Leicester made five changes with Christian Fuchs, Yohan Benalouane, Adrien Silva, Vicente Iborra and Fousseni Diabate coming into the XI. West Ham made two changes as Joao Mario and Arthur Masuaku started the game. Two minutes later, Arnautovic should have opened the scoring but his brilliantly curled effort could only ping against the upright and go wide, with Hamer well beaten in goal. West Ham found the breakthrough in the 34th minute as Arthur Masuaku delivered a superb cross into the area that met Arnautovic, who took two flicked touches before sliding the ball back for the waiting Joao Mario. The Portuguese then swept home past Hamer. Leicester improved at the start of the second half but struggled to find their rhythm up front with the Hammers doubling their lead in the 64th minute. It was a wonderful strike from Noble as he collected a headed clearance from Aleksandar Dragovic before powering a volley through the area and into the net off the post. Joao Mario is congratulated by team-mates after giving West Ham the lead at Leicester The Foxes had their first shot on target in the 86th minute, although it was a tame effort from Adrien Silva that went straight into the hands of Adrian, but the goalkeeper was more sternly tested not long after. He palmed away a near-post header from Yohan Benalouane before denying the defender again as he tried to head home from a corner. England Watch Harry Maguire and Jamie Vardy both played the full 90 minutes, and despite the defeat, the defender did not do too much wrong. Vardy did very little, but was starved of service from his team-mates more than his own performance. Aaron Cresswell also did well despite a bizarre handball booking, while Andy Carroll made a decent 20 minute cameo after a turbulent week. Opta stats Leicester are without a win in six home Premier League games (D4 L2), their longest winless streak in the league on home soil since a run of six ending on Boxing Day 2014 (D2 L4). The Foxes have lost four of their last five league games (D1), as many defeats as they had suffered in their previous 13. West Ham have scored in each of their last 11 away Premier League games their longest scoring run in the top-flight since December 1966 (14 games). Leicester have failed to score in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since February 2017 (a run of six which were Claudio Ranieri's last games in charge). Adrian celebrates West Ham's opener against Leicester The managers Claude Puel: \"I think it is normal [the fan reaction of boss at full-time] because it is a tough period with some negativity and blame. I would like to apologise for the last performance because it is not enough and we have to finish strongly in the last two games.\" 4:53 Leicester manager Claude Puel says the frustration of the fans is normal and admits recent performances have not been good enough Leicester manager Claude Puel says the frustration of the fans is normal and admits recent performances have not been good enough David Moyes: \"Winning always feels good and we've needed to win a couple of games so the boys did a really good job today getting that result. We've just played Chelsea, Arsenal and Man City in a row which is never easy and we conceded some goals so to get a clean sheet and three points today is really good.\" 3:28 Following their win at Leicester, David Moyes says he’s looking up the table to see where West Ham can finish in the Premier League Following their win at Leicester, David Moyes says he’s looking up the table to see where West Ham can finish in the Premier League Man of the match - Marko Arnautovic By the 78th minute, Arnautovic looked tired and for good reason. The striker ran himself ragged, especially in the first half, and was heavily involved in much of the positive attacking play from West Ham. While he may not have got on the scoresheet himself, he did set up Joao Mario for his opener and has now been involved in nine goals in his last eight Premier League away games. Arthur Masuaku is challenged by Yohan Benalouane What's next?

Watford 2-1 Newcastle Two first-half goals confirmed Watford's Premier League status and gave them their first win since early March as they saw off Newcastle 2-1 on Saturday in the Premier League. Hosts Watford took the lead after just three minutes as Roberto Pereyra simply finished off a move involving Andre Gray, Troy Deeney and Abdoulaye Doucoure, and it was 2-0 on 28 minutes as Gray nodded home at the far post from Pereyra's cross. Deeney saw a late first-half penalty saved by Martin Dubravka, before Ayoze Perez halved the deficit 10 minutes after the break with a fine far-post finish with the outside of his boot.

Watford were quickest out of the stops and took the lead through Pereyra's finish from 10 yards, slotting home at the near post after Paul Dummett have failed to clear the ball in the box, allowing Doucoure to feed the Argentine to score. It should have been 2-0 on seven minutes as Pereyra and then Deeney saw close-range efforts blocked by Dubravka, and the Newcastle goalkeeper was again at his best to deny Gray's effort from an angle inside the box. Gray got his goal a minute later, however, heading into the empty net at the far post as Pereyra found a yard to cross from the left, over the stretch of Dubravka. Team news Watford made three changes after the defeat by Spurs on MNF; Janmaat, Pereyra and Deeney came in, replacing Richarlison, Femenia and Mariappa, who all dropped to the bench For Newcastle, Manquillo replaced Yedlin, and Murphy came in for Ritchie, who also dropped to the bench. Ayoze Perez scored early in the second half for Newcastle Roger East handed Watford a penalty on 39 minutes after Dummett's clumsy slide on Gray, but Dubravka guessed correctly to his right to save Deeney's spot kick, and then got up well to block the rebound. Newcastle battled superbly in the second half and scored with their first shot on target through Perez, brilliantly turning the ball home on the stretch with the outside of his boot from Javier Manquillo's right-wing cross. Adrian Mariappa nearly turned into his own net midway through the second half, and Perez hit the outside of the post with a fine flick from a corner, but Watford held on to make sure they'll be playing Premier League football for a fourth straight season. The managers 2:36 Javi Gracia says he’s happy that Watford have achieved their objective Javi Gracia says he’s happy that Watford have achieved their objective Javi Gracia: \"I'm very proud to belong with this club, I am very happy here.

Now we know we have to keep doing the same thing, but we're not doing that at the moment, so we'll see what happens. \"It's a question of showing what we are capable of doing.

Newcastle's winless top-flight run at Watford extended to eight games (W0 D4 L4) - only at Wimbledon (10) have they played more without victory. The Hornets had eight shots on target in this match - in no Premier League game have they had more this season (also eight vs Chelsea in February). Roberto Pereyra has scored three goals in his last five Premier League games - more than he'd managed in his previous 29 in the competition (2). England World Cup watch Jonjo Shelvey was absent in the first half, but impressed in the second with some trademark crossfield passing. Shelvey has that knack of finding strikers in-behind even the deepest line of defence, but the feeling is Southgate is likely not to risk the Newcastle man in Russia. Man of the match - Roberto Pereyra The Argentine scored the first and set up the second as Watford created a flurry of chances in the opening 45 minutes. His cross for the second, Andre Gray's far-post header, caught out the otherwise faultless Dubravka, and he completed a team-high 91.3 per cent of passes, and 84.6 per cent in the opposition half. He was brought off early in the second half with what looked to be an injury, and Watford missed his creativity and dynamism thereafter. What's next?

But the winner came in injury time as ex-Spurs midfielder Livermore turned the ball into the net from a yard out after a goalmouth scramble to hand West Brom a Premier League lifeline. Darren Moore's side needed three points to have any chance of staying in the division - but a Southampton win a few hours later against Everton would still have sent them down to the Championship. Instead, Tom Davies struck a last-gasp Everton equaliser at Goodison Park to grant Albion another reprieve - until Tuesday's Sky Live meeting between Saints and Swansea at least. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (7), Nyom (6), Dawson (8), Hegazi (7), Gibbs (6), Phillips (7), Livermore (7), Brunt (7), McClean (5), Rodriguez (6), Rondon (7) Subs: Sturridge (5), Chadli (5), Krychowiak (5) Spurs: Lloris (7), Alderweireld (8), Sanchez (6), Vertonghen (7), Trippier (7), Wanyama (6), Eriksen (6), Rose (6), Lamela (5), Alli (5), Kane (4) Subs: Son (5), Lucas (6), Llorente (N/A) Man of the match: Craig Dawson Kane has not been at his prolific best since returning from an ankle injury last month and he snatched at a good opportunity midway through the first half after being picked out by Kieran Trippier. West Brom rallied towards the end of the half and had two great chances to score, Jay Rodriguez latching onto a hopeful long ball into the box to lob over Hugo Lloris, only to see Toby Alderweireld head his effort over the bar on the goal line. Moments later, Ahmed Hegazi rose highest inside the box to meet Matt Phillips' in-swinging corner but his header drifted just wide of the far post. Spurs continued to find it difficult to break West Brom down in the second half and went closest through Christian Eriksen's free-kick from distance that stung the palms of Foster down to his right. Team news Darren Moore named an unchanged team following West Brom's 1-0 win over Newcastle last weekend. Former Spurs player Nacer Chadli was back on the bench after a lengthy lay-off.Mauricio Pochettino made four changes with Toby Alderweireld, Danny Rose, Victor Wanyama and Erik Lamela replacing Eric Dier, Ben Davies, Mousa Dembele and Son Heung-min. Shortly afterwards there was a flashpoint between Danny Rose and Allan Nyom on the left touchline which resulted in the latter going to ground clutching his face following a push. Both players were booked after the incident and Nyom had to be restrained by his team-mates after remonstrating furiously with the referee. As the game wore on, West Brom grew increasingly confident and they almost snatched the lead through an unlikely source as Kane - off the pace again - shinned the ball towards the goal inside his six-yard box. Fortunately for him, Lloris was equal to it, flinging himself acrobatically at the ball to divert it over. 20 - Spurs have now lost 20 Premier League games thanks to goals scored in the 90th minute - more than any other side in the competition. Drama. #WBATOT — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) May 5, 2018 Jan Vertonghen went off injured with five minutes to go and Spurs missed the Belgian badly as West Brom took advantage of his absence to score from a corner, Craig Dawson's initial header eventually falling to Livermore, whose finish sparked jubilant scenes. England watch At what point will Gareth Southgate start to fret over Harry Kane's form? The man most likely to captain England this summer endured another frustrating day, missing a great chance in the first half and almost scoring an own goal. Dele Alli was also subdued on the day but it was a surprise when he and not Erik Lamela was withdrawn. Danny Rose was handed a rare start but was fortunate to last the 90 minutes after stupidly pushing Allan Nyom in the face. Kieran Trippier was the best player of Spurs' English contingent. For West Brom, Jake Livermore did his chances of earning a World Cup call-up no harm with the winning goal. Man of the match - Craig Dawson Not many teams keep Spurs' attack quiet - their 2-0 win against Watford on Monday night meant that they had scored in 23 Premier League games in a row. However, West Brom did just that and the performance of Craig Dawson, alongside his central defensive partner Ahmed Hegazi, was a huge reason why. Dawson was phenomenal throughout, making a mammoth 17 clearances and winning five aerial duels. He also played a key role at the other end to, winning the header that eventually resulted in Livermore's goal. The managers 4:05 Following their win over Tottenham, Darren Moore says his West Brom side have shown through hard work and commitment what can be achieved Following their win over Tottenham, Darren Moore says his West Brom side have shown through hard work and commitment what can be achieved Darren Moore: \"It was a wonderful game, not one for the faint-hearted, a pulsating game and one that will live long in the memory. \"We came up against a very good Spurs team but we just felt we needed to keep the game tight, which we did, I thought the players were very disciplined. \"I thought everyone to a man and everyone connected with West Bromwich Albion played a part today.\" 2:29 Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham weren’t clinical enough in front of goal during their 1-0 defeat at West Brom Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham weren’t clinical enough in front of goal during their 1-0 defeat at West Brom Mauricio Pochettino: \"In football, you can dominate, have the option to score but then you have to be clinical and today was not good. Our finishing wasn't good and we are very disappointed. \"Against a team like West Bromwich [Albion] it is always possible that can happen because they are very physical and work very hard and are good at set-pieces. \"Still we have in our hands the possibility to be in the top four.\" Opta stats West Brom are unbeaten in their last five Premier League games (W3 D2) - only Liverpool (6) are on a longer current run in the competition. The Baggies are the only non 'big six' side to avoid defeat against two 'big six' sides in the Premier League this season (W1 D1 vs Spurs, D2 vs Liverpool). Indeed, West Brom have won 10 points against big six sides in the Premier League this season - only Man City (24), Man Utd (19) and Spurs (13) have won more. Spurs failed to score for the first time in 24 Premier League games, since a 0-2 loss at Arsenal in November. Jake Livermore has scored two goals in his last three Premier League games for West Brom, after failing to score in his first 46 for the club. Indeed, Livermore's strike on 91:46 was West Brom's only shot on target in this match. This was Tottenham's first defeat against the side starting the day bottom of the table since also losing against West Brom in September 2014. What's next? West Brom's final game of the season is away to Crystal Palace next Sunday and depending on results between now and then, they will know whether or not a win would be able to save them. Tottenham are now in danger of surrendering their top-four place and will be looking for a better result against Newcastle on Wednesday before ending their campaign against Leicester at Wembley next Sunday."}, {"date": "05/05/2018", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38225, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

"report": "2:40 Everton 1-1 Southampton Everton 1-1 Southampton Tom Davies' 96th-minute equaliser denied Southampton a huge three points in their fight for survival with a 1-1 draw at Everton. Davies' deflected effort, more than 60 seconds after the four minutes of added time shown had elapsed, was not enough to save Sam Allardyce from a chorus of boos at the full-time whistle at the end of a flat performance from the hosts. Nathan Redmond, a half-time substitute, had turned Cedric's cross beyond Jordan Pickford from close range (57) with a goal which looked like it would earn the Saints a valuable, and rare, away win. The visitors looked like keeping Everton at bay even after Maya Yoshida was sent off with five minutes remaining until Davies' late strike, which leaves Southampton outside the relegation zone on goal difference ahead of a trip to 18th-placed Swansea on Tuesday night, live on Sky Sports. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (6), Keane (6), Jagielka (7), Baines (6), Gueye (5), Schneiderlin (6), Vlasic (5), Davies (6), Bolasie (5), Tosun (6). Subs: Funes Mori (6), Niasse (7), Klaassen (N/A) Southampton: McCarthy (7), Soares (7), Yoshida (5), Hoedt (6), Bednarek (6), Bertrand (6), Romeu (7), Lemina (5), Hojbjerg (6), Tadic (7), Austin (6). Subs: Redmond (8), Ward-Prowse (6), Long (6). Man of the match: Nathan Redmond A poor first half was punctuated by two Southampton chances - Charlie Austin testing Pickford from 25 yards, and Oriol Romeu's deflected effort forcing the England international to punch clear. Everton had just three touches in the Saints box before the break, with Yannick Bolasie's weak header the closest they came to troubling Alex McCarthy - and they were booed off at half-time by much of the home support. Southampton broke rapidly down the right for the opening goal of the game as Dusan Tadic held the ball before Cedric overlapped, and the full-back's perfect cross gave Redmond a simple finish. Allardyce then introduced Oumar Niasse within moments of the goal, but there was little improvement in terms of clear-cut chances from the hosts. Team news Wayne Rooney (leg) and Theo Walcott (knee) both missed out with injury for Everton, and Davy Klaassen made a rare appearance on the bench. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg was Mark Hughes' only change for Southampton, replacing Nathan Redmond. They were handed a lifeline when Yoshida, already booked for a foul on Ramiro Funes Mori, slid in on the same player and was given his marching orders by Jon Moss. Moss added on four minutes at the end of the game, with Southampton looking comfortable even with their man disadvantage - but with almost another minute already played, a free-kick against Redmond was launched forward by Everton, from which Davies' deflected 20-yard shot broke Southampton hearts. That goal keeps West Brom's survival hopes alive until Tuesday night at least, while Southampton's trip to Swansea in midweek looks increasingly do-or-die. Match facts Everton have lost just one of their 19 Premier League home games against Southampton (W13 D5). The side playing at home has only lost one of the last 18 league meetings between these sides (W11 D6), with Everton picking up a 3-0 victory at St Mary's in August 2015. Southampton have now dropped 21 points from winning positions this season - only West Brom have lost more (26). The Toffees have lost their final home league game in just two of their last 14 seasons (W10 D2). Everton have conceded 55 Premier League goals this season - the last time they conceded more came during the 2003-04 campaign (57 goals conceded). The Saints have now conceded 14 goals from outside of the box this campaign - the most in the division. Nathan Redmond's goal was his first in the Premier League this season with what was his 40th shot of this campaign. England watch Jordan Pickford could do little about Nathan Redmond's goal after half-time, and made several smart saves. Michael Keane was fairly solid in the Everton backline, but let Redmond go for a free header for his goal. Man of the match - Nathan Redmond Despite only arriving at the interval, Redmond took the game by the scruff of the neck, scoring the goal that looked like proving a shot in the arm for Southampton's fight for survival, and having more shots (4) than any player on the pitch. Redmond looked a different player to the one who has gone all season without scoring - and despite touching the ball only 26 times, he changed the game and provided the creative spark the visitors had been missing. What's next? Southampton travel to 18th-placed Swansea on Tuesday night, while Everton play their final game of the season next Sunday at West Ham, Allardyce's former club."}, {"date": "04/05/2018", "arena": "Amex

second-half header guaranteed Brighton's Premier League status following a 1-0 win over a flat Manchester United on Friday Night Football. Gross broke the deadlock with a close-range header which fell 2.8 centimetres over the line - confirmed by the Goal Decision System - on 57 minutes, after David de Gea's superb save from Glenn Murray's dipping volley kept the scores level at the break. Both sides had chances in the second half to score the second, but United were well below-par as they look to finish the Premier League season on a high ahead of the FA Cup final against Chelsea.

After Marouane Fellaini had seen an early goal correctly ruled out for offside, Brighton's Glenn Murray forced a superb save out of De Gea with a fine half-volley from 25 yards. De Gea, who was named Manchester United Player of the Season for a record fourth time this week, did well to tip over Jose Izquierdo's long-range effort, and then showed his worth yet again by blocking Pascal Gross from an angle at the near post after some sloppy play by Fellaini. Team news Brighton made two changes, with Murray and Propper in for Ulloa and Kayal. Man Utd made six changes from the side that beat Arsenal 2-1 last weekend, with Rashford, Mata, Martial, Fellaini, Darmian and Rojo coming in. Sanchez and Lukaku were not involved. Chris Smalling challenges Glenn Murray in the opening exchanges at the Amex De Gea's opposite number Mathew Ryan did well to stop a low Paul Pogba effort after the break, but Brighton took the lead on 57 minutes thanks to the help of the Goal-line Decision System. Izquierdo's cross down the wing was not dealt with by United, allowing Gross to pile in from six yards out and head inches over the line, despite Marcos Rojo's best efforts to keep the ball out. Izquierdo nearly doubled Brighton's lead moments later, but fizzed an effort just wide at the far post with United on the ropes and both Pogba and Anthony Martial, in particular, struggling to influence the game. Martial did strike just wide towards the end, while sub Jesse Lingard miscued from a clear opportunity inside the box after a well-worked one-two with Martial. Gross celebrates the opening goal, given by GDS The managers Chris Hughton: \"There's a group of players with great belief and discipline. We learned after the first few games that the performances were good enough that we weren't always going to get beat, and that gave us confidence.\" Jose Mourinho: \"Maybe now you understand why some players play more than others, and you don't ask all the time why A, B and C don't play more. I thought for some of them the possibility to start the game, to give reason to the ones who all season have been critical towards my choices. \"Probably we are not as good individually as people think we are, and I keep saying, if you manage to finish second, it is great, more than great if you manage to finish second. But now we need four points and we must try to get them.\" 3:32 Jose Mourinho says certain individuals did not perform well enough Jose Mourinho says certain individuals did not perform well enough Man of the match - Anthony Knockaert \"Not just for lighting up the stadium for his dribbles, but he's got into his defensive positions so well,\" said Gary Neville. \"Both sides of his game were superb.\" Knockaert constantly wanted the ball down the right and caused Ashley Young all manner of issues, with a team-high 57 touches and 19 duels. England World Cup watch Ashley Young was left exposed as most of Brighton's attacks came down United's left, while Chris Smalling did his chances no harm but didn't overly impress. Marcus Rashford struggled to make an influence in the game as Jose Mourinho gave him a rare chance up front, while Jesse Lingard came off the bench in the second half. Glenn Murray, who has a outsider's chance of making the squad if there are injury issues for England up front, held the ball up well and put in an impressive performance with just a week-and-a-half until the squad is announced. Opta stats Brighton registered only their second win in 19 matches against Man Utd in all competitions, with this their first since a 1-0 victory in the top-flight in November 1982. Manchester United have lost away from home against three newly promoted sides in a league season for the first time in their history, also losing at Huddersfield (1-2 in October) and Newcastle (0-1 in February). It was also the first time they'd lost three matches against newly promoted sides in a league season since 1989/90, when they lost to Man City, Crystal Palace and Chelsea.

in Tottenham's routine 2-0 win over Watford to reopen their five-point cushion over Chelsea in the race for a top-four finish. Dele Alli's fourth Premier League goal in his last five games gave Spurs the perfect start at Wembley, pouncing on a mistake from Orestis Karnezis to finish from Christian Eriksen's pass (16). Mauricio Pochettino's side were flat in the first half, but it took just three minutes into the second period for Kane to tuck in Kieran Trippier's cross and take his tally to 38 goals for the season. Spurs are now a point behind third-placed Liverpool with a game in hand while 13th-placed Watford are six points clear of the relegation zone but still not mathematically assured of safety. Dele Alli struck his first league goal at Wembley in 10 appearances Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Trippier (8), Sanchez (7), Vertonghen (8), Davies (6), Dier (6), Dembele (6), Eriksen (7), Alli (6), Son (6), Kane (6) Subs: Wanyama (6), Sissoko (5), Lamela (n/a) Watford: Karnezis (4), Mariappa (5), Cathcart (5), Kabasele (5), Holebas (5), Hughes (7), Doucoure (6), Capoue (5), Femenia (5), Gray (6), Richarlison (5) Subs: Deulofeu (5), Deeney (5), Carrillo (n/a) Man of the match: Kieran Trippier In a game which saw the two clubs join forces to back Sky's Ocean Rescue campaign, a goalkeeping error gifted the hosts the advantage. Karnezis spilled Trippier's cross, presenting the ball straight to Eriksen, whose first-time ball found Alli for a simple tap-in after 16 minutes to ease any nerves among the subdued home supporters. It means Spurs have scored in 23 successive league games - their best run since the late 80s - but Javi Gracia's side had a golden chance to level 10 minutes later. Harry Kane celebrates his goal in Tottenham's 2-0 win against Watford Team news Despite losing 2-1 in the last four of the FA Cup last time out, Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino kept faith with the same outfield players. Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris came back in though after Michel Vorm featured against Manchester United. As expected, Roberto Pereyra (groin) and Stefano Okaka (unspecified) missed out for Watford, while Troy Deeney dropped to the bench. Kiko Femenia, Andre Gray and Richarlison all came in as replacements as Gracia’s side looked to end their long wait for another away win. A slack pass from Eric Dier allowed Etienne Capoue to release Andre Gray, but Watford's £18.5m record signing was unable to beat Hugo Lloris with his snap-shot low down to the keeper's right. It was the type of chance Watford had to take on a night when Spurs dominated, and Heung-Min Son was then unfortunate not to win a penalty when going down under a challenge from Abdoulaye Doucoure. Spurs continued to present chances to their opponents as a delightful touch from Will Hughes found Doucoure on the left of the Tottenham penalty area, but having cut back inside, the pair got in each other's way as Lloris gathered Doucoure's shot at the second attempt.

Kane initially slipped from Son's cross, but he got back up to his feet to convert Trippier's low ball to score his 27th league goal of the campaign, four behind Mohamed Salah in his quest for the Premier League Golden Boot. Jan Vertonghen came within inches of stretching their lead when his header from Trippier's free-kick struck a post, before Richarlison blazed over from Troy Deeney's knock-down with 20 minutes remaining. The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"I think it's nice for us because the objective was the three points to allow us to be in a good position in the table. It was a must-win game and so important for us. \"Maybe we didn't play in the way we wanted to play and our performance wasn't great, but the most important thing was the three points tonight.\" 2:34 Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino gives his reaction to Sky Sports following the 2-0 win over Watford Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino gives his reaction to Sky Sports following the 2-0 win over Watford Javi Gracia: \"We conceded cheaply in our box and we weren't able to score the goals in the other box. If you don't have control of the boxes it's difficult to win games. \"I'm focused on the next game and I'll try to improve our position in the Premier League, the best the club has ever got. This is our target and our focus is on the next game against Newcastle.\" 2:02 Watford boss Javi Gracia gives his reaction to Sky Sports following the 2-0 defeat to Tottenham on Monday Night Football Watford boss Javi Gracia gives his reaction to Sky Sports following the 2-0 defeat to Tottenham on Monday Night Football Man of the match: Kieran Trippier Spurs were not at their sparkling best, but Trippier was a constant outlet down the right with his delivery instrumental in providing the two key moments. In setting up Kane's goal, the full-back now has seven league assists to his name - no defender has provided more. Trippier has also notched one goal and five assists in his six top-flight appearances against Watford. A rare mistake nearly resulted in Deeney grabbing a consolation goal, but the former Burnley full-back repaid the faith shown in him by Pochettino, vindicating his decision to be selected in front of substitute Serge Aurier. Kieran Trippier provided Spurs with numerous chances from his accurate crossing England World Cup watch Kieran Trippier The right-back overcame an early knock to his foot to produce the cross that caused uncertainty for Spurs’ opener, and his delivery from out on the right caused the Watford defence problems all night, setting up Kane for the second. On this evidence, Gareth Southgate faces a dilemma on whether to persist with playing Kyle Walker as part of a back three. Eric Dier One slack pass nearly resulted in a Watford equaliser in the first half, and while Will Hughes impressed for the visitors in the opening 45 minutes, Dier showed good discipline to nullify his threat in the second period. Dele Alli Job done for Alli, as the midfielder ended a run of 10 home league appearances without a goal by profiting from Karnezis’ mistake. Watford’s defence did well to keep Alli on the periphery of the game, but it is a good sign for England if he is still scoring when keeping plenty of energy in reserve. Harry Kane Kane showed early signs of rustiness as he dragged an effort straight at Karnezis with Trippier better placed for the pass before he failed to control from Alli’s cross. On 33 minutes, Kane ducked under a cross when receiving a call from a Watford defender, but the striker showed his strength in character by flashing in his 27th league goal of the campaign. Opta stats Tottenham have scored in each of their last 23 Premier League games, their longest scoring run in the top-flight since April 1987 (26 games). Watford have now gone seven Premier League away games without scoring (D1 L6), since Gray found the back of net against Man City at the Etihad on January 2nd. Eriksen has been directly involved in nine goals in his last eight games in all competitions (5 goals, 4 assists). Eriksen (10 goals, 10 assists) is the third Spurs player to register 10+ goals and 10+ assists in a single Premier League season, after Jurgen Klinsmann in 94/95 and Emmanuel Adebayor in 11/12. Dele Alli has registered seven goal involvements in his last seven games for Spurs in all competitions (5 goals, 2 assists). Watford are the only side to have more than one goalkeeper make an error leading to goal this season in the Premier League (two each for Gomes and Karnezis). What's next? Tottenham travel to face a resurgent West Brom at The Hawthorns on Saturday, while Watford host Newcastle at Vicarage Road on the same day."}, {"date": "29/04/2018", "arena": "London Stadium",

1-4 Manchester City Manchester City's title-winning campaign reached new heights as a 4-1 victory at West Ham saw them smash through the 100-goal mark en route to a record-equalling 30th win. Leroy Sane opened the scoring for the visitors at the London Stadium with a deflected 13th-minute strike before a calamitous Pablo Zabaleta own goal in the 27th minute saw City become the first club in Premier League history to hit a century of goals in two seasons. Aaron Cresswell halved the deficit on 42 minutes with a sumptuous free-kick, but goals from Gabriel Jesus (53) and Fernandinho (64) saw City re-establish control and equal their highest goals tally in a Premier League campaign. City need just one win and two more goals from their remaining three games to set the record for the most wins in a Premier League season and to surpass Chelsea's record goals tally of 103. West Ham remain 15th in the table, three points clear of the relegation zone, after a defeat which leaves boss David Moyes with three games to secure their top-flight status. Player ratings West Ham: Adrian (5), Zabaleta (5), Ogbonna (5), Rice (5), Cresswell (5), Evra (5), Noble (5), Kouyate (5), Fernandes (5), Lanzini (6), Arnautovic (6). Subs: Mario (5), Masuaku (5), Chicharito (5). Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Laporte (7), Otamendi (7), Delph (7), Fernandinho (8), Gundogan (8), De Bruyne (8), Sane (8), Sterling (9), Jesus (8). Subs: Danilo (5), Toure (5), Nmecha (5). Man of the Match: Raheem Sterling With survival yet to be secured, the Hammers were cautious in the opening exchanges but their reluctance to go after the champions proved costly as Sane's curling effort took a wicked deflection off Patrice Evra on its way past a stricken Adrian in the home goal. That kicked West Ham into gear as Manuel Lanzini drew a save from Ederson, but City were soon two to the good as a Declan Rice error, for the second week running, saw him turn the ball into the back of the net off former City defender Zabaleta. Leroy Sane celebrates with Kyle Walker and Kevin De Bruyne after putting Manchester City 1-0 up against West Ham The linesman came to Ederson's rescue on 39 minutes when Marko Arnautovic's effort was ruled out for a foul on the City 'keeper as he dithered in possession in his area, but West Ham soon found the net. After Ilkay Gundogan's foul on Edimilson Fernandes was incorrectly adjudged to have been outside the area, Cresswell whipped the resulting free-kick over the City wall to give West Ham hope before half-time. Team news Adrian, Manuel Lanzini and Patrice Evra were recalled by David Moyes as he made three changes to the West Ham side that lost at Arsenal. Joe Hart was ineligible to face his parent club. Kyle Walker, Nicholas Otamendi, Fernandinho and Leroy Sane returned to the starting line-up for the champions. That hope was extinguished within eight minutes of the restart, though, as Jesus released Raheem Sterling in behind before gathering the England forward's cross, skipping inside Zabaleta and firing past Adrian from close range. An apparent blatant foul by Cresswell on Sterling in the area went unpunished on 58 minutes, but City wrapped up their victory when Fernandinho converted their fourth on 64 minutes from Sterling's precise cross. Opta stats Manchester City have now scored 102 goals in 35 games this season, the quickest an English top-flight side has reached this milestone in a single campaign since Everton in 1931-32 (32 games). This is the fourth occasion that a team has scored 100+ goals in a single Premier League season and City are the first to do so twice. Manchester City have won 30 Premier League games in 2017-18, equalling the English top-flight record for most league wins in a 38-game season (Chelsea 2016-17). Manchester City are the first team since Arsenal in 2012-13 to have four different players score 10+ Premier League goals in a single season. Indeed, the other teams to achieve this feat were Chelsea in 2009-10, Chelsea in 2010-11, and Manchester United in 1995-96. Pablo Zabaleta is the first player to score a Premier League own goal against a side he's previously played for in the competition since Jonjo Shelvey vs Liverpool in December 2014. Gabriel Jesus has been directly involved in 24 goals in 25 Premier League starts for Man City (18 goals, 6 assists), with the Brazilian netting in each of his last four starts. England Watch Joe Hart was ineligible to play against his parent club but, with City scoring four goals, his World Cup hopes were arguably strengthened by being absent. Kyle Walker returned to the City side for a 61-minute cameo while Fabian Delph’s claim for a surprise inclusion gathered pace as he put in another solid performance. Raheem Sterling’s stock continued to rise as he tormented Aaron Cresswell and set up two goals in an inspired second-half display at the London Stadium. Man of the Match - Raheem Sterling Sterling enjoyed the freedom of the London Stadium down the right flank behind Cresswell. The England forward teed up Jesus for City's third and Fernandinho for a classy fourth to seal an emphatic victory for the champions. Fernandinho celebrates after scoring City's fourth goal Had he had his shooting boots on, the records that City will pursue before the end of the season would have been broken with games to spare, but Sterling's performance was still exemplary.

Substitute Fellaini popped up in the 91st minute with a well-directed header from Ashley Young's left-wing cross to give Jose Mourinho the points over rival Wenger, who hasn't won a league game at Old Trafford since 2006. Paul Pogba had given United the lead (16) from close range, but former United midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan levelled after the break (51) with a neatly-placed low effort from the edge of the box. Henrikh Mkhitaryan held back on his celebrations after scoring against his former club Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Valencia (7), Lindelof (6), Smalling (6), Young (8), Herrera (6), Matic (6), Pogba (7), Lingard (5), Sanchez (5), Lukaku (5) Subs: Rashford (6), Martial (7), Fellaini (7) Arsenal: Ospina (6), Bellerin (7), Chambers (6), Mavropanos (7), Kolasinac (6), Xhaka (4), Maitland-Niles (9), Nelson (7), Iwobi (6), Mkhitaryan (8), Aubameyang (5) Subs: Welbeck (6), Monreal (6), Willock (NA) Man of the match: Ainsley Maitland-Niles Arsenal nearly held on, but the result means United are guaranteed a top-four finish in the Premier League, and need just four points from their last three games to secure second place. Arsenal are sixth, three points above seventh-placed Burnley with a game in hand, but the defeat confirms they cannot reach the top four, and will finish below north London rivals Tottenham for the second successive season. Wenger made seven changes ahead of the Europa League semi-final second leg on Thursday at Atletico Madrid, giving Konstantinos Mavropanos his debut in defence. After Wenger was handed a gift by Sir Alex Ferguson before kick-off, United got back to business on the pitch and were ahead on 16 minutes through Pogba. Team news With Atletico Madrid in mind on Thursday, Wenger made seven changes; Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal, Ramsey, Wilshere, Welbeck, Ozil and Lacazette dropped out, while Chambers, Kolasinac, Maitland-Niles, Reiss Nelson, Mkhitaryan, Aubameyang and Mavropanos, making his debut, came in. For United, Lindelof came in for Jones in the only change following the FA Cup semi-final win over Spurs. Mkhitaryan battles for the ball with Alexis Sanchez Alexis Sanchez saw his header from point-blank range superbly diverted onto the post by Hector Bellerin, but Pogba was on hand to poke into the empty net from three yards. In what was a competitive first half, Mkhitaryan came close to equalising against his former club moments after the opener, but dragged inches wide of the far post from 20 yards after Ainsley Maitland-Niles' backheel. But after Romelu Lukaku was taken off injured after the break, Mkhitaryan made it second-time lucky, striking through the legs of Victor Lindelof and into the bottom corner from 20 yards. At the end of an uneventful second half, United thought they had won it when sub Marcus Rashford deflected the ball home from close range after Fellaini's header had ricocheted off the post, but he was rightly flagged offside. United did win it moments later through Fellaini, who rose highest in the area to meet Young's fine cross and loop a header into the far corner beyond the grasp of David Ospina. Romelu Lukaku was brought off injured early in the second half The managers Jose Mourinho: \"If it was a draw it wouldn't be unfair. They did a good game. No pressure for them, they defended well and of course we were the team that tried to win and had a few more chances. We were a bit lucky when we scored in the last couple of minutes, but were stronger in the last 20.\" Arsene Wenger: \"Overall the team performance was very positive for such a young team and of course they are very disappointed in the dressing room because they gave everything. You could see in the last 20 minutes some of them are not used to that pace and intensity. It's difficult to find a bad performance in the team, but we had a bad result.\" Man of the match - Ainsley Maitland-Niles There were a handful of positives for Arsenal to take away from Old Trafford, in particular Maitland-Niles' role in midfield. He won possession five times, and covered the second-most ground in the Arsenal side, completing 36 of his 39 passes. The 20-year-old referenced how Wenger had been like a father figure to him, and Arsenal will be hoping the Englishman pushes on under the new boss in the coming seasons. England World Cup watch Ashley Young impressed at left-back for United, setting up the winner for Fellaini with a trademark delivery from deep, while Chris Smalling was nothing more than solid. Elsewhere for the hosts, Jesse Lingard was largely ineffective before being substituted after the hour mark. Danny Welbeck started on the bench for Arsenal but came on for 25 minutes, and there was a nod to future major tournaments as young English midfielder Ainsley Maitland-Niles picked up the man-of-the-match award. Opta stats Manchester United completed a Premier League double over the Gunners for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign. Arsenal have lost six consecutive away league matches in the top-flight for the first time since January 1966, when they lost seven in a row. The Gunners are the only side in the top four tiers of English football yet to win a single point in an away league game in 2018 (P6 W0 D0 L6). Arsene Wenger lost his final match at Old Trafford as Arsenal boss - other than the Emirates and Highbury, he lost more matches at Old Trafford in all competitions as Arsenal manager than at any other ground (17).

their slim hopes of Premier League survival with a 0-0 draw at an unusually lacklustre Liverpool on Saturday lunchtime. Despite picking a strong side that included Mohamed Salah, Jurgen Klopp's men seemed to have one eye on their midweek Champions League trip to Roma as they mustered just two shots on target at Anfield. Klopp's men had averaged a goal every 39 minutes at home this season but could only really point to a glaring one-on-one miss from Salah and a disallowed Danny Ings strike as clear-cut chances. The result takes Stoke to within three points of safety, although Swansea - who host Chelsea in the late game on Saturday - have two games in hand. Stoke will only be able to reach a points total (36) that has - at best - guaranteed survival 50 per cent of the time over the past 10 Premier League seasons. Player Ratings Liverpool: Karius (6), Alexander-Arnold (6), Van Dijk (6), Klavan (6), Gomez (6), Moreno (6), Henderson (6), Wijnaldum (7), Firmino (6), Salah (5), Ings (6). Subs: Clyne (6), Milner (6) Stoke: Butland (6), Bauer (7), Pieters (6), Zouma (8), Shawcross (7), Martins Indi (6), Ndiaye (7), Allen (6), Shaqiri (5), Diouf (5), Crouch (6) Subs: Sobhi (6), Fletcher (6) Man of the match: Kurt Zouma Liverpool remain the only unbeaten side at home this season in England's top four tiers and if they avoid defeat against Brighton at Anfield in their final game, then it would be only the second time in 30 seasons that the Reds have gone an entire league season unbeaten at home. There was a real collectors' item for Liverpool fans in the opening minutes as Salah raced through, one-on-one with Jack Butland, but lifted an effort wide of the post when he looked certain to score. Mohamed Salah spurned a glorious chance to put Liverpool ahead inside 10 minutes Salah then turned provider for Trent Alexander-Arnold, who only had Butland to beat from 10 yards but could not turn the ball home. Team news Sadio Mane had a slight injury so didn’t make the squad while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was out due to a knee injury. Andrew Robertson and James Milner dropped to the bench while Joe Gomez, Ragnar Klavan, Danny Ings and Georginio Wijnaldum came into the side. The only change for Stoke saw Kurt Zouma come in for former Liverpool defender Glen Johnson. Stoke countered and almost broke the deadlock as a ball played right across the face of goal only just evaded a finishing touch from Mame Biram Diouf or Peter Crouch. Meanwhile, Ings had the ball in the net on the stroke of half-time but it was ruled out for offside. Liverpool maintained their stranglehold of possession in the second period but Stoke - with Darren Fletcher added to their midfield, replacing Crouch - were well organised and rarely troubled. For a team that have scored 128 goals across all competitions this season, Liverpool looked short on ideas, although they had a good shout for a handball inside the area by Erik Pieters, which was turned down. Jurgen Klopp on the Anfield touchline The visitors saw out the final stages very comfortably. Stoke, who could have nicked it late on through Ryan Shawcross, have still never won a top-tier fixture away at Liverpool in 55 attempts (D12 L43) but this could be a season-saving result. Opta stats Liverpool failed to score at Anfield in the league for the first time in nine games (since a 0-0 draw v West Brom in December), after scoring 27 in total in the eight before that. The Reds mustered 20 shots without finding the back of the net, their biggest haul without scoring at Anfield in the league since April 2014 (26 v Chelsea). Paul Lambert has taken charge of more Premier League games at Anfield without ever losing than any other manager in the competition (5 - W2 D3). Salah mustered seven shots in the game (none on target), the most he has had without scoring in a single game for Liverpool in all competitions. England World Cup watch Trent Alexander-Arnold started positively in a new role for Liverpool on the right of midfield. However, after suffering a dead leg his influence faded and he was replaced after 65 minutes. Jordan Henderson managed to complete the game. after an injury scare in the first half when he twisted his ankle. Joe Gomez was solid enough in defence but failed to make much of an impact going forward down the right side. The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"I take the point. It's an important point, we need another three and we have two games to get them in. If football is fair then we will take these three points. It was an acceptable performance, we can play much better, but we had to make a few changes.\" 5:30 Jurgen Klopp said he was satisfied with what he described as a very important point Jurgen Klopp said he was satisfied with what he described as a very important point Paul Lambert: \"We have to fight and we have a chance. Everybody has written off us but we have a chance. It won't be for the faint-hearted. \"The players have given me absolutely everything since I walked in the door, if the team had played like that throughout the season there is no way Stoke would be in this position and I certainly wouldn't be here.\" 2:53 Paul Lambert said Stoke were outstanding Paul Lambert said Stoke were outstanding Man of the match - Kurt Zouma \"We deserved the draw,\" said the Stoke centre-back, whose individual performance stood out in a solid defensive showing from the visitors. Zouma kept Roberto Firmino and Salah very quiet with some strong tackling and was there to clear danger in the final stages when Liverpool went a bit more direct. The on-loan Chelsea man will have plenty of suitors this summer if the west Londoners allow him to leave. What's next?

The hosts' best chance came in the first half when Kevin Long's point-blank shot was blocked on the line by Shane Duffy. Brighton struggled to create any clear-cut chances, with Bruno coming closest for Chris Hughton's side in the 18th minute, but neither team could break the deadlock in a lacklustre second half. A point for both sides means Burnley have virtually secured European qualification in seventh due to eighth-placed Everton's inferior goal difference. Brighton, meanwhile, are now five points clear of the relegation zone in 14th.

Five minutes later and Burnley spurned the half's greatest opportunity to take the lead. Johann Gudmundsson's dangerous free-kick was stabbed towards goal by Ashley Barnes, but goalkeeper Mat Ryan got down to block before he quickly pushed the ball away. Burnley's Long latched onto James Tarkowski's clever back-heel on the rebound, but Duffy made a goal-saving block to deny the hosts the game's opener. Protests of a Duffy handball were waved away by referee Roger East. Team news Burnley manager Sean Dyche named an unchanged side. For Brighton, Glenn Murray dropped to the bench and Leonardo Ulloa took his place up top. Brighton began the second half with more attacking impetus. In the 48th minute, Jack Stephens engineered a chance outside the box, but Pope comfortably got down low to make the necessary stop. Sean Dyche brought on Sam Vokes for Chris Wood in the 66th minute, who looked to be carrying a knock, and the Wales international came close to scoring with his first touch. However, he couldn't direct his ricocheted effort from a Gudmundsson set-piece beyond Ryan. Both teams cancelled each other out defensively and the match fizzled out with a goalless draw looking likely to benefit the two parties. Opta stats Courtesy of this goalless draw, Burnley ended a run of eight top-flight home games without a clean sheet. Brighton have bagged a league-low nine away goals in the Premier League this season. Brighton have lost on just one of their last eight league visits to Turf Moor (W2 D5). Only against Tottenham (8 games), has Sean Dyche faced an opponent more often in all competitions as Burnley manager than Brighton (7) without enjoying a single victory. Brighton have been involved in a joint-league-high five goalless draws in the Premier League this season, level with Southampton. A league-high 17 of Burnley's Premier League games this season have been goalless at half-time, with Brighton, Huddersfield and West Brom next (all on 15). The managers 3:01 Sean Dyche felt there was a lot of desire to try and beat Brighton but his Burnley side lacked the quality they've shown over the season Sean Dyche felt there was a lot of desire to try and beat Brighton but his Burnley side lacked the quality they've shown over the season Sean Dyche: It was a game of huff and puff. Lacking quality today from both sides, I thought, but a lot of endeavour, good habits and doing the basics well. It's hard to questions these lads. We've come a long way this season so the odd dip in form or performance and you still come out with a point, that's probably a good measure actually of how far we've come. 3:15 Chris Hughton says he felt his Brighton side were the better team as the Seagulls picked up a point away at Burnley Chris Hughton says he felt his Brighton side were the better team as the Seagulls picked up a point away at Burnley Chris Hughton: A tough game for sure and you expect nothing less when you come here - particularly with the form they're in and the season they've had. I thought we were the better side today, that looked more likely to score. They're very aggressive in their 4-4-2, and in their front lines, but I thought we had a defence that defended very well but I thought we had the better of the moments. England World Cup watch It was a successful afternoon for Burnley's England internationals involved. Nick Pope and James Tarkowski both kept the Brighton attack at bay. Brighton's Glenn Murray may not have done much to impress England boss Gareth Southgate. He struggled to make a significant impact off the bench and picked up a yellow card. Man of the Match - Mathew Ryan Ryan was tested a few times by the Burnley attack and pulled off an excellent stop to deny Barnes in the first half. He showed good composure to come and deal with a number of crosses into the box, and strongly commanded his area as Brighton held on for the clean sheet. What's next?

giant stride towards Premier League survival with an emphatic 5-0 victory against 10-man Leicester at Selhurst Park. First-half goals from Wilfried Zaha (17) and James McArthur (38) put Roy Hodgson's side in firm control at the break, and their position was further strengthened when Marc Albrighton was shown a straight red card (56). Late strikes from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Patrick van Aanholt (84) and Christian Benteke (90) rounded off a brilliant afternoon for Palace, who secured their biggest win in the Premier League era. Victory sees Palace, who looked destined for relegation after losing their opening seven matches of the season, move up to 38 points, six points clear of the relegation zone with only Southampton capable of catching them, while Leicester stay in ninth position. James McArthur celebrates with teammates after making it 2-0 Both sides started brightly and it was a tale of two goalline clearances in the opening stages as Kelechi Iheanacho blocked James Tomkins' header before Joel Ward brilliantly kept out Jamie Vardy's goal-bound effort. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (7), Ward (7), Tomkins (7), Sakho (7), Van Aanholt (7), Townsend (8), Cabaye (7), Milivojevic (7), McArthur (8), Loftus-Cheek (8), Zaha (9). Subs: Schlupp (6), Chung-yong Lee (6), Benteke (7). Leicester: Hamer (6), Albrighton (5), Morgan (6), Maguire (6), Chilwell (6), Mahrez (6), Choudhury (5), Ndidi (6), Gray (6), Iheanacho (5), Vardy (6). Subs: Silva (6), Diabate (6), Dragovi(6). Man of the match: Wilfried Zaha Palace started to take control and Zaha was at the heart of it. Quick passing from Loftus-Cheek, Yohan Cabaye and then McArthur put the Ivory Coast forward in space, and he made no mistake, opening his body before burying a right-footed shot into the top corner. Zaha almost doubled the advantage in the 29th minute but Ben Hamer, filling in for the injured Kasper Schmeichel, got down brilliantly to his left to palm the ball away from safety. The second eventually came in the 38th minute and it was no more than Palace deserved. Zaha was involved again, this time teeing up McArthur, who produced a brilliant turn and shot to pick out the far corner. James McArthur celebrates with teammates after making it 2-0 Claude Puel reacted by bringing on Adrien Silva and Fousseni Diabate at the break but the visitors' challenge was well and truly ended when Albrighton was given his marching orders after dragging down Zaha as the last man. The hosts put gloss on the result in the final 10 minutes, scoring three more goals to round off a jubilant afternoon for the Palace fans. The result was put beyond any doubt in the 81st minute when Loftus-Cheek rounded Hamer for a tap-in after being played in behind Leicester's defence by Mamadou Sakho. Team news Crystal Palace were unchanged from the side that drew 0-0 at Watford last weekend. Meanwhile, Leicester made two changes form their 0-0 draw with Southampton with Wes Morgan and Hamza Choudhury starting in place of Aleksandar Dragovic and Adrien Silva. Three minutes later, Zaha's through-ball released substitute Jeffrey Schlupp. His shot as blocked by the onrushing Hamer but the rebound fell for Van Aanholt, who curled into the bottom right corner with his weaker right foot. Benteke came off the bench and was brought down in the penalty area by Harry Maguire in stoppage time. Earlier in the season, he had defied team orders, by taking and missing a late penalty instead of Luka Milivojevic, costing victory in a 2-2 draw with Bournemouth. The Belgium international was afterwards heavily criticised, but this time Milivojevic stepped aside again, allowing him to score his first goal since late January and round of a brilliant afternoon for Palace. Crystal Palace’s 5-0 success against Leicester is their biggest win in the PL era and has equalled the biggest victory in their top-division history (also beat Man Utd 5-0 in old Div 1 in December 1972) #PL pic.twitter.com/1u4zaaEiq9 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) April 28, 2018 Opta stats Crystal Palace have won two top-flight games in a season against the same opponent by a margin of at least three goals for the first time ever. Leicester shipped five goals without scoring themselves for the first time in the league since January 2004 (0-5 v Aston Villa in the top-flight). Leicester have picked up five red cards in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. The Foxes are the first side this season to see a player sent off against the same Premier League opposition both home and away. Only Chris Armstrong (23) has scored more Premier League goals for Crystal Palace than Zaha (21, level with Andrew Johnson). James McArthur has scored and assisted in a single Premier League game for only the third time in his career and the first since September 2016 (v Sunderland). Man of the Match - Wilfried Zaha Wilfried Zaha opens the scoring for Palace Zaha produced another scintillating performance to inspire Palace to back-to-back home wins for the first time since April 2017. The 25-year-old was a threat to Leicester all afternoon. He produced a brilliant finish to send his side on their way before picking out the pass to create McArthur's second. He has now has scored four goals in his last four Premier League games. He has also scored and assisted in five Premier League games with Crystal Palace, more than any other player for the club. England Watch In front of England boss Gareth Southgate, Loftus-Cheek impressed in midfield, playing 86 minutes and capping his fine display with a goal.Andros Townsend, who is an outside bet to be included in England’s World Cup squad, also put in an excellent display, playing 86 minutes and causing Leicester problems all afternoon with his pace. For Leicester’s England contingent it was an afternoon to forget, Harry Maguire and Jamie vardy both played the full 90 minutes but with their side on the back foot, struggled to make an impression.

The visitors opened the scoring six minutes before half-time thanks to Cenk Tosun's neat finish - the Turkey striker's fifth league goal since joining the club in January. Sam Allardyce's side sealed the win when Idrissa Gueye drove home a second with just 13 minutes remaining to keep Everton eighth in the table.

Despite dominating the first 45 minutes, it was Everton who went in ahead at the break after a careless moment from Rajiv Van La Parra, whose stray cross-field pass was intercepted by Theo Walcott. The former Arsenal forward broke clear over halfway, before releasing Tosun, who still had work to do before finding the bottom left-hand corner. Team news Huddersfield, who were unchanged, were missing Elias Kachunga, Danny Williams and Michael Hefele with injury, while Tom Ince was also out with a hamstring problem. Leighton Baines and Morgan Schneiderlin were available after recovering from knocks, but Dominic Calvert-Lewin was absent through injury. And despite returning to training after a knee problem, this game came too soon for Iceland forward Gylfi Sigurdsson as the visitors made one change from Monday's 1-0 win over Newcastle with Nikola Vlasic replacing Yannick Bolasie. That was the visitors' first effort on target in the game and they almost doubled their lead with their second, 12 minutes after half-time. However, after playing a neat one-two in the box with Nikola Vlasic, Seamus Coleman was unable to beat Jonas Lossl at his near post, although that miss was soon forgotten as Everton went further ahead. England watch Jordan Pickford had a relatively quiet afternoon’s work at the John Smith’s, with the England international keeping what must surely be one of his easiest clean sheets of the season. Meanwhile, left-back Leighton Baines produced another accomplished display for his side, reminding Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate that even at 33, he still has much to offer in that role after creating the visitors’ second, the 82nd Everton goal he has been involved in in the top flight. Substitute Oumar Niasse broke clear to the right-hand byline, before picking out the unmarked Leighton Baines on the edge of the area. The left-back's lovely layoff was then driven home by Gueye as Everton made it just one defeat in their last seven league encounters.

We were aggressive, we brought intensity into the game and we limited them in the first half to one shot. Unfortunately, this one shot on target was a goal and we were not able to use our half chances, which we had. Second half was not as good as the first half, but in the end we got beaten by quality, something that we have to accept. 2:39 David Wagner says his side have to accept they were beaten by quality and will move on quickly to their next match David Wagner says his side have to accept they were beaten by quality and will move on quickly to their next match Sam Allardyce: I can't honestly produce anymore than I'm doing. I'm sorry if some fans don't like it, but we're trying as hard as we possibly can, both myself, the staff and the players. What can I say when you've got 14 points out of seven games when we were in a position of difficulty when I arrived. I can only say it's just one of those things and if we keep winning hopefully they might change it to love. 2:47 Sam Allardyce was delighted with his Everton's 2-0 victory away at Huddersfield as the Toffees continue their fine form Sam Allardyce was delighted with his Everton's 2-0 victory away at Huddersfield as the Toffees continue their fine form Pundit - Matt Le Tissier Huddersfield barely threatened and I do not remember Jordan Pickford having to make any saves of note in the whole 90 minutes.

Matt Phillips' 29th-minute strike proved enough to overcome a lacklustre Newcastle outfit as Darren Moore extended his unbeaten run as Baggies caretaker to four games. Newcastle struck the post and saw Ben Foster pull off a stunning save to keep a Dwight Gayle header out in a frustrating performance, although they will take comfort from the fact their top-flight status is secure.

From there on, though, the Baggies steadily grabbed the initiative, spurning two chances before finally breaking the deadlock as Jake Livermore's lofted pass released Phillips and he clinically fired past Martin Dubravka. Matt Phillips celebrates scoring for West Bromwich Albion during at St. James Park Newcastle so nearly found an immediate response as Kenedy played a neat one-two with Ayoze Perez to get in behind the West Brom defence, but his low, toe poke clipped the outside of the post on 34 minutes. Newcastle pushed hard for an equaliser before the break but Mohamed Diame saw his attempt to convert a Florian Lejeune knockdown deflect behind for a corner from which a wonder save from Foster clawed Gayle's goal-bound header away from goal. Team news Rafa Benitez made one change to the Newcastle side after Monday’s defeat at Everton as Dwight Gayle replaced Islam Slimani up front. Darren Moore named an unchanged West Brom side after their dramatic 2-2 draw Liverpool. Newcastle returned with much greater intensity but continued to look vulnerable at the back with Rodriguez mis-hitting a 53rd-minute attempt from Phillips' knockdown and Rondon slicing wastefully wide from Livermore's pass eight minutes later. Chris Brunt whistled a long-range effort just wide with 21 minutes remaining, but the Magpies continued to pile forward in search of an equaliser as substitute Joselu headed wide on 85 minutes. 2 - Darren Moore has won more Premier League matches in four games in charge at West Bromwich Albion than Alan Pardew did in 18 for the Baggies. Hope. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 28, 2018 As their hopes of a comeback faded, frustration appeared to get the better of Newcastle, with Islam Slimani kicking out at defender Craig Dawson in an ugly incident which could yield more severe consequences. Opta stats In just four games, Darren Moore (W2 D2 L0) has won more Premier League games for West Brom than Alan Pardew (W1 D5 L12), and as many as Tony Pulis (W2 D4 L6) did for the Baggies this season. West Brom kept their first league clean sheet at St James' Park since September 1977, ending a run of 15 straight games in which they'd conceded at the ground. Newcastle have lost back-to-back league games for the first time since a run of four in December. This was Rafael Benitez's first Premier League defeat against West Brom as manager (W7 D1 L1), meaning Stoke are now the side he's faced the most without defeat in the competition (7 games). Matt Phillips' goal was his first in 22 games in all competitions for West Brom, since netting against Manchester City in October. There were 15 shots in total in the second half in this game (10 for Newcastle, 5 West Brom), but none were on target. England watch Jake Livermore was quick and alert to lay on the winning goal for Phillips, and he could have had another assist had Salomon Rondon converted another chance in the second half. However, you could argue Livermore’s selfless defensive performance further strengthened his claim to be on the plane to Russia. It proved to be a frustrating afternoon for Jonjo Shelvey as his bid to convince Gareth Southgate to include him in his squad was dampened by his side’s lethargic display. The managers Rafa Benitez: \"After the great season we have done, it's a pity to see this kind of game. We made too many mistakes, gave the ball away easily, didn't understand how to attack a team that defended well and didn't stop the counter attacks. Many things we have been doing well this season went wrong today.\" 1:30 Rafa Benitez blamed his side's inability to do the right things for their defeat to West Brom at St James' Park. Rafa Benitez blamed his side's inability to do the right things for their defeat to West Brom at St James' Park.

Darren Moore says he was delighted with his players' brilliant performances as the Baggies secured a 1-0 victory away at Newcastle. Man of the Match - Matt Phillips The Scotland international's energetic performance proved to be a thorn in Newcastle's side all afternoon. Often the instigator of pressure-relieving counter-attacks, Phillips showed great composure to take his only clear chance of the contest, securing an unlikely victory which left the Baggies with the slightest of survival chances.

Bournemouth at St Mary's to move them to within a point of Premier League safety. Southampton took the lead in the 25th minute after a swift counter, with Tadic finishing off the move in style to net his fifth league goal of the season, before Josh King slammed the ball into the roof of the net to level on the stroke of half-time. However, that equaliser failed to swing the momentum in Bournemouth's favour, and Tadic soon had the hosts back in front, brilliantly firing into the bottom corner with the outside of his boot in the 54th minute. Southampton were forced to hang on in stoppage time, with Alex McCarthy making some crucial saves in the home goal, but they saw out a vital first win in nine league games to move them to within a point of Swansea in 17th. Bournemouth drop to 12th, six clear of the bottom three. Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (8), Cedric (7), Yoshida (7), Hoedt (8), Bertrand (6), Romeu (6), Lemina (8), Bednarek (6), Tadic (9), Austin (7), Redmond (6). Subs: Long (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Hojbjerg (N/A) Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Francis (6), Cook (5) Ake (6), Gosling (6), Daniels (6), Cook (6), Mousset (6), Fraser (7), Wilson (5), King (6). Subs: Surman (6), Defoe (6), Ibe (6) Man of the match: Dusan Tadic After a cagey opening, Saints started to commit more bodies forward, and almost took the lead 14 minutes in, but Nathan Redmond and then Oriol Romeu saw their strikes blocked in the box. However, the nervous St Mary's masses did not have to wait long for that opener as Tadic struck. Bournemouth had the corner, Saints countered, Mario Lemina's pace took him clear, Saints had two on one, Lemina delayed and delayed, before threading the perfect pass into Tadic, who slotted into the bottom corner. Lemina then saw a fine effort well saved by Asmir Begovic in the away goal, before McCarthy brilliantly denied Nathan Ake down the other end. One lapse in concentration, however, saw the hosts concede at a crucial moment, as King arrived unchallenged at the back post to fire home. Team news Mark Hughes made just one change to the Southampton team beaten by Chelsea in last week’s FA Cup semi-final with Nathan Redmond replacing Shane Long in attack. As expected, Sofiane Boufal was not in the squad after falling out with Hughes this week. Just the one change for the visitors, too, with Lys Mousset coming in for Jordon Ibe. After the break, Saints maintained their attacking impetus and soon retook the lead. Steve Cook tried to bring the ball down on his chest, Tadic nipped in, strode clear of Cook, had options either side, but used the runs as decoys, creating space for him to brilliantly steer the ball into the net with the outside of his boot. Southampton then missed two glorious chances to put the game to bed through substitute Shane Long and Redmond, before McCarthy stepped up when called upon late in the day. Firstly, he did superbly to stick out a leg to deny Jermain Defoe, before saving his best for last, clawing out Ryan Fraser's strike - virtually the last kick of the game - to ensure Saints' hopes of preserving their Premier League status were given a huge boost. Tadic celebrates with Nathan Redmond and Oriol Romeu after putting Southampton back in front at St Mary's Opta stats Bournemouth have now failed to win any of their 14 trips to Southampton in all competitions (D5 L9); against no other side have they played more away matches without winning any of them in their history (also 14 v Burnley). This was Southampton's first home league win since they beat Everton 4-1 in November. They had failed to win any of their nine such games since then prior to today (D5 L4). The Saints have scored 2+ goals in both of their home league games under Mark Hughes, as many times as they managed in their last 14 such matches at St. Mary's under Mauricio Pellegrino. The Cherries have now conceded at least 60 goals in all three of their seasons in the Premier League. Only two other sides have conceded 60+ goals in three or more successive seasons in which all were in the Premier League - Southampton (1992-93 to 1994-95) and Wigan Athletic (2009-10 to 2012-13). No Southampton player has scored more goals in all competitions this season than Dusan Tadic (seven, level with Charlie Austin). Tadic, who scored his first Premier League brace since April 2016 against Aston Villa, became only the third Serbian player to score 20+ Premier League goals, after Savo Milosevic (29) and Branislav Ivanovic (22). The managers Mark Hughes: \"We need to have the teams above us looking over their shoulders, and this result does that for us. We need to pressure the ones above us too. They know we have quality here. Now we just need to keep the momentum from this huge result. If we carrying on playing like we did today, we will go close.\" Eddie Howe: \"The goals we conceded were big mistakes and we got punished for them. I am disappointed with how we played. It was a game that we could have won if we had played like we can do, but we didn't. We were disappointed with our attacking player in both halves.\" England watch Ryan Bertrand will count his lucky stars that his poor miss in the second half did not prove costly. Both he and Redmond actually were rather quiet afternoons down the left flank, with Tadic hogging the limelight on the right. Lewis Cook had one speculative effort for Bournemouth, but otherwise had little effect on the result. Jan Bednarek in pursuit of Joshua King at St Mary's Man of the match - Dusan Tadic Lemina deserves a mention for his breathless efforts, but Tadic's two expertly-taken goals win him the award. He has gone missing on occasion this season, but against Bournemouth he saved his best football for when it really mattered. As well as his goals, Tadic provided five key passes in the match, three more than anyone else on the pitch. What's next? Southampton face a trip to Merseyside next to take on Everton, while Bournemouth welcome Swansea to the south coast."}, {"date": "28/04/2018", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20900,

top-four chances, while leaving the Swans one point above the Premier League relegation zone. It took just four minutes for Chelsea to take the lead on Saturday, with Fabregas' superb curling effort his 50th Premier League goal. While the remainder of the first half lacked chances, Swansea were improved in the second period and had a number of chances to equalise. After Southampton beat Bournemouth earlier in the day, Carlos Carvalhal's side are now just one point ahead of the drop zone in 17th, while Chelsea have closed the gap on fourth-placed Tottenham to two points. Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (7), Naughton (6), Van Der Hoorn (6), Mawson (7), Olsson (7), Roberts (7), Ki (6), Clucas (6), King (6), J Ayew (6), A Ayew (7).

Man of the match: Cesc Fabregas. Chelsea made a fast start as N'Golo Kante capitalised on Andy King's poor control to unleash Eden Hazard, who shook off the challenge of Sung-Yueng Ki before setting up Fabregas to score. The visitors almost doubled their advantage in the 22nd minute as Olivier Giroud's header was sent agonisingly over the crossbar by Alfie Mawson, with the ball clipping the woodwork on the way through. Team news Swansea made two changes with Sam Clucas and Connor Roberts coming in for Tom Carroll and Federico Fernandez. Chelsea also made two changes with Thibaut Courtois and Tiemoue Bakayoko replacing Willy Caballero and Willian. The remainder of the opening period saw few chances, but Swansea went close seven minutes into the second half as Andre Ayew's header from a Martin Olsson cross was marshalled wide by Antonio Rudiger. Chelsea went close to doubling their lead once more in the 74th minute, as Fabregas picked out Victor Moses at the near post but the wing-back was unable to convert as the ball squeezed wide of the post. 50 - Cesc Fabregas has scored his 50th Premier League goal, becoming the third Spanish player to do so in the competition (after Fernando Torres and Diego Costa). Milestone. pic.twitter.com/P3FrLhaW6Y — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 28, 2018 Swansea had their best chances to equalise in the final 15 minutes, with Andre Ayew hammering a shot wide before Kyle Naughton fired straight into the hands of Thibaut Courtois. Substitute Tom Carroll could have snatched a point for Swansea in the 89th minute with a powerful volley from just inside the area, but again it ran wide for the hosts as they suffered a second successive loss in the Premier League for the first time under Carvalhal. England Watch Alfie Mawson could have cost Swansea with an own goal, but despite the nervy moment, he put in a solid performance for the remainder of the game. Gary Cahill also did well at the other end, helping Chelsea to keep a clean sheet and producing some vital blocks when needed. Opta stats Antonio Conte has won 50 of his 73 Premier League games in charge - only Jose Mourinho (63) and Pep Guardiola (69) reached 50 wins as manager in the competition in fewer games. Swansea have failed to score in 16 different Premier League games this season; in no campaign have they failed to score in more in the competition (also 16 in 2012-13). Chelsea have won three consecutive away league games for the first time since September (a run of five). Olivier Giroud hasn't scored in any of his last six Premier League starts, with his last six goals in the competition all coming as a sub. Man of the match - Cesc Fabregas Cesc Fabregas score the opening goal at the Liberty Stadium It was a moment of quality from Fabregas that decided a fairly quiet encounter at the Liberty Stadium, with his lovely curling effort bringing up his 50th Premier League goal - the third Spanish player to reach the milestone in the competition after former Blues Fernando Torres (85) and Diego Costa (52). He also became only the fourth player to scored 50+ goals and register 100+ assists in the Premier League, and first non-British player to do so after Ryan Giggs, Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard, showing how he continues to shine in England's top flight.

strike from Theo Walcott was enough for Everton to beat Newcastle 1-0 in the Premier League on Monday and send the Toffees into eighth place. In a game of few chances at Goodison Park, Walcott converted Wayne Rooney's cross in the 51st minute to give Everton their first win in four games. Rafa Benitez was not able to fashion a victory in his 100th game as Newcastle manager, with Dwight Gayle - who started the game on the bench - going closest in the 64th minute for the visitors. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (7), Jagielka (7), Keane (7), Baines (7), Gueye (6), Schneiderlin (6), Walcott (7), Rooney (6), Bolasie (6), Tosun (6). Subs used: Davies (6), Calvert-Lewin (6), Niasse (n/a). Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Yedlin (6), Lascelles (6), Lejeune (6), Dummett (6), Shelvey (6), Diame (7), Perez (7), Ritchie (6), Kenedy (6), Slimani (5). Subs used: Gayle (7), Murphy (5), Merino (n/a). Man of the match: Theo Walcott. The win sees Everton leapfrog Leicester into eighth spot, although they are eight points behind seventh-placed Burnley, while Newcastle remain 10th. Everton could have nabbed an early goal inside three minutes when Walcott darted into the box before his intended pass to Rooney was poorly intercepted, but Cenk Tosun was unable to capitalise on the loose ball as his effort flashed across the face of goal. Team news Everton named an unchanged side from their previous draw with Swansea. Newcastle made one change with Islam Slimani handed his first Magpies start, coming in for Dwight Gayle. Everton went close for a second time 30 minutes later. Newcastle failed to clear a corner, allowing Rooney to whip the ball into the area which was headed towards the back post by Michael Keane. His effort found Phil Jagielka, but he could only put his stretching volley over the crossbar from close range. But Everton did find the breakthrough six minutes into the second half, as Yannick Bolasie pumped a ball into the area from the right to pick out Walcott at the back post. The former Arsenal forward then found himself a pocket of space before lifting the ball over goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and into the roof of the net. Wayne Rooney takes on Jonjo Shelvey in the first half Newcastle could have scored an equaliser in the 64th minute in one of their rare chances in the game. Jonjo Shelvey's corner met the head of Jamaal Lascelles, who directed the ball towards the back post for substitute Gayle, but the striker could not get the right connection as his volley went over the bar from inside the six-yard box. The visitors saw the better of the ball in the closing stages as they looked to snatch a point, and they nearly succeeded in the last minute of injury time, but Jacob Murphy's cross was headed behind strongly by Seamus Coleman as the Magpies' four-match winning streak came to an end. England Watch Jordan Pickford had a good game for Everton and was solid when called upon. He was aided by Michael Keane, with a generally good display in defence although he was tested by Dwight Gayle later in the game. Man of the Match Theo Walcott scored the only goal to increase his chances of being on the plane, although Jonjo Shelvey took time to grow into the game with better passing from the midfielder in the closing stages. Opta stats Everton have won five consecutive top-flight games against Newcastle for the first time since January 1920. This is the first time that Everton have kept five consecutive clean sheets against a single opponent in the Premier League. Newcastle have won just one of their last 14 Premier League trips to Goodison Park (D3 L10). Theo Walcott has been directly involved in 10 goals in his last nine Premier League games against Newcastle (5 goals, 5 assists) The managers 3:09 Sam Allardyce believes it was a well deserved win over Newcastle and has called on Everton fans to get behind him as he looks to win over those who are unhappy with his style of play. Sam Allardyce believes it was a well deserved win over Newcastle and has called on Everton fans to get behind him as he looks to win over those who are unhappy with his style of play. Sam Allardyce (Everton): \"We completely dominated the game, out-passed the opposition in their half. We found it very difficult to break them down because they had all 10players behind the ball in their own half and you have to be patient. We were patient and got the winner. Some of our passing went astray but in fairness you can't really blame me for that can you? I don't pass the ball out there, the lads do.\" Rafa Benitez (Newcastle): \"We didn't take our chances and that is the difference when you have Walcott or Rooney or players on these wages that can make a difference. We did really well to be here to play against this team. To expect that we have to beat them easily is impossible. They have very good players and they can make the difference. We battled and we fought until the end so we had the chance to draw, but we lost against a good team and that's it.\" 1:50 Rafa Benitez was left frustrated by his side's inability to convert their chances in their defeat to Everton. Rafa Benitez was left frustrated by his side's inability to convert their chances in their defeat to Everton. Man of the Match - Theo Walcott Theo Walcott opened the scoring for Everton It was a well taken goal from Walcott that sees him take the man-of-the-match plaudits, and when Everton were on the attack, he was mostly involved as he played off the left wing in the second half as well as making the most sprints in the game (80). His strike was his fifth Premier League goal against Newcastle, and he has only scored more against West Ham (six). His strike was the third goal he has scored since joining the club in January. After the game, Walcott said: \"It was a much-needed three points after a disappointing run of results.\" Everton complete home & away 1-0 wins against Newcastle & have now won the last 5 meetings without conceding Champions Man City are the only other team to win both PL games v Newcastle so far this season pic.twitter.com/xQm3VZz7Pn — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) April 23, 2018 What's next?

Arsenal 4-1 West Ham The countdown to Arsene Wenger's Arsenal exit started with an emphatic victory as West Ham were beaten 4-1 on Super Sunday. Emotions were running high at the Emirates Stadium following Friday's shock announcement that the Arsenal boss was to end his 22-year reign, but goals from Nacho Monreal (51), Aaron Ramsey (82) and an Alexandre Lacazette double (85, 89) ensured victory, despite a 64th-minute equaliser from Marko Arnautovic. The late surge of goals ensured Arsenal moved four points clear of seventh-place Burnley as they warmed up for Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Atletico Madrid in style. The result leaves West Ham in 15th, six points above the relegation with four games to play and still with work to do to avoid the drop this season. Player ratings Arsenal: Ospina (6), Bellerin (6), Mustafi (6), Koscielny (7), Monreal (7), Xhaka (7), Elneny (7), Iwobi (6), Ramsey (7), Welbeck (6), Lacazette (7).

Subs: Lanzini (7), Hernandez (6), Carroll (n/a) Man of the match: Alexandre Lacazette Wenger spoke before the game of his hope that the week's events would stir positive emotions in his players, but the first half was subdued with the Emirates Stadium once again below full capacity. Perhaps inspired by Wenger's half-time words, Monreal broke the deadlock six minutes into the second period, running onto a Granit Xhaka corner and volleying left-footed past Joe Hart from near the penalty spot. Nacho Monreal scores Arsenal's first goal of the game against West Ham West Ham struck back 13 minutes later when David Ospina punched away Arthur Masuaku's cross and the ball was eventually worked to substitute Manuel Lanzini to slip in Arnautovic and he rifled a brilliant shot across the goalkeeper and into the far corner. West Ham goalkeeper Hart made superb saves to deny Xhaka and Danny Welbeck, but was cruelly beaten by Ramsey eight minutes from time when Declan Rice inexplicably ducked out of the way of the Welshman's cross and the ball drifted into the net. Team news Arsene Wenger made five Arsenal changes following last week’s defeat at Newcastle with starts for David Ospina, Hector Bellerin, Laurent Koscielny, Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck. Meanwhile, David Moyes named the same West Ham XI which grabbed a late 1-1 draw with Stoke on Monday. Three minutes later, Lacazette scored Arsenal's third when he finished off a flowing Arsenal move with a fierce drive, which deflected off Aaron Cresswell and across Hart. Lacazette added gloss to the result in the final minute when he received a pass from Ramsey and powered home his second of the game to spark raucous chants of 'one Arsene Wenger' from the victorious home supporters. West Ham United's Marko Arnautovic (left) and Arsenal's Shkodran Mustafi (right) battle for the ball Opta stats Arsenal have won six consecutive home matches in all competitions, netting at least three goals in each victory (20 goals in total). Arsene Wenger has beaten David Moyes in 22 matches in all competitions - more than he has beaten another manager during his time as Arsenal boss. Moyes is winless in all 18 of his away matches against Arsenal in all competitions (D4 L14). The last three occasions that West Ham have conceded four second half goals in a Premier League game have been against Arsenal (January 2013, December 2016 and today). Marko Arnautovic has had a hand in 14 goals in his last 16 Premier League appearances (10 goals, 4 assists). England World Cup Watch Jack Wilshere sat the game out for Arsenal, while Danny Welbeck was full of running for the 88 minutes he was on the pitch, though was consistently wasteful in front of goal. Despite conceding four goals, Joe Hart enhanced his chances of forcing his way into Gareth Southgate’s starting XI as his overall display was excellent. He made two brilliant saves with the scoreline at 1-1, denying both Granit Xhaka and Welbeck and was let down by his defenders for the first two goals which he was helpless to prevent. Man of the Match - Alexandre Lacazette Arsenal's striker picked up the Man of the Match award after netting the two late goals which took the game beyond West Ham and 80% of his strikes for Arsenal this season in all competitions have come at the Emirates. The Frenchman was a consistent focal point for the home team throughout the game and profited when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang emerged from the bench to give him additional support in attack. The managers 3:45 After Arsenal's 4-1 win over West Ham Arsene Wenger would not disclose whether he would take another coaching job once he leaves the club. After Arsenal's 4-1 win over West Ham Arsene Wenger would not disclose whether he would take another coaching job once he leaves the club. Arsene Wenger (Arsenal): \"The second goal was key. At 1-1 you could see we may have been wobbling but the second goal killed them. We had a spell in the second half when we came out when we should have scored two or three goals. So when they came back to 1-1 it was interesting to see how we responded.\" David Moyes (West Ham): \"The young centre-half [Declan Rice] should head the ball away and it wouldn't have even got to 2-1, it was that easy. Why he would duck in the box I've got no idea. But look, we've all been young players going into games and we're always going to make mistakes. The most important thing is you learn from your mistakes, you don't do it again and you understand how important it is.\" 2:03 David Moyes was critical of Declan Rice's role in Arsenal's second goal as West Ham succumbed to Arsenal 4-1 at the Emirates. David Moyes was critical of Declan Rice's role in Arsenal's second goal as West Ham succumbed to Arsenal 4-1 at the Emirates. The pundit - Thierry Henry \"Arsenal were much better at the end of the game. For an hour you didn't know where the game would go. Arnautovic scored a well-deserved goal, he played really well. It was no more than West Ham deserved after their first-half performance. Arsenal went 2-1 up in the second half and from there on there could have been a fifth or a sixth goal had there been a couple more minutes. It looks great in the end for Arsenal and it's a good result for the boss, it creates a gap over Burnley.\" What's next?

Burnley remain seventh, but now four points behind Arsenal. Stoke took the lead with the first chance of the game as Ndiaye saw his 20-yard effort deflect off the boot of Kevin Long and fall past Nick Pope following unselfish work from Mame Biram Diouf on the edge of the box. Gudmundsson forced a good save out of Butland with a 25-yard free-kick, but Stoke should have gone into the half 2-0 up as Diouf received Moritz Bauer's cross in space inside the box, but the forward decided to attempt a touch rather than shoot, seeing the ball squirm under his foot. Team news Paul Lambert made just one change, replacing Sobhi with Crouch up front, while Burnley were unchanged following the midweek defeat by Chelsea. James Tarkowski nearly equalised, but saw his header from a corner well saved by Butland, but it was 1-1 shortly after as Barnes turned home off his knee after Butland had again saved Tarkowski's header from close range. There was a late flurry of chances at both ends, with a draw not suiting Stoke; substitute Ireland curled a beauty off the post from 20 yards, while at the other end Gudmundsson saw efforts saved by Butland and curl past the far post. If Southampton do not win the FA Cup, seventh place would see Burnley compete in Europe for the first time since the 1960s at the Europa League second qualifying round, while Stoke look odds-on to be playing second-tier football next season. England World Cup watch In the battle of the England goalkeepers, both Jack Butland and Nick Pope put in strong performances, with the Stoke stopper picking up man of the match. Both looked confident with aerial balls, and were alert on all occasions to rush out of their box as both sides looked to play direct. Elsewhere, James Tarkowski had a mixed day, looking sloppy in possession but impressive defensively and attacking the ball in the opposition box. Man of the match - Jack Butland The England stopper made six saves, four of which were superb, and was unlucky not to keep out Barnes' leveller following a fine star-fish stop Peter Schmeichel would have been proud of. In the race for Russia, all four goalkeepers are putting in a claim to be Gareth Southgate's No 1. 1:59 Paul Lambert insists his side would keep fighting for their Premier League survival until it's mathematically impossible Paul Lambert insists his side would keep fighting for their Premier League survival until it's mathematically impossible The managers Paul Lambert: \"Until it's mathematically impossible for us to do, we'll keep fighting.

highlights of Manchester City's 5-0 win over Swansea Manchester City moved closer to breaking Chelsea's all-time Premier League points record with a 5-0 victory over Swansea City on Super Sunday. Pep Guardiola's champions now only need six points from their remaining four matches to surpass Chelsea's 95-point haul after goals from David Silva, Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bryune, Bernardo Silva and Gabriel Jesus sent them to a classy victory. Guardiola's men recorded 83% possession and completed 942 passes from 1,015 attempted over the course of 90 minutes; both of which are the most by any side in a Premier League game since 2003/04. Man City could also become the first top-flight team to register 100 points in a season if they take 10 points between now and the end of the campaign. This five-goal haul took them to 98 goals for the Premier League season - the record, set by Chelsea in 2009/10, is 103. Swansea, who were chasing shadows throughout, remain four points above the Premier League drop zone and still have both Stoke and Southampton to play. Player Ratings Manchester City: Ederson (7), Danilo (7), Kompany (7), Laporte (7), Delph (7), Gündogan (7), De Bruyne (9), Bernardo Silva (8), David Silva (9), Sterling (8), Jesus (7). Subs: Toure (7), Foden (7), Mendy (7) Swansea: Fabianski (5), Naughton (3), Van der Hoorn (4), Fernandez (3), Mawson (6), Olsson (5), Ki (4), King (5), Carroll (5), A Ayew (4), J Ayew (5) Subs: Bartley (5), Clucas (5), Abraham (6) Man of the match: Kevin De Bruyne Swansea welcomed the new champions onto the pitch with a guard of honour and that was about as close as they got to Guardiola's side. The hosts took the lead on 12 minutes. Team news Pep Guardiola made two changes to the side that beat Tottenham last weekend with Danilo replacing Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva coming in for Leroy Sane while Benjamin Mendy was on the bench. Mike Van Der Hoorn replaced Luciano Narsingh as Swansea played with three centre-backs. Sterling made a clever break in behind the static Swansea defence and flicked a clever reverse pass to David Silva, who thrashed a low effort into the far corner - his 10th goal of another amazing season for him. Silva then turned provider five minutes later, threading through Fabian Delph down the left wing and he had the simple task of squaring the ball across goal for Sterling to tap home. Andre Ayew and David Silva battle for the ball Swansea rarely ventured out of their own half as Silva, De Bruyne and Sterling ran amok in midfield. By half-time City had enjoyed a remarkable 86% of the ball. A similar pattern continued after the break. One slight criticism you can throw at the champions is that they can overplay at times, however, De Bruyne dispelled that notion on 54 minutes with a stunning long-range strike. Kevin De Bruyne is congratulated after his sensational strike put Man City 3-0 ahead There did not look much on when he picked the ball up 30 yards from goal but one swing of his right boot saw the ball fly like a rocket right into the top corner. Sterling then drew a clumsy foul off Federico Fernandez inside the area and, despite the cries from the crowd for Ederson to take it, Gabriel Jesus stepped up. His effort came back off the post but Bernardo Silva reacted quickest after 64 minutes to slide home the rebound. It was then party time as Guardiola gave minutes to crowd favourites Yaya Toure and Benjamin Mendy, who was returning from seven months out after a serious knee injury. There was time for Jesus to get a deserved goal with two minutes remaining when he skillfully headed home a delightful chipped pass from Toure. Swansea simply had no answer to the brilliance of Guardiola's men. Opta stats Manchester City have won each of their seven Premier League games against Swansea at the Etihad, scoring 19 goals and conceding just three in return. This was Swansea's joint-heaviest defeat in the Premier League, and the fifth time they've lost by a five-goal margin (also against Liverpool x2, Chelsea and Spurs). Sterling has scored 18 goals in the Premier League this season; twice as many as he did in his previous best campaign (9 for Liverpool in 2013/14). David Silva (nine goals, 11 assists) has been directly involved in 20+ goals in a Premier League season for the first time since 2011-12 (21). De Bruyne has now scored five goals from outside the box in the Premier League this season; the most of any player. Man of the match - Kevin De Bruyne Whether the brilliant Belgian wins the PFA Player of the Year award or not, the levels he has reached this season are frightening. He bossed this game from the very first kick, gliding around the pitch orchestrating almost every attack Manchester City put together. His link play with David Silva was a joy to watch and his performance was capped with a sensational strike that will be talked about in the pubs of Manchester long into the night. What's next? Manchester City are in front of the Sky Sports cameras again next Sunday when they visit West Ham United, who still need points to secure their Premier League status for next season.

Liverpool took just four minutes to open the scoring, with Danny Ings - in for the rested Roberto Firmino - registering his first goal since October 2015 with a neat finish. The visitors then doubled their lead when Mohamed Salah scored his 31st Premier League goal of the season, equalling Luis Suarez's club record from four years ago. Jake Livermore's close-range effort gave West Brom hope with 11 minutes to go and Rondon headed home a late leveller to boost West Brom's faint survival hopes.

The visitors made a dream start at a sun-drenched Hawthorns, taking an early lead through Ings, the forward's first goal since netting against Everton at Goodison Park 930 days ago. James Milner worked a short corner to Sadio Mane, who escaped his marker before finding Georginio Wijnaldum in the six-yard box. And despite the Dutchman failing to control the ball, Ings was there to finish from close range. Mohamed Salah celebrates doubling Liverpool's lead There could have been further goals in the first half, with Jay Rodriguez inches away at the far post from getting his foot on James McClean's cross-cum-shot, before Ben Foster did brilliantly to prevent Ings from scoring again just the break. Ings was in the action again at the start of the second half, only for referee Stuart Attwell to deem a coming together with Craig Dawson in the box an accident, while Ahmed Hegazi was lucky not to see red just before the hour mark for an unseen punch in the same player's stomach. However, that mattered little when Salah added a second with 18 minutes to go, with the Egypt forward collecting substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's pass, before confidently dinking the ball over the advancing Foster for his 41st goal in all competitions this season. Team news West Brom were unchanged from the side that won 1-0 at Man Utd last Sunday. Meanwhile, Liverpool made five alterations from the team that beat Bournemouth 3-0 last Saturday, with Ragnar Klavan, Joe Gomez, Alberto Moreno, James Milner and Danny Ings all coming in. That strike meant Salah has now scored the joint-most goals by a player in a 38-game Premier League campaign, moving level with Alan Shearer (1995-96), Cristiano Ronaldo (2007-08) and Suarez (2013-14). The home side got themselves back in the contest when Liverpool failed to deal with a right-wing corner, allowing Livermore to find the back of the net from just six yards, the midfielder's first-ever goal for the Baggies. And Rondon completed a remarkable turnaround when heading home Chris Bunt's inviting free kick with just two minutes remaining as Darren Moore maintained his unbeaten run as caretaker boss. The Baggies, though, could now be relegated if Crystal Palace do not lose at Watford on Saturday afternoon and Swansea win at Man City on Sunday. .@22mosalah scores his 31st PL goal of the season - equalling the record for a 38-game @premierleague season. pic.twitter.com/z0yURkDVh3 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) April 21, 2018 Match stats West Brom avoided defeat in a Premier League game in which they were 2+ goals down for the first time since February 2015 versus Burnley Rondon has equalled the record for most Premier League games scored in a single season without winning any of them (7, level with Jordan Ayew in 2015-16) Salah is just the fifth player in Premier League history to register 40+ goal involvements in a single season (31 goals, 9 assists) - also Alan Shearer (47 in 94-95), Andy Cole (47 in 93-94), Thierry Henry (44 in 02-03) and Luis Suarez (43 in 13-14) Oxlade-Chamberlain has been directly involved in 10 Premier League goals this season, (3 goals, 7 assists), his best-ever haul in the competition.

West Brom obviously decided not to water the pitch in half-time again. And it was quite difficult. Then we had the situation early in the second half, Ings in the box, you saw the pictures - it could be a penalty. And the situation with Hegazi and Ings, I do not know… You need a little bit of, not even help, only the right decision.

It is not in the rules that they should water the pitch, or overwater the pitch. There is no rule or law to say you have to make the pitch perfect for Liverpool. That is not the way it is. It could have been better, of course, everybody wants it perfect for the style of play you play. West Brom do not play that style of play with the quick passes and movement. They like to get it long and back to front very quickly, so they are not interested in how good the pitch is for Liverpool. They are interested in themselves.

Crystal Palace Watford 0-0 Crystal Palace Wilfried Zaha saw two penalty claims turned down as Watford and Crystal Palace edged towards Premier League safety after playing out an eventful 0-0 on Saturday. The Palace forward was booked for simulation following the second penalty shout, having gone down under pressure from Adrian Mariappa (63). Meanwhile, the woodwork was struck three times at Vicarage Road, with Watford striker Stefano Okaka heading against the bar before Palace duo Luka Milivojevic and James Tomkins suffered similar misfortune after the break. The point lifts Palace into 15th, six points clear of 18th-placed Southampton who have a game in hand, while Watford move onto 38 points - nine clear of the drop zone. Wilfried Zaha has picked up four bookings for simulation in the Premier League since the start of 2015/16, more than any other player Player ratings Watford: Karnezis (6), Mariappa (6), Cathcart (6), Kabasele (6), Holebas (6), Capoue (6), Doucoure (6), Hughes (7), Pereyra (7), Okaka (6), Deeney (7) Subs: Richarlison (6), Femenia (6), Gray (6) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Ward (5), Tomkins (7), Sakho (6), Van Aanholt (5), McArthur (6), Milivojevic (7), Cabaye (6), Loftus-Cheek (5), Townsend (6), Zaha (5) Subs: Benteke (6) Man of the match: James Tomkins Watford were dominant in the first half, and almost took the lead after four minutes when Okaka's header cannoned off the crossbar following Troy Deeney's cross. The hosts almost went ahead in fortuitous circumstances, but goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey got down well to keep out a poor Deeney attempt which ricocheted off Joel Ward and headed towards goal. The first penalty shout saw Wilfried Zaha go down after tangling with Christian Kabasele A quiet half from Palace ended with calls for a penalty, but referee Chris Kavanagh waved away the claims after Zaha went down after tangling with Christian Kabasele - an already-booked Abdoulaye Doucoure made his feelings clear when rushing over to confront the forward. Team news Watford made three changes, and switched to 4-4-2, with Stefano Okaka starting up front and both Jose Holebas and Christian Kabasele coming into the defence. Sebastian Prodl was out - Daryl Janmaat and Kiko Femenia dropped to bench. Crystal Palace named the same XI that beat Brighton 3-2 last weekend, meaning Christian Benteke was among the subs once more as Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha started in attack. 4:01 Roy Hodgson defended Wilfried Zaha after the forward picked up a yellow for simulation Roy Hodgson defended Wilfried Zaha after the forward picked up a yellow for simulation After the break, Milivojevic's free-kick from a narrow angle hit the post, but attention soon turned to a contentious decision down the other end. It came as Zaha - who was fouled five times in the match - was grounded from Mariappa's attempted tackle. Kavanagh opted to book the Ivorian, though replays suggested there was a touch from the Watford defender. Wilfried Zaha was booked for simulation at Vicarage Road for the second season in a row A fierce affair rumbled on, with James Tomkins heading against the post for Palace before a late flurry of cards saw the match end with eight bookings - Ward perhaps the most fortunate to escape a second yellow following a poor challenge on Jose Holebas. Opta stats Watford are without a win in six Premier League games (D2 L4), after winning three of the four before that (L1). Crystal Palace have picked up eight points in their last five Premier League games (W2 D2 L1), after accruing just two from their previous seven in the competition. The Hornets have failed to score in four of their last six top-flight games, netting just three goals in total in that period. Watford equalled their season-best tally for first-half shots in the Premier League in this game (11), but only mustered three in the second period. Troy Deeney was on hand to clear the danger after James Tomkins' header hit the post Man of the match - James Tomkins Crystal Palace survived a first-half onslaught from Watford and could have nicked a winner after the break. Tomkins was central to Palace's resolute display in defence, making 18 clearances - 13 more than any other player on the pitch - while he came within a whisker of heading the visitors to victory when his header struck the post. England World Cup watch Ruben Loftus-Cheek had more touches than any other Crystal Palace player (63), but was far from a standout figure at Watford, recording a pass completion of 72.5% from 40 passes in total. The managers Javi Gracia: \"It was a good first half from us - one of the best this season. We created many chances but we didn't take them. \"In the second half, they made more control and created chances to score. We tried until the end but could not do it. \"It did not surprise us. They changed a little with [the Christian] Benteke [substitution], but the first half was very demanding as we pressed very aggressively. 2:05 Javi Gracia says his side couldn't match the intensity they set in the first half and admits they were under pressure in the second period. Javi Gracia says his side couldn't match the intensity they set in the first half and admits they were under pressure in the second period. Roy Hodgson: \"I think he [Zaha] is being unfairly treated. But the fact is, reputations are given to you from people outside of your control. Other managers sometimes come in with opinions and that's been picked up by the mass media - then it gets blown up. \"I can assure people, if they've got any faith in my judgement and ability to see football relatively calmly, he never looks to dive in the penalty area - never - because he wants to score goals, there's no doubt about that. \"He will get unbalanced. I thought in the first half the referee made the right decision when he almost got through but was unbalanced and went down. He didn't go for the penalty. He was just unbalanced. The referee dealt with that very well. \"The second one, when people see it they will have their opinions, but they will have to forgive me for thinking that it was a penalty.\" What's next?

Victor Moses struck a 69th-minute winner to move Antonio Conte's side to within five points of fourth-placed Tottenham with four games to play and the result will build confidence ahead of Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Southampton. Kevin Long's unfortunate own goal (20) had given Chelsea a first-half lead, which was cancelled out by Ashley Barnes' fortuitous strike (64), but Burnley's run of five successive victories would ultimately be ended by last season's champions. Sean Dyche's side remain in seventh place as they continue to fight for a Europa League spot, but are now two points behind Arsenal having played a game more. Player ratings Burnley: Pope (5), Lowton (5), Long (5), Tarkowski (6), Ward (6), Lennon (6), Cork (6), Westwood (6), Gudmundsson (7), Barnes (7), Wood (6) Subs: Vokes (6), Wells (n/a) Chelsea: Courtois (6), Azpilicueta (6), Cahill (7), Rudiger (6), Moses (8), Kante (7), Bakayoko (7), Emerson (7), Pedro (7), Morata (6), Giroud (7). Subs: Hazard (6), Zappacosta (n/a) Man of the match: Victor Moses Chelsea opened the scoring in unlikely fashion in the 20th minute when Victor Moses crossed from the right and Pope failed to punch the ball away, instead palming the ball onto the knee and then hand of his own defender Long and seeing it rebound into the net. The goalkeeper was at fault for the goal, but twice denied the wasteful Alvaro Morata in the first half, clearing an early shot across goal with his legs before rushing off his line to stop the striker getting a shot away. Morata, who started in a front two alongside Olivier Giroud, was guilty of a glaring miss 10 minutes after half-time when he was played clean through by N'Golo Kante, but after taking two touches to set himself steered the ball narrowly wide of the post. Team news Eden Hazard dropped to the bench as Antonio Conte made six changes to the Chelsea team that beat Southampton on Saturday. Emerson Palmieri made his first Premier League start in place of the suspended Marcos Alonso. Burnley were unchanged. And Chelsea were even more frustrated in the 64th minute when Burnley equalised in fortunate circumstances. Johann Berg Gudmundsson struck a low shot from 20 yards which was heading wide, but it took a fierce deflection off Barnes, wrong-footing Thibaut Courtois and finding its way into the far corner. Ashley Barnes celebrates scoring for Burnley against Chelsea But the away side restored their lead five minutes later when Emerson's left-wing cross found Moses unmarked eight yards from goal and he drilled a low shot past Pope at his near post. Eden Hazard emerged from the bench for the final 20 minutes, but the victory was rarely under threat in the closing stages and Conte still has a top-four finish - as well as FA Cup glory - in his sights this season. Pedro celebrates after Kevin Long's own goal Opta stats Chelsea recorded their first back-to-back league victories of 2018, previously winning consecutive games in their final two matches of 2017. Since beating Chelsea in their first match of the season, Burnley have collected just four points from 10 Premier League matches against the big six (P10 W0 D4 L6). This was Antonio Conte's 100th match in charge of Chelsea in all competitions - only Jose Mourinho (72) has won more of his first 100 games in charge of the Blues than Conte (65). This was the first Premier League match to feature two Italians for Chelsea (Emerson and Davide Zappacosta) since May 2003 against Liverpool (Carlo Cudicini and Gianfranco Zola). This was the 500th game to kick-off on a Thursday in English top-flight league history. The managers Sean Dyche: \"I'm really pleased with our growing mentality. It's not easy to take the game on when you're 1-0 down at half-time to Chelsea. I thought we did, we really took the game on. So there are certainly no disappointments, we were playing a top side and we are getting closer.\" 3:51 Burnley boss Sean Dyche gives his reaction to Sky Sports after watching his side lose 2-1 to Chelsea.

Chelsea boss Antonio Conte gives his reaction to Sky Sports after watching his side win 2-1 away at Burnley. Man of the Match - Victor Moses Sky Sports co-commentator Andy Hinchcliffe was full of praise for the Chelsea match-winner, saying: \"It has to be Victor Moses. He's got dangerous crosses in, he's scored, he's worked hard defensively and he's done everything you need from a wing-back. He's a player perfect for that position.\" Sean Dyche saw his five-match winning run ended England World Cup watch Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope did little to enhance his hopes of forcing his way into Gareth Southgate’s plans as his first-half error gave Chelsea the lead, though he did make a couple of good saves to deny Alvaro Morata. James Tarkowski struggled to deal with Chelsea’s attacking threat at times, particularly when Eden Hazard came on in the closing stages. At the other end, Gary Cahill looked more assured, making up for his one slip with a fine recovery tackle on Ashley Barnes. What's next? Next up for Chelsea is an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley against Southampton on Sunday, before they resume their Premier League campaign at Swansea on the following Saturday evening.

The hosts arguably had the game's best chance, as Alex McCarthy produced a fine save to deny a trademark effort from Jamie Vardy with 20 minutes remaining. It was a rare moment of quality during a cagey affair, with Southampton's best chance to break the deadlock falling to Shane Long in the second half, but Ben Hamer was out quick to smother his shot.

Claude Puel will have relished the chance to do a domestic double over his former club, but after seeing his team now go three games without a victory, the Frenchman will be keen for the season not to peter out in the remaining four games. His side made the brighter start on Thursday night, and the energetic Kelechi Iheanacho came close to breaking the deadlock after 17 minutes as the Nigeria international reacted fastest to his own blocked shot to regain possession and curl a shot just a yard wide of McCarthy's right-hand post. Mark Hughes watched his side collect the first Premier League point of his reign Team news Leicester made five changes to the side that were beaten by Burnley. Ben Hamer, Aleksander Dragovic, Marc Albrighton, Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho came in for Kasper Schmeichel, Wes Morgan, Danny Simpson, Hamza Choudhury and Shinji Okazaki. Southampton were unchanged from the defeat by Chelsea. But that was as good as it got for the Foxes in the opening 45 minutes, with Dusan Tadic and Cedric Soares spurning half-chances for the visitors without testing Hamer. That would change 12 minutes into the second half as Tadic's deflected shot fell kindly for Long via Harry Maguire's outstretched leg, but the Republic of Ireland striker could only fire straight at Hamer. Vardy had endured a frustrating evening having been ruled offside on several occasions, but he very nearly produced another moment of magic to give his side the lead from Marc Albrighton's inch-perfect pass. The England striker managed to wriggle himself clear of the three-man Southampton defence to meet the makeshift right-back's ball over the top, but McCarthy was equal to his measured volley to ensure the Saints head back south with at least a point. The managers Claude Puel: \"The result is not enough because we played at home. I'm happy with our performance because it was a good game with good variety on the floor. \"We had many chances to score in the first half and it was important to score in this moment when we dominated the game, as well as in the final 30 minutes.\" 4:20 Leicester City manger Claude Puel credited how his side played in the 0-0 draw against Southampton but admits the result is disappointing. Leicester City manger Claude Puel credited how his side played in the 0-0 draw against Southampton but admits the result is disappointing. Mark Hughes: \"I think 0-0 is a fair result. I don't think there were many clear-cut chances. Arguably we had the best one where the keeper makes a good block from Long, but we didn't create enough chances of note. \"We played better against Arsenal and Chelsea but didn't get anything out of it. This sets us up for the remaining games. We're heading towards a stage when we can't hold back and we'll have to throw the kitchen sink at it.\" 3:40 Southampton manager Mark Hughes claims the 0-0 draw with Leicester was a fair result. Southampton manager Mark Hughes claims the 0-0 draw with Leicester was a fair result. Man of the match: Wilfred Ndidi This was a game where the onus was on Southampton to drag themselves closer to the sides above the relegation zone, but their frustration in creating goalscoring opportunities owed a lot to the returning Ndidi. The indefatigable Nigeria midfielder was suspended for Leicester's last two games after picking up his second red card of the season in the 2-0 win over Brighton but he barely put a foot wrong during a match low on attacking excellence. Ndidi made six tackles in this match; double the number of any other player. Overall this season, he has made the most tackles in the competition (135); 29 more than any other player. Wilfred Ndidi brought much-needed steel to the Leicester midfield against the Saints Opta stats This was the 27th 0-0 draw in the Premier League this season, equalling the tally from 2016-17 (27) but with four matchdays left to play. Southampton have been involved in five of these goalless draws in 2017-18; more than any other side. Southampton did not attempt a single shot on target until the 57th minute of this match. They only attempted one more in the game, and that came in the 90th minute. Leicester City have collected 44 points this season, level with their points tally in the whole of 2016-17. Southampton (29 points) need three points from their remaining four league games of the season to even match their worst-ever points tally in a Premier League season (32 in 2004-05, when they finished bottom). After winning the 2015-16 Premier League title with 23 wins to their name, Leicester City have won the exact same number of matches (23) in 72 games since August 2016. What's next? Southampton head to face Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-finals at Wembley before returning to Premier League action against Bournemouth on April 28.

Chris Smalling continued his rich vein of form in front of goal on his 150th Premier League appearance, finding the net for the third consecutive away game with the opener on 28 minutes. Substitute Romelu Lukaku then wrapped up the points on 70 minutes as Jose Mourinho's side warmed up for Saturday's FA Cup semi-final with Tottenham by moving four points clear of third-place Liverpool. David de Gea strengthened his claim for the Golden Glove with a 17th league clean sheet - a career-high 21 in all competitions. However, things could have been different for Eddie Howe's side - who remain 11th in the table - had Luke Shaw's goal-preventing challenge on Callum Wilson yielded punishment from referee Graham Scott. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (5), Francis (5), S Cook (5), Ake (6), Daniels (6), Fraser (5), L Cook (5), Surman (5), Ibe (5), King (6), Wilson (6). Subs: Gosling (5), Defoe (5), Mousset (6).

Man of the Match: Paul Pogba. With Sunday's title-deciding defeat to West Brom clearly on United minds, Bournemouth started brightly and created the first opening inside 11 minutes, Jordon Ibe dragging a shot wide from the edge of the area. It took the visitors 27 minutes to register an effort on target, Marcus Rashford drawing a decent save from Asmir Begovic after robustly dispossessing Nathan Ake on the right-hand touchline. Chris Smalling scored Manchester United's opening goal against Bournemouth But Begovic's resolve was broken a minute later when Ander Herrera's divine pass released Jesse Lingard in behind the Bournemouth defence, and he squared for Smalling to tap home. United went on to dominate the rest of the first period but had De Gea to thank for preserving their lead as Josh King's rasping shot was parried clear before half-time. Team news Callum Wilson and Andrew Surman were drafted into the Bournemouth starting line-up as Eddie Howe made two changes following Saturday’s defeat at Liverpool. With an eye on Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final, Jose Mourinho made seven changes, with only David de Gea, Chris Smalling, Ander Herrera and Paul Pogba retaining their places after the defeat to West Brom. Bournemouth pushed for an equaliser early in the second period and felt they should have had a penalty on 56 minutes when Shaw appeared to impede Wilson as he tried to convert King's cross. But referee Scott deemed the left-back's challenge legal, and United made the most of their reprieve as Lukaku, eight minutes after coming off the bench, lifted the decisive second over Begovic at the end of a Paul Pogba-led counter. Romelu Lukaku celebrates scoring against Bournemouth Opta stats David de Gea has kept more clean sheets in all competitions for Man Utd in 2017/18 than he has in any other season for the club (21). Manchester United have won six of their last seven Premier League games (L1), scoring two or more goals in each victory. After winning their first Premier League meeting with Man Utd (2-1 in December 2015), Bournemouth have lost four and drawn one of the subsequent five. Romelu Lukaku has scored seven goals in his six Premier League appearances against Bournemouth. No player has provided more Premier League assists in away games this season than Paul Pogba (7 - level with Christian Eriksen and David Silva). Jesse Lingard has been directly involved in 19 goals in all competitions this season (13 goals, 6 assists), one more than he managed in his previous three seasons for Man Utd combined (18). Man of the Match - Paul Pogba Paul Pogba set up Romelu Lukaku's goal against Bournemouth After drawing criticism from his manager in the wake of United's defeat to West Brom, which handed Manchester City the title, all eyes were on the Pogba to get United back on the winning track. He took his time to grow into the game but once he was up to speed we were treated to a vintage display from the Frenchman, who capped an imperious second-half display by setting up Lukaku for United's second. What's next? Bournemouth travel to south-coast rivals Southampton on Saturday, April 28, for a game which could go a long way to deciding each club's fortunes. United, meanwhile, take on Tottenham for a place in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday before hosting Arsenal at Old Trafford on Nissan Super Sunday on April 29."}, {"date": "17/04/2018",

Harry Kane's 26th league goal of the season could not get Spurs back to winning ways as Brighton earned a deserved 1-1 draw at the Amex Stadium. His close-range finish, three minutes after half-time, was harsh on the Seagulls who had limited the visitors' forward line before the break. Brighton were handed an opportunity to level within moments of the opener when Serge Aurier bundled Jose Izquierdo over in the box, and a hand from Hugo Lloris was not enough to keep out Pascal Gross' powerful spot-kick. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (7), Bruno (7), Duffy (7), Dunk (6), Bong (6), Knockaert (7), Kayal (6), Stephens (7), Izquierdo (7), Gross (7), Murray (6). Subs: March (6), Ulloa (6). Tottenham: Lloris (7), Aurier (6), Alderweireld (7), Vertonghen (7), Davies (6), Wanyama (7), Sissoko (7), Eriksen (7), Lucas (7), Son (7), Kane (6). Subs: Dembele (6), Lamela (6), Llorente (n/a). Man of the match: Pascal Gross The draw takes Brighton eight points above the bottom three, while the result gives Chelsea a small chink of light for a top-four spot, with Tottenham eight points clear of the Blues having played a game more. Brighton's air of confidence was not what you would expect from a side four games without a win. They gave Hugo Lloris a scare when he fumbled Lewis Dunk's header but the Frenchman gathered before he was punished. Lloris' errors have cost Spurs three goals in as many games but there was nothing too testing about Brighton's efforts before half-time, and Matt Ryan was the busier goalkeeper, tipping a long-range effort from Lucas Moura and Heung-Min Son's low shot behind. Kane had been off-colour before the break, slipping as he fired a free-kick over and also finding row Z with a wayward long-range strike, but he did what he does best three minutes after the break. Team news Anthony Knockaert made his first start since returning from suspension, with Bruno also returning to the Brighton defence. There were six alterations for Spurs, who left Dele Alli out of the 18 altogether ahead of the FA Cup semi-finals, and gave Toby Alderweireld a first Premier League appearance since October 28. Son did excellently to keep the ball in when it ricocheted off Lucas Moura, out-muscling Dunk before beating Ryan to the ball and inadvertently finding Kane, who smashed into the net via a deflection off Bruno. Brighton needed just 18 seconds after the restart to find a route back into the game, when Izquierdo received a lovely reverse pass from Glenn Murray and was knocked to the floor by Aurier's clumsy challenge. Gross stepped up with Murray taken off penalty duties and smashed the ball beyond Lloris despite the France international's best efforts. Tottenham responded with Lucas Moura missing the near post and Shane Duffy diverting Christian Eriksen's cross just beyond the far one with little idea where the ball would end up, but dropped points for the second game in succession to fall off the pace in the race for second place. The Managers Chris Hughton: \"It's a step [towards safety]. What I was most happy with was our character. To concede when we did, probably through our own fault, to react as we did and play as big a part in the game as we did, I thought we showed great character and quality when we had to. 2:06 Brighton manager Chris Hughton praised the character of his side Brighton manager Chris Hughton praised the character of his side \"We spoke about having to give everything against these sides, and if you're that percentage below your best, they can really hurt you. It's concentration, not allowing the quality they've got and I think we limited them to chances but no real clear ones.\" Mauricio Pochettino: \"In the second half we created chances, but not enough to win the game. We tried to give the team some fresh legs, playing in the evening on Saturday was so tough mentally and physically, and we needed to rest some players and rotate. 1:45 Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino claimed six chages didn't impact on the result Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino claimed six chages didn't impact on the result \"I think we have the squad to win games, and we rotated the team. I think the most important thing is the big picture, we have a big squad, everyone is ready to play, the game was tough, Brighton were a difficult opponent, and we have to congratulate them.\" Match facts Tottenham failed to win a league game in which they were ahead for only the second time this season (W20 D2 L0), with the other game being a 1-1 draw with Burnley in August. There were just 143 seconds between Harry Kane's opener and Pascal Groß's leveller. Groß has been directly involved in 43.8% of Brighton's 32 Premier League goals this season (6 goals, 8 assists). Only Mo Salah (50%) has been involved in a higher proportion of his team's goals. No side has drawn more home games this season than Brighton (8, level with West Brom). Tottenham are unbeaten in 13 away games in all competitions - only once have they ever had a longer run (15 between April 1949 and January 1950). Harry Kane has now scored against 26 of the 27 different clubs he's faced in the Premier League (96.3%), with the exception being Cardiff City. Of all players to have played against more than one side in the competition, only Thierry Henry (97.1%) and Sergio Aguero (96.9%) have scored against a higher percentage of the opponents they've faced. The English striker has now scored 15 away goals in the Premier League this season - only Kevin Phillips in 1999-00 (16) has scored more on the road in a single campaign. Man of the match - Pascal Gross Continued his exceptional season of being involved in more than 43 per cent of Brighton's goals this season, with six goals and eight assists. Pascal Gross equalised from the spot He took responsibility for their penalty after Glenn Murray missed two earlier in the season, and struck it confidently past Lloris to level.

Stoke had to wait until 79 minutes to make the breakthrough as Peter Crouch took advantage of a terrible mistake by West Ham goalkeeper Joe Hart with England manager Gareth Southgate watching on. Player ratings West Ham: Hart (6), Rice (6), Ogbonna (6), Cresswell (7), Zabaleta (6), Noble (6), Kouyate (6), Masuaku (7), Fernandes (7), Joao Mario (7), Arnautovic (7) Subs: Carroll (8), Hernandez (7), Lanzini (6) Stoke: Butland (8), Shawcross (7), Zouma (8), Martins Indi (9), Bauer (8), Ndiaye (7), Allen (6), Pieters (7), Shaqiri (6), Sobhi (6), Diouf (6) Subs: Ireland (6), Cameron (6), Crouch (7) Man of the match: Bruno Martins Indi However, fellow substitute Carroll came off the bench to volley home Aaron Cresswell's inch-perfect cross to keep David Moyes' side seven points above 19th-placed Stoke in the race to avoid the drop. It was a battle of the England 'keepers in a closely fought first 45 minutes, with Hart and Jack Butland both responsible for keeping the scoreline goalless at the break. Andy Carroll (right) is congratulated after equalising late on for West Ham The Stoke No 1 was the busier, making excellent stops to keep out Arthur Masuaku, Cresswell and Marko Arnautovic, the latter a point-blank reaction save to deny his former team-mate. Hart was also tested by efforts from both Moritz Bauer and Mame Biram Diouf, but after the interval, it was one-way traffic as West Ham stepped up a gear in search of the opener. Peter Crouch shows his delight after opening the scoring The home side were denied by the flag as Michael Oliver - making his first appearance since sending off Gianluigi Buffon in the Champions League on Wednesday - and his officiating team were sharp to spot that Arnautovic had twice strayed offside. Stoke, however, were not without their own moments of promise, with Biram Diouf firing over from close range, before Crouch opened the scoring with 11 minutes to go in a moment Hart will want to forget. Team news West Ham were unchanged from the side that secured a creditable 1-1 with champions Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last time out, but both Andy Carroll and Manuel Lanzini were back as substitutes. Stoke, meanwhile, made one alteration from last Saturday’s 2-1 home defeat to Spurs, with Kurt Zouma replacing Glen Johnson – out with a groin injury - at right back. The visitors worked the ball nicely around the West Ham box, before Xherdan Shaqiri tried his luck from just outside the area, only for Hart to spill the Swiss' low drive straight at Crouch's feet. And the substitute made no mistake from close range to become his side's record Premier League goalscorer. However, it was another player coming off the bench that had the final word as Carroll - making his first appearance since January - did brilliantly to guide a volley past Butland and earn the hosts a deserved draw.

Meanwhile, Aaron Cresswell - who is an outside shot for a place on the plane to Russia – created West Ham’s equaliser with another of his delicious centres straight on to the head of Andy Carroll, who will have given the watching Gareth Southgate a reminder of his abilities with a well-taken late goal. Managers David Moyes: \"I thought we played really well. We played good in parts of the game, it was just the fact we went one behind, because if anyone was going to score first I thought it would be us. \"We got the ball well out of the back, we just didn't have something different up front.

Pundit - Gary Neville \"Hart had a nightmare for that goal, and you are thinking about the pressure of a World Cup and the form you need to go into a World Cup - this is a serious competition that to be fair eats you alive - and Jack Butland to be did not display great confidence in what I would call the difficult moments where balls came into the box. \"I thought it was a tough, tough night and the goal that was disallowed for offside, I thought Butland should have saved it anyway. \"So for me, I did not think it was a good night for either of them and to be fair, Gareth Southgate will have been there solely watching them, so it is a massive concern not having surety in the goalkeeping position. \"And Jordan Pickford looks to be the No 1, but he is going into a World Cup for the first time away from home in Russia, which is a tough ask.\" Joe Hart and Jack Butland (left) shake hands at the full-time whistle Man of the Match - Bruno Martins Indi The Stoke defender was a dominant figure at the heart of the visitors' back line at the London Stadium, helping to keep West Ham at bay for the majority of the match. The Netherlands international made a number of key interceptions throughout the contest, as well as marshalling his fellow defenders, and the Potters will need more such heroics if they are to beat the odds and stay up.

Newcastle all-but ensured their Premier League survival with a 2-1 comeback win over bogey side Arsenal. Alexandre Lacazette had volleyed the visitors into a 14th-minute lead at St James' Park, but Ayoze Perez drew Newcastle level (29) with a smart near-post finish before Ritchie completed the turnaround with a 68th-minute strike. A fourth straight Premier League win means Rafa Benitez's once relegation-threatened side have surpassed the 40-point safety mark set by their manager and, after a priceless victory on the eve of his birthday, will now harbour real hopes of a top-10 finish. But sixth-placed Arsenal - much-changed after their midweek trip to Moscow - have now suffered five successive defeats on the road and see their lead over Burnley trimmed to just two points with five league games remaining. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Yedlin (7), Lascelles (7), Lejeune (7), Dummett (7), Ritchie (7), Diame (8), Shelvey (8), Kenedy (6), Perez (7), Gayle (7).

Subs: Welbeck (6), Maitland-Niles (5), Nketiah (N/A). Man of the Match: Mo Diame Matt Ritchie celebrates scoring what proved the winner for Newcastle The Gunners had enjoyed a 10-match-winning Premier League streak against their hosts and had an early chance when Lacazette - playing alongside Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for the first time - swivelled to craft space but scuffed his shot. Jonjo Shelvey had lofted several threatening balls forward but it was a fine long drive from Shkodran Mustafi that yielded first reward, Aubameyang taking a controlling touch before crossing for a lunging Lacazette at the back post. The hosts were struggling to find attacking rhythm as Arsenal bristled with intent, Alex Iwobi jinking in the box and drilling low before Jamaal Lascelles was forced to turn a dangerous Calum Chambers cross behind. Arsenal's Alexandre Lacazette battles for the ball with Newcastle defender Jamaal Lascelles Team news Newcastle were unchanged from the side that beat Leicester last time out. Arsene Wenger made six changes from the side that drew at CSKA Moscow in midweek to progress to the Europa League semi-finals, notably handing Joe Willock a league debut and starting Alexandre Lacazette alongside Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for the first time. But Newcastle were level just before the half-hour mark when their tactic to go over the top paid off. Dwight Gayle brought down Shelvey's looping punt and when DeAndre Yedlin whipped in, Perez darted past Mustafi to sweep beyond Petr Cech. Arsenal might have restored their lead had Lacazette, having dispossessed Mo Diame, opted to shoot rather than tee up an off-guard Joe Willock (43) but the hosts instead had a foothold and Perez broke promisingly soon after the restart before being crowded out. Ayoze Perez celebrates scoring the equaliser against Arsenal Gayle, full of running, was replaced by Islam Slimani, and it was the substitute's fine header that allowed Ritchie - via a Perez flick - to bury what would prove a decisive second. Wenger had brought on Danny Welbeck for Willock just moments before the game swung away from his side but the deficit might have been greater as Kenedy hit the crossbar just minutes later. Newcastle withstood a late barrage into the box but the equaliser never came and the famous Geordie folk song 'Blaydon Races' rang out, Benitez's side now 13 points clear of the drop zone and surely safe. 3:18 Super Sunday guest Nemanja Vidic analyses Arsenal's defending Super Sunday guest Nemanja Vidic analyses Arsenal's defending Man of the match - Mo Diame Shelvey caught the eye again with a string of dreamy diagonal and forward balls but while he crafted openings, Diame dug in.

Arsenal have now lost 11 Premier League games this season; equaling their worst tally of league defeats in a season under Arsene Wenger (11 in 2005-06). All seven of Matt Ritchie's Premier League goals have come in home games (four for Bournemouth, three for Newcastle). Joe Willock (born in August 1999) was just the fourth player who was born after Arsene Wenger's first match in charge to make a Premier League appearance for Arsenal (Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Reiss Nelson & Eddie Nketiah are the others). Willock was the 56th teenager to make a Premier League appearance for Arsenal - the most of any Premier League team - six more than Chelsea & Manchester United (50 each). World Cup Watch Jonjo Shelvey was again at the fore, his expansive passing range showcasing the best of his talents. He hit seven accurate long balls - most of which got Gayle running at Arsenal's defence. Will Gareth Southgate finally be convinced he could - at least from the bench - offer something different? The managers Rafa Benitez: \"We were not expecting to be in the top 10, but at the same time I said we were dreaming, but we were awake and thinking that we could do it.

Brom West Brom secured the Premier League title for Manchester City and boosted their faint survival hopes with an unlikely 1-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday. Jay Rodriguez headed the title-winning goal from close range on 73 minutes as a lethargic United failed to prolong their rivals' wait to be crowned champions, a week on from doing so in dramatic fashion in the Manchester derby. West Brom remain nine points from safety at the foot of the table but a timely first win in 11 leaves them with the slimmest of chances of avoiding relegation with four games to play. Knowing defeat would all-but secure their relegation to the Championship, West Brom created the better chances and frustrated United as Old Trafford bore witness to another underwhelming first half. The visitors nearly took the lead on 13 minutes through a low Jake Livermore shot but David de Gea, as he has done all season, came to United's rescue with a fine save. Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (5), Valencia (5), Lindelof (5), Smalling (5), Young (5), Herrera (4), Pogba (5), Matic (6), Mata (5), Sanchez (5), Lukaku (6). Subs: Martial (5), Lingard (5), Rashford (4). West Brom: Foster (8), Nyom (7), Dawson (8), Hegazi (7), Gibbs (6), Phillips (6), Livermore (6), Brunt (6), McClean (7), Rodriguez (8), Rondon (6). Subs: Yacob (n/a), Sturridge (n/a), Krychowiak (5). Man of the Match: Jay Rodriguez. United were unfortunate not to win a penalty after Craig Dawson brought Ander Herrera down in the area on 18 minutes, but referee Paul Tierney chose not to point to the spot. Ben Foster produced a fine double save two minutes later to prevent Romelu Lukaku scoring against his former club and Alexis Sanchez from converting the rebound. West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster made a brilliant save to deny Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku in the first half From there on, United were toothless in the final third and West Brom looked the more threatening as Dawson headed Chris Brunt's corner agonisingly across the face of goal on 42 minutes. Jesse Lingard was introduced by Jose Mourinho at half-time and the substitute so nearly had an immediate impact with a half-volley from 14 yards, but Dawson flung himself in the way of the effort. Team news Jose Mourinho made two changes to his Manchester derby winning side as Victor Lindelof and Juan Mata replaced Eric Bailly and Jesse Lingard. West Brom caretaker boss Darren Moore named an unchanged side. It took United until the 67th minute to register an attempt on target as Lukaku's header across goal drew a stunning fingertip save from Foster. Lingard flashed a shot wide shortly after before Rodriguez won a corner and dispatched Nemanja Matic's inadvertent knockdown to hand City the title, boos from the disgruntled Old Trafford faithful greeting the final whistle. Opta stats West Brom have lost just one of their last five Premier League visits to Old Trafford (W3 D1 L1), with their only loss in this run coming in November 2015 (0-2). This was just the second time in Premier League history that Manchester United have lost at Old Trafford to a side starting that day as the bottom of the league club - the other game was a 2-3 defeat to Blackburn Rovers in December 2011. Since Jose Mourinho was named as Manchester United manager in the summer of 2016, four clubs have won more points in the Premier League than the Red Devils (140) - Manchester City (165), Chelsea (153), Tottenham Hotspur (153) and Liverpool (146). Darren Moore has already equalled Alan Pardew's total Premier League wins (1 in 18 games) as WBA manager in just his second game as boss (1). Moore has led WBA to four points in his two games as caretaker manager (W1 D1 L0), the same tally of points that Alan Pardew secured in his final 11 Premier League games as manager (W1 D1 L9). Jay Rodriguez has scored as many goals in his last four Premier League appearances (3) as he did in his previous 26 combined. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"We were deservedly punished. Everything was complicated, they couldn't play simple, everything was one more touch, one more flick, one more turn, the ball lost. No fluidity in our football. I don't think we deserved to lose, but we gave them the opportunity to win the match.\" 4:41 Jose Mourinho says his side overcomplicated their play in the defeat to West Brom, a result which handed the Premier League title to rivals Manchester City. Jose Mourinho says his side overcomplicated their play in the defeat to West Brom, a result which handed the Premier League title to rivals Manchester City. Darren Moore: \"It was important to come here and give a positive performance.

Man of the Match - Jay Rodriguez Rodriguez drew a line under a testing period off the pitch with the winner at Old Trafford. The striker's charge of racially abusing Gaetan Bong was found not proven earlier this week and he visibly played with a new-found freedom. \"It's been horrendous for myself, my family,\" he told Sky Sports. \"I'm a great believer in the truth always comes out. For me it was a massive weight off my shoulders.\" What's next? United head to Bournemouth on Wednesday before contending their FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham at Wembley on Saturday.

came off the bench to score twice as Chelsea came from two goals down to beat struggling Southampton 3-2 and keep alive their hopes of Champions League qualification. The home team went ahead thanks to Dusan Tadic's fourth Premier League goal of the season (21), before Jan Bednarek volleyed home a second on his top-flight debut (60). However, the champions responded in style by scoring three times in only nine minutes via a stooping header from substitute Giroud (70) - his first league goal for Chelsea - before Eden Hazard's composed finish brought them level (75). Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (6), Hoedt (6), Cedric (8), Bednarek (7), Yoshida (6), Romeu (7), Hojbjerg (8), Bertrand (7), Ward-Prowse (8), Tadic (7), Long (7) Subs: Austin (6), Gabbiadini (6), Sims (6) Chelsea: Courtois (6), Azpilicueta (6), Cahill (6), Christensen (6), Zappacosta (6), Fabregas (6), Kante (7), Alonso (7), Willian (7), Hazard (8), Morata (6) Subs: Pedro (6), Moses (6), Giroud (9) Man of the match: Olivier Giroud Then with 12 minutes to go Giroud completed the comeback with a low drive to inflict a fourth defeat in a row on the struggling Saints. As a result, Southampton remain in the relegation zone, while Antonio Conte's team, after their first two-goal comeback since 2002, moved to within seven points of both Tottenham and Liverpool - who play later today - in the race for the top four. Southampton had opened the scoring after 21 largely uneventful minutes following a lovely build-up down their left flank involving Ryan Bertrand, sent clear by Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's inch-perfect pass. The England left back then got the better of Cesar Azpilicueta in a foot race, before pulling the ball back for the waiting Tadic to nip in front of his marker and side-foot the hosts ahead with his first strike since Boxing Day. Southampton players celebrate after taking the lead against Chelsea It took a flat Chelsea - fortunate not to see Marcos Alonso sent off for a late tackle on Shane Long just before the break - until the second half to test Alex McCarthy. The Saints No 1 just did enough though to keep out Willian's low drive from the edge of the area, minutes after Thibaut Courtois also had to be alert to touch over Long's looping effort. However, Mark Hughes - taking charge of Southampton at St Mary's for the first time - only had to wait till the hour-mark for his side to double their lead, and it came via an unlikely source. James Ward-Prowse floated a free kick to the far post for Bednarek to cushion a volley past Courtois as a first league win under their new manager appeared to be on the cards, only for the visitors to hit back with three goals in only eight minutes. Team news The Saints made one change from last Sunday's 3-2 loss at Arsenal, with Jan Bednarek replacing the suspended Jack Stephens - sent off at the Emirates - for his Premier League debut. Chelsea, meanwhile, made two alterations from last weekend's 1-1 home draw against West Ham, with Andreas Christensen and Davide Zappacosta coming in for Antonio Rudiger and Victor Moses, with the German not even in the Blues squad. Giroud, only just off the bench, headed in Alonso's inch-perfect cross from the left, before Hazard kept his cool to trap Willian's cut back and drill the Blues level as Southampton heads dropped. And the France international then sealed a quite remarkable turnaround by firing through a posse of Saints defenders to keep Chelsea's Champions League hopes alive. Match stats Southampton have lost consecutive Premier League games after scoring 2+ goals for the first time ever Hughes is only the second manager to lose three Premier League games against the same opponent in a single season after Graeme Souness vs Arsenal in 2004-05 The Blues have won five in a row against Saints in the league for the first time ever Tadic has been directly involved in 45 Premier League goals since his debut in August 2014 (18 goals, 27 assists), 14 more than any other Southampton player. Bednarek is only the third Polish player to score in the Premier League, after Robert Warzycha in 1992 and Marcin Wasilewski in 2015 Giroud is the top-scoring sub in the Premier League this season, with six goals from the bench Giroud is the first player to score an away goal against the same opponent for different clubs in a single Premier League season since Mikel Arteta (for Everton and Arsenal v Blackburn 2011/12) Hazard has scored 69 Premier League goals for Chelsea; only Frank Lampard (147) and Didier Drogba (104) have netted more.

There's clear intent to hurt Shane, it was raked down the back of the calf, it's a dangerous tackle and could have broken his leg.\" Antonio Conte: \"Our first half wasn't good, in a lot of aspects.

And that means the 31-year-old is now just five behind Jermain Defoe's record for most goals off the bench. England watch Saints skipper Ryan Bertrand delivered an energetic display down the left side for his side, including a barnstorming run to help create their opener. Meanwhile, Gary Cahill was solid at the heart of the Blues’ back line, despite their at times shaky defending, as the centre back continued his return to the champions’ defence. And Ross Barkley was also back on the bench for the first time since January 31 after a hamstring injury, although the midfielder was not called upon at St Mary’s What's next?

Chris Wood opened the scoring in the sixth minute as he netted the rebound from a Kasper Schmeichel save, before Kevin Long headed home three minutes later. Leicester were much improved in the second half and Jamie Vardy (72) scored the reply for the visitors, although they suffered a late blow when Schmeichel had to be substituted in the 86th minute after a crunching tackle from Ashley Barnes. The win for Burnley sees them move nine points clear in seventh place ahead of Leicester and a step closer to Europa League football next season which could be theirs if they finish in seventh or higher and Southampton do not win the FA Cup.

A poor attempted clearance from Wes Morgan allowed Ashley Barnes onto the ball, and he picked out Wood down the left of the box. After seeing his initial shot saved by Schmeichel, Wood latched onto the rebounded ball and slotted home at the second time of asking. Three minutes later, and the hosts doubled their lead. It was another easy goal for Burnley as Johann Berg Gudmundsson whipped a corner into the area, and found the head of the incoming Long at the back post, who powered a header past Schmeichel. Team news Burnley made one change with Johann Berg Gudmundsson making a return from injury to replace Georges-Kevin Nkoudou. Leicester made three changes with Hamza Choudhury, Demarai Gray and Shinji Okazaki coming into the XI. Leicester did grow into the game though, and forced two good saves from Nick Pope in the final ten minutes. The first came from a Riyad Mahrez header at the near post, but it landed in the hands of the goalkeeper down low, before Vardy's own headed effort down the middle on the stroke of half-time also went straight into the hands of his England team-mate. Both sides could have scored the next goal in the opening minutes of the second half. Gudmundsson saw his strike from the top of the area just whistle over the crossbar, before Vardy's attempt to sweep home from the middle of the box was turned around the post by Pope with a fingertip save. Chris Wood celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game with Ashley Barnes But Vardy did finally beat the Burnley goalkeeper in the 72nd minute. It was a classic break from the Foxes as Kelechi Iheanacho burst through the middle of the park before picking out Vardy through the middle, who hammered home past Pope to score in his fifth consecutive Premier League away game. Leicester suffered a blow when Schmeichel had to be substituted in the 85th minute after an earlier challenge from Barnes sent him tumbling over. The Burnley striker was booked and the goalkeeper attempted to carry on, but he was eventually replaced by Hamer. England Watch Gareth Southgate was watching on a Turf Moor and would surely have been impressed with Nick Pope who looked calm and assured throughout the game. James Tarkowski also produced another solid performance in the back line, with Harry Maguire doing the same on the opposite side and made some good forward passes in the second half. Jamie Vardy was mostly non-existent in the first half but was much better in the second, and doing his chances no harm by nabbing a good goal with other fine chances coming his way. Opta stats Burnley have won win five consecutive matches in the top-flight for the first time since November 1968 (six in a row). This is the first time the Clarets scored two goals within the opening 10 minutes of Premier League game. Kevin Long has registered goal involvements in consecutive league games (1 goal, 1 assist) for the first time since December 2011 for Accrington. Jamie Vardy has been on the losing side in eight Premier League games this season when he has scored, a record for a single campaign in the competition. Burnley's Chris Wood scores his side's first goal of the game in the Premier League match against Leicester City The managers Sean Dyche: \"It was a tough game. Leicester have had some ups and downs lately but they are still a very good side, an attacking side with the technical players that they've got,\" he added. \"But we made a very good, fast start and we took the game on which I was pleased with. We got ourselves in front but it's never comfortable when you're playing a good side.\" 3:40 Burnley boss Sean Dyche heaped praise on goalkeeper Nick Pope after his side defeated Leicester 2-1 at Turf Moor Burnley boss Sean Dyche heaped praise on goalkeeper Nick Pope after his side defeated Leicester 2-1 at Turf Moor Claude Puel: \"At the beginning of the game, in the first seven or eight minutes, we conceded two goals. It was crazy, but the second half, we had a lot of chances to score and just to score one goal in this game is crazy. \"Perhaps this afternoon, we deserved a different result at the end after all the chances. 4:24 Claude Puel praises Sean Dyche and his players after Burnley defeated Leicester 2-1 at Turf Moor Claude Puel praises Sean Dyche and his players after Burnley defeated Leicester 2-1 at Turf Moor The pundit Paul Merson: \"They were all over them at that stage [late in the game] but Burnley stayed strong and it looks like Europa League for them. It's a big ask for Southampton to win the FA Cup. \"Leicester gave it a go in the second-half but Pope was phenomenal. He produced some world class saves.\" 2:11 Paul Merson says despite going down 2-0 in the first ten minutes at Burnley, Leicester got back into the game well but were unable to pick up the points Paul Merson says despite going down 2-0 in the first ten minutes at Burnley, Leicester got back into the game well but were unable to pick up the points Man of the match - Nick Pope The Burnley goalkeeper was in more superb form on Saturday afternoon, making a number of important saves to keep Leicester at bay and secure a vital win for the hosts. He was strong from set pieces, coming out to collect cleanly and strongly, and looked at ease as the likes of Vardy and Mahrez peppered his goal towards the end of the first half and for much of the second. Kevin Long celebrates with teammate Jack Cork after doubling Burnley's lead at Turf Moor With Tom Heaton watching on from the bench and itching for a place back in the XI, it doesn't look like Pope is giving up his spot without a fight and could well be in between the sticks for the remainder of the season. What's next? Burnley are next in action on Thursday when they welcome Chelsea to Turf Moor live on Sky Sports Premier League.

Brighton at Selhurst Park Crystal Palace moved six points clear of the relegation zone after a flurry of first-half goals in their 3-2 win over rivals Brighton at Selhurst Park. Wilfried Zaha got two of the five scored before the break with James Tomkins also finding the net for the hosts, but goals from Glenn Murray and Jose Izquierdo twice pulled Brighton back to within striking distance. The visitors pushed hard for an equaliser after the interval with Wayne Hennessey saving well from Dale Stephens and Glenn Murray failing to find the target from point-blank range, but Palace held on for the points. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (7), Ward (6), Tomkins (6), Sakho (7), Van Aanholt (6), Milivojevic (8), Cabaye (6), Loftus-Cheek (7), McArthur (7), Zaha (8), Townsend (7) Subs: Benteke (6), Riedewald (6) Brighton: Ryan (6), Schelotto (5), Duffy (6), Dunk (5), Bong (6), Stephens (6), Kayal (6), Locadia (6), Gross (5), Izquierdo (6), Murray (6) Subs: Knockaert (6), Ulloa (5), March (6) Man of the match: Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace) The win takes Roy Hodgson's team above Swansea into 16th in the table, just one point behind Chris Hughton's Brighton and, more importantly, six clear of Southampton in 18th. Brighton could not match Palace's intensity in the early stages and were lackadaisical in sending only one man for a short corner in the fifth minute. Luka Milivojevic wandered into the box and drilled a low shot from a tight angle that found its way under the body of Mat Ryan before being turned in from near the goal-line by Zaha. Another corner saw Palace double the lead inside a quarter of an hour as Tomkins lashed home left-footed off the legs of Ryan after a scramble inside the penalty box (14). Brighton could not keep out James Tomkins' goal after a scramble Brighton soon responded through a corner of their own as Lewis Dunk was left unmarked to head into the path of Murray, who volleyed the ball high into the net against his former club (18). Palace's lead was restored midway through the first half when Ezequiel Schelotto elected not to track Zaha's run and the Palace hero headed in well from Milivojevic's lofted cross (24). Just when Hughton's side seemed out of it again, Izquierdo pulled the visitors to within one after eluding Joel Ward on the left and tucking neatly beyond Wayne Hennessey (34). Team news Crystal Palace made one change from the team that drew at Bournemouth with Joel Ward coming in for Aaron Wan-Bissaka at right-back. Brighton made two changes with the suspended Davy Propper replaced by Beram Kayal and Jurgen Locadia coming in for Solly March. It remained a feisty contest after the break with Dunk and Stephens both testing the patience of referee Andre Marriner and Brighton might well have snatched something late on. Firstly, Stephens struck a bouncing ball well with Hennessey doing brilliantly to save low to his right, and then Murray could not make the right connection with a left-wing cross. That was as close as Brighton came with Palace hanging on to take the points that leave both clubs well placed to renew their rivalry in the Premier League next season. Opta stats Crystal Palace ended a run of four top-flight home games without a victory (D1 L3), netting three goals in a league game at Selhurst Park for the first time since May 2017 (4-0 v Hull). Brighton have conceded in each of their last 12 Premier League games - the longest current run without a clean sheet in the division. Wilfried Zaha has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since March 2015 (v QPR and Stoke). Glenn Murray is the fifth player to score against Crystal Palace in the Premier League having previously played for them in the competition, and the first since Leon McKenzie in April 2005 (for Norwich). The managers Roy Hodgson: \"I thought after our first-half performance, which was arguably one of the best performances we have given here since I have come to the club, it was a little unfortunate that we conceded two goals from the only two clear-cut opportunities that came their way. \"Of course, that meant that in the second half, if they step up their game and play a few more balls forward into our penalty area, we would have to find a way to hang on to the victory. I am very pleased that the players managed to do that.\" 2:22 Roy Hodgson says his side put in one of their best performances of the season Roy Hodgson says his side put in one of their best performances of the season Chris Hughton: \"It was uncharacteristic. We have been very good at corners. It is not like us but it is very difficult to give those goals away and get something from the game. We arguably had the best chances in that second half to get an equaliser or a winner but you can't give the goals away that we gave away in the early period of that game.\" 3:53 Chris Hughton says all three goals that Brighton conceded were avoidable Chris Hughton says all three goals that Brighton conceded were avoidable Man of the match - Wilfried Zaha Milivojevic produced an impressive performance, controlling things for Palace in the middle of the park and providing two assists, but the sight of Zaha in full flow is just exhilarating. That is not news to Palace's supporters but for Zaha to find the net twice is a little rarer - this was the first time that he has done that in a Premier League game. Good timing. England watch Glenn Murray scored yet another goal for Brighton to make it 12 for the Premier League season. Too late for the veteran to force his way into Gareth Southgate’s plans? Probably, and the same goes for Andros Townsend. But Ruben Loftus-Cheek is proving his fitness again and the England manager will surely be taking note of that. What's next? The good news for Palace is that the remaining fixtures offer opportunities for points. It is Watford away next Saturday, then Leicester at home and Stoke away before West Brom are the visitors to Selhurst Park on the final day of the season. Brighton are in action before all that when they play host to Hughton's old club Tottenham on Tuesday evening. It is Burnley away next weekend before the trickiest of run-ins against Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool."}, {"date": "14/04/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance":

scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner as Huddersfield beat Watford 1-0 to move seven points clear of the relegation zone. In a game of few chances, the Huddersfield substitute swept the ball home from close range in the 91st minute to spark wild celebrations at the John Smith's Stadium. Victory sees David Wagner's side climb to 14th in the Premier League table with four games remaining and ends a run of five matches without a win. Watford, two points ahead of their hosts, have now lost four of their last five matches and remain winless on the road under Javi Gracia. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Hadergjonaj (7), Zanka (7), Schindler (7), Kongolo (6), Quaner (5), Hogg (6), Mooy (7), Van La Parra (6), Pritchard (6), Mounie (4) Subs: Ince (8), Depoitre (6), Billing (6) Watford: Karnezis (6), Janmaat (6), Mariappa (7), Prodl (5), Cathcart (6), Femenia (5), Doucoure (6), Capoue (4), Hughes (7), Pereyra (6), Deeney (5) Subs: Richarlison (5), Gray (5), Sinclair (n/a) Man of the match: Tom Ince Huddersfield settled the quicker of the two sides in a cagey first period and their tireless pressing kept Watford penned inside their own half. The pressure built as the half reached its midpoint but having dealt with a flurry of Huddersfield corners and conceded no clear chances, Watford began to grow into the game. Abdoulaye Doucoure twice tested Jonas Lossl, firstly with a tame effort from outside the box and then with a deflected shot from a tight angle that the Huddersfield keeper pushed round the post. The best chance of the half fell to Troy Deeney. Doucoure drove to the edge of the area, his pass was behind Roberto Pereyra but ran to Deeney, whose right-foot shot was deflected just wide. It was Watford who began the second half the brighter too with Will Hughes and Pereyra at the centre of a couple of flowing moves. Team news David Wagner made one change to the Huddersfield side that drew with Brighton as Colin Quaner replaced Tom Ince on the right. There was also just the one change for Watford as the fit-again Craig Cathcart came in for Jose Holebas, who was not named among in the 18. However, chances were not forthcoming and Huddersfield gradually worked their way back onto the front foot. Ince saw a goal-bound effort blocked soon after coming on, Steve Mounie wanted too long when the rebound fell kindly to him and Jonathan Hogg fizzed a low shot just wide as the game looked set to end in deadlock. Huddersfield were gifted one final chance though as Terence Kongolo's hopeful ball forward was not dealt with by the Watford defence, Mathias Jørgensen got on the end of it and stabbed the ball back across the six-yard box where Ince arrived to turn the ball into an empty net and seal a vital win. Man of the match - Tom Ince Quality was at a premium in West Yorkshire but after Huddersfield had huffed and puffed without ever really laying a glove on Watford, Ince came on with half an hour to go and made the final, telling contribution with his stoppage-time strike. Tom Ince scored a 91st minute winner for Huddersfield against Watford He gave Watford a warning of the threat he posed shortly after entering the fray, drifting into a dangerous position between the centre-backs to get on the end of Pritchard's cut back. Sebastian Prodl made a vital block on that occasion but when he popped up again in the 91st minute, there was no stopping him and he slid the ball home to earn Huddersfield a critical three points. Opta stats Huddersfield have won two of their last four Premier League games at home (D1 L1), after failing to win any of the previous five (D2 L3). In contrast, Watford have picked up just one point from a possible 30 away from home in the Premier League since December (D1 L9). Javier Gracia is yet to see Watford score an away Premier League goal in his first five matches on the road - the last manager to not see his side score in his first five away Premier League matches was Gus Poyet in December 2013. Tom Ince has scored in four of his last five league games against Watford, scoring exactly once on each occasion. The managers 4:30 Huddersfield boss David Wagner says his side are one step closer to Premier League safety after beating Watford Huddersfield boss David Wagner says his side are one step closer to Premier League safety after beating Watford David Wagner, Huddersfield: \"It is not only that they've won it, how they have won it makes it even bigger. With this very, very late goal they will always believe that it is possible. \"There was this magic moment from Zanka and Ince was in the right place and scored a great goal, a huge one for us. \"I think the game was very even, both teams neutralised each other, there were not a lot of chances but the one we had, we used. It's a fantastic afternoon for us.\" Javi Gracia, Watford: \"It is another situation similar to the last games, another goal in added time. I don't know if it is fair but it is another chance we've missed to get points. 2:29 Watford boss Javi Gracia was left frustrated once again as his side conceded late on, leaving them empty handed at Huddersfield Watford boss Javi Gracia was left frustrated once again as his side conceded late on, leaving them empty handed at Huddersfield \"I think they dominated the first 15-20 minutes, we tried to defend and create chances on the counter attack but after that we had more possession, we felt better playing more time in the opposition half.

For all of Swansea's early endeavour, Everton took the lead in fortuitous circumstances just before half-time when Kyle Naughton inadvertently headed the ball into his own goal (43). The hosts levelled after the break through Ayew (71), who marked his return from a three-match suspension with a fine half-volley into the far corner. Seamus Coleman and Tammy Abraham spurned opportunities for both sides late on as the match ended all square, leaving Swansea five points above the relegation zone with five games remaining. Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (6), Naughton (6), Fernandez (6), Mawson (7), Olsson (6), Carroll (7), King (6), Ki (6), Narsingh (7), A.Ayew (7), J.Ayew (7) Subs: Dyer (6), Abraham (5) Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (6), Keane (6), Jagielka (5), Baines (6), Gueye (7), Schneiderlin (5), Rooney (5), Bolasie (6), Walcott (5), Tosun (5) Subs: Baningime (6), Funes Mori (6), Vlasic (n/a) Man of the match: Jordan Ayew Jordan Ayew's half-volley earned Swansea a point at the Liberty Stadium Swansea started brightly, but were denied twice in quick succession as Jordan Ayew saw an attempt deflect wide off Leighton Baines before Federico Fernandez's header was cleared off the line by Cenk Tosun from the resulting corner. Moments later, a smart flick from Jordan Ayew played his brother, Andre, through on goal, but his shot on the stretch was comfortably saved by Jordan Pickford. Kyle Naughton (2nd r) scored an own goal to put Everton in the lead For Everton's opener, Lukasz Fabianski had got down well to keep out Yannick Bolasie's half-volley, but his save from Idrissa Gueye's follow-up ricocheted off Naughton's head and bounced over the line before Alfie Mawson could clear - it took a check of the watch to tell referee Lee Mason it was indeed a goal. Team news Swansea made three changes, with Jordan Ayew, Sung-Yeung Ki and Luciano Narsingh coming into the starting XI. Tammy Abraham and Mike van der Hoorn were among the substitutes, while Sam Clucas was not fit to feature. Everton's only change saw Idrissa Gueye come in for Tom Davies, who dropped to the bench. Pickford then denied Swansea twice in the opening stages of the second half, first flying to his right to keep out Tom Carroll's header before then standing tall to keep out Andre Ayew's attempt. Swansea's pressure eventually paid off, for moments after Mawson's header was cleared off the line, Carroll picked out Jordan Ayew out wide, with the striker calmly chesting the ball down before sending a sweet strike beyond Pickford's grasp. Swansea City manager Carlos Carvalhal celebrates his side's equaliser Both sides missed chances to score a winner, with Coleman's close-range effort striking the bar before Abraham fired well over from eight yards out. England World Cup watch Tammy Abraham came off the bench and missed a sitter for Swansea with the score at 1-1. Meanwhile, Alfie Mawson was solid in defence and almost headed the hosts level early in the second half. Jordan Pickford was solid in goal for Everton. There was little he could have done to keep out Jordan Ayew's equaliser, while he made a total of six saves. Michael Keane followed up an indifferent first half with a better display in the second, while Theo Walcott was somewhat disappointing in a wide role for the visitors. Opta stats Swansea have only lost one of their last eight Premier League meetings with Everton (W2 D5), with the Swans unbeaten in their last four at Liberty Stadium (W1 D3). Swansea City have conceded 13 own goals in the Premier League since 2014-15; five more than any other side. Since keeping two clean sheets in December, Everton have conceded in each of their last seven Premier League games on the road. Jordan Ayew has scored in three of his last four Premier League games at Liberty Stadium, including of his last two. Man of the match - Jordan Ayew After serving a three-match man, Ayew outlined his importance to Swansea with a standout performance at the Liberty Stadium. The 26-year-old linked up well with Carroll and brother Andre, and got the goal he richly deserved with 20 minutes to go. Jordan Ayew also played four key passes in the match and had another two attempts blocked. On another day, it could have been three or four for Swansea - but it's perhaps typical of their season that they could only score once. 3:20 Swansea boss Carlos Carvalhal says his side deserved to beat Everton after the sides drew 1-1 at the Liberty Stadium.

Sadio Mane opened the scoring after seven minutes as the hosts showed no signs of tiredness following their midweek Champions League victory over Manchester City. Salah made it 2-0 in the 69th minute when he expertly headed in from Trent Alexander-Arnold's superb pass, and Roberto Firmino added a late third to round off a comfortable win. Player ratings Liverpool: Karius (6), Alexander-Arnold (8), Van Dijk (7), Lovren (7), Robertson (7), Henderson (7), Wijnaldum (7), Oxlade-Chamberlain (8), Mane, (7) Salah (7), Firmino (7) Subs: Milner (6), Klavan (5), Solanke (5) Bournemouth: Begovic (5), Ake (6), Francis (5), S Cook (5), Daniels (5), Gosling (5), L Cook (6), Fraser (5), Ibe (4), King (4), Defoe (4) Subs: Mousset (5), Wilson (6), Surman (5) Man of the match: Trent Alexander-Arnold The result leaves Liverpool 10 points ahead of fifth-placed Chelsea, while Salah is five goals ahead of Harry Kane in the race for the Golden Boot and now has 40 for the season in all competitions. Bournemouth look as though they will be safe in the Premier League - with a 10-point cushion over the relegation zone - but they never looked like springing an upset at Anfield, where Liverpool are unbeaten in the league this season. Despite playing Man City just a few days earlier, the hosts were quick out of the blocks and, after Salah missed a good early chance, Mane did not make the same mistake as he saw a header saved by Asmir Begovic and followed up and fired the rebound in. Mohamed Salah celebrates after making it 2-0 At that stage it looked ominous for Bournemouth, but the visitors did not fold and managed to restrict Liverpool to half-chances for the rest of the first half. Alexander-Arnold saw a low free-kick pushed away by Begovic while Salah and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain shot wide and Mane headed past the post late in the half. The game continued in similar fashion after the break as Bournemouth defended deep and kept Liverpool at bay. However, the Cherries' resistance was broken in the 69th minute when Alexander-Arnold picked out Salah with a fantastic pass from deep and he looped a first-time header over Begovic. Mane and Firmino spurned chances to add to the lead before Bournemouth finally threatened, with Dan Gosling seeing a shot palmed away by Loris Karius and Callum Wilson dragging an effort wide. But it was the hosts who had the final say as Firmino finished at the near post to round off the win. Team news Liverpool made one change from their midweek win over Manchester City as Henderson returned from suspension in place of Milner. Former Liverpool winger Ibe started for Bournemouth along with King, as Wilson and Pugh dropped out. Opta stats Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 19 Premier League home games (W12 D7), the longest current run in the division, and the Reds' longest run since August 2009 (31 games). Bournemouth have enjoyed just one win in their last 11 Premier League away games, drawing six and losing four. Sadio Mane is now the outright top scoring Senegalese player in Premier League history, scoring 44 goals in the competition and eclipsing Demba Ba (43). Mohamed Salah is the eighth different player to score 30+ goals in a single Premier League season - he's also the first African to do so. Salah is also only the third different player in Liverpool history to score 40+ goals in all competitions in a single season, after Roger Hunt (1961-62) and Ian Rush (1983-84 and 1986-87). Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has equaled his best-ever Premier League goal involvement tally in a season (3 goals, 6 assists), level with 2016/17 (2 goals, 7 assists). Man of the match - Trent Alexander-Arnold Excellent in defence and also in attack, this was another encouraging display from the 19-year-old after impressing in the Champions League quarter-finals against Manchester City. His pass for Salah's goal was superb and he helped create several other opportunities with driving runs down the right. The managers Jurgen Klopp on Salah: \"It's all about him and all about us, how we finish the season. It's completely normal that a boy in that situation wants to be top of the scoring list, the Golden Boot. But we cannot force it; so, pass, shoot, pass, shoot, that's the normal thing to do. It's good and impressive. What a number. Wow!\" Eddie Howe: \"We've come up against a team that without doubt can win the Champions League, but these games are always valuable for our learning as a team. Only in the latter stages did we come into the game with the ball.\" What's next? Liverpool host West Brom next Saturday live on Sky Sports before the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Roma on Tuesday, April 24.

Christian Eriksen fortuitously halved the deficit three minutes before the interval and an improved second-half performance from Spurs left City in jeopardy of surrendering a two-goal lead just as they did in last week's Manchester derby.

Man of the Match: Raheem Sterling. City arrived at Wembley licking their wounds having been dumped out of the Champions League four days after Manchester United dramatically denied them the title. But there was no sign of self-pity from the champions-elect as they quickly settled into their groove, Leroy Sane rattling the post with a sliced fourth-minute volley. Raheem Sterling congratulates Gabriel Jesus after his opener at Wembley Sterling, Kevin de Bruyne and Gundogan all had shots on goal before Vincent Kompany's simple pass exploited Spurs' high backline, releasing Jesus who clinically finished past the on-rushing Hugo Lloris on 22 minutes. Things went from bad to worse for Spurs and their captain as Lloris' reckless lunge on Sterling - which appeared outside of the area - handed City a penalty which Gundogan coolly slotted home. Team news Tottenham made four changes as Kieran Trippier, Ben Davies, Eric Dier and Erik Lamela were recalled. There was also a spot on the bench for 19-year-old Kazaiah Sterling. Vincent Kompany, Ilkay Gundogan and Fabian Delph returned as Manchester City made three changes. Ben Davies' horrific 27th-minute tackle on Kompany typified Spurs' frustrations but there was salvation before the break for the hosts as Aymeric Laporte's clearance fired into the City goal off Eriksen. Ilkay Gundogan wheels away after doubling City's lead from the penalty spot That goal buoyed Spurs after the break but they were unable to convert their new-found vigour into goals, with City continuing to create the clearer chances. Jesus and Sterling spurned gilt-edged chances to score City's third but Sterling finally restored their two-goal lead on 72 minutes, converting a rebound from close range after Lloris failed to parry a Jesus shot away from danger. Christian Erisken pulled a goal back for Spurs but it failed to inspired a comeback All Spurs could muster by way of a response was a stoppage-time drive from Lucas Moura as the hosts were left to come to terms with their first league defeat since December 16. Opta stats Manchester City have won 14 away games in the Premier League this season - the only side to have won more in a single campaign is Chelsea in 2004/05 (15). Spurs were unbeaten in 14 games in the Premier League before tonight's defeat (W11 D3); indeed, the last team to beat them were Pep Guardiola's side back in December (4-1 at the Etihad). City have recorded a Premier League double over Spurs for the first time since the 2014/15 campaign (under Manuel Pellegrini). Prior to this evening, Spurs hadn't lost a Premier League home game by a margin of two or more goals since August 2014 (0-3 v Liverpool). Raheem Sterling scored his 22nd goal of the season for Manchester City, which is now at least twice as many as he's registered in any of his previous seasons in all competitions (11 in 2014/15 and 2015/16). Tottenham conceded a goal from the penalty spot in the Premier League for the first time in 59 games, last conceding against West Ham in November 2016. Man of the Match - Raheem Sterling during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City at Wembley Stadium on April 14, 2018 in London, England. Having spurned two clear chances to put last week's Manchester derby to bed and seen former club Liverpool progress at City's expense in the Champions League, it's fair to say Raheem Sterling has had better weeks. After a handful of missed opportunities at Wembley, question marks over his finishing undoubtedly remain, but the England international's character was the latest attribute to show signs of improvement as finally took his chance to propel City to the brink of the title. What's next? Tottenham travel to Brighton on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports Premier League, before contending their FA Cup semi-finals against Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday. Manchester City, meanwhile, can win the title with a home victory over Swansea on Nissan Super Sunday."}, {"date": "08/04/2018", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59374, "home_team": {"name":

recovered from a series of setbacks to claim a 3-2 victory over Southampton and keep Mark Hughes' side deep in relegation trouble. Charlie Austin looked to have earned a hard-fought point when he equalised (73) with only his second touch from the bench, but Welbeck scored his second of the game just eight minutes later and the header proved decisive. The result was tough on a Saints side that had punished a defensive mix-up to take a surprise lead through Shane Long (17), before further first-half goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (28) and Welbeck (38) wrestled the contest back in Arsenal's favour. An action-packed encounter descended into chaos in the closing moments as Jack Stephens and Mohamed Elneny saw red for angry reactions, but while Arsenal, on course for the Europe League semi-finals, can savour a sixth straight win in all competitions, Hughes' imperilled side remain three points from safety. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (7), Bellerin (6), Chambers (6), Mustafi (5), Kolasinac (6), Elneny (6), Xhaka (6), Iwobi (7), Nelson (6), Welbeck (7), Aubameyang (7). Subs: Lacazette (6), Wilshere (6), Holding (6). Southampton: McCarthy (7), Stephens (5), Yoshida (5), Hoedt (6), Cedric (7), Romeu (6), Hojbjerg (6), Bertrand (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Tadic (7), Long (7). Subs: Austin (7), Sims (6). Man of the match: Danny Welbeck Southampton striker Charlie Austin levelled the tie at 2-2 against Arsenal Arsene Wenger had made seven changes with Thursday's Moscow decider in mind and though the visitors were under pressure again early on, Tadic cynically clattering Reiss Nelson when the youngster dropped a shoulder, the game's first chance fell their way as Arsenal switched off. Tadic raced onto a forward punt, James Ward-Prowse's resulting effort cleared off the line, and the Serbian was afforded more space at the byline moments later with the hosts' brisk start seeming increasingly deceptive. Arsenal looked ragged and this time Tadic's attacking intent paid off, Long darting beyond Hector Bellerin before beating a dithering Shkodran Mustafi at the front post as Petr Cech was left to berate his team-mate. Shane Long opened the scoring for Southampton against Arsenal after 17 minutes Team news Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere, Nacho Monreal, and Alexandre Lacazette were on the bench, with Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny left out and Henrikh Mkhitaryan injured. Calum Chambers, Sead Kolasinac, Mohamed Elneny, Danny Welbeck, Alex Iwobi and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang came in, with Reiss Nelson handed his first Premier League start. Mark Hughes made four changes from a 3-0 defeat to West Ham with Manolo Gabbiadini, Nathan Redmond, Charlie Austin and Mario Lemina replaced by Maya Yoshida, Oriol Romeu, Shane Long and James Ward-Prowse. A sparse home crowd bristled as their side laboured but Aubameyang hauled them back into the contest just before the half-hour mark, the finish on the stretch scruffy but the back-flick into his path from Welbeck inspired. Alex Iwobi had played in Welbeck for the equaliser and he found the striker again as Arsenal finally took command seven minutes before the break, Welbeck cutting inside before firing a ball that looped in off Maya Yoshida's leg. Iwobi, drifting dangerously between the lines, tested McCarthy himself after the restart but the Gunners remained vulnerable while their lead was slender and after Cech thwarted Pierre-Emile Hojberg, Mohamed Elneny cleared a Wesley Hoedt header off the line. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang levelled for Arsenal after Shane Long's opener for Southampton Long made Cech work again when he rose to meet a Ryan Bertrand corner and showed sharp reactions to divert Cedric's effort into the back of the net with just over an hour gone, a warning fired even if the flag was raised. Aubameyang left the field for Alexandre Lacazette to a standing ovation while Hughes threw on Austin as a second striker in a change that proved pivotal, the substitute tapping in for swift impact when Cedric centred. Welbeck missed a glorious chance from just yards out when Jack Wilshere had stretched to keep a move alive but he made no mistake shortly after with a back-post header following more fine work by Iwobi. The Saints were reduced to 10 men in stoppage time after Stephens was dismissed for his reaction to having his shirt pulled by Wilshere, before Elneny was sent off for a shove on Cedric as tempers flared before the whistle finally came. Opta stats Arsenal have won six matches in a row in all competitions for the first time since May 2017 (also six). Mark Hughes has now lost each of his 11 trips to Arsenal in the Premier League. Only Harry Redknapp against Manchester United (15) is on a longer wait for an away win against an opponent in the competition. Pierre Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in seven goals in his first seven Premier League games (six goals, one assist), more than any other player in their first seven appearances for the Gunners. Charlie Austin has scored in each of his four Premier League games against Arsenal (four goals), including in both of his appearances at the Emirates. England watch Danny Welbeck's two goals and man-of-the-match performance will no doubt have caught Southgate's eye, and his nine goals this term is his best return since joining from Man Utd in 2014. Jack Wilshere came on late and was involved in a late ruccus with Jack Stephens, which saw the Saints man sent off. For Southampton, Ryan Bertrand was busy and solid at left-back, as was James Ward-Prowse, with both putting in 6/10 displays. The managers Arsene Wenger: \"When you play every three days it is difficult to get into the pace of the game, and when you look at the game today, we were twice in difficult situations at 1-0 down and at 2-2, and again we found the response to win the game. \"It shows we have the resources, and the spirit especially I would say, that even when the legs don't respond as much as you want, we have the mental resources still to win the game.\" Welbeck celebrates scoring Arsenal's second goal, his first Mark Hughes: \"We've got difficult games coming up, we understand that, but what you have to show is qualities and strengths in your play and mind-set, and for the most part I saw what I needed to see today. \"Confidence has been a little bit low, something I've recognised since I came into Southampton, but it won't be damaged today. I think confidence will be high after today.\" Man of the match - Danny Welbeck The England forward had not scored a single league goal since September last year, but proved the catalyst for a much-changed Arsenal side with two goals and a stylish assist.

RIP, Ray. pic.twitter.com/oFRH7tpyzL — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) April 8, 2018 After a quiet opening, Chelsea had the ball in the back of the net in the 25th minute but Alvaro Morata was correctly flagged for offside after being played in by Eden Hazard. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (7), Rudiger (7), Alonso (6), Moses (6), Cahill (5), Azpilicueta (7), Fabregas (6), Kante (7), Hazard (6), Willian (7), Morata (6). Subs: Pedro (5), Giroud (6), Emerson (6). West Ham: Hart (9), Cresswell (6), Rice (7), Ogbonna (7), Zabaleta (7), Kouyate (6), Noble (7), Masuaku (6), Fernandes (6), Joao Mario (6), Arnautovic (8). Subs: Hernandez (8), Evra (6). Man of the match: Joe Hart Morata's flick then drifted wide of the far post after yet more good work from Hazard before Willian fired inches wide from the edge of the penalty area, and the Brazil international was in again in the 35th minute after yet more sensational passing from Chelsea but Joe Hart raced off his line to make a brilliant block. Chelsea' dominance eventually told from the resultant corner and West Ham switched off as Morata headed Victor Moses' cross back into the danger area where Azpilicueta was there tap home from inside the six-yard box. Cesar Azpilicueta celebrates scoring against West Ham Chelsea went in search for a second after the break and Willian had an immediate chance to double the hosts' advantage but his shot fizzed past the far post. Conte's side thought they had their second when Morata swept home Willian's cross, but again the offside flag was up to deny the Spain striker before Moses curled wide of the upright. Team news Conte made two changes after last weekend's loss to Tottenham, with Thibaut Courtois and Gary Cahill back in the starting XI. They replaced Willy Caballero and Andreas Christensen, who were both named as substitutes. West Ham also kept changes to a minimum with Moyes making just the one switch with the injured Michail Antonio replaced by Edimilson Fernandes. They were punished midway through the second-half as Gary Cahill's poor defensive header fell to Marko Arnautovic and his cut back picked out Hernandez, who produced a sweet strike from just inside the area to beat Thibaut Courtois. In a frantic final 10 minutes, Hart had to be at his best to produce two saves to deny Marcos Alonso and Olivier Giroud, while West Ham thought they should have had a penalty as N'Golo Kante's last-ditch tackle sent Arnautovic to the floor, but referee Kevin Friend remained unmoved. Opta stats Chelsea failed to win a Premier League game at Stamford Bridge under Conte in which they led at half-time for the first time, having won all 18 of their previous games under the Italian when ahead at the interval. West Ham avoided defeat in an away Premier League game against the reigning champions for only the third time, beating Man Utd in 2001-02 and drawing 2-2 with Chelsea in 2015-16. Azpilicueta scored his fifth Premier League goal for Chelsea in his 191st appearance - all five of his goals have been against sides beginning with W (two against Watford, two against West Brom and one against West Ham). Morata assisted Azpilicueta's goal, the seventh time the two have combined in the Premier League this season - no two players have combined for more goals this campaign. Hernandez has scored four of his 16 Premier League goals as a substitute against Chelsea - only one player in Premier League history has scored more sub goals against an opponent, with Julian Joachim scoring five against Derby County. This was the fourth time Hernandez has appeared as a substitute at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League and the Mexican has found the net in all four of those games (four goals). Man of the Match - Joe Hart Joe Hart produced a man-of-the-match display against Chelsea Hart put in a reminder to England manager Gareth Southgate's with a fine performance at Stamford Bridge, which included some world-class saves. In the first-half, the 30-year-old was quickly off his line to make a smart block to deny Willian before two saves in the final minutes helped the Hammers to what could be a crucial point in their bid to stay in the Premier League. The first saw him show excellent reactions in tipping Alonso's powerful drive over the crossbar before quick feet allowed him to tip Giroud's goal-bound header around the post. England Watch Gareth Southgate’s assistant Steve Holland was in the stands to see Joe Hart produce a man-of-the-match display. It was a timely return to form for the 30-year-old as the battle to become England’s No. 1 heats up. It wasn’t such good news for Gary Cahill, who played the full 90 minutes at the heart of Chelsea’s back three. It was his poor defensive header which led to Javier Hernandez’s equaliser. Meanwhile, there was an injury blow for Aaron Cresswell. The left-back had to leave the field in the 63rd minute after landing awkwardly challenging for a high ball with Willian. Slaven Bilic, who was watching the game for Sky Sports, said: \"It was his best game I think. He kept West Ham in the game because in the second half, it looked more like Chelsea were going to score the second goal rather than West Ham would equalise. Jamie Redknapp agreed, saying: \"He's probably given Gareth Southgate a problem he didn't want to a certain extent becaue he is maybe looking at Jack Butland or Jordan Pickford and all of a sudden, Joe Hart has come into the equation. A nice problem, but one he might not have wanted.\" What's next?

Everton's search for a Merseyside derby win extended to 17 games as they played out a 0-0 draw with Liverpool in the Premier League on Saturday. Both Jordan Pickford and Loris Karius produced brilliant saves to keep the scores level in the first half, with Dominic Solanke, James Milner and Yannick Bolasie all denied. Everton missed two glorious chances late on through Seamus Coleman and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, and in the end Liverpool were holding on for a point. Gini Wijnaldum and Tom Davies compete in the first half at Goodison Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (6), Keane (7), Jagielka (7), Baines (6), Schneiderlin (6), Davies (6), Rooney (5), Bolasie (5), Walcott (6), Tosun (6) Subs: Gueye (6), Calvert-Lewin (5), Baningime (NA) Liverpool: Karius (7), Clyne (6), Van Dijk (6), Lovren (6), Klavan (6), Milner (7), Wijnaldum (7), Henderson (6), Mane (5), Ings (6), Solanke (6) Subs: Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Firmino (5), Alexander-Arnold (NA) Man of the match: Gini Wijnaldum The result means Liverpool stay in third in the Premier League, while Everton are ninth. Jurgen Klopp made five changes from the side that beat City 3-0 on Wednesday, with Tuesday's Champions League quarter-final second leg in mind, as Danny Ings, Solanke, Nathaniel Clyne and Ragnar Klavan all started. Fresh from their epic midweek win against City, Liverpool had the first chance through Solanke, whose close-range effort was superbly saved by Jordan Pickford as the ball fell fortuitously to him. Bolasie came close at the other end, but Loris Karius produced one of the saves of the season to tip away his fine, curling shot from 25 yards. Team news Jurgen Klopp made five changes after the 3-0 win over Man City, ahead of the second leg on Tuesday night. Clyne, Klavan, Wijnaldum, Solanke and Ings came in, replacing Alexander-Arnold, Robertson, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Firmino and the injured Salah. For Everton, Davies came in for Calvert-Lewin in the only change from the 3-1 defeat by Man City last week. Liverpool's Sadio Mane takes on Seamus Coleman It was a battle of the goalkeepers in the first half, and Pickford did his bit again, getting his fingertips on Milner's goal-bound shot from the corner of the box in front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate. The opening stages of the second half were dour, and the only flashpoint came when Wayne Rooney was substituted off before the hour mark, looking extremely frustrated as he left the pitch. It was Everton who nearly grabbed the victory with two fine opportunities late on. First, Cenk Tosun's header across goal evaded the boot of Coleman by inches as he stretched a yard from goal, before Calvert-Lewin miscued his effort wide from 12 yards with the goal gaping. Jurgen Klopp gives his side instructions from the touchline Man of the match - Gini Wijnaldum In a game where defences were on top, the standout player on the ball was Wijnaldum, who completed 94 per cent of his passing at Goodison. He made 81 passes in total, more than any other player, and won possession seven times. In among Liverpool's swashbuckling attacks, the Dutchman is the calm required in central midfield. The managers Sam Allardyce: \"I think in the end, when you finish the game as strongly as that, and bring yourself back into it, put Liverpool under pressure, I suppose we're rather unlucky with the Cenk Tosun header. \"The second half basis was the pleasing thing. I know the crowd got a bit frustrated, but we build on that basis by limiting a team who are very good in an attacking sense this year.\" Jurgen Klopp: \"I think we controlled around 60, 70 minutes of the game, and then it got quite emotional, which is normal I expected that! I am completely fine with the result. Again, clean sheet and good defending. \"Another point, away, and not long to drive home! So all good, and we prepare for the next game. I think until then it was not exactly the game the people wanted, but it was not our job to deliver that. We were here for getting a result, it's not our 1A solution, but it is 1B.\" England watch Gareth Southgate watched a total of 15 English players at Goodison Park during the goalless draw in the Merseyside derby, and nobody in a red or blue shirt did their England chances too much harm. For Everton, Jordan Pickford made two world class saves, Michael Keane and Phil Jagielka were strong in defence to earn a clean sheet, but Theo Walcott and Tom Davies were relatively underwhelming.Nathaniel Clyne made his first appearance of the season, putting in a steady display, while James Milner was at his energetic best. Danny Ings and Dominic Solanke worked hard off the ball but were largely absent on it, and Jordan Henderson kept things ticking without anything spectacular in midfield. Opta stats This was only the second Merseyside derby in Premier League history without a single card shown and first since their maiden clash in the competition in December 1992. Five of the last six Premier League meetings between these sides at Goodison Park have ended level. Everton have scored just four goals in their last nine top-flight Merseyside derbies, failing to score in five of those games. Liverpool are unbeaten in 17 games in all competitions against Everton (W8 D9) - their longest ever run without defeat against their Merseyside neighbours. What's next? Liverpool now go to Manchester City on Tuesday in their Champions League quarter-final second leg, leading 3-0 from the first, while Everton have a trip to Swansea on Saturday in the Premier

2-2 Crystal Palace Bournemouth 2-2 Crystal Palace Josh King's 89th-minute strike salvaged a point for Bournemouth as they came from behind twice to draw 2-2 against Crystal Palace at the Vitality Stadium. After a goalless first half, Crystal Palace took the lead just two minutes into the second half as Luka Milivojevic whipped a wonderful free-kick into the top corner from the edge of the box. Bournemouth struck back through Lys Mousset's effort, before Wilfried Zaha restored Palace's one-goal advantage with a moment of individual brilliance. However, just as they did last week against Watford, Bournemouth rescued a point in the final stages as King prodded in from close range from a corner to leave Palace ruing more dropped points. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Francis (6), S. Cook (6), Ake (7), Daniels (6), Pugh (6), Gosling (6), L. Cook (6), Fraser (6), Defoe (6), Wilson (5) Subs: Mousset (7), King (7), Surman (N/A) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Wan-Bissaka (6), Tomkins (6), Sakho (6), Van Aanholt (6), Milivojevic (8), Cabaye (7), Loftus-Cheek (7), McArthur (6), Zaha (7), Townsend (6) Subs: N/A Man of the match: Luka Milivojevic (Crystal Palace) Bournemouth started brightly and should have taken the lead inside the opening minute through Callum Wilson. Charlie Daniels' searching ball from the left somehow evaded Mamadou Sakho to go through to Wilson, but the striker, perhaps expecting the Frenchman to intercept, was slow to react and bobbled his shot wide. Both sides were wasteful in the first half but it was a different story in the second. Just two minutes after half-time, Palace took the lead thanks to a stunning free-kick from Milivojevic on the edge of the box, after Jermain Defoe had been penalised for a foul on Yohan Cabaye. Shortly after, the visitors had a great chance to double their lead as Zaha released Patrick Van Aanholt clean through on goal, but the Dutchman was foiled by Asmir Begovic. It was a costly miss, as with 65 minutes played, Bournemouth equalised through the substitute Mousset who found the bottom corner with a precise finish from the edge of the box. Palace went ahead again 10 minutes later thanks to a brilliant individual goal from Zaha. Up until that point, the Eagles' talisman had endured a frustrating afternoon, but he produced the goods when it mattered, pirouetting brilliantly away from Fraser's sliding challenge before lashing a left-footed strike past Begovic. Team news Eddie Howe made three changes with Simon Francis, Marc Pugh and Jermain Defoe coming in for Jordon Ibe, Josh King and Junior Stanislas, who was ruled out for the season in midweek with a knee injury.Roy Hodgson made two changes to his side as Ruben Loftus-Cheek and James Tomkins replaced Martin Kelly and the injured Christian Benteke. Bournemouth's goalkeeper made a wonderful reaction save to prevent a deflected Andros Townsend strike nestling in the top corner, and that proved to be a decisive moment as Bournemouth grabbed a second equaliser soon afterwards. Centre-back Nathan Ake popped up on the left wing and saw his cross towards Defoe turned away by Sakho for a corner. However, from the resulting set-piece, Bournemouth equalised with Steve Cook nodding the cross towards the back post where King, another substitute, was lurking and he made no mistake from a couple of yards out. The result means that Bournemouth inched closer to the 40-point mark, while Palace are still hovering just outside the relegation zone with three points separating them from Southampton who have two games in hand. England watch Eddie Howe championed Jermain Defoe’s chances of a World Cup call-up pre-match but the veteran striker had a frustrating day with most of Bournemouth’s best chances instead dropping to his strike partner Calum Wilson.Lewis Cook made his senior debut last month and was industrious without exerting too much control on proceedings with Milivojevic and Cabaye generally dominating the midfield battle.Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who was the man of the match against Germany last November, enhanced his prospects with an eye-catching display of the left wing while Andros Townsend was bright in an unfamiliar central striker role. Man of the match - Luka Milivojevic A candidate for man of the match virtually every week, Luka Milivojevic delivered another excellent performance in Crystal Palace's engine room alongside the similarly impressive Yohan Cabaye. Milivojevic completed more passes (66) than any other player on the pitch and had the second-highest number of touches with 77, highlighting how involved and influential he was throughout. Luka Milivojevic is the 2nd Serbian player to score 10+ PL goals in a single season after Savo Milosevic (12 for Aston Villa in 1995-96) #PL pic.twitter.com/tcsu941nLv — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) April 7, 2018 The Serbian capped his display with an exceptional free-kick, making him the first Crystal Palace midfielder to reach ten league goals in a season.

Solly March (centre) celebrates after his shot is deflected into his own net by Jonas Lossl Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Schelotto (7), Bong (6), Dunk (7), Duffy (5), Stephens (6), Propper (5), March (7), Izquierdo (6), Gross (6), Murray (6). Subs: Kayal (5), Ulloa (5) Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Hadergjonaj (6), Kongolo (6), Schindler (6), Zanka (6), Hogg (6), Mooy (7), van La Parra (6), Ince (5), Pritchard (8), Mounie (7). Subs: Billing (5), Quaner (n/a), Depoitre (n/a) Man of the match: Alex Pritchard Brighton, who stay 13th, nearly made the perfect start as Propper latched onto Ezequiel Schelotto's long ball over the top to breach the Terriers defence but the Dutchman - still awaiting his first Brighton goal - fired wide. Huddersfield - who remain 16th - responded as Mounie warmed the gloves of Ryan having been set-up by Terrence Kongolo, before Lossl got down smartly at the feet of Jose Izquierdo during a blistering opening 15 minutes. Brighton made the breakthrough as March took aim 25 yards out, with his shot rolling a yard over the line after the ball had ricocheted off a post and the outstretched arm of Lossl. Dale Stephens is challenged by Alex Pritchard at the Amex Stadium Team news Brighton made two changes from the side that lost 2-0 at home to Leicester with Dale Stephens and Solly March coming in for Jurgen Locadia and Beram Kayal. Huddersfield selected Florent Hadergjonaj at right back in place of Tommy Smith while Elias Kachunga was replaced by Tom Ince and Steve Mounie came in for Laurent Depoitre up front. But a lapse of concentration from Shane Duffy down the other end allowed Mounie to end Huddersfield's goal drought - which stood at 427 minutes - meaning it was all square at the interval. Brighton had the first good chance of the second half as Lewis Dunk rose to meet March's inviting free-kick, but the defender could only direct his header wide. Lossl then produced a superb save to deny Dale Stephens but Huddersfield were handed a numerical advantage with 16 minutes remaining. Propper dived into a 50-50 challenge with Hogg but led with his studs, leaving referee Anthony Taylor with little choice but to show a red card. Despite the dismissal, it was Brighton who came closest to finding a winner with Lossl rushing out to deny Izquierdo as the points were shared. The managers Chris Hughton: \"It's a hard-earned point but it was definitely a missed opportunity. We kicked ourselves in the foot again as we started the game really well. \"Even with 10 men, we've had the best chance of the game. In a game that could've gone either way, we've had the best chances. On the balance of play and chances, it's a game we should've won and deserved to win.\" David Wagner: \"I'm pleased with how we bounced back. We've been in a difficult moment and this was great. I'm please with the performance and they were brave on the ball. We deserved the point. \"Some people said at the beginning of the season that we were completely inexperienced so an away point in this league is always good. It could be a crucial point come the end of the season.\" Opta stats Brighton are unbeaten in their last six home league meetings with Huddersfield (W3 D3), since a 2-3 loss in League One in April 2011. Huddersfield have conceded in each of their last 14 on the road in the Premier League - the longest such run in the competition this season. There have been more own goals scored in Premier League games involving Brighton this season than any other team (6 in total - 5 against, 1 for). Courtesy of Steve Mounie's 32nd minute strike, Huddersfield netted their first goal in 427 minutes of Premier League action. Mounie has bagged three goals in his two Premier League games against Brighton this season, 43% of his total top-flight haul this season (3/7). Huddersfield have seen an opponent sent off four times in the top-flight this season, a figure only Burnley can better (6). Man of the match - Alex Pritchard The 24-year-old made a strong impression during an energetic display, playing off striker Mounie with just his final pass denying him from capping his performance with a decisive contribution. Huddersfield still have work to do if they are to retain their top-flight status, and Pritchard could be vital to their chances in the coming weeks after showing his willingness to be the side's creative force. In a game of individual quality, it was the former Tottenham winger who looked most promising in the closing stages as Huddersfield pressed for a winner. England World Cup Watch There were few players on show who can have any lingering hopes of a late dash for England’s plane to Russia this summer, but should injuries come to key personnel in attack, this was not a good audition for the ultimate outsider. Glenn Murray has been in superb form this season, but he was left extremely frustrated by a lack of service before his withdrawal without having tested Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl. Pritchard, who has represented England nine times at Under-21 level, showed his class with his darting runs and quality on the ball but the Three Lions are well-stocked in that department off the front man and this summer must surely come too soon for him.

was enough to earn Newcastle a 2-1 victory at Leicester, moving Rafa Benitez's men 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Newcastle were by far the better side in the first half, and deservedly took the lead 18 minutes in through Jonjo Shelvey - his first Premier League goal for Newcastle. With Leicester pressing for an equaliser, Newcastle caught the hosts cold on the counter with Ayoze Perez making it two, with a helping hand from Leicester's defenders, in the 75th minute. Jamie Vardy's goal - with Leicester's first and only shot on target in the match - six minutes from time made for a nervy ending, but Newcastle held on to record their third win in a row, with the three points taking them up to 10th in the Premier League table and within touching distance of safety. Leicester stay eighth. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6) Simpson (6), Morgan (6), Maguire (6), Chilwell (6), Albrighton (6), Diabate (5), Silva (6), Mahrez (5), Iborra (5), Vardy (6).

Subs: Atsu (6), Joselu (6), Hayden (6) Man of the match: Jamaal Lascelles Newcastle started with plenty of confidence, and were the better team in the opening exchanges. Perez almost found the net as early as the fourth minute, but his header was well saved by Kasper Schmeichel in the home goal. The visitors continued to press and deservedly took the lead 18 minutes in. Perez pulled the ball back for Shelvey, who threw the dummy to put two Leicester defenders on the deck, before guiding the ball into the bottom corner. Leicester were poor in the first half, and offered no threat whatsoever to the Newcastle goal as the visitors cruised into the interval, with the only worry coming when the hosts had strong penalty appeals waved away late in the half after Riyad Mahrez appeared to be felled. Team news Rafa Benitez named the same starting XI that beat Huddersfield 1-0 last weekend. Two changes from the Leicester side who beat Brighton last time out. Fousseni Diabate came in for the suspended Wilfred Ndidi, while Adrien Silva started in place of Shinji Okazaki. Newcastle continued to look in control in the second half, as Leicester remained little threat in attack. Out of nowhere, Perez netted a sublime second to put the visitors further in command with 15 minutes left. Perez simply latched onto a long, hopeful punt forward, Harry Maguire and Wes Morgan both allowed the ball to bounce, neither challenged for it, Schmeichel came racing out of his goal but immediately turned back, allowing the Newcastle forward the opportunity to loft the ball into the empty net, which he executed perfectly. Leicester did get one back through Vardy, who stole in at the back post to fire home after Shinji Okazaki had knocked the ball down, but Newcastle remained comfortable in seeing out another crucial victory. Opta stats England watch Despite Jamie Vardy getting on the scoresheet late on – his fourth goal in as many games in all competitions – the England striker was otherwise very ineffective, making only 25 touches in the match – the fewest of any outfield player to have started the match. Harry Maguire’s afternoon was not overly impressive either, as his indecision was a major factor in Newcastle going two in front.Jonjo Shelvey did his chances of earning a surprise World Cup call-up a great deal of good with his fine goal. Newcastle recorded their first victory at the King Power Stadium in all competitions, having previously lost three and drawn two. Leicester lost for the first time in seven home Premier League games, since a 0-3 defeat to Crystal Palace in December (W2 D4). Newcastle have won three consecutive Premier League games or the first time since September. Ayoze Perez both scored and assisted in a single Premier League game for just the third time in his career and first time since October 2015 vs Norwich Ayoze Perez celebrates scoring Newcastle's second goal Man of the match - Jamaal Lascelles The Newcastle captain again led by example, and did not put a front wrong all match. He kept Vardy very quiet for the majority of the contest and kept things simple, making a colossal 11 clearances in the match, compared to the next highest amount - four from Florian Lejeune. Sometimes, such simplicity can make all the difference.

Highlights: Stoke 1-2 Tottenham Christian Eriksen's double left Stoke deep in relegation trouble as Tottenham won 2-1 at the bet365 Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The Dane stroked home the opener seven minutes after half-time and his free-kick on 63 minutes proved to be the winner, even though Harry Kane claimed he got the final touch on its way past Jack Butland. In between those goals, Mame Biram Diouf had equalised for Stoke (57), capitalising on a mistake from Hugo Lloris before stroking into an unguarded net. The win sees Tottenham move level on points with Liverpool, but they remain in fourth place on goal difference, while Stoke remain in 19th and are four points from safety with five games to play.

In the 12th minute, the unmarked Diouf fired over the bar from the edge of the six-yard box, before Butland did brilliantly to deny Heung-Min Son when clean through midway through the half. However, the breakthrough came seven minutes into the second period when Mousa Dembele found Dele Alli inside the Stoke area and instead of squaring to Kane he delayed and pulled the ball back for Eriksen to stroke the ball first time into the corner. Team news Harry Kane started for Tottenham in one of four changes from the win over Chelsea. Danny Rose, Victor Wanyama and Serge Aurier all started with Ben Davies, Eric Dier and Erik Lamela dropping to the bench and Kieran Tripper not in the matchday squad. Mame Diouf recovered from a calf injury, so Paul Lambert stuck with the same team that lost at Arsenal last weekend, though Saido Berahino was left out of the squad. Stoke were level just five minutes later when Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris, on his 200th Premier League appearance, raced off his line to win the ball just outside the area. However, his attempted clearance was straight at Diouf who bravely closed the ball down before rolling it into an empty net. But Tottenham's lead was restored six minutes later when Moritz Bauer conceded a needless free-kick and Eriksen's delivery from the left sailed past everybody and into the net - though Kane was adamant he'd got a faint touch on the ball on his return to the starting line-up. Xherdan Shaqiri went close to levelling when his finely-struck free-kick rattled the bar with 10 minutes remaining, but Stoke could not avoid a fourth straight defeat and time is now running out for them to preserve their Premier League status. Opta stats Mousa Dembele and Joe Allen in action during the first half Mauricio Pochettino took charge of his 200th Premier League game (W103 D53 L44) He is the first non-European manager to reach the landmark in the competition. Spurs have won more Premier League away games at the bet365 Stadium than any other team (7). Spurs are on the longest current unbeaten run in the Premier League (14 - W11 D3), and are the only side yet to lose in 2018. Christian Eriksen now has 10 Premier League goals this season - his joint-best return in a single campaign. Mame Biram Diouf has scored as many Premier League goals in 2017-18 (6) as he did in his previous two campaigns combined. Dele Alli has provided more league assists this season than in any other campaign (10). The managers Paul Lambert (Stoke): \"I thought we were excellent against a really good side. The way they played, the way they committed and the way they went at them was excellent. Spurs have beaten Stoke the last few times really heavily and I'm pretty sure that wasn't an easy game for them. If we keep playing like that - and I still think we need to win three games or so - we will certainly do it. If you ask me how proud I am of the team, I thought we were outstanding.\" Mauricio Pochettino (Tottenham): \"It was so tough. I told you in my press conference yesterday that it should be a more difficult game than against Chelsea because to match the hunger and motivation of Stoke and play in a difficult atmosphere is always tough. That's what happened during the game. It was a tougher game, but I think we deserved the victory. We were better, but we suffered a lot. We fought a lot to get the three points.\" Christian Eriksen takes a shot on goal under pressure from Erik Pieters The pundit - Phil Thompson \"Stoke City gave this a good bash today, they really did. Paul Lambert will wonder how much more they have to give. It was all Stoke late on, they just didn't get a proper opening. Paul Lambert will be proud of his side and rightly so, but it was another defeat. There are not many game-changers on the bench, but this was not bad today. They've got to give that same commitment and not just do it against the big sides. They will have to do it away at West Ham.\" England watch Harry Kane was not at his fluent best, but got 90 minutes under his belt and was denied a goal when the Premier League reviewed Spurs’ winner and awarded it to Christian Eriksen. Dele Alli was not as influential as in his previous match with Chelsea, but Danny Rose started and played well on the left. Eric Dier was dropped to the bench and only came on for the final eight minutes, while Kieran Trippier was not even in the matchday squad. Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland made a superb save in the first half, but should arguably have been more decisive in coming out to claim the Eriksen free-kick which proved to be the winning goal. Man of the Match - Christian Eriksen Tottenham Hotspur's Christian Eriksen celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game with teammate Harry Kane Harry Kane was adamant he had scored Tottenham's second, but the record books will show Christian Eriksen was the matchwinner and two goals were a just reward for a solid display. Set-pieces were a constant source of opportunity for Spurs against a dogged Stoke side and after clinically stroking in the opener, his pinpoint delivery in the 63rd minute ultimately proved to be the defining moment of the match.

Burnley Sam Vokes' goal 22 seconds after coming on inspired Burnley to a 2-1 turnaround win at Watford. Vokes was presented with the perfect opening when Adrian Mariappa nodded Ashley Westwood's free-kick towards his own goal, cancelling out Roberto Pereyra's opener when he slotted in a loose ball nine minutes earlier (61). The Hornets had dominated both the game and the chances at Vicarage Road up to that point, but were stunned when Kevin Long headed another Westwood delivery back across goal, where Jack Cork nodded in (73) despite Orestis Karnezis' impressive palm away, which was adjudged to have been behind the line. Player ratings Watford: Karnezis (6), Janmaat (7), Prodl (6), Mariappa (6), Holebas (5), Capoue (6), Doucoure (6), Femenia (7), Hughes (8), Pereyra (7), Deeney (6). Subs: Okaka (5), Richarlison (n/a), Carrillo (n/a) Burnley: Pope (7), Lowton (5), Tarkowski (7), Long (7), Ward (6), Lennon (6), Cork (7), Westwood (7), N'koudou (5), Barnes (5), Wood (6) Subs: Vokes (7), Hendrick (n/a) Man of the match: XXX The Clarets' win is their fourth straight top-flight victory, a feat they last achieved in 1968, while Watford have lost when scoring first for the fourth time this season. Burnley had the ball in the Watford goal inside two minutes, but Chris Wood's header was ruled out for a narrow offside. But if that was a warning sign for the Hornets, they heeded it well. Burnley did not manage a shot on target before the break, while Pereyra forced two good saves from Nick Pope in a half the home side dominated. England watch Nick Pope did his England credentials no harm at all, was left blameless for Watford's goal and dealt with their late onslaught of high balls confidently. Will Hughes' performance again impressed - if he keeps this up, perhaps it's not too late for the 22-year-old to stake an unlikely claim. Pereyra and Will Hughes were running the show, and the two combined for the opener 16 minutes after the restart when Hughes danced through the Burnley defence, was tackled by James Tarkowski and the loose ball popped up for the Argentine, who calmly slotted in. But the introduction of Vokes from the bench would spark Burnley's comeback. Barely 20 seconds after his introduction, Westwood's deep free-kick was nodded goalwards by Mariappa, catching out the Watford defence and leaving the Welshman unmarked to level from close range. And three minutes later a shellshocked Watford were down and out. Another free-kick was kept in play by Long, and Burnley's players were cautious to celebrate Cork's header before referee Paul Tierney whistled for the goal. Team news Watford were unchanged from their 2-2 draw with Bournemouth last weekend. Burnley's one alteration was enforced, with Ben Mee missing out and Kevin Long taking his place. Tom Heaton returned to the bench after his long stretch out. Watford brought on Richarlison, Andre Carrillo and Stefano Okaka as they pushed for an equaliser, but never seriously threatened Pope as Burnley saw out the game with relative ease. Man of the match - Will Hughes The young Englishman did not deserve to be on the losing side, having dropped between the lines and caused Burnley problems throughout. He got another assist to add to his collection, and for the second week in a row played more key passes than anyone on the field (3). Again he produced out of possession too, making as many tackles (2) as anyone on his side and second only to Matt Lowton overall. You wonder what he could have achieved this season had he not missed three months to injury. Opta facts Burnley have won four consecutive top-flight games for the first time since November 1968. This was Watford's first home league defeat under Javi Gracia, with Swansea the last side to win at Vicarage Road back in December. Burnley have won seven away games in the Premier League this season; their most in a top-flight campaign since 1965-66 (9). The Clarets won a Premier League away game in which they conceded the first goal for the first time since April 2010 (4-1 at Hull), ending a run of 29 defeats and seven draws when shipping first on the road. Sam Vokes' leveller was scored with his first touch of the game and just 22 seconds after coming off the bench - the fastest goal scored by a substitute in the Premier League this season. Jack Cork scored his first goal in 20 Premier League appearances, since netting against Swansea in November. Roberto Pereyra has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time. Roberto Pereyra put Watford in front with his second goal in as many games What's next?

Jay Rodriguez broke the deadlock in the 54th minute for bottom club West Brom, who were playing under caretaker manager Darren Moore after Alan Pardew left by mutual consent on Monday. However, the Baggies' winless run was extended to 10 league games when Abraham met Sam Clucas' corner (75), in what was the forward's first league goal since October. A first point in nine games leaves West Brom 10 points from safety, while Swansea remain in 15th, four points above 18th-placed Southampton, who are in action at Arsenal on Sunday - live on Sky Sports Premier League.

Andre Ayew should have broken the deadlock for Swansea, but the striker could only stab an attempt wide after latching onto Clucas' through ball. Darren Moore took caretaker charge of West Brom after Alan Pardew left the club on Monday Moments before the half-time whistle, Craig Dawson's cushioned header found Rodriguez, and it took a fine flying save from Lukasz Fabianski to deny the West Brom forward. Team news Both sides made two changes. Matt Phillips and James McClean replaced Jonny Evans and Claudio Yacob for West Brom. Tom Carroll and Tammy Abraham started for Swansea – Ki Sung-Yeung and Nathan Dyer dropped to the bench. West Brom remained on the front foot in the second half, and they took the lead when Rodriguez tapped in after Salomon Rondon flicked on Matt Phillips' cross. Jay Rodriguez opened the scoring in the 54th minute for West Brom The hosts pushed for a second, but Swansea captain Federico Fernandez was on hand to block James McClean's strike from inside the box. West Brom then gave away a needless corner, and duly paid for it, with Abraham meeting Clucas' cross - seemingly with his shoulder - to earn a point for the Swans. Opta stats West Bromwich Albion have lost 26 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, the most by a club in a single campaign since the 2012-13 season (Southampton 29 and Aston Villa 28). Swansea scored with their only shot on target in this match. They've had just 75 shots on target in the Premier League this season, fewer than any other side. Tammy Abraham's goal was his first in the Premier League since October, ending a run of 17 games without scoring in the competition. Jay Rodriguez has scored six Premier League goals this season - only in 2013-14 (15) has he scored in a single campaign in the competition. Abraham's equaliser came with 15 minutes left on the clock England World Cup watch In an encounter largely played in the middle third, Jake Livermore enjoyed a busy afternoon for West Brom. The midfielder recorded a team-high passing accuracy of 92.5%. Meanwhile, Tammy Abraham will be delighted to have ended his long wait for a goal. The striker must push on in the final six games, however, if he wants to convince Gareth Southgate to take a fourth forward to Russia. Man of the match - Chris Brunt West Brom's captain for the day in Jonny Evans' absence was central to all of their play going forward. Brunt had 25 more touches (104) than any other player on the pitch, gaining possession a match-high 10 times as well as putting in a number of dangerous crosses for the hosts. The managers West Brom caretaker manager Darren Moore: \"It's a proud moment. Everybody knows my connection here at the football club. To step out there it was a proud moment and really good to lead the team. I thank everybody out there today. \"It was a together spirit from everybody at the club and together we got that valuable point. It stops the rot and it sends everybody away with a point. It's not another loss. \"I'm always one for if you don't win the game, then don't lose it. The boys did that really. In recent weeks maybe if we'd have gone level, with that amount of time we might have lost the game.\" Swansea boss Carlos Carvalhal: \"I am [pleased with a point]. We expected a difficult game with a change of manager,\" Carvalhal told Sky Sports. \"The [West Brom] players are in a difficult position, and they made things difficult. We felt this during the game, they put some problems to us even though we controlled with our defensive organisation. \"We must do better when we're on the ball, in the first half we knew that. In the second half, it was still the same, but after the goal, we reacted - we have a lot of strength in our head. \"The team's reaction was fantastic. We were nearer to the opponent's goal and did not gift too many opportunities to them. What's next? West Brom head to Old Trafford next weekend to face Manchester United on Nissan Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League.

comeback to deny Manchester City a chance to win the Premier League title in a 3-2 win on Saturday. City knew a win would be enough for their third Premier League title and goals from Vincent Kompany (25) and Ilkay Gundogan (30) looked to have sealed the deal. Pep Guardiola then watched his team waste numerous chances with Raheem Sterling particularly culpable and Pogba, who was offered to Manchester City in January according to Guardiola, put the champagne on ice with a quick-fire double just after half-time (53, 55) before Chris Smalling (69) completed a miraculous comeback. In a quite pulsating game that produced nine yellow cards, tempers boiled over late on with City being denied what seemed a clear penalty for a dangerous tackle from Ashley Young on Sergio Aguero and David de Gea produced a world-class save to deny the Argentine striker. The result still leaves Guardiola's men in pole position for the title as they require just six points from their remaining six games (if United keep winning) - four of which come against relegation-threatened teams. This means they cannot secure the title at Wembley against Tottenham next weekend, live on Sky Sports. Meanwhile, United are 13 points behind in second and are four clear of Liverpool with a game in hand. Player Ratings Manchester City: Ederson (6), Danilo (6), Kompany (7), Otamendi (6), Delph (6), Gundogan (6), Bernardo Silva (6), Fernandinho (4), David Silva (7), Sane (7), Sterling (3) Subs: Aguero (6), De Bruyne (6), Jesus (6) Manchester United: De Gea (8), Young (5), Bailly (4), Smalling (6), Valencia (6), Lingard (7), Matic (6), Pogba (8), Herrera (6), Sanchez (7), Lukaku (6) Subs: McTominay (6) Man of the match: Paul Pogba United would have been happy with their display in the first 25 minutes but they were undone by a set-piece and a familiar foe. Kompany scored the decisive winning goal in the 2012 Manchester derby on the way to City's title win and thumped home the opening goal here six years on. Leroy Sane swung in a delicious delivery which was met by the City skipper, who brushed aside Smalling's pitiful man-marking attempts. Nicolas Otamendi and Danilo congratulate Vincent Kompany after giving Manchester City the lead The goal rocked United and a revitalised City smelt blood. It was 2-0 just five minutes later as Guardiola's men produced a move that summed up their free-flowing style. Sterling found Gundogan with a clever reverse pass before the Germany international fooled Nemanja Matic with a round-the-world turn and toe-poked a cheeky effort into the bottom corner. Team news City boss Pep Guardiola made four changes from Wednesday night's 3-0 defeat to Liverpool in the Champions League with Danilo, Fabian Delph, Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling all getting a start. Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho opted to recall Ander Herrera to his midfield as Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial were left on the bench. Sterling then blotted his copybook by missing two guilt-edge chances when through one-on-one with De Gea - firing both clumsily over the crossbar. Gundogan - fed by Sterling - clipped a curling effort off the post just after the break. The City chances were adding up and United made them pay with a sensational double salvo, spearheaded by Pogba. The France midfielder reduced the deficit with a cool finish after an outrageous chested pass by Ander Herrera and then two minutes later, Pogba breezed past Nicholas Otamendi and flicked a header into the bottom corner via an Alexis Sanchez cross. These goals were Pogba's first for United against a top-six team in the Premier League. Goal-scorers Chris Smalling and Paul Pogba celebrate Manchester United's third goal City - so in control just minutes earlier - were now wilting and United took the lead on 69 minutes. Once again it was Sanchez who delivered the perfect centre and Smalling made amends for his earlier error by volleying home from close range. Guardiola called for reinforcements from the bench with Aguero, Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Jesus all entering the fray. There were worried faces on the United bench when Young brought down Aguero in the box with a challenge that crunched the striker's shin bone. However, referee Martin Atkinson deemed the tackle a fair one. With time running out, De Gea then produced an eye-watering one-handed save to deny Aguero and Sterling somehow spurned an effort off the post from two yards out. Man of the match: Paul Pogba A world-class showing from a player capable of producing moments to remember. Both of his goals were very skillfully taken, which makes the fact that he's only scored eight times in 50 appearances since returning to United very confusing. Paul Pogba is the 1st player to score 2 goals in a game against Man City in any of their 50 fixtures in all competitions this season pic.twitter.com/sgaa5P7uFG — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) April 7, 2018 Opta stats City lost a Premier League game they were winning by a two-goal margin for the first time since October 2008 vs Liverpool. United have won nine Premier League away games when trailing by at least two goals - four more than any other side in the competition. Alexis Sanchez has provided two assists in a Premier League game for only the second time, also doing so against Newcastle in December 2014. Sanchez has had a hand in four goals in his last two Premier League games for Manchester United (1 goal, 3 assists). Managers Pep Guardiola: \"We did absolutely everything. In the first half of the game. We created enough chances and had chances but its okay. We're a little sad for our fans, our people and players but we'll try and put things right on Tuesday. \"They found their game and their actions. They have spirit, this is Manchester United! But we have done everything to win this game. \"I don't think the players have lost focus. Our team is built to create and attack, that's why we made the decisions we did to go forward. We had a lot of quality and goals in the first half but you have to defend a little better from set-pieces. But that's football.\" 3:05 Man City boss Pep Guardiola said he was pleased with his side's performance but admitted he was sad for the fans that they weren't able to clinch the title against their rivals. Man City boss Pep Guardiola said he was pleased with his side's performance but admitted he was sad for the fans that they weren't able to clinch the title against their rivals. Jose Mourinho: \"We had more ball than normally a team has against Manchester City so it was a question of keeping confident and waiting for a goal. \"I gave them the example of many matches where teams are losing 2-0 and they recover. They kept their shape and it's a very important result for us. We need six points in three matches at home and away to finish in the top four, and to finish second I think is very important as we are two points ahead of Liverpool. \"Hopefully City can beat Tottenham to win the title, as our challenge is to finish second, so I get the chance to congratulate City for their title. Of course they wanted to do it today, but they are going to win the title, just not today. \"They've won more points than the others but they gave no chance to the others.\" 6:35 Jose Mourinho gives his reaction to Sky Sports after Man Utd came from 2-0 down to beat their City rivals and postpone their title-winning celebrations. Jose Mourinho gives his reaction to Sky Sports after Man Utd came from 2-0 down to beat their City rivals and postpone their title-winning celebrations. England Watch Raheem Sterling caught the eye for all the wrong reasons in Man City’s defeat to rivals Man Utd, missing three guilt-edge chances as City threw away a 2-0 lead. In Sterling’s defence his build-up play, which included an assist for Ilkay Gundogan’s goal, was his usual high-standard. Fabian Delph wasn’t included in Gareth Southgate’s last squad, but played 90 minutes at left back at the Etihad. He was solid if unspectacular. Delph is battling with Ashley Young for a spot on the plane to Russia. The United full back had a clumsy afternoon and was lucky to stay on the pitch after escaping giving away a penalty for a handball and an ugly tackle on Sergio Aguero. Meanwhile, Chris Smalling, who is out of favour with Southgate, summed up United’s day with an appalling first-half showing, before gathering himself in the second period to score the winning goal. Jesse Lingard maintained his good form with an energetic display, while Marcus Rashford played just eight minutes from the bench – the third domestic game in a row he’s been overlooked for a starting berth. The pundit - Graeme Souness \"It's put a large question mark against Man City. There was a question mark going into the game and it's only become bigger. That's two games now and they've conceded six goals. \"If you're winning the big titles you can't keep giving teams three goals.\" What's next? Manchester City face Liverpool in 72 hours, facing the task of turning around a 3-0 deficit in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final, while United are back in front of the Super

relegation mire as Arsenal won 3-0 on Super Sunday. Aubameyang scored from the penalty spot on 75 minutes after Mesut Ozil had been fouled by Bruno Martins Indi and added a second 11 minutes later when he smashed in from a corner. Match highlights Tap on the VIDEO section of the app if you are having problems viewing match highlights. Arsenal were awarded a second penalty with one minute left and Lacazette stepped up to leave Arsene Wenger's side in confident mood ahead of Thursday's Europa League quarter-final with CSKA Moscow. The result flattered the home side, but leaves Stoke in 19th place in the Premier League table and three points from safety with only six matches remaining to preserve their top-flight status. Player ratings Arsenal: Ospina (7), Bellerin (7), Mustafi (6), Chambers (6), Monreal (6), Ramsey (8), Elneny (7), Wilshere (7), Ozil (6), Aubameyang (8), Welbeck (6) Subs: Lacazette (7), Mkhitaryan (7), Xhaka (6) Stoke: Butland (7), Bauer (7), Martins Indi (5), Shawcross (6), Johnson (6), Pieters (6), Allen (6), Ndiaye (5), Diouf (6), Shaqiri (7), Sobhi (6) Subs: Berahino (6), Crouch (6) Man of the match: Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal) The Emirates Stadium was far from full once again - and those in attendance saw few chances in the first half with Xherdan Shaqiri curling an early left-footed effort shot inches wide and Aaron Ramsey looping a 23rd-minute shot onto the top of the crossbar. The home fans booed their players off at half-time and the game lacked tempo until the 69th minute when Shaqiri hit the post direct from a corner, moments before Jack Butland rushed off his line to deny Aubameyang. The breakthrough eventually came with 15 minutes left to play when Ozil darted into the box and was tripped by Martins Indi, although the Stoke defender was adamant he touched the ball first. Aubameyang, who missed his previous spot kick against Manchester City, stepped up to send Butland the wrong way. Team news Jack Wilshere, who missed both of England’s friendlies last week, started in one of seven Arsenal changes from the win over Watford. David Ospina replaced the injured Petr Cech in goal as Arsene Wenger appeared to have one eye on Thursday’s Europa League quarter-final with CSKA Moscow. Mame Biram Diouf and Erik Pieters returned as Stoke made four changes. Butland produced a great save to deny substitute Henrikh Mkhitaryan at the near post and then dived to stop Ozil from range - but from the resulting corner he was beaten again. Shkodran Mustafi flicked on Ozil's corner and the unmarked Aubameyang was lurking to rifle the ball beyond the goalkeeper and into the net with four minutes to play. There was more misery for luckless Stoke in the final minute when Badou Ndiaye barged over Lacazette on the edge of the area and the Arsenal substitute was allowed to take - and score - the resulting penalty, even though the selfless Aubameyang was on a hat-trick. Opta stats Mame Biram Diouf of Stoke City battles for possession with Arsenal's Danny Welbeck Arsenal have won their last 16 home matches against Stoke in all competitions, a run stretching back to August 1981. Stoke are winless in their last 18 Premier League matches in London (W0 D6 L12), since winning 2-1 at Tottenham in November 2014. Arsenal have scored 3+ goals and kept a clean sheet in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since October 2015. Aubameyang has been directly involved in six of Arsenal's last nine goals in the Premier League (five goals and one assist). The Gunners have scored two penalty goals in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2012 (v West Brom). The managers Arsene Wenger (Arsenal): \"It was a game I feel mentally first half we were not in the pace of the game, we were a bit sloppy, lacked cohesion. If you are mentally not at the races, you are in trouble. Because when you play against a team who wants to stay in the Premier League nowadays, you have a fight, and you have to be ready mentally for it.\" Paul Lambert (Stoke): \"I've just told the players that I've come here a few times and not played as well as that, even when I've won. The team was absolutely outstanding, we looked great throughout the game and looked a threat and before Arsenal scored we hit the post. Shaqiri's had a few chances and Badou (N'Diaye) has had a chance. I thought our general game was first class, and I thought we were really hard done by with the first penalty. The pundit - Thierry Henry Alexandre Lacazette changed the game. When Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang went on the left and Lacazette came on as a No 9, he started to make runs that a No 9 should make. He started to be the guy that they were looking for to make those penetrative runs - and Aubameyang got his chance when he went on the left and made that run. Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates scoring the first goal England World Cup watch Stoke’s Jack Butland might have been beaten three times in the last 15 minutes, but he could have done little about the two penalties, nor Aubameyang’s excellent strike. Indeed, the goalkeeper enhanced his reputation with a string of fine saves, denying Mkhitaryan at his near post and Ozil from long range as well as rushing off his line to deny Aubameyang. He spilled a first-half ball, which presented Ramsey with a chance, but otherwise Gareth Southgate will have been impressed. From an Arsenal perspective, Jack Wilshere played the full 90 minutes and captained the team after missing England’s fixtures through injury, but Danny Welbeck was disappointing in attack and was substituted on 61 minutes seemingly short of fitness. Man of the Match: Aaron Ramsey Arsenal took a long time to find their stride against a stubborn Stoke and the victory was ultimately built on the control and thrust offered by Aaron Ramsey in the middle of the park. Sky Sports expert Alan Smith said: \"It was a bit of a messy contest, but I thought Aaron Ramsey kept his standards high, made good runs and led by example. He got into good positions.\" Paul Lambert has six games left to save Stoke City What's next?

Not since the days of Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne had Spurs triumphed at the Bridge and their first Premier League win there came the hard way having fallen behind to Alvaro Morata's opener (30). With a fit-again Harry Kane back amongst the substitutes, Christian Eriksen's stunning 30-yard strike was a real game-changer (45+1) for Spurs before Alli, who was making his 100th Premier League appearance, struck twice in four minutes (62, 66) after half-time. The result leaves Antonio Conte's men eight points behind Tottenham in fourth with their only hope of silverware being the FA Cup, where they play Southampton in the semi-final. Player Ratings Chelsea: Caballero (5), Rudiger (6), Christensen (6), Azpilicueta (7), Moses (4), Kante (7), Fabregas (3), Alonso (6), Willian (6), Morata (6), Hazard (6). Subs: Emerson (6), Giroud (6) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Trippier (7), Vertonghen (7), Sanchez (8), Davies (7), Dier (7), Dembele (7), Lamela (7), Alli (8), Eriksen (8), Son (7) Subs: Kane (6), Wanyama (6), Sissoko (6) Man of the match: Christian Eriksen The match was played in a hostile atmosphere following fixtures like the \"Battle of the Bridge\" in 2016 when Spurs surrendered the title to Leicester courtesy of a Chelsea comeback. Team news Thibaut Courtois was missing through injury for Chelsea, who started with Cesc Fabregas in midfield instead of Tiemoue Bakayoko. Harry Kane was fit enough for a place on the substitutes' bench as Spurs made three changes from their 3-0 FA Cup win over Swansea with Eric Dier, Moussa Dembele and Dele Alli returning. With the fast-paced tempo in midfield neither team had much space to work with but Marcos Alonso, who scored twice in the reverse fixture at Wembley this season, had a goal chalked off on 19 minutes as he was marginally offside from an N'Golo Kante cross. Spurs did not heed the warning of Chelsea's dangerous attacks down the right flank and Morata made them pay on the half hour. Victor Moses swung in no more than a decent cross and the Chelsea striker rose above a flapping Hugo Lloris to flick in his first Premier League goal of 2018. Chelsea's Alvaro Morata (centre) celebrates Chelsea remained a threat but Alonso was denied by Lloris and Kante had a goal-bound effort blocked by Eric Dier. Spurs looked short of ideas but Eriksen hauled them back into the game on the stroke of the half with a stunning long-range effort. There did not look much on from 30 yards out but the Dane pinged a swerving effort that deceived a flat-footed Willy Caballero and flew into the roof of the net. Caballero redeemed himself somewhat after the break with a flying one-handed save to deny Heung-Min Son but minutes later Spurs were in front, with a goal which showcased the talent at the disposal of Gareth Southgate. Dier picked out his international team-mate Alli with a super 50-yard pass over the top and the 21-year-old controlled the ball into his stride before finishing past Caballero. Four minutes later, Alli wrapped up the game. This effort was much scrappier than his first but nonetheless important as he fired home from six-yards after a goalmouth scramble, where Chelsea's defenders failed to clear their lines. Kane was introduced with 15 minutes to go as Spurs dealt with a wave of Chelsea pressure that was full of oomph but lacked a killer touch as another Premier League title defence is left in tatters. England watch Dele Alli sent a message to Gareth Southgate with a man-of-the-match display against Chelsea. Alli was overlooked for a starting berth for England in friendlies with Netherlands and Italy but struck twice at Stamford Bridge in a performance full of star quality. Eric Dier provided the assist for Alli’s opener with a stunning 60-yard pass while Kieran Trippier was a solid outlet on the right flank. Southgate would have been delighted to see Harry Kane play 15 minutes after returning from injury earlier than expected. Opta stats Tottenham ended a run of 27 league visits to Chelsea without a victory (D9 L18), winning there for the first time since February 1990. Tottenham have won more points in Premier League London derbies this season than any other side (16 - W5 D1 L2). Seven of Morata's 11 Premier League goals this season have been headers, more than any other player has managed. Morata's seven headed goal haul is also the most ever by a Chelsea player in a Premier League season. Chelsea have scored a league-high 14 headed goals this season. Eriksen has scored 16 goals from outside the box since his Premier League debut in September 2013; the most of any current player in that time in the competition. Eriksen has been directly involved in five goals in his last five Premier League appearances against Chelsea, scoring two and assisting three. Manager reaction Conte: \"We are doing this, and we have to try until the end to do our best. But I think if we are in this position, we are deserving of this position. \"We have to try until the end to catch a Champions League place. In this case, there's Tottenham and Liverpool so we'll try until the end to get three points in every game. We'll see what happens.\" Pochettino: \"That type of game will help us achieve what we want. \"After nearly four years, a lot has happened at the club and I'm happy with how we are evolving. \"I remember four years ago when I arrived at Tottenham our challenge was to bridge the top four and now we're competing with the top sides.\" What's next?

Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool Mohamed Salah scored his 29th league goal as Liverpool came from behind to beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park in Jurgen Klopp's 100th Premier League game in charge. Tap on the video section of the app if you are having problems viewing match highlights. Roy Hodgson's side took the lead through captain Luka Milivojevic's 13th-minute penalty, which was given after Loris Karius brought down Wilfried Zaha. The visitors were back on level terms just after the break through Sadio Mane (49) before Christian Benteke missed two glorious chances to restore Palace's lead. It was left to Salah (84) to seal all three points for the Reds with his 29th league goal, equalling the record for the number of matches (21) scored in during a 38-game season set by Cristiano Ronaldo (2007/08) and Robin van Persie (2012/13). Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Van Aanholt (7), Sakho (6), Kelly (6), Wan-Bissaka (6), McArthur (6), Milivojevic (8), Cabaye (7), Townsend (6), Zaha (7), Benteke (5). Subs: Loftus-Cheek (6), Fosu-Mensah (6). Liverpool: Karius (6), Robertson (7), Van Dijk (7), Matip (7), Alexander-Arnold (6), Wijnaldum (6), Milner (8), Henderson (7), Mane (6), Firmino (6), Salah (7). Subs: Lallana (5), Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Lovren (6). Man of the match: James Milner Karius was in the thick of the action in the opening stages, reacting well to turn Zaha's shot behind. However, minutes later, the German raced off his line and took down Zaha just inside the penalty area. Referee Neil Swarbrick pointed to the spot before brandishing a yellow card to Karius. Milivojevic sent the goalkeeper to wrong way to score his seventh penalty of the campaign. Liverpool appealed for a penalty of their own in the 24th minute when Mane went down under a challenge from James McArthur, but Swarbrick adjudged the Senegal forward to have gone down easily and booked him for simulation. Liverpool's Mohamed Salah in action against Crystal Palace's Patrick van Aanholt (left) and Mamadou Sakho during the Premier League match at Selhurst Park There was more frustration for Mane, who had the ball in the net in the 30th minute. Roberto Firmino rose highest to head the ball on from a corner, but Mane was correctly flagged offside before nodding past Wayne Hennessey from close range. Mane's luck changed after the restart as he flicked Milner's low cross in at the near post for his ninth goal of the season. The hosts should have been back in front as Benteke missed two clear-cut chances within the space of a minute, missing the target with only Karius to beat on both occasions. Team news Wilfried Zaha was fit to start after being unable to train during the international break due to a knee problem. However, James Tomkins and Alexander Sorloth both joined Jeffrey Schlupp and Joel Ward on the sidelines as boss Roy Hodgson made two changes from the side that won 2-0 at Huddersfield last time out. Liverpool were missing right-back Joe Gomez, who damaged ankle ligaments while playing for England in the Netherlands last Friday night, with Trent Alexander-Arnold coming in. And the visitors were also without midfielder Emre Can - who was replaced by James Milner. Meanwhile, right-back Nathaniel Clyne was included in the squad for the first time this season after a long-term back injury. Mane, who was later substituted by Klopp, was then lucky to avoid picking up a second yellow card for an intentional handball on the edge of the area and Karius kept out the resultant free-kick from Patrick van Aanholt. Palace kept on pushing for a winner but in the end, they were punished by Salah, who was in the right place at the right time to control Andrew Roberton's driven shot before calmly placing the ball past the diving Hennessey to secure a dramatic late victory for his side. Liverpool's Mohamed Salah scores his side's second goal of the game during the Premier League match against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park Match stats Liverpool have now won 679 top-flight away games - no side has ever won more (level with Arsenal). Salah has been involved in 38 Premier League goals this season (29 goals, 9 assists), the most by any player in the competition since Luis Suarez in 2013-14 (43). Mane became the joint-highest scoring Senegalese player in Premier League history, equalling Demba Ba's haul of 43 in the competition. It was also Mané's fifth Premier League strike against Crystal Palace - more than he's got against any other opponent. Crystal Palace are the first team to lose three consecutive Premier League home games thanks to goals conceded in the final 10 minutes (88th vs Tottenham, 90th vs Man Utd and 84th vs Liverpool). No player has won more Premier League penalties this season that Zaha (4), while Milivojevic has taken (8) and scored (7) the most spot-kicks this season. Benteke has missed 20 of the 22 big chances he's had in the Premier League this season, more than any other player. Mohamed Salah has scored his 37th goal in all comps this season Only Ian Rush (1983-84 & 1986-87) and Roger Hunt (1961-62) have scored more goals for Liverpool in a single campaign pic.twitter.com/d6VHi398Os — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) March 31, 2018 Man of the Match - James Milner Salah will be getting all the plaudits once again after his late strike secured Liverpool a late victory but Milner, who was filling in for the injured Emre Can, was excellent in the middle of the park for Klopp's side. The 32-year-old was neat and tidy in possession and provided a cutting edge of the visitors in the final third, setting up Mane's 49th minute equaliser with a drilled cross towards the near post. How did England hopefuls fare? There was an injury blow for Gareth Southgate as Adam Lallana lasted just over five minutes after coming on a substitute before picking up a nasty looking injury trying to tackle Milivojevic. Jordan Henderson, who captained England last week against the Netherlands, completed the full 90 minutes at Selhurst Park, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who also appeared for the Three Lions during the international break, playing 26 minutes as a substitute. Meanwhile, Joe Gomez missed the game after injuring his ankle on England duty. The 20-year-old was forced off in the early stages of England's 1-0 win in Amsterdam against the Netherlands last Friday and subsequently missed Tuesday's draw with Italy. Managers Roy Hodgson: \"A little bit of Groundhog Day when we play against these top teams. We played quite well in the second half I thought, we controlled the ball better and created the better chances ourselves. \"But unfortunately we also conceded the two goals in that half, which would have seemed more likely in the first half when they had a lot of possession and put us under a lot of pressure.\" Jurgen Klopp: \"It was no dive; diving with a bit of contact is not possible. It was contact, 100 per cent. He wants to stay (on his feet) and then it doesn't work and he goes down. \"And the second yellow, I think it was a foul on Sadio. But then he made a wrong decision to put his hand on the ball. \"And then I thought 'okay that's it, au revoir, see you later'. I thought 'now he's gone', of course.\" The pundit Graeme Souness: \"Lots of plusses (for Liverpool), playing a very attractive football, a team that most neutrals would want to watch. \"But they have to start winning trophies as that is what you are judged on ultimately and that is the only thing that is missing. \"But I think they are certainly on the right road, they just need to win a trophy,\" said the Scot, who won the 1992 FA Cup while managing Liverpool. \"And if you win one, then it makes it so much easier going forward because you start to believe in yourself.\" What's next? Crystal Palace are back in action next Saturday (April 7) when they travel to the Vitality Stadium to face Bournemouth (3pm).

highlights Brighton 0 -2 Leicester - highlights Late goals from Vicente Iborra and Jamie Vardy handed ten-man Leicester a 2-0 win against Brighton at the Amex Stadium after Glenn Murray had missed a penalty. A poor game sprung into life after 77 minutes when Jose Izquierdo won a penalty for the hosts but Murray, who has been in good goalscoring form of late, saw his effort brilliantly saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Video Tap on the video section of the app if you are having problems viewing match highlights. That miss proved costly just six minutes later as Iborra delicately glanced a header from a Ben Chilwell cross into the bottom corner although Leicester's slender lead was put in jeopardy when Wilfred Ndidi was sent off five minutes later. However, with Brighton throwing men forward in search of an equaliser, Leicester picked them off on the counter-attack with Vardy scoring their second deep into stoppage time. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Schelotto (6), Dunk (6), Duffy (6), Bong (5), Kayal (6), Gross (7), Propper (6), Locadia (6), Izquierdo (6), Murray (4) Subs: March (6), Baldock (N/A) Leicester: Schmeichel (8), Simpson (6), Maguire (7), Morgan (6), Chilwell (7), Mahrez (7), Ndidi (5), Iborra (7), Albrighton (6), Vardy (7), Okazaki (5) Subs: Diabate (6), Gray (6), Fuchs (N/A) Man of the match: Kasper Schmeichel Stray passes and sloppy passages of play dominated the opening 45 minutes as both sides struggled to get into their rhythm. However, it was Brighton who had the only meaningful chance of the half when Murray blasted a shot wide of the post with only Schmeichel to beat after being played through by Pascal Gross. There was a slight improvement in the second half as Brighton began to take control of the game with Gross forcing an excellent stop from Schmeichel with a rasping drive from distance. Brighton's wingers Jurgen Locadia and Izquierdo were causing Leicester's defence plenty of problems too with each member of their back four cautioned. Then on 77 minutes, Brighton had the perfect chance to break the deadlock. Izquierdo drifted into the box and was felled by Ndidi, although he certainly went down in theatrical fashion. Murray stepped up to take it but his effort, down to Schmeichel's left was at the perfect height for the 'keeper to save it. Schmeichel's penalty heroics proved to be the turning point in the game as six minutes later Iborra gave them the lead. The summer signing from Sevilla found himself completely unmarked in the Brighton penalty area and he punished Brighton's slack marking by clinically nodding Ben Chilwell's pinpoint cross beyond Mathew Ryan, who was rooted to the spot. Team news Jurgen Locadia made his first Premier League start for Brighton following his club-record move from PSV in January. The Dutchman came in for the suspended Anthony Knockaert in Chris Hughton's only change.Claude Puel also made one alteration to his starting line-up with Marc Albrighton replacing Demarai Gray, who dropped down to the bench. Brighton were given fresh hope of finding an equaliser four minutes later when Ndidi was sent off for a second yellow after mistiming a challenge on Shane Duffy and from the resulting free-kick, Schmeichel made another great stop to deny Solly March. In the fourth minute of added time, Gaetan Bong somehow contrived to miss an open goal when his header from March's corner went wide and just a minute later Leicester sealed their victory as Vardy tapped in substitute Demarai Gray's cross-shot from a yard out. England World Cup watch Gareth Southgate would have been pleased to see Jamie Vardy continue his fine form in front of goal as he tapped in Leicester's second goal to follow on from his strike against Italy.A problem area for England at the moment is left back and Ben Chilwell's performance might have caught Southgate's eye as he provided the assist for Vicente Iborra's goal.Harry Maguire enjoyed another solid performance at the heart of defence while Lewis Dunk was largely solid throughout too. It wasn't such a good day for Glenn Murray, though, as he missed a glorious chance and a penalty. Opta stats This was Brighton's fourth Premier League home defeat, and first against a non 'big-six' side. Wilfred Ndidi's red card was Leicester's fourth of the season in the Premier League - no side has been shown more (level with Chelsea and Watford). This was the 23rd away Premier League game in which Leicester had a player sent off, but only the second they went on to win (also beating Hull in December 2014). Jamie Vardy has scored in five of Leicester's last six away league games, with the other game in that run ending 0-0. Vicente Iborra has scored in back-to-back Premier League games, after netting in just one of his first 14 in the competition. Iborra has now scored in consecutive Premier League games 38% of Iborra's goals in the big five European leagues have been headers (12/32). Kasper Schmeichel has saved three of the 14 Premier League penalties he's faced - the same number his father Peter saved during his time in the competition (21 faced). Man of the match - Kasper Schmeichel Leicester were nowhere near at their best on the day and had their goalkeeper to thanks for keeping them in the game at 0-0 when he made a brilliant save from Glenn Murray's penalty. The game completely turned on that moment as Leicester belatedly awoke from their slumber to seize the initiative and take the lead soon after. Schmeichel made another great stop from just under his crossbar from March's free-kick to keep Leicester in front before Jamie Vardy finished it off with virtually the last kick of the game. What's next? Brighton's next game is also at the AMEX as they entertain Huddersfield Town next Saturday at 3pm. Leicester are also at home next Saturday as they host Newcastle United at the King Power, which kicks off at the same time."}, {"date": "31/03/2018", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75038,

Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (7), Young (7), Lindelof (7), Smalling (6), Valencia (6), Matic (7), Mata (6), Pogba (6), Lingard (7), Sanchez (8), Lukaku (7) Subs: Herrera (5), Rashford (5), McTominay (5) Swansea: Fabianski (6), Van Der Hoorn (5), Mawson (5), Fernandez (5), Olsson (5), Naughton (5), Clucas (4), King (5), Ki (4), Dyer (4), A Ayew (5) Subs: Abraham (6), Carroll (6), Routledge (5) Man of the match: Alexis Sanchez The win sees United move two points above Liverpool, who beat Crystal Palace earlier in the day. Swansea stay three points clear of the relegation zone after a performance that must go down as one of their worst under Carlos Carvalhal. United's own performances have been under scrutiny for much of the season but there was little for the home fans to complain about in a dominant first-half display. The deadlock was broken after just five minutes when Lukaku's shot deflected in off Alfie Mawson. Alexis Sanchez doubled Manchester United's lead The goal was Lukaku's 100th in the Premier League and he was only denied his 101st by a sharp low save from Lukasz Fabianski. Sanchez did make it 2-0 in the 20th minute when he clinically fired home from the edge of the box after a through ball from Jesse Lingard. Swansea offered nothing in response before half-time and were fortunate not to fall further behind as Sanchez headed over in the 55th minute and then Juan Mata lashed a volley over the bar from close range. A change in formation, and the introduction of Tom Carroll, eventually helped the Swans to get a foothold in the game, but De Gea prevented them clawing a goal back. First he made a brilliant one-handed save to keep out Abraham's powerful shot and then he turned an effort from the striker around the post. Swansea continued to look more positive but failed to create further clear chances and saw Fabianski save well from Lukaku. Team news United made five changes from their last match as De Gea, Pogba, Young, Sanchez and Lindelof came in for Romero, Martial, Bailly, Shaw and McTominay. Fabianski, Fernandez, King and Andre Ayew started for Swansea in place of Bartley, Carroll and Abraham. Opta stats Romelu Lukaku became the 28th different player, first Belgian and fifth youngest player to score 100 Premier League goals. Swansea have won just one of their last 14 Premier League away games (D4 L9). The Swans had as many shots on target in this game (2) as they'd managed in their three previous Premier League away games combined. Alexis Sanchez had a hand in more Premier League goals in the opening 20 minutes of this match (1 goal, 1 assist) than he had in his previous six appearances for Manchester United combined (1 goal). The Chilean has now both scored and assisted in 11 different Premier League games - only Romelu Lukaku and Roberto Firmino (12 each) have done so in more matches since his debut. Jose Mourinho is unbeaten in all 10 of his previous meetings with Swansea in all competitions, beating five different managers in that time (W8 D2). England World Cup watch After impressing for England in recent internationals, both Young and Lingard were in good form again. At this rate the Manchester United duo should be pushing for starting roles at the World Cup. Luke Shaw, meanwhile, was left on the bench. Tammy Abraham is an outsider to make the squad but he was influential after coming on at half-time. The striker was twice denied by De Gea and held the ball up well to get Swansea further up the pitch. Man of the match - Alexis Sanchez Sanchez was particularly lively in a one-sided first half when he was involved in a lot of Manchester United's best moves. He set up for Lukaku for the opener before finishing well for the second. Might have added another after half-time when he headed over the bar, but overall it was a positive display that ended with a warm ovation when he was replaced in the second half. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"In the first half we did everything right, we defended very well, brought the line up, kept Swansea miles away from our goal, scored, had more chances, we played beautiful. The first half was perfect, they improved in the second half but we let it go.\" Carlos Carvalhal: \"I have good expectations especially with our second half [performance]. I have good expectations for the future because we will play like that more and if we play like that I believe we will stay in the Premier League. I am not happy with the result but really happy with the second half.\" Pundit reaction - Matt Le Tissier \"The first half was almost too easy for Manchester United. They got themselves in front early, they dominated for the first 30 minutes and it was a walk in the park. \"The changes at half-time helped Swansea, they went a bit more positive and Tammy Abraham had two very good chances and David De Gea pulled off two good saves, bearing in mind he had nothing to do in the first half. \"That is how you become a top quality goalkeeper, you do nothing for that period of time and are then suddenly forced to make a really top-drawer save with his right hand and then with his left a minute later.\" What's next? Manchester United will be looking to prevent Manchester City winning the title next Saturday when they meet at the Etihad Stadium, live on Sky Sports. Swansea, meanwhile, travel to West Ham on Saturday."}, {"date": "31/03/2018", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52261, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name":

Premier League survival but kept Huddersfield in peril with a 1-0 win at St James' Park. Tap on the video section of the app if you are having problems viewing match highlights. Rafa Benitez's side - once again inspired by Jonjo Shelvey - looked in danger of paying for their profligacy as Dwight Gayle spurned a string of first-half chances. But Perez belatedly made the breakthrough when he sparked and finished a move 10 minutes from time, converting Kenedy's calm cut-back to release home tension and further ease relegation fears. The slender scoreline was scant reward for a dominant display but a third successive home win in the Premier League means Newcastle climb to 12th - seven points above the drop zone - at the expense of under-par visitors who remain just three points from trouble. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Yedlin (7), Lascelles (7), Lejeune (7), Dummett (7), Ritchie (6), Shelvey (8), Diame (7), Kenedy (7), Perez (7), Gayle (5). Subs: Slimani (6), Hayden (6), Atsu (7). Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Smith (6), Schindler (6), Jorgensen (6), Kongolo (6), Hogg (6), Mooy (6), van La Parra (6), Pritchard (7), Kachunga (6), Depoitre (7). Subs: Malone (6), Quaner (7), Mounie (6). Man of the match: Jonjo Shelvey Ayoze Perez celebrates after scoring Newcastle United's winner Benitez, who was finally able to give Islam Slimani a late cameo after injury, had admitted victory against rivals who started the afternoon just a point behind them would represent a \"big step\" in the survival scrap and a competitive edge in the opening stages served reminder of the cause. Jamaal Lascelles and Aaron Mooy drew early bookings, while a Kenedy penalty appeal was waved away, but Newcastle found their groove and should have made the breakthrough when Shelvey's low drive was so nearly diverted past Jonas Lossl by Gayle on the stretch (14). Team news Rafa Benitez kept faith with the side that started in the 3-0 win over Southampton - but was finally able to name Islam Slimani on the bench. Huddersfield boss David Wagner made five changes with Tommy Smith, Terence Kongolo, Rajiv van La Parra, Elias Kachunga and Laurent Depoitre handed starts. Newcastle United's Florian Lejeune challenges Huddersfield Town's Aaron Mooy The hosts continued to attack with zip, Matt Ritchie thwarted moments later from a tight angle, but the game's best chance came just before the half-hour mark when quick-thinking Shelvey lofted a free-kick that dropped onto Gayle's boot, his controlling touch not matched by the dink he sent wide. Huddersfield carried only fleeting threat on the counter, Laurent Depoitre linking well with Alex Pritchard, but further chances came Gayle's way via DeAndre Yedlin before the break, one effort well over and another improvised flick rolling the wrong side of the post. David Wagner's side mustered their first real attempt on goal with 59 minutes gone as Depoitre drilled off-target and a goalmouth scramble on 65 was emblematic of a far scrappier second period, Collin Quaner finally muscled out after Mathias Jorgensen was afforded a free header. Substitute Christian Atsu blazed a shot wide as the home side struggled for renewed inspiration, but it was from his cross that a home moment to savour came, Lossl's hand in vain as Kenedy looked up and Perez made it count. Quaner, left carelessly free as a ball was flashed across goal, and then Scott Malone had late chances to provide a final twist but a Town leveller would have been unjust, Benitez's side deservedly able to breathe easier as the games tick down. Match stats Newcastle are unbeaten in six straight home league games (W3 D3) - their best such run in the top flight since December 2014 under Alan Pardew (also six). Huddersfield Town have drawn a blank in 12 separate away games in the Premier League this season, just one short of the single-season record (13) for failing to score on the most occasions on the road in the competition's history, jointly held by Norwich City in 1994-95, Southampton in 1998-99 and Middlesbrough in 2002-03. Ayoze Perez has scored his first Premier League goal at St James' Park since March 5 2016 against Bournemouth, 756 days ago. Kenedy has been directly involved in four goals in his first four home league games for Newcastle United (two goals, two assists). Man of the match - Jonjo Shelvey Paul Dummett defended stoutly, Mo Diame grafted tirelessly in midfield and Ayoze Perez - finally - provided the finish but Jonjo Shelvey gave further ammunition to those clamouring for an England call with another impressive display in the middle. Short, long, defence-splitting or diagonal, he crafted and stretched play once again with his passing range, even if his influence did diminish after the interval - and he shanked a couple of efforts well wide. Gayle should have done better with the glorious ball that dropped onto his laces midway through the first half. The pundit view Paul Merson: \"Newcastle are one win away from safety. They were brilliant in the first half; in the first 30 minutes they had 10 shots on goal. They kept on going in the first half but in the second half they never got themselves going and Huddersfield came back into the game. But the goal was superb and they definitely deserved to win the game. \"Huddersfield have no pace but if you had said to them at the beginning of the season that after 31 games they would be outside of the relegation zone they would have been happy.\" How did England hopefuls fare? Jonjo Shelvey's vision and passing range continue to catch the eye, though more than two years have passed since his last England cap. He was wasteful on occasion in front of goal but made five chances for his team-mates - including that opportunity for Gayle. Newcastle team-mate Jamaal Lascelles has been touted as an outside bet after growing into his captaincy at St James' Park. He admitted he was disappointed not to make the cut but was solid again here, making seven clearances and a key interception. The managers Rafa Benitez: \"The team was working so hard. We had very clear chances in the first half; it was a pity we couldn't score but we were attacking and creating chances. To win three in a row at home, the fans are delighted. It's breathing space but not enough. Forty points is the target so we have to carry on.\" David Wagner: \"It's a disappointing result. It was a very good defensive performance from my players and we had the best chances in the second half. For sure it hurts but from what I've seen - the fighting spirit and the work ethic - I have no concerns that we'll be able to collect the points we need.\" What's next Resurgent Newcastle travel to Leicester next Saturday, while Huddersfield face another of the sides who came up with them last season, Brighton, as they seek to kick-start their own fight for survival."}, {"date": "31/03/2018",

92nd-minute equaliser earned Bournemouth another point from a losing position in an entertaining 2-2 draw at Watford. Watch highlights Tap on the video section of the app if you are having problems viewing match highlights. The former England forward broke a seven-game hoodoo to score his first goal against the Hornets when a long free-kick was flicked on, giving him a simple finish to earn Bournemouth's 17th point from a losing position this season. Watford were hard done by but had only themselves to blame, having earlier blown Kiko Femenia's 13th-minute opener when Jose Holebas needlessly handballed in the box, allowing Josh King to equalise from the spot (43). They reclaimed the lead thanks to Roberto Pereyra's deflected effort four minutes into the second half, but Defoe's goal denied them the chance to move within a point of ninth-placed Everton, and instead they remain level on points with the Cherries, who are 10th. Player ratings Watford: Karnezis (6), Janmaat (6), Prodl (7), Mariappa (7), Holebas (5), Doucoure (6), Capoue (6), Femenia (6), Hughes (7), Pereyra (7), Deeney (6). Subs: Cathcart (6), Richarlison (7), Okaka (5). Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Fraser (6), S Cook (6), Ake (7), Daniels (6), Ibe (6), Gosling (6), L Cook (7), Stanislas (7), King (6), Wilson (5). Subs: Pugh (7), Defoe (7). Man of the match: Will Hughes. Nathan Ake struck the bar from Junior Stanislas' free-kick at the start of an end-to-end encounter, which the visitors should have led once Josh King robbed Adrian Mariappa before being denied by an outstanding sliding challenge from Sebastian Prodl. Having wasted those two chances, and another which Karnezis stopped from Stanislas at full-stretch, Watford took the lead with their first shot on goal when Holebas' corner reached Femenia, who half-volleyed beyond a stranded Asmir Begovic. The goal gave Watford the belief they had lacked and Femenia came close to a second, but with a half-time lead looking assured Holebas handled to palm Stanislas' cross away from Jordon Ibe, and was perhaps lucky to stay on the pitch. Team news Watford dropped Britos and Richarlison following their 5-0 drubbing at Liverpool last time out, allowing Janmaat and Hughes to return. Bournemouth's changes were both in defence, with Smith ruled out by injury and replaced at right-back by Fraser, more regularly a midfielder. Smith dropped to the bench for Daniels. King sent Karnezis the wrong way to level, but four minutes after the restart Watford restored their advantage when Hughes laid the ball off for Pereyra, whose curled shot took a slight deflection, but left Begovic unmoved. Bournemouth huffed and puffed without testing Karnezis, until an innocuous foul from substitute Stefano Okaka inside the Cherries half allowed them a chance to pump the ball long. Steve Cook launched it into the box where Defoe, who had not scored since December, showed his predatory instincts to slot in an equaliser with barely two minutes of the game left. Match facts Jermain Defoe has now scored 15 Premier League goals in the 90th minute or later - at least four more than any other player in the competition's history. Bournemouth have now gained 17 points from losing positions this season - more than any other side. Kiko Femenia's opener was his first league goal since netting for Alaves against Athletic Club \"B\" in the Spanish Segunda Division on May 26th 2016, 674 days ago. Femenia was the 16th different player to score for Watford in the Premier League this season - only Arsenal have had more (17, excluding own goals). Josh King has now scored three goals in his last seven league games - he had only managed to find the net twice in his first 20 such games this season. Will Hughes has had a hand in five goals (two goals, three assists) in nine Premier League games for Watford this season - as many as he managed in 38 Championship games for Derby County last season. Man of the match - Will Hughes Had a big hand in much of Watford's good attacking play, making the second goal for Pereyra with a lovely lay-off. It summed up his knack of finding himself in the heart of the action, registering four key passes - more than anyone else on the pitch - and also putting in a real shift defensively, making more tackles than any of his team-mates (4). England World Cup watch Will Hughes impressed on his return to the starting line-up, but after his injury problems since November he's probably left his chance too late to even be an outside shot for Russia. Former call-up regular Jermain Defoe grabbed a goal, but it was his first since December and only a fourth of the season. The managers Javi Gracia: \"It's disappointing with the result, because we have lost two points in injury time, but I'm proud of my players. Javi Gracia dropped his first points at home since he took over as Watford head coach in January \"If we had taken more of the chances we had, it could have given us more of a cushion - and at the end we lost two points. \"I didn't see the handball. It was a long way from my position on the pitch. Today we have one point more, we wanted three and I think we deserved it, but there are six games left and we will try to get all the points we can.\" Eddie Howe: \"It was an action-packed game. We left it very late. I thought we did alright first half, it was a good open game, we came strong at the end. Eddie Howe's Bournemouth have picked up 17 points from losing positions - more than any other Premier League side \"It's something we've developed as our calling-card, late in the season. We don't know when we're beaten, but it's not good to keep going behind.

Watch highlights Tap on the video section of the app if you are having problems viewing match highlights. Ashley Barnes' brilliant acrobatic finish after 22 minutes sent them on their way to a third successive victory before Chris Wood doubled their lead with a header from close range (73). Salomon Rondon reduced the arrears with a well-taken finish seven minutes before the end but the hosts could not complete the comeback and Alan Pardew's side remain 10 points adrift of safety with six games remaining. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (6), Nyom (6), Gibbs (5), Evans (6), Dawson (5), Hegazi (5), Yacob (5), Livermore (6), Brunt (6), Rodriguez (5), Rondon (7).

Subs: Vokes (5), Hendrick (5) Man of the match: Ashley Barnes Burnley go from strength to strength, however, with Sean Dyche's men just two points off sixth-placed Arsenal, and the sides face each other in the penultimate weekend of the season. West Brom's eight-year stay in the Premier League looks increasingly like coming to an end, and they paid the price on Saturday after an opening half which lacked the sense of urgency required for a side fighting for their lives. Burnley dominated possession, but scored from their first meaningful attempt on goal as the impressive Aaron Lennon stood up a cross from the right for Barnes to volley past Ben Foster. It was the fourth consecutive Premier League game in which the forward scored - the first time he has achieved the feat - and West Brom failed to test Nick Pope until Rondon's header from Jake Livermore's cross was tipped around the post in first-half stoppage time. Team news West Brom were unchanged from the side that lost 2-1 at Bournemouth. Burnley made two changes to the side that won 3-0 at West Ham as Georges-Kevin N'Koudou and Chris Wood came in for Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Jeff Hendrick. Pardew sought to inject greater endeavour and energy at the interval with Matty Phillips replacing Kieran Gibbs, and the switch had the desired effect as the substitute's cross was headed narrowly over by Jay Rodriguez 14 minutes after the restart. But the necessary quality continued to desert the hosts, with Burnley's resolute defence absorbing their opponents' best efforts and the game appeared over as a contest when Wood latched onto Matt Lowton's cute pass to head beyond Foster after his initial shot was saved. It was only after Rondon pounced on a loose ball from Jonny Evans' cross to fire past Pope with seven minutes remaining that Burnley showed any signs of weakness, with Chris Brunt unable to convert from Phillips' cross moments later as the visitors held on for victory. The managers Alan Pardew: \"We were so tentative in what we did [in the first half]. It wasn't the team I saw in training this week. We didn't cope with the pressure from the fans and the media, but in the second half, we did much better. \"We need a result, and we did everything today but we couldn't get one. We've got another tough game here next week at home, and we're learning some players can deal with the situation. \"We've got to stand up to the opposition and ask them questions. We did that in the second half but the first 45 minutes we weren't good enough.\" Sean Dyche: \"We're really pleased. It's another big win. This is a strange place to come at the minute but I thought we handled the occasion well. \"I'm not sure if we can break into the top six [this season], but progress is being made. It's hard to make massive strides at once but we've made improvements, particularly away from home. \"You've got to be careful what you wish for, but I'm very proud of what the players are achieving.\" Man of the match: Ashley Barnes Barnes' beauty midway through the first half lit up a match that had been starved of quality. The 28-year-old forward is brimming with confidence after notching in his fourth straight Premier League game, and his overall link-up play in particular with Lennon and Wood was a highlight of his performance. He is the second Burnley player to score in four consecutive Premier League appearances after Sam Vokes did so between May and August 2017. Barnes launches himself in the air to meet Lennon's cross to make it 1-0 England World Cup watch Nick Pope and James Tarkowski returned from international duty with England to play with all the confidence and know-how of two players who have been on the scene for many years. Tarkowski’s only mistake led to Rondon’s goal but, alongside Ben Mee, this was another impressive defensive display to enhance his chances of making Gareth Southgate’s final 23-man squad. As always there were several Englishmen in Dyche’s side, with Aaron Lennon’s resurgence likely to come too late while West Brom’s Jake Livermore produced moments of quality during a midfield battle with Jack Cork. The injury concerns surrounding Jack Wilshere could yet force Southgate to select a wildcard in the centre of the pitch, and while West Brom’s season now appears an exercise in futility, Livermore still has plenty to play for. Opta stats Burnley have won six away games this season, one more than in their three previous Premier League campaigns combined (5). West Brom have lost eight consecutive Premier League games, their longest losing run in the competition. It's their longest losing run in the top-flight since a nine-game streak ending in September 1985. Alan Pardew has collected just 12 points from a possible 84 in his last 28 Premier League games as manager of both Crystal Palace and West Brom (W2 D6 L20). Chris Wood has found the back of the net in each of his last three Premier League games, scoring four in the process. Aaron Lennon has assisted a team-mate in back to back Premier League games having registered just one assist in his previous 72 in the competition. Salomón Rondón has scored three and assisted one more in four Premier League matches against Burnley. What's next? West Brom are at home next weekend as they host Swansea on April 7 while Burnley travel to face Watford at Vicarage Road on the same day."}, {"date": "31/03/2018", "arena": "London Stadium",

West Ham plunged Southampton deep into relegation trouble as Marko Arnautovic haunted Mark Hughes in a 3-0 win on Saturday. In their first game since fans charged onto the pitch during their 3-0 defeat to Burnley, the Hammers surged to a comfortable lead at half-time with a double from Arnautovic (17, 45+4) and a powerful strike from Joao Mario (13). Watch highlights Tap on the video section of the app if you are having problems viewing match highlights. Hughes, who was taking charge of his first Premier League game for Southampton, has history with Arnautovic after he publicly criticised him following West Ham's game with Stoke earlier this season. The West Ham striker celebrated his opener by angrily shouting towards the away dugout, presumably with Hughes his target. The result sends West Ham five points clear of the drop zone while Southampton remain in the bottom three, two points from safety with Arsenal (a) and Chelsea (h) their next two games. West Ham skipper Mark Noble called for the home fans to stick with their team for this crucial encounter, which subsequently turned out to be an easy request as the Hammers started full of energy. Player Ratings West Ham: Hart (7), Zabaleta (8), Ogbonna (7), Cresswell (7), Rice (7), Masuaku (8), Kouyate (7), Noble (7), Mario (8), Antonio (6), Arnautovic (9). Subs: Hugill (6), Fernandes (7), Cullen (6) Southampton: McCarthy (5), Soares (4), Stephens (3), Hoedt (3), Bertrand (4), Lemina (3), Hojbjerg (3), Tadic (5), Redmond (4), Austin (6), Gabbiadini (4). Subs: Long (7), Carrilo (5), Boufal (5) Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic They were 2-0 up inside 17 minutes as Southampton froze under the pressure. On 13 minutes, a quick counter-attack down the right flank - triggered by Cheickhou Kouyate - resulted in Mario firing home a spectacular strike from 18 yards out. The home fans sensed nervousness in the visitors and roared their team on. Arnautovic fired a gilt-edged chance wide on 15 minutes but made amends 90 seconds later when hammering home a rebound after his initial header from close range was palmed back to him. Team news Declan Rice and the previously suspended Arthur Masuaku came back into the fold for West Ham, who had Manuel Lanzini missing through injury. Mark Hughes made two changes and there was a return for Charlie Austin following three months out injured. Southampton's front pair of Charlie Austin and Manolo Gabbiadini were mere bystanders as the Hammers controlled the game in every department. The third goal came during first-half injury-time when Arnautovic volleyed home a pin-point Arthur Masuaku cross. The introduction of Shane Long improved Hughes' men after the break but they never looked capable of giving Joe Hart anything serious to think about. Arnautovic hunted his first Premier League hat-trick but couldn't add to his tally despite testing McCarthy with some long-range efforts - his eighth and ninth goals in his last 13 games were more than enough for the comfortable Hammers. Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic Having been sent off in two of his last three appearances against Southampton, Arnautovic had unfinished business with them and, of course, their manager Hughes, who sold him to West Ham. The decision to switch him to a central striker now looks a masterstroke from Moyes and after failing to score in his first 13 appearances for West Ham, he's now got nine goals to his name this season. Arnautovic starred in front of his former manager Mark Hughes Opta stats West Ham scored three first-half goals in a Premier League game for the first time since September 2012 against Fulham. Indeed, the Hammers have scored three goals in a Premier League game at the London Stadium for just the second time - also 3-0 vs Crystal Palace in January 2017. Southampton have won just 28 points from their 31 Premier League games this season - only in 1996-97 and 2004-05 (27 each) have they recorded fewer at this stage of a Premier League campaign. Hughes hasn't won his first Premier League match in charge of a club since September 2004 at Blackburn - losing four of his five such games since then (lost with Man City, QPR, Stoke, Southampton and drew with Fulham). Hughes has won just one of his last 12 away Premier League games as manager (W1 D3 L8). Arnautovic has been directly involved in more Premier League goals this season than any other West Ham player (9 goals, 3 assists). England World Cup watch Joe Hart made just his second Premier League appearance since November 29 and kept a clean sheet in front of the watching Gareth Southgate. Ryan Bertrand also faces a battle make the final World Cup squad after Ashley Young’s solid performances in the friendlies and he struggled to make an impact for Southampton. West Ham’s opening two goals came from an attack that developed down his flank. Manager reaction David Moyes: \"We made a great start and we had great support from the first minute and I think it inspired the players as well. \"The players had a really good go right at the start and thankfully we got a couple of early goals and the third goal just before half-time made a big difference as well.\" Mark Hughes: \"We were poor. The opening period of a game is vitally important. \"You have to understand as the away team that the home team is going to come flying out of the blocks and you have to be ready to go yourself. \"Unfortunately, as happened against Newcastle, a very similar situation unfolded today.\" Pundit reaction: Charlie Nicholas West Ham were all over Southampton like a rash from the first whistle, but Southampton created their own mess. Arnautovic has got pace and power, he likes to stretch the defenders with a little angle on the shoulder of them and it means that they don't like defending too high up. He gets his team up the pitch by 10-15 yards. This was everything about a positive return from David Moyes and his team but there is plenty to talk about for Southampton. Austin was living off scraps, for a game of this magnitude it incredible how they froze. It wasn't fear they just didn't play like a team. If they continue like this they are going down. What's next? West Ham have a London derby with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge next Sunday, live on Super Sunday, while Southampton take on Arsenal in Sunday's early game - also live on Sky Sports."}, {"date":

Everton 1-3 Man City Everton 1-3 Man City Champions elect Man City are within one win of the Premier League title after a fine first-half blitz gave them a 3-1 win at Everton on Saturday. Match highlights Tap on the VIDEO section of the app if you are having problems viewing match highlights. If City beat rivals Manchester United on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium, live on Sky Sports Premier League at 5.30pm, they will be crowned champions for the third time in seven years. City took the lead after just four minutes through Leroy Sane's fine volley, before Gabriel Jesus nodded in the second (13) for his first Premier League goal since November as the leaders cut through Everton with ease. The champions elect put in a superb performance at Goodison Park Player ratings Everton: Pickford (5), Coleman (5), Keane (6), Jagielka (5), Baines (5), Bolasie (5), Schneiderlin (5), Rooney (4), Walcott (5), Tosun (5), Calvert-Lewin (5) Subs: Davies (4), Baningime (NA), Niasse (NA) Man City: Ederson (6), Kompany (7), Laporte (7), Otamendi (7), Walker (8), Fernandinho (7), De Bruyne (8), D Silva (9), Sane (8), Sterling (8), Jesus (8) Subs: B Silva (6), Gundogan (NA), Danilo (NA) Man of the match: David Silva Raheem Sterling made it 3-0 with a low finish eight yards (37), but Yannick Bolasie pulled one back for Everton with a low effort from long range off both posts (63). The result leaves Everton in ninth, eight points off the top six but having played two games more than sixth-place Arsenal. Despite not playing for 19 days, City ran riot in the first half, taking the lead through Sane's superb far-post volley from David Silva's lifted cross. Everton should have equalised as Bolasie headed over from close range, but just seconds later it was 2-0 as Jesus headed past Jordan Pickford from six yards after Kevin De Bruyne's deft, lifted cross from the right. Team news Man City made only one change from their last game, a 2-0 win at Stoke; Zinechenko was named on the bench, with Laporte coming into defence. Everton went with an attacking side; Gueye missed out and Davies was on the bench, meaning Calvert-Lewin and Schneiderlin replaced them. Gabriel Jesus scores his first Premier League goal since November to make it 2-0 Leighton Baines then curled a free-kick inches wide, before Kyle Walker dragged a fine opportunity past the post, but City made amends with eight minutes of the half remaining as Sterling finished low at the far post from Silva's centre after another lightning counter attack. Everton defended better in the second half, but they were nearly four behind as Pickford did well to readjust and turn over Fernandinho's deflected long-range effort. The hosts pulled a goal back midway through the half as Bolasie's low, 20-yard shot went through the legs of Walker, striking both posts before crossing the line. Cenk Tosun then headed a good chance wide from a Baines corner, while at the other end Fernandinho hit a beauty from 30 yards inches wide of the upright. The win means Pep Guardiola's first title at City, and his seventh in his last nine seasons in management, could be confirmed next weekend. Raheem Sterling adds a third for City in the first half The managers Sam Allardyce: \"You are 2-0 down so early on and then you try to go to get back in the game because you panic a little bit and we opened ourselves up too much and conceded a third from the counter-attack. At 2-0 we became disheveled and lost doing things as a team together. We put that right in the second half.\" Pep Guardiola: \"We are closer than ever. We have one game to win. If we are not able to win, we have six more chances. We are so, so close and so happy with the performance. I understand the people are talking about United now but all the decisions I am going to take is thinking about Liverpool - the game before United and after United. That is what it is.\" Opta stats Guardiola is now the second quickest manager to reach 50 Premier League wins in the competition's history, doing so in just 69 matches. Only Jose Mourinho (63 games) reached 50 wins faster. Indeed, his City side are the 10th team to have beaten every other top-flight club within the same season, and the first since Manchester United in 2010/11. Manchester City's final possession figure of 82.13 per cent is the highest by an away side in a single Premier League game since we have this data available (2003/04). Manchester City are just the third club to have three players (De Bruyne, Sane and Silva) reach double figures for assists in a single Premier League season, after Liverpool (1995/96) and Arsenal (2004/05). Since the start of the 2015/16 campaign, De Bruyne has provided 42 assists in the Premier League, more than any other player in the top five European leagues. England World Cup watch Kyle Walker was at his blistering best at Goodison Park, continuing his impressive form from the international break, but this time played on the right flank rather than in the central defensive trio. His team-mate Raheem Sterling also starred, scoring City's third goal. For Everton, Jordan Pickford's struggled with his distribution on his right foot, and though Michael Keane was kept busy, he put in a decent performance in Everton's defence. Theo Walcott showed glimpses of quality, but ultimately failed to get into the game, while Tom Davies featured for just over half an hour. Man of the match - David Silva Any one of four City players could have picked up the gong on Saturday evening, but Silva's continued form shows no sign of slowing down. He was majestic again at Goodison Park, setting up the first and third goals, and making more key passes (five) than any other player. Make no mistake, there's a real case for calling Silva City's best-ever player, and one of the greatest imports the Premier League has ever seen. What's next? Before the visit of United on Saturday, City go to Anfield in their Champions League semi-final first leg against Liverpool on Wednesday evening.

West Brom had been leading with 13 minutes to go thanks to Jay Rodriguez's well-taken opener (49), the forward's ninth goal of the season, only for the hosts to equalise through Jordon Ibe's drive (77). However, with the match entering its final minute, Stanislas stepped up to curl a sensational free-kick past Ben Foster as Bournemouth won for the first time in five games to move eight points clear of the relegation zone. As for the visitors, Alan Pardew's team produced one of their best displays of the season, but this latest defeat - their seventh in a row - leaves them 10 points from safety with now only seven games left this campaign. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (6), Steve Cook (6), Ake (6), Adam Smith (7), Stanislas (8), Lewis Cook (6), Gosling (6), Ibe (7), Wilson (5), King (8) Subs: Daniels (6), Defoe (6), Mousset (6) West Brom: Foster (7), Nyom (7), Evans (7), Dawson (6), Hegazi (6), Gibbs (7), Yacob (6), Livermore (7), Brunt (7), Rondon (9), Rodriguez (8) Subs: Robson-Kanu (6), Phillips (7), Field (6) Man of the match: Salomon Rondon In a first half with virtually no goalmouth action to report, it was two penalty calls not awarded by referee Graham Scott that were the talk of the Vitality at the break. The first incident came on the half-hour mark when Josh King appeared to be upended by Ahmed Hegazi, while five minutes later Salomon Rondon got to the ball first in the area, only for Nathan Ake to catch the striker. West Brom had soon forgotten that last decision though after taking the lead early in the second half following an excellent team move involving Kieran Gibbs, who powered down the left flank before standing a cross up for Rondon at the far post. Team news Joshua King started for the hosts having recovered from a neck problem. Meanwhile, West Brom defender Jonny Evans returned after missing last weekend's loss to Leicester. The Venezuelan then headed the ball back across for Rodriguez, who did well to swivel and volley past Begovic as hopes were raised of an all-too-rare win on the road for the Baggies. Those hopes, however, were dashed in the final quarter of the match as first Ibe beat Foster with a low drive that despite bouncing just in front of him, the goalkeeper should have kept out. Stanislas then broke West Brom hearts with a breathtaking free-kick that this time Foster had no chance with, the forward's fifth goal of the campaign, before Charlie Daniels' goal-line clearance prevented Matt Phillips for equalising in the seventh minute of stoppage time. Opta stats Bournemouth have picked up 16 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side West Brom have lost 24 points from leading positions in the top-flight this season, more than any other team The Cherries have lost just one of their last seven Premier League games on home soil, winning four and drawing two That 24-point haul is also the most the Baggies have ever lost from leading positions in a single Premier League campaign Rodriguez has netted three goals in his four Premier League appearances against Bournemouth; against no other side has he scored more (also 3 v Newcastle and Stoke) Rodriguez's goal was West Brom's first away from home in the league in 402 minutes Ibe has been directly involved in five goals in his last eight top-flight games with Bournemouth (2 goals, 3 assists), after managing just three in his previous 44 with the Cherries (3 assists) Stanislas has netted four goals in his last seven Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 19 Managers Eddie Howe: It was a difficult game, we always knew it would be, especially with the way West Brom played. They got men behind the ball, they made it very difficult for us. And it was even more difficult when we went behind against that style of play. To go behind was always going to be our biggest challenge, but we found something again and thankfully we have been able to do that at times and come back. It did not look like we were going to do that today, but that is where the players deserve exit credit. 2:00 Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe says Junior Stanislas’ hard work on the training pitch is paying off after his free kick helped them to a win over West Brom Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe says Junior Stanislas’ hard work on the training pitch is paying off after his free kick helped them to a win over West Brom Alan Pardew: It was really hard on our players - they put in an unbelievable effort. It's tough for us as it's been one of those seasons where nothing has gone right - the players have worked really hard and it's difficult to look them in the eye when they've got no reward for it. They'll be walking out of here injured animals as they didn't deserve that. 2:28 Alan Pardew says West Brom didn’t deserve to lose to Bournemouth after putting in an unbelievable effort Alan Pardew says West Brom didn’t deserve to lose to Bournemouth after putting in an unbelievable effort The pundit - Phil Thompson West Brom were well worthy of going in front. Rondon was on fire. It was like Bournemouth were waiting to go behind to start playing. West Brom started to back off and when Jonny Evans went off, a minute later West Brom were behind. Stanislas' free kick was fantastic. I thought West Brom looked tired. Bournemouth probably just about shaded it, but Alan Pardew must be thinking what more West Brom have to do to get out of this run. 3:49 Phil Thompson says West Brom looked the more threatening of the two sides in their 2-1 defeat to Bournemouth and hailed the impact of Salomon Rondon Phil Thompson says West Brom looked the more threatening of the two sides in their 2-1 defeat to Bournemouth and hailed the impact of Salomon Rondon Man of the Match - Salomon Rondon The muscular Venezuela international did not deserve to be on the losing side after producing an impressive display on the south coast. The frontman helped create Rodriguez's opener and had a hand in everything good the struggling Baggies did all afternoon long. However, despite running himself into the ground, the 28-year-old could not prevent his team from conceding twice late on and seemingly slip towards the Championship. What's next? Bournemouth take on Watford at Vicarage Road in the league on Saturday, March 31. Meanwhile, West Brom entertain Burnley at the Hawthorns, with that match also taking place next Saturday afternoon."}, {"date": "17/03/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 23980,

Huddersfield 0-2 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace moved out of the Premier League drop zone after they beat fellow relegation rivals Huddersfield 2-0 on Saturday. It was a strong away performance from Roy Hodgson's side, with James Tomkins poking home the opener in the 23rd minute to the delight of the away fans. Luka Milivojevic added the second from the penalty spot in the 67th minute after Andros Townsend was fouled by Mathias Jorgensen in the area to send Crystal Palace two points clear of 18th place where they had started the day.

Subs used: Cabaye (7), Loftus-Cheek (n/a). Man of the match: James Tomkins. Huddersfield offered little in terms of a reply throughout the game at a snowy John Smith's Stadium, and remain in 15th on 31 points - one ahead of the Eagles. Palace began well in west Yorkshire and could have taken the lead in the seventh minute as Milivojevic curled a superb free-kick over the wall, but it did not have enough whip to find the back of the net. But they made the breakthrough in the 23rd minute as Tomkins took advantage of some sloppy Huddersfield defending. Milivojevic was involved again as he delivered a corner, which fell to the defender in the six-yard box. His initial effort was saved by Jonas Lossl, but he managed to poke home the rebound and put Palace ahead. Team news Huddersfield made one change with Colin Quaner coming in for Rajiv van La Parra. Crystal Palace made two changes with Wilfried Zaha and Mamadou Sakho coming in for Alexander Sorloth and Martin Kelly. Huddersfield grew into the game after going behind with a number of crosses from both flanks going into the area, but they were unable to create a clear-cut opening as they went into the break on the back foot. Palace continued to see the better of the chances in the second half, and had an effort cleared off the line in the 61st minute. It could have been another for Tomkins as he collected a Townsend corner at the back post, but his shot through the area was seen away by Steve Mounie. But Huddersfield had their best chance of the game not long after. Florent Hadergjonaj crossed into the area and after a slight flick on from Milivojevic at the near post, the ball landed to the feet of Mounie but his fierce drive flew past the post. Luka Milivojevic celebrates scoring from the spot for Crystal Palace against Huddersfield Palace put the game to bed in the 67th minute, though, as Townsend was brought down in the area by Jorgensen and referee Mike Dean pointed to the spot. Captain Milivojevic sent Lossl the wrong way as he smashed home the penalty to seal victory for Palace. Opta stats Crystal Palace have won seven Premier League away points in 2018 (W2 D1 L3), one more than they picked up in their previous 12 away games in 2017 (W1 D3 L8). Huddersfield have failed to score in a league-high 17 different Premier League games this season. Christian Benteke is challenged by Scott Malone Crystal Palace ended a seven-match winless run in the Premier League (D2 L5), securing their first victory since a 1-0 win over Burnley in January. Luka Milivojevic has scored more penalties than any other Premier League player this season (6). The managers David Wagner: \"I think it was a deserved result.

I hope that is going to give us some type of boost and confidence for the future.\" Man of the match - James Tomkins James Tomkins celebrates after putting Palace ahead It was a superb performance from Tomkins at both ends of the field. Not only did he show brilliant reactions to score the opening goal but he twice further collected corners in the box, but was denied by the Huddersfield defence. He played a major part in Palace securing a clean sheet, nicking in front of players and making clearances at almost every turn. He helped clear up some mistakes by centre-back partner Mamadou Sakho, and was fantastic in keeping Huddersfield quiet. What's next?

2-1 win at a snowy Bet365 Stadium. The Potters played an hour with 10 men after Charlie Adam was sent off by Martin Atkinson for a foul on Wayne Rooney. They fell behind to Tosun's opener (69) from close range after his initial header had been saved, but Stoke had substitute Eric Choupo-Moting to thank for their leveller when he side-footed in Joe Allen's excellent free-kick - injuring himself in the process, and lasting only six minutes in total before he was forced back off. Player ratings Stoke City: Butland (5), Johnson (6), Shawcross (6), Zouma (5), Stafylidis (5), Ndiaye (6), Allen (6), Adam (6), Shaqiri (5), Crouch (6), Sobhi (6). Subs: Choupu-Moting (7), Berahino (6), Jese (5). Everton: Pickford (6), Coleman (6), Keane (7), Jagielka (6), Baines (6), Gueye (6), Davies (6), Walcott (7), Rooney (8), Bolasie (7), Tosun (8). Subs: Calvert-Lewin (4), Schneiderlin (n/a), Holgate (n/a). Man of the match: Cenk Tosun Tosun's diving header then finished off Theo Walcott's cross with six minutes to go, leaving Stoke three points from safety having played a game more than many of their relegation rivals. On a day of changing weather in Staffordshire, with snow blizzards and clear sunshine interchanging at will, the main talking point before the break came thanks to Atkinson. Cenk Tosun reacts after scoring for Everton against Stoke in the Premier League. His decision to send off Adam appeared harsh. The Scotsman and Rooney were competing for a 50/50 ball on the edge of the Everton box and Adam's challenge was late rather than dangerous. Everton could not press their man advantage before the break as Stoke held firm in increasingly difficult conditions, but finally did so when they produced the first move worthy of a goal all afternoon. Team news Paul Lambert rung the changes for Stoke, making five alterations from Monday night's defeat to Man City. Everton's one alteration was enforced, with the injured Gylfi Sigurdsson replaced by Idrissa Gueye. Yannick Bolasie's cross was headed goalwards by Tosun, and at the second attempt he turned the ball in for the opener despite Ryan Shawcross' best efforts. Everton looked more likely to double their advantage than the deflated Potters did to find an equaliser, but they pulled level when Choupo-Moting, brought on four minutes earlier, popped up at the far post to slot home Allen's brilliant free-kick from deep. Watch highlights from Stoke 1-2 Everton All of a sudden, the hosts looked confident - but it was shortlived, as Walcott's inviting cross was turned in by Tosun with a low header Butland perhaps should have saved, to leave Stoke's route to survival as treacherous as the weather at the Bet365 Stadium. What's next? Stoke's tough time at the bottom doesn't get any easier, with a trip to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal on April 1. Everton have a home game with Manchester City on March 31 with Liverpool coming up at Goodison Park seven days later."}, {"date": "17/03/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53287, "home_team":

Mohamed Salah continued his superb season by scoring four times as Liverpool thrashed Watford 5-0 at Anfield in the Premier League on Saturday. Salah struck twice in the first half and then twice again late in the game to secure his first Liverpool hat-trick and take his tally to 36 for the season in all competitions. That is the best haul in a debut season by a Liverpool player while he also chipped in with an assist shortly after half-time when he set up Roberto Firmino for a flicked finish. Player ratings Liverpool: Karius (6), Gomez (7), Van Dijk (7), Matip (7), Robertson (7), Wijnaldum (7), Henderson (7), Can (5), Mane (7), Salah (10), Firmino (8) Subs: Milner (6), Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Ings (6) Watford: Karnezis (4), Holebas (4), Prodl (4), Britos (3), Mariappa (4), Doucoure (4), Capoue (4), Pereyra (5), Femenia (4), Richarlison (4), Deeney (4) Subs: Hughes (5), Okaka (5), Janmaat (5) Man of the match: Mohamed Salah Watford offered little in response as their poor away form under Javi Gracia continued. The Hornets are yet to even score on the road since Gracia took over in January, and they were given a masterclass in finishing from Salah as Liverpool bounced back from their defeat at Manchester United in style. In snowy conditions, the Reds enjoyed the perfect start as Salah, who is now four clear in the Premier League golden boot race with 28 goals, sat down Miguel Britos in the box and then fired a low shot past Orestis Karnezis in the fourth minute. Salah celebrates scoring his second goal of the game with Firmino Watford defended deep in the opening half an hour and were only eventually given impetus by a few slack passes from Liverpool, who had otherwise looked comfortable. However, after Richarlison headed at Loris Karius, the Reds doubled their lead as Andy Robertson's perfectly-placed cross was finished by Salah from 10 yards out in the 43rd minute. Salah then set up Firmino to cleverly flick in for 3-0 after half-time. Roberto Pereyra hit the bar for Watford from a free-kick shortly afterwards, but that was a rare positive moment for the visitors, who crumbled late on. Salah twisted and turned in the box in the 77th minute before finishing for his hat-trick and then fired in a fourth in the 85th minute after Danny Ings' shot was spilled by Karnezis. Team news Liverpool made four changes from their defeat at Manchester United as Gomez, Matip, Wijnaldum and Henderson replaced Milner, Alexander-Arnold, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lovren, who missed out with an ankle injury. Britos replaced Janmaat for Watford. Opta stats This was Jurgen Klopp's 50th Premier League home game in charge of Liverpool (W28 D18 L4). The Reds have averaged 2.20 goals per game since Klopp took over - their highest goals per game ratio at Anfield in the competition under any manager. Salah has scored 28 Premier League goals this season, only one African player has netted more in a single campaign (Didier Drogba 29 in 2009-10). Salah is the first Egyptian player to score a Premier League hat-trick, with Egypt the 43rd nation overall and the 10th African country to provide a hat-trick scorer in the competition. Salah scored four goals from his four shots - the first player to do so in the Premier League since Andrey Arshavin in April 2009, also at Anfield. Roberto Firmino (3 assists) and Mo Salah (4 assists) have combined for seven goals in the Premier League this season - the joint-most by any duo, level with Sadio Mane (6 assists) and Mo Salah (1 assist). Watford are winless in their last nine Premier League away games (D1 L8), scoring just twice in that run and failing to find the net in each of the last five. Man of the match - Mohamed Salah Who else? A simply wonderful individual display, from the skill for the opening goal that took him past Britos to the jinking back and forth away from several defenders for the third goal. He's now four clear at the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 28 goals and although the season is nearing the end, isn't showing any signs of slowing down. What's next? Liverpool are next in action on Saturday, March 31 when they travel to Crystal Palace in the Premier League, live on Sky Sports. They then host Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday, April 4.

Man City broke the deadlock after just 10 minutes at the bet365 Stadium thanks to Silva's neat side-footed finish. The Spain midfielder then doubled the visitors' advantage, converting after a lovely move five minutes into the second half. As a result, Pep Guardiola's side will now win the Premier League by beating Everton and second-placed Manchester United in their next two fixtures.

The champions-elect made the perfect start to proceedings, taking an early lead thanks to yet another brilliant team goals that began with Vincent Kompany at the back. Man City's captain fed the returning Fernandinho in midfield and, after a slick exchange of passes involving Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling, the England forward's right-wing cross was swept home by Silva's composed finish, although Jack Butland may have done better in Stoke's goal. David Silva celebrates his opener at the bet365 Stoke huffed and puffed in the first half, but the closest the hosts came to equalising was when Xherdan Shaqiri's quick feet saw the Swiss get free to the byline on the right, only for Fernandinho to crucially deflect Badou Ndiaye's goal-bound shot just past the far post. The visitors made Stoke pay for that miss when Silva scored his second of the night after 50 minutes, and his eighth league goal of the campaign, as Paul Lambert's team were again undone by a breathtaking goal. Team news Stoke made just one alteration from the side that drew with Southampton last time out as Jese replaced the injured Mame Biram Diouf in attack. Meanwhile, Man City made three changes from the team that beat Chelsea last Sunday, with Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho and Raheem Sterling all recalled. Fernandinho picked out the Spain international, who then found Jesus lurking just outside the box, with the forward's lovely return pass allowing Silva to hook the ball over the advancing Butland to give Man City breathing space. Man City moved up a further gear and were unlucky not to add more goals in the final quarter, but a combination of poor finishing, excellent goalkeeping and bad luck denied both Sterling and the impressive Leroy Sane. Not that that mattered, and with Man City having now collected 81 points from their 30 league games this season, they have now equalled Leicester City's total as champions three years ago. Man of the Match - David Silva The Spain international ran the show from start to finish in the Potteries on Monday Night Football, with his two goals either side of half-time putting City within touching distance of a third Premier League title. The midfielder's opener came with a cushioned finish, while his second meant the 32-year-old has now scored eight league goals this season, his second highest tally in a single campaign in the competition after netting 12 three years ago.

The pundit - Gary Neville \"What I would say is it's the best team I've seen in terms of their attacking shape being the best defensive shape. They are absolutely perfect when they attack, which means they are perfect when they defend. \"Their attacking positions are such that when they back up play they are in a shape whereby they can sustain every single attack. \"They don't come out of shape. They are brilliant in their attacking, but also they are brilliant in their defending off the back of their attacking. \"They are the best I've seen in terms of their organisation, it really is wonderful to watch - and it is clockwork.\" Stoke's Maxim Choupo-Moting (left) shields the ball from Man City midfielder Fernandinho Opta stats Man City have now scored 85 Premier League goals this season - only 11 teams have ever scored more in a completed Premier League campaign. David Silva has scored eight Premier League goals this season, his second highest tally in a single campaign in the competition (12 in 2014-15). Silva also bagged his second league brace of the campaign - he'd only scored three in his previous seven Premier League seasons combined. Only Jonas Lössl (50) has conceded more Premier League goals among goalkeepers than Jack Butland (49) this season. Gabriel Jesus has played 31 Premier League games without ever being on the losing side (W26 D5). It's the fourth longest run without defeat from a Premier League debut, after Jens Lehmann (47), Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba (37 each). David Silva (centre) is congratulated by his Man City team-mates after opening the scoring What's next? Man City travel to Goodison Park to take on Everton. However, the Premier League leaders have to wait until tea time on Saturday March 31 before they are next in action, followed by United at the Etihad in their following fixture on Saturday April 7 in a match you can see live on Sky Sports Premier League.

watch highlights Arsenal 3-0 Watford - watch highlights Arsenal geared up for their Europa League decider and halted a run of three straight Premier League defeats with a 3-0 win over Watford at the Emirates. Shkodran Mustafi headed an eighth-minute opener and Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang fired a belated second just before the hour-mark, before Henrikh Mkhitaryan added a third 13 minutes from time as Arsene Wenger's selection gamble with AC Milan in mind paid off. The hosts had escaped punishment for a profligate first half and were indebted to Petr Cech for saving a Troy Deeney penalty just minutes after Aubameyang struck, the goalkeeper finally recording his 200th Premier League clean sheet. Wenger's scrutinised side remain 10 points adrift of the top four, having played a game more, but victory at a stadium once again pockmarked by empty seats will at least help boost still-fragile confidence ahead of a Europa League last-16 showdown pivotal to their season. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (8), Maitland Niles (6), Holding (6), Mustafi (7), Kolasinac (6), Elneny (7), Xhaka (7), Ozil (7), Iwobi (6), Mkhitaryan (7), Aubameyang (7). Subs used: Chambers (6), Wilshere (6), Welbeck (6). Watford: Karnezis (7), Femenia (6), Prodl (6), Mariappa (6), Holebas (6), Doucoure (7), Capoue (7), Janmaat (6), Pereyra (7), Richarlison (7), Deeney (6). Subs: Britos (6), Hughes (6), Okaka (6). Man of the Match: Petr Cech Aubameyang celebrates in style after netting Arsenal's second goal Deeney had memorably accused Arsenal of lacking 'cojones' at Vicarage Road in October but after responding to their critics with a 2-0 win in Italy on Thursday, the Gunners set a brisk tempo despite six changes that saw Laurent Koscielny and Aaron Ramsey rested. Ozil had slipped Aubameyang through with just two minutes on the clock, Hornets 'keeper Orestis Karnezis splayed to thwart him, but the German created the opener soon after with an inswinging free-kick that Mustafi rose between yellow shirts to meet. Team news Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang returned to the starting line-up as one of six Arsenal changes, Petr Cech, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Rob Holding, Mohamed Elneny and Alex Iwobi given starts. Kiko Femenia replaced Andre Carrillo for Watford. That milestone goal - Arsenal's 1,000th at home in the Premier League - might have been supplemented before the break but Sead Kolasinac's heavy centre just evaded Aubameyang's lunge (17) and after collecting Mohamed Elneny's ball on the run, Ozil lashed straight at the goalkeeper (28). Abdoulaye Doucoure's driving run into the box had tested Cech's reactions, while Roberto Pereyra smashed a loose ball from close range over the crossbar (25) during a half where the visitors grew in confidence as their hosts failed to increase their lead. Troy Deeney sees his second-half penalty saved by Petr Cech Cech had pushed away a stoppage-time Richarlison header to preserve the slim advantage by the break and Rob Holding was forced into a smart block after the restart as Watford maintained momentum. Danny Welbeck was stripped to enter the fray, home nerves lingering, but then Mkhitaryan pounced on a loose ball and drove goalwards, threading through a ball that Aubameyang tucked away before flipping backwards in celebration (59). Shkodran Mustafi celebrates scoring Arsenal's first goal against Watford with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Mohamed Elneny Arsenal breathed easier but Watford were gifted a lifeline when Ainsley Maitland-Niles tripped Pereyra, only for Deeney - booed lustily as he stepped up to the spot - to fire straight at Cech. The Czech punched the air, landmark shut-out in sight, as the Emirates noise finally lifted, and having opened his Arsenal account in midweek, Mkhitaryan sealed the points when he latched onto Aubameyang's ball and slotted home. 4:26 Alan Smith and Alex Scott analyse Arsenal's 3-0 win over Watford and discuss the issue of empty seats at the Emirates. Alan Smith and Alex Scott analyse Arsenal's 3-0 win over Watford and discuss the issue of empty seats at the Emirates. Opta stats Arsene Wenger registered his 700th Arsenal win in his 1,222nd match in charge of the Gunners. Mesut Ozil became the fastest player to reach 50 Premier League assists, doing so in just 141 games and breaking the record held by Eric Cantona (143 games). Petr Cech made his first Premier League penalty save since February 2011 for Chelsea against Fulham - it was also the 16th he'd faced in all competitions for Arsenal and the first one he'd saved for the Gunners. Cech registered his 200th Premier League clean sheet, the first goalkeeper to achieve this feat in the competition's history. Four of Mustafi's five Premier League goals have been assisted by Mesut Özil (two from corners, two from free kicks) - all four of the Özil assisted goals have been at the Emirates. Watford have now lost all five of their away Premier League matches in the month of March. Man of the match - Petr Cech Mohamed Elneny impressed and Mesut Ozil - who pulled up in the first half before playing on - was at the centre of Arsenal's best attacking play before the break but Petr Cech takes the prize on his milestone day. Speaking on Super Sunday co-commentary, Alan Smith said: \"He's not been flawless but he made four saves and got that 200th clean sheet. He deserves it.\" 3:13 Petr Cech and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang share their thoughts after Arsenal's 3-0 win over Watford.

Bournemouth took the lead through Junior Stanislas (7), before goals from Dele Alli (35), Son (65 and 87) and Serge Aurier (90) ensured Spurs strengthened their position in the top four. It was an impressive response to their agonising midweek Champions League exit to Juventus but there is cause for concern over Kane, who was forced off in the first half after he awkwardly planted his right boot into the turf. Tottenham move into third place, one point above Liverpool and five ahead of fifth-placed Chelsea. Bournemouth, meanwhile, remain in 12th and six points above the relegation zone. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (5), Francis, S (6) Cook (6), Ake (6), Smith (6), Stanislas (7), Daniels (6), L Cook (5), Mousset (6), Wilson (6) Subs: Ibe (5), King (N/A), Defoe (N/A) Tottenham: Lloris (7), Aurier (6), Vertonghen (6), Sanchez (6), Rose (5), Wanyama (6), Dembele (6), Eriksen (6), Alli (8), Son (9), Kane (6) Subs: Lamela (6), Sissoko (5), Trippier (5) Man of the match: Heung-Min Son Bournemouth were gifted a golden opportunity to go in front in the opening exchanges. In the third minute, Callum Wilson sprinted behind Davinson Sanchez and squared the ball across to Stanislas, whose effort crashed off the crossbar. But the 28-year-old made amends moments later by putting his side ahead following a ruthless counter-attack. Adam Smith's low cross from the right flank was missed by Wilson before Stanislas, on the half-volley, hit home to hand Bournemouth a deserved lead. Kane had the ball in the net on the half-hour mark but it was ruled out for offside shortly before he was forced off the pitch with an ankle injury. However, Tottenham seemed unfazed as Alli grabbed an equaliser in the 35th minute as he tapped in Aurier's low cross to end a run of 15 games without a goal. Team news Bournemouth made just the one change, bringing in Mousset to replace Josh King, while Spurs made three changes from Wednesday's defeat at Wembley. Full-backs Trippier and Davies are replaced by Aurier and Rose, while Wanyama came in for Dier, who picked up a knock against Juventus but is on the bench. The hosts responded brightly at the start of the second half as Simon Francis, on his 600th Bournemouth appearance, unleashed a fierce drive towards goal which Hugo Lloris did well to parry away. At the other end, in the 57th minute, Christian Eriksen was denied by Asmir Begovic as he pushed away his powerful drive that seemed destined for the bottom corner. Spurs continued to push for the lead and found it through Son five minutes later. Alli turned from goal-scorer to provider as he dinked the ball into the South Korea international's path, allowing him to acrobatically turn his first-time shot in. In the 83rd minute, Wilson had a goal ruled out as referee Mike Dean felt he fouled Sanchez when he controlled the ball to tap home. Alli and Son celebrate Tottenham's second goal against Bournemouth And Spurs completed a convincing turnaround when Son struck again in the 87th minute. The 25-year-old rounded Begovic for a simple finish before Aurier completed the comfortable win with a far-post header. Opta stats Tottenham are now unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League games (W9 D3) - only once before have they been on a longer run without a defeat in the competition (14 games ending in December 2015). Bournemouth have now failed to beat Spurs in six Premier League meetings (D1 L5). Only against Manchester City City (0 points) have they picked up fewer points in the competition since they joined. Indeed, the Cherries side have conceded 17 goals in six Premier League games against Spurs - only Man City have netted more against them since they joined the competition (21). Eddie Howe's side have now lost 19 points from leading positions this season; only West Brom (21) have dropped more after taking the lead in the Premier League. Dele Alli has scored 10+ goals in all competitions in each of his three seasons with Spurs (42 goals total). Man of the Match - Heung-Min Son Son scored twice against Bournemouth After Kane went off injured, Son took on the goalscoring responsibility and did so with flying colours. When the game was firmly in the balance, Son scored the game's pivotal goal before putting the visitors further ahead three minutes from time. Son's continues his fine form as he now has six goals in his last four matches. What's next? Bournemouth host West Brom on March 17 in a 3pm kick-off. Tottenham, meanwhile, travel to Swansea for their FA Cup quarter-final tie on the same day (12.15pm)."}, {"date": "10/03/2018", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74855, "home_team": {"name":

Manchester United to a crucial 2-1 victory over rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford on Saturday. The England forward's thunderous drive fired United into the lead on 14 minutes - his first Premier League goal since December 10 - and he doubled his tally with a deflected second 10 minutes later. Eric Bailly's 66th-minute own goal handed an improved Liverpool a route back into the game but United withstood a late onslaught to secure their first victory over their rivals since January 2016. The victory sees Jose Mourinho's men extend their unbeaten league run against Liverpool to eight games and opens up a five-point lead over Jurgen Klopp's side in the race for second. Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (7), Valencia (6), Bailly (7), Smalling (7), Young (8), McTominay (6), Matic (6), Mata (6), Rashford (8), Sanchez (6), Lukaku (7). Subs: Darmian (n/a), Fellaini (6), Lingard (n/a). Liverpool: Karius (5), Alexander-Arnold (5), Lovren (5), Van Dijk (5), Robertson (6), Milner (5), Can (5), Oxlade-Chamberlain (5), Salah (6), Mane (5), Firmino (5). Subs: Wijnaldum (5), Lallana (5), Solanke (5). Man of the Match: Marcus Rashford. There was a subdued start to the 200th meeting between England's two most-decorated clubs, but Rashford, making his first league start since Boxing Day, ignited the contest. Romelu Lukaku bullied Dejan Lovren to flick a David de Gea punt into the path of Rashford, who cut inside Trent Alexander-Arnold before ruthlessly rifling the ball into the far corner. Virgil van Dijk should have drawn Liverpool level on 23 minutes but he headed James Milner's corner wide from five yards - and Rashford made him pay for the miss a minute later. After Lukaku got the better of Lovren in the air again, Juan Mata's attempted shot was blocked into Rashford's path and his low effort took a nick off Alexander-Arnold on its way past Karius. Team news Jose Mourinho made three changes as Juan Mata, Marcus Rashford and Eric Bailly replaced Jesse Lingard, Victor Lindelof and the injured Paul Pogba. In Jurgen Klopp’s only change, James Milner got the nod ahead of Jordan Henderson. United so nearly had a third on 39 minutes but Mata's overhead kick flashed wide, moments before Ashley Young brilliantly denied Liverpool a lifeline, preventing Andrew Robertson's cross from setting up Mohamed Salah for a tap-in. There was a stark improvement from Liverpool after the break. Van Dijk steered a header onto the roof of the United goal within four minutes of the restart before a combination of Chris Smalling and Young denied Salah from converting Roberto Firmino's lofted pass. The visitors had a strong penalty appeal declined on 57 minutes when Robertson's drilled cross appeared to strike Antonio Valencia's arm, but they were back in the game nine minutes later when Bailly clumsily turned Sadio Mane's cross into his own net. In a pulsating finale, substitute Georginio Wijnaldum's rasping 18-yard drive deflected inches wide, a last-gasp Bailly tackle halted a dangerous Mane run into the area and, into the sixth-minute of stoppage time, Salah blazed a volley over as Liverpool's hopes of a comeback failed to materialise. Opta stats Man Utd defeated Liverpool for the 68th time in league competition; this is the most defeats that Liverpool have suffered against a single side. Liverpool have won only one of their seven Premier League games on the weekends immediately following playing a Champions League game this season (W1 D4 L2). Man Utd have won 20 of their 30 Premier League games this season, already surpassing their totals in both 2016-17 (18) and 2015-16 (19) and equalling their number of league wins in 2014-15 (20). Only Man Utd (67) have profited from more own goals in the Premier League than Liverpool (58). Marcus Rashford has scored seven of his 16 Premier League goals against teams in the 'big six' (44%). Marcus Rashford has scored with 29% of his shots in the Premier League against 'big six' clubs, compared to a 10% ratio against the other teams. Romelu Lukaku now has seven Premier League assists this season; more than he has in any previous campaign. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"Is it a perfect result? Yes. Three points is very important. I wouldn't go so far as saying it was a perfect performance. In the first half, the game gave us the opportunity to be direct, fast and score goals, more than we did. A third goal from Mata would've been fantastic.\" 3:16 Jose Mourinho says Manchester United deserved their 2-1 win against Liverpool and hailed his side's control throughout the game. Jose Mourinho says Manchester United deserved their 2-1 win against Liverpool and hailed his side's control throughout the game. Jurgen Klopp: \"Nobody could have had an argument if it was a draw. But the situations around the two goals cannot happen. They scored twice and it was a big influence, it was a big boost for them and a big blow for us. We needed luck but we cannot say we do not deserve the defeat because of the two goals.\" 3:26 Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says it was a hard position to be in, going two goals down in their 2-1 defeat against Manchester United and admitted they have to defend better.

Brighton were happy to sit back until the hour-mark, when Yannick Bolasie's cross was turned into his own net by Gaetan Bong, under pressure from Theo Walcott. It was 2-0 shortly after through Tosun (76), who fired in off the crossbar from 12 yards after Leighton Baines had squared the ball across goal. Theo Walcott and Seamus Coleman celebrate the opener Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (7), Jagielka (7), Keane (6), Baines (7), Sigurdsson (6), Davies (6), Walcott (7), Rooney (6), Bolasie (6), Tosun (7) Subs: Calvert-Lewin (6), Holgate (NA), Klaassen (NA) Brighton: Ryan (6), Schelotto (5), Dunk (6), Duffy (6), Bong (4), Kayal (5), Propper (5), Izquierdo (5), Gross (5), Knockaert (4), Murray (5) Subs: Locadia (5), Ulloa (NA), Suttner (NA) Man of the match: Cenk Tosun Wayne Rooney saw a late penalty superbly saved by Matt Ryan, but the result sees Everton move up to ninth, while Brighton are down to 11th - seven points off the drop zone. For all of Everton's dominance in the first half, in which they had 65 per cent possession and eight corners, they couldn't break down a dogged Brighton side. Seamus Coleman came closest, dragging an effort wide from an angle eight yards out, before Glenn Murray forced Jordan Pickford into a decent save from range. Team news Everton made four changes from the side that lost 2-1 at Burnley: Jagielka, Baines, Rooney and Bolasie came in, Williams, Cuco Martina, Gueye and Calvert-Lewin made way. Kayal came in for Stephens in the only change for Brighton after the win over Arsenal. Everton finally took the lead after the break as Bong inadvertently turned home Bolasie's dangerous cross under pressure from Walcott. It was 2-0 with 14 minutes remaining as Tosun lashed home inside the box, but the ball looked to take a slight deflection off Lewis Dunk before hitting the underside of the crossbar and crossing the line. Anthony Knockaert deservedly saw red for Brighton soon after, going in two-footed on Leighton Baines at the touchline, before Rooney saw a penalty tipped wide by Ryan after Dominic Calvert-Lewin had been brought down by Shane Duffy. Brighton nearly halved the deficit at the death, but Pickford did well to tip away Pascal Gross' effort from the edge of the box. Sigurdsson and Gross battle for the ball in the first half Opta stats? Everton have lost only one of their 10 previous league meetings with Brighton (W5 D4). Everton have won seven consecutive Premier League home games against newly promoted sides for the first time in the competition. Anthony Knockaert's red card was the first Brighton have received in the Premier League and their first in league football since Lewis Dunk's against Huddersfield in February 2017. Wayne Rooney has missed three penalties in the Premier League this season, only the eighth time that a player has missed this many in a single Premier League campaign. Indeed, Rooney is the first player since Darren Bent in 2009-10 to miss as many as three penalties in a Premier League season. The managers Sam Allardyce: \"As soon as we deliver a bit of real quality, the two goals came about. [Tosun] found himself a bit of space and finished it brilliantly. He's settled down. For me, it was 'Why did you buy him? Why are you not playing him?' The usual when you pay money for somebody. For me my job is not what about everybody else says, it's about what I think internally, when he's ready. 3:28 Everton boss Sam Allardyce was delighted with his side’s stylish performance Everton boss Sam Allardyce was delighted with his side’s stylish performance \"He could have got a lot of criticism if I'd played him too soon, and they'd all have started saying: 'What a waste of money,' as happens across the football world, but we were patient with him and he worked really hard. Long may it continue.\" Chris Hughton: \"It was [a bad day at the office], if we play at a level like that, we will find it difficult to win any Premier League games. We know what the levels are, and we have reached those levels in the run we've been on, and we were well below that today. Certainly the best side won.\" 2:59 Brighton boss Chris Hughton was disappointed with his side’s performance Brighton boss Chris Hughton was disappointed with his side’s performance Man of the match: Phil Jagielka There were plenty of contenders for MOTM at Goodison Park, but it has to go to Jagielka, who has been out of the side of late through injury. He was dominant alongside Michael Keane, who has been anxious recently, and dealt with anything Brighton threw at them as they looked to go long to Glenn Murray early on. Special mentions for Cenk Tosun, Theo Walcott and Leighton Baines - but Jagielka stole the show - registering more clearances (six) than any other Everton player. What's next?

"2:36 Huddersfield 0-0 Swansea Huddersfield 0-0 Swansea Swansea produced a brilliant defensive performance to claim a point at Huddersfield despite playing 79 minutes of the 0-0 draw with 10 men. The visitors' gameplan was undone after just 11 minutes when Jordan Ayew was shown a straight red card by Michael Oliver for a high boot in a challenge with Jonathan Hogg. Yet for all their subsequent possession - and Huddersfield enjoyed 81 per cent of the ball - Swansea keeper Lukasz Fabianski was forced into just one save of note, tipping Steve Mounie's fierce volley onto the bar midway through the second half. Tom Ince then hit the post in injury time with a fine downward header, but the hosts could find no way through as Swansea held on to leave both sides on 31 points in their fight against relegation. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Malone (7), Hogg (6), Mooy (6), La Parra (6), Pritchard (6), Ince (7), Mounie (7), Zanka (6), Schindler (6), Hadergjonaj (7) Subs: Williams (6), Depoitre (6), Quaner (6) Swansea: Fabianski (8), Naughton (7), van der Hoorn (7), Mawson (8), Fernandez (8), Olsson (7), Ki (7), Clucas (7), King (7), J Ayew (3), A Ayew (7) Subs: Abraham (6), Carroll (6) Man of the match: Federico Fernandez The game swung on Ayew's red card as he slid in to retrieve the ball in a robust 50-50 challenge with Hogg, although replays showed the Huddersfield captain was perhaps fortunate to avoid punishment as he appeared to stamp on the Swansea forward's leg. And it might have been worse for the visitors had Alfie Mawson made contact with Alex Pritchard with a reckless sliding lunge on 18 minutes. That Pritchard was able to hop out of the way meant the Swansea defender was only shown a yellow. Jordan Ayew is shown a red card after just 11 minutes But the red card established the pattern of the game, with Huddersfield moving the ball wide and throwing in cross after cross, largely without reward as the Swansea back three of Mawson, Federico Fernandez and Mike van der Hoorn continued to head and hack clear. Only once did Town really threaten in the opening 45 minutes - Mounie's flicked header from Aaron Mooy's cross on 41 minutes looping just over the bar with Fabianski scrambling. They improved after the break - a superb cross from Florent Hadergjonaj fell to Scott Malone at the far post but he could not sort his feet out to make contact and ended up in the back of the net instead of the ball. Team news Huddersfield boss David Wagner made three changes, with Aaron Mooy back after a three-game absence with a knee injury. He replaced Danny Williams, while Terence Kongolo missed out through injury, allowing Scott Malone to come in. Tom Ince started after impressing in the defeat at Spurs, so Colin Quaner began the game on the bench. Swansea were unchanged from the side that beat West Ham so emphatically last weekend. Mounie then fired into the side netting on the hour before Fabianski brilliantly tipped the striker's fierce volley onto the bar and behind as Huddersfield continued to press. Hadergjonaj's shot from 25 yards flew inches wide and when Ince's header bounced up and onto the post, Huddersfield knew that despite 28 shots to Swansea's zero, this was not to be their day. Opta stats There have been three occasions of a team having more than 25 shots in a Premier League match but failing to score this season - all of them have been against Swansea City - Southampton: 29 in August, Tottenham: 26 in September and Huddersfield: 30 today. Meanwhile, Swansea became only the third side to fail to have a single shot in a Premier League match since Opta have the data available (2003-04), after West Bromwich Albion against Manchester City in December 2004 (drew 1-1) and Blackburn against Tottenham in April 2012 (lost 0-2). Huddersfield have failed to score in a league-high 16 Premier League games this season. Huddersfield's possession figure of 80.84% is the second highest ever in a Premier League game (since 2003-04), after Manchester City's 82.28 against QPR in May 2012. Jordan Ayew's red card after 11 minutes was the earliest a player has been sent off in the Premier League this season, and earliest in the competition since Jeff Hendrick against Watford in February 2017 (six minutes). The managers David Wagner: \"Sometimes in football you need luck, but the performance was very good. We didn't have luck today, but we will take the clean sheet. It's been a long time since we had a clean sheet. But this could be a crucial point at the end of the season. \"Swansea put all the bodies behind the ball and were lucky. They worked hard but we have to be honest, they were lucky, we were unlucky. We can live with this performance, you don't always you get what you deserve.\" 3:42 Huddersfield boss David Wagner says that Swansea were lucky and his side should have took one of their many chances in their 0-0 draw in the Premier League. Huddersfield boss David Wagner says that Swansea were lucky and his side should have took one of their many chances in their 0-0 draw in the Premier League. Carlos Carvalhal: \"This is one of our best results because of the circumstances of the game and the importance of the game. My players were brave. They fought a lot, the commitment was very strong. We played with 10 players for most of the game. \"When we lost one player, we knew we missed the bridge to go to attack, so we had to protect the point. You see how many crosses and corners they had, but my players were unbelievable.

Swansea boss Carlos Carvalhal was very pleased with his side’s performance after playing most of the game with ten men in their 0-0 draw against Swansea. Man of the match - Federico Fernandez It was a heroic performance by all of Swansea's defenders, but Fernandez was the pick of them all, repelling everything thrown his way as Huddersfield laid siege to the Swansea penalty area. The Argentinian made a game-high 15 clearances for his side as Carlos Carvalhal's side returned to Wales with a valuable point. What's next? Huddersfield's bid to avoid the drop continues with another clash with fellow strugglers as Crystal Palace visit the John Smith's Stadium next Saturday. Swansea have an FA Cup quarter-final date with Tottenham next Saturday before travelling to Manchester United in the Premier League at the end of the month."}, {"date": "10/03/2018", "arena": "St

Newcastle recorded a crucial victory in the battle for survival in the Premier League, beating Southampton 3-0 at St James' Park on Saturday. Kenedy was the man of the moment for the hosts, scoring his first goal for the club in the second minute to give Rafael Benitez's side the perfect start. The Brazilian scored his second after a brilliant counter-attacking move featuring Ayoze Perez and Dwight Gayle in the 29th minute before Matt Ritchie (57) rounded off a comfortable afternoon's work for the hosts. The win sees Newcastle move up to 13th in the league, five points clear of the relegation zone but defeat leaves Southampton perilously close to the drop zone in 17th, one point ahead of Crystal Palace and Stoke having played a game more. Newcastle were handed the perfect start by Kenedy, who chested down Jonjo Shelvey's pass before turning and side-footing the ball past Alex McCarthy and into the bottom corner to score his first goal for the club. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Yedlin (7), Lascelles (7), Lejeune (8), Dummett (7), Ritchie (7), Shelvey (8), Diame(7), Kenedy (8), Perez (7), Gayle (7). Subs: Joselu (6), Atsu (6), Merino (n/a). Southampton: McCarthy (6), Soares (6), Stephens (6), Hoedt (5), Bertrand (6), Redmond (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Lemina (4), Hojbjerg (5), Tadic (4), Carrillo (5). Subs: Long (5), Sims (6), Gabbiadini (5). Man of the match: Jonjo Shelvey. The goal gave the home fans a huge early lift and Benitez's players responded to the backing from their supporters as Shelvey snapped into a tackle to win the ball back in midfield before playing a brilliant pass through to Gayle, whose touch let him down with only McCarthy to beat. Kenedy scores Newcastle's second goal against Southampton Southampton struggled to find any sort of foothold in the game and they should have been further behind when Mohamed Diame dispossessed Mario Lemina, but Gayle's shot was smartly saved by McCarthy low down to his left. The second goal eventually came though, and Lemina was involved again, slipping on the edge of the Newcastle penalty area to allow Perez to break forward on the counter-attack and pick out Gayle in the penalty area. The striker could have easily taken on the shot himself but he showed brilliant vision in sliding the ball to Kenedy, who had a tap-in at the far post to finish off a scintillating Newcastle counter-attack. Team news Rafael Benitez made three changes to the Newcastle side that lost 2-0 to Liverpool last weekend. Shelvey, Perez and Ritchie replace Merino, Atsu and Murphy, who all drop down to the bench. Meanwhile, Southampton made two changes from the side that drew 0-0 with Stoke last week. Ward-Prowse and Hojbjerg replace Sims and Romeu, who both drop to the bench. Southampton responded by sending on Shane Long and Josh Sims on at the break for Lemina and Dusan Tadic but Mauricio Pellegrino's side continued to struggle. And they were further behind in the 57th minute when Shelvey, who had acres of time and space on the edge of the penalty area, laid the ball off for Ritchie, who stroked the ball into the bottom corner. Matt Ritchie celebrates scoring for Newcastle against Southampton Southampton did eventually muster up a couple of shots on target through Guido Carrillo and Sims but Martin Dubravka, who had a quiet afternoon, kept both out to compound what was a miserable afternoon for the Saints. Despite Dubravka's late work, Newcastle remained relatively untroubled as they secured a victory which sees them take a positive step towards remaining in the Premier League. Opta stats Mauricio Pellegrino looks dejected during Southampton's defeat at St James' Park Newcastle kept a clean sheet for the first time in 13 league games against Southampton, since a 1-0 win in October 2003. Benitez's side also scored as many goals this afternoon as they had in their previous six combined at St James' Park in the Premier League (3). Ritchie's strike was the 12th goal Southampton have conceded from outside the box in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. Kenedy's opener was his first in the Premier League for Newcastle and his second overall in the competition. His first came after 39 seconds (vs Norwich in March 2016), while the first goal today came with 63 seconds on the clock. After a run of 10 Premier League games without a goal or assist, Gayle has had a hand in four goals in his last four appearances in the competition (two goals, two assists). Shelvey provided two assists in a Premier League game for the fourth time, and first since May 2015 for Swansea against Stoke. The managers Rafael Benitez: \"This result can give us a lot of confidence and belief. In the end, it's just what you need when you are in this type of situation. There are a lot of teams trying to avoid relegation but we have confidence that we can do it. There are still a lot of games to play but at least you know you can play in this way and you can get points. We have confidence we can do it.\" 3:19 Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino apologised to the fans and said they paid the price for a lack of focus after defeat to Newcastle. Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino apologised to the fans and said they paid the price for a lack of focus after defeat to Newcastle. Mauricio Pellegrino: \"I haven't seen my team compete in this way this season without the spirit you need to compete at this level. Sometimes you can play badly, sometimes you can make mistakes but you have to react. We have to say sorry to our fans because we didn't represent the values of the club. In this situation we have to react as quickly as we can.\" Man of the Match - Jonjo Shelvey Rafael Benitez passes on some instructions to Jonjo Shelvey Kenedy proved to be the matchwinner for Newcastle after scoring his first goals for the club but Shelvey was at the heart of all that was good in his side's 3-0 victory. Neat and tidy in possession, the 26-year-old ran the game from central midfield and picked out Kenedy for his opening strike before laying the ball on a plate for Ritchie to pick out the bottom corner. Replaced in the 83rd minute, Shelvey received an excellent ovation from the St James' Park crowd, who recognised his contribution to what could prove to be a vital three points in their bid to beat the drop. What's next? Nathan Redmond shows his disappointment at Newcastle Newcastle are not in action next week due to Tottenham's involvement in the FA Cup. With an international break also on the horizon, Benitez's side have a long wait for their next match on Saturday March 31 against Huddersfield at St James' Park. Meanwhile, Southampton are involved in the FA Cup and they travel to Wigan next Sunday (1.30pm) with an opportunity of reaching the semi-finals."}, {"date": "10/03/2018", "arena": "The Hawthorns",

Leicester Riyad Mahrez starred as Leicester condemned West Brom to their sixth successive Premier League loss with a 4-1 win at The Hawthorns on Saturday. Salomon Rondon had given the Baggies the lead inside eight minutes as nipped in front of Wes Morgan to steer the ball into the net. However, the hosts' lead lasted just 13 minutes as Jamie Vardy was superbly picked out by Mahrez from inside his own half before the England forward volleyed Leicester level from the 18-yard box. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (5), Nyom (5), Dawson (4), Hegazy (5), Gibbs (4), Krychowiak (6), Livermore (5), Brunt (5), Burke (6), Rondon (6), Phillips (4) Subs: Field (5), Rodriguez (5), Robson-Kanu (N/A) Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Simpson (6), Morgan (6), Maguire (6), Chilwell (7), Iborra (7), Ndidi (6), Mahrez (9), Gray (6), Okazaki (6), Vardy (8) Subs: Iheanacho (8), Albrighton (7), Diabate (N/A) Man of the match: Riyad Mahrez Substitute Kelechi Iheanacho was on the field for only three minutes before he picked out Mahrez (62), who lifted the ball over Ben Foster before the former Manchester City striker rounded off the victory with a pinpoint header. There was just enough time left for Vicente Iborra to rub salt into the wounds of the home fans as he rose above Craig Dawson to head in Leicester's fourth in added time and seal a convincing win. The loss leaves West Brom rooted to the foot of the table - eight points off 17th-placed Southampton with just eight matches left in the league - while the Foxes remain in eighth. After a tentative opening from Alan Pardew's side, Oliver Burke got behind Ben Chilwell on the right before delivering a brilliant ball into the box for Rondon to toe-poke past Kasper Schmeichel. Kelechi Iheanacho celebrates after scoring for Leicester against West Brom With their tails up, Grzegorz Krychowiak's rasping shot from the edge of the box took a deflection off Chilwell and Schmeichel was forced to pull off a brilliant save to tip the ball onto the crossbar. Just four minutes later and the visitors equalised. Mahrez sprayed a pass over the top from inside his own half to Vardy, who allowed the ball to drop over his shoulder before volleying low into the right corner. Team news West Brom defender Jonny Evans missed out through illness with Allan Nyon replacing him, while Oliver Burke came in as top-scorer Jay Rodriquez was dropped to the bench There were five changes for Leicester as Danny Simpson, Ben Chilwell, Vicente Iborra, Demarai Gray and Shinji Okazaki came in for Daniel Amartey, Christian Fuchs, Matty James, Adrien Silva and Mark Albirhgton. With half-time approaching, sloppy defending from the home side allowed Vardy through on goal but uncharacteristically the 31-year-old wanted too much time on the ball and Dawson got back to clear. With Mahrez's dominance on the match growing after the break, Iheanacho's pass was brilliantly brought down by the Algerian, before he coolly chipped the ball over Foster. West Brom were struggling to get a footing in the second-half and Krychowiak was forced to shoot from range but failed to test Schmeichel. Salomon Rondon celebrates after scoring for West Brom against Leicester Provider then turned goalscorer as Chilwell's pinpoint cross was met by Iheanacho, who made no mistake from six yards out. As the home fans flooded out of The Hawthorns, Leicester continued to attack and a tiring Dawson was unable to match the athletic leap of Iborra, who netted just his second goal for Leicester. Opta stats West Brom have dropped a league-high 21 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, while gaining just one point from behind in return. Riyad Mahrez has now been involved in 18 Premier League goals this season (10 goals, eight assists) - twice as many as last season (9 - six goals, three assists). Jamie Vardy (15 goal involvements) and Riyad Mahrez (18 goal involvements) are the only players to have been involved in at least 14 goals this season and play for clubs outside the 'big six'. Salomon Rondon's goal was his 22nd Premier League strike - since the start of 2015-16, he's scored 12 more goals for West Bromwich Albion than any other player. Jamie Vardy celebrates his goal with team-mates Riyad Mahrez and Vicente Iborra Man of the match - Riyad Mahrez Leicester's playmaker was at the heart of their attacking play, pulling the strings from deep in midfield as helped the Foxes control the match with pinpoint crosses and defence-splitting passes.

The New Zealand international's introduction in the second half inspired a comfortable win for Burnley against a backdrop of crowd demonstrations against West Ham owners David Sullivan and David Gold. Burnley had not had a shot on target until the 66th minute when Barnes smashed in the visitors' opener before Wood tapped in a second (70) and capitalised on Joe Hart's error for their third (81). The result puts Burnley three points clear in seventh and places further pressure on sixth-placed Arsenal. West Ham, meanwhile, drop down to 16th after their third successive defeat. Player ratings West Ham: Hart (6), Zabaleta (6), Collins (6), Ogbonna (6), Cresswell (5), Kouyate (6), Noble (6), Mario (6), Lanzini (5), Antonio (6), Arnautovic (5) Subs: Hernandez (N/A) Burnley: Pope (8), Lowton (7) , Mee (6), Tarkowski (6), Ward (6), Cork (6), Hendrick (5), Westwood (6), Lennon (6), Gudmundsson (7), Barnes (7) Subs: Wood (9), Vokes (N/A) Man of the match: Chris Wood West Ham were in full control during the opening 45 minutes as Burnley failed to test Joe Hart's goal. The host's first goalscoring opportunity came to Marko Arnautovic in the 12th minute - breaking free into the box - but his low drive from a tight angle was stopped by the feet of goalkeeper Nick Pope. Joao Mario fired his volley towards an open goal over the bar moments later, and in the 23rd minute, West Ham had a controversial penalty appeal turned down. Aaron Cresswell's cross hit Aaron Lennon's arm at a very close proximity, but referee Lee Mason elected to only award a West Ham corner. As David Moyes' men continued to push numbers forward, West Ham's next big chance arrived in the 38th minute. Angelo Ogbonna's looping header caught the Burnley backline off-guard before the ball landed to Manuel Lanzini in a one-on-one position, but his low shot was blocked by Pope's left boot. Team news Joe Hart started in goal. James Collins and Angelo Ogbonna replaced Declan Rice and Winston Reid. Joao Mario and Michail Antonio started while Javier Hernandez and Patrice Evra dropped to the bench. Sean Dyche kept the same lineup that beat Everton 2-1 in their last outing. The second half sparked into life when Sean Dyche elected to bring on Wood on the hour-mark. In the 66th minute, the 26-year-old held the ball on the right flank before he teed up the onrushing Barnes, who smashed his effort first-time into the top corner. After a group of protesters made their way onto the pitch and beneath the director's box, Burnley scored almost instantly after the restart. Barnes fed the ball to Lennon, who squared he ball across the goal-mouth for Wood to get his first of the game. West Ham supporters invaded the pitch at the London Stadium Ten minutes before time, Burnley condemned West Ham to a terrible afternoon when Hart spilled Johann Gudmundsson's powerful drive which allowed Wood to capitalise on the opportunity to get his second of the afternoon. And as the game drew to a close, Trevor Brooking cut a lonely figure in the director's box as Gold and Sullivan left early. West Ham director of football development Trevor Brooking remained in the box Opta stats West Ham United have lost three league games in a row by a margin of 3+ goals for the first time since March 2008. Burnley have now recorded their highest points tally in a single Premier League season (43), with eight games still to spare. Ashley Barnes has scored in three successive appearances for Burnley - the last time he scored in three successive games was back in May 2011 for Brighton (four games). Chris Wood is the first player to be involved in three Premier League goals (two goals, one assist) as a substitute in a match since Steven Naismith scored a hat-trick for Everton against Chelsea in September 2015. Man of the Match - Chris Wood Wood came off the bench to score twice West Ham dominated the opening 45 minutes, but as soon as Wood came on midway through the second half, the game was turned on its head. Wood quickly forged an effective partnership with Barnes up front and assisted his team-mate's goal before getting two himself, and he did it all in just 30 minutes. The managers 0:46 David Moyes has appealed to West Ham fans to get behind the team as they battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League. David Moyes has appealed to West Ham fans to get behind the team as they battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League. David Moyes: \"We missed two or three great chances in the first half. I thought we played well. In truth, two minutes of madness changed the whole game when it never really looked like we were under a great deal of threat. We played well so it's just disappointing the way it went. \"We have to deal with our own stuff but the stoppages didn't help the concentration. It's down to us. The game changed, we missed the opportunities in the first half and we didn't start the second half quite as well. It never looked like the way it was going that's for sure.\" 2:33 Burnley boss Sean Dyche says his side were not at the races in the first half but put in a very thorough performance in the second half to beat West Ham. Burnley boss Sean Dyche says his side were not at the races in the first half but put in a very thorough performance in the second half to beat West Ham. Sean Dyche: \"The first half they were the better side. We weren't at the races. What kept us really in it was the diligence to the simple stuff, to the basics. We kept our shape and all the little details in the game to just about hang in there. \"They had a couple of good chances. Pope makes a save. We had one over the top and it was a reminder to us that you can't give anyone a moment in this division. In the second half it was a very good display. \"We stayed calm with some interesting things going on today and delivered a good second half.\" What's next?

deflected Willian strike and a calamitous Martin Kelly own-goal gave the Blues only a second league victory in six. They could have been out of sight by the break had Olivier Giroud added to their two first-half goals (25, 32), but he was denied by a goal-line clearance by James Tomkins and later struck a post after the interval. Palace improved immeasurably thanks to the half-time return of Wilfried Zaha from a long-term injury and saw Alexander Sorloth hammer a shot against the woodwork, before his seemingly legitimate late goal was chalked off for a foul in the build-up that looked extremely soft. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (6), Christensen (6), Cahill (6), Azpilicueta (7), Zappacosta (7), Kante (7), Fabregas (7), Alonso (7), Willian (8), Giroud (6), Hazard (7). Subs: Morata (6), Pedro (n/a), Bakayoko (n/a).

Subs: Zaha (7), Reidewald (6), Lee Chung-yong (n/a). Man of the match: Willian. The Eagles did pull one back in the final minute when Patrick van Aanholt slotted beyond Thibaut Courtois from close range, but Chelsea hung on to move back within two points of fourth-placed Tottenham. The hosts had lost four of their previous five league games but immediately effused the kind of confidence of their title-winning side of last season. They were lacking a final ball to really test Wayne Hennessey, before a stroke of luck put them ahead as Willian cut inside and saw his drilled shot strike Kelly and go in off the post. It was two seven minutes later when a flowing move ended with Willian feeding Zappacosta, and despite Kelly's valiant efforts, he could only clear the ball against Hennessey, and in turn himself, before it trickled over the line. Team news Antonio Conte opted for a strong side despite Chelsea's upcoming Champions League interests, but notably returned Olivier Giroud to the side in place of Pedro. Crystal Palace were unchanged from Monday night's late collapse against Manchester United, but were buoyed by the return of Mamadou Sakho and Wilfried Zaha to the bench. The onslaught continued as the superb Tomkins denied Giroud what appeared a certain goal with a sliding block on the line, but Palace looked a different side once Zaha was brought on at the break. They struck the woodwork within two minutes when Chelsea gifted Sorloth the ball and the Norweigan beat Courtois, but not the post, from an inviting angle, before Giroud hit the frame of the goal with an even easier opportunity from eight yards. Palace thought they had given themselves a lifeline when Sorloth fired home from a free-kick, but referee Anthony Taylor harshly punished a high foot in the Chelsea box from Jairo Riedewald on Gary Cahill when contact looked to be minimal at best. They did get a goal back in the final minute of normal time as Van Aanholt swept home from close range, but could not find an equaliser to take them level on points with 17th-placed Southampton. Man of the match - Willian Chelsea's in-form forward was at it again, registering more shots on target (4) than any other player on the pitch and getting a goal to show for it too, albeit deflected. He really came into his own after half-time, putting what should have been a third on a plate for Giroud and keeping the Palace defence chasing shadows at times. The Brazilian has now scored five times in his last five games for Chelsea, having found the net only once in nine previous matches. What's next? Chelsea will jump on the plane to Spain for the second leg of their finely balanced Champions League last-16 tie with Barcelona, before travelling to Leicester City next Sunday.

Team news Roy Hodgson made two changes from their defeat at Tottenham as Martin Kelly and Jeffrey Schlupp were given the nod while United made just one switch from their win over Chelsea as Jesse Lingard replaced Anthony Martial, who was not in the squad. United needed a quick response and they got it through Smalling courtesy of some woeful defending from James Tomkins. The Palace defender sat deep in his own box following the clearance of a corner and this allowed Smalling to stand onside on the penalty spot and nod home from a Antonio Valencia cross. United set up camp in Palace's half for the remaining 25 minutes as Matic had a shot cleared off the line by Benteke before Lukaku drew his team level. Sanchez's shot from the edge of the box deflected up and rattled the bar but the Belgian striker was quick to react and fired home from 10 yards out. De Gea clawed out a Benteke header three minutes later and that proved a pivotal moment as United stole the points in injury time in spectacular fashion. The ball dropped to Matic about 30 yards out and the midfielder unleashed a sensational dipping half-volley that swerved into the top corner. Opta stats Manchester United came from 2-0 down to win a Premier League game for the first time since December 2013 (away to Hull). Manchester United are unbeaten in all 18 Premier League meetings between the sides, the most a side has faced another without defeat in the competition. Matic's strike was Man Utd's first 90th minute winner in the Premier League since Marcus Rashford's against Hull in August 2016. Crystal Palace have now lost all nine Premier League games not to feature Wilfried Zaha this season, by an aggregate score of 3-21. 5:25 Palace boss Roy Hodgson says he is extremely disappointed after his side surrendered a two-goal lead Palace boss Roy Hodgson says he is extremely disappointed after his side surrendered a two-goal lead Man of the match: Nemanja Matic Fresh from a barnstorming performance against his former club Chelsea, where his work without the ball was exceptional, he conjured up a moment of magic here to win the game for his team. It was his first goal for the club - and one he will not forget. The £40million signing is the only United outfield player to start all 29 Premier League games this season, which emphasises his importance to Mourinho's team structure. What's next? United are back in front of the Sky Sports cameras on Saturday as they welcome Liverpool to Old Trafford for the first part of Rivalry Weekend.

The future of the Arsenal manager has been under scrutiny after 3-0 defeats to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final last Sunday and in the Premier League on Thursday night, and first-half goals from Lewis Dunk (7) and Glenn Murray (26) prompted more discontent among the away supporters at the Amex Stadium. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's 42nd-minute goal gave Wenger some hope after a woeful first-half performance, but his players were unable to find an equaliser and avoid a fourth straight away defeat in the Premier League. The loss leaves Arsenal in sixth place and 13 points behind Tottenham in fourth, while Brighton climb into the top half of the table. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (7), Bong (6), Dunk (8), Duffy (8), Schelotto (7), Knockaert (7), Stephens (8), Propper (6), Izquierdo (8), Gross (8), Murray (8) Subs: Bruno (6), March (6), Kayal (n/a) Arsenal: Cech (5), Chambers (5), Koscielny (4), Mustafi (5), Kolasinac (5), Ozil (6), Wilshere (6), Xhaka (6), Iwobi (5), Mkhitaryan (5), Aubameyang (7) Subs: Welbeck (6), Bellerin (n/a), Nketiah (n/a) Man of the match: Glenn Murray (Brighton) Arsenal were ragged and sloppy throughout the first half and fell behind in the seventh minute when Pascal Gross' corner was headed back across the six-yard box by Shane Duffy and - with Petr Cech out of position - Dunk responded quickest to stab home. Lewis Dunk celebrates scoring Brighton's first goal against Arsenal A deserved Brighton second duly arrived on 26 minutes when Laurent Koscielny conceded possession and the ball was worked to Gross on the right. His cross was met by Murray in the six-yard box and the ball squeezed beneath the body of Cech to prompt some 'Wenger out' chants in the away end. But somehow Arsenal halved the deficit with a scruffy goal two minutes before the break. After Duffy had failed to clear, Alex Iwobi pulled the ball back to Granit Xhaka and his pass was smartly deflected beyond Mathew Ryan by the outside of Aubameyang's right foot. Team news Arsene Wenger made three changes from Thursday's defeat to Man City with Aaron Ramsey rested and Hector Bellerin and Danny Welbeck benched. Jack Wilshere, Calum Chambers and Alex Iwobi all started. Brighton were unchanged. Incredibly, Arsenal were almost level on the stroke of half-time when Duffy thudded a header onto his own post and they also had the first major chance of the second period when Mesut Ozil's drive forced a save from Ryan. Sead Kolasinac, who was booked in the first half, avoided further punishment for a match-ending barge on Ezequiel Schelotto and, moments later, Jose Izquierdo shot just wide after driving at the Arsenal defence. The offside flag denied Brighton a third when Murray finished off a slick move late on, but his first-half header ultimately earned them a third straight home victory, while another insipid Arsenal display will prompt even more discussion over Wenger's position. Match stats Arsenal have lost four games in a row in all competitions for the first time since October 2002. This was Arsenal's first defeat in 35 Premier League games against newly-promoted sides. Arsenal haven't kept a clean sheet in their last 11 Premier League games; their joint-longest such run in the competition. Murray has scored six Premier League goals in 2018 - only Sergio Aguero (9) and Mo Salah (7) have scored more. Arsenal have just 13 points from their 15 away Premier League games this season - their worst such return in the top-flight since 1989/90 (12). Chris Hughton is only the third manager to beat Wenger in the Premier League with three different clubs (after Mark Hughes and Sam Allardyce). Man of the Match - Glenn Murray Glenn Murray's header squeezed under Petr Cech to hand Brighton a 2-0 lead against Arsenal Six goals in six games… not bad for a 34-year-old! The Brighton striker's first-half strike was his 11th of the season in the Premier League, which is more than any Arsenal player has managed in this campaign. He was quick to praise his supply line at full-time, but Murray led the line superbly and, perhaps surprisingly, made more sprints than any other player on the pitch. Maybe those work-weary legs explain why he opted to hold the ball up rather than run at goal when played clean through in the closing stages. The Managers 3:07 Chris Hughton praised his Brighton players performance as they beat Arsenal 2-1 to record their first win against a top-six side in the Premier League. Chris Hughton praised his Brighton players performance as they beat Arsenal 2-1 to record their first win against a top-six side in the Premier League. Chris Hughton (Brighton): \"For us it is massive. It is our first win against one of the top six. We found it difficult. We spoke before about how we had done really well against Manchester United, but that against everyone else we found it really difficult.\" Arsene Wenger (Arsenal): \"It's not easy, but I have enough experience and enough desire to turn things around and I must say that, at the moment, when you need to stay in the game we are making a few mistakes at the wrong moments. We have to stick together and focus. We have no other solution.\" 3:00 Arsene Wenger conceded that Arsenal were now out of the running for a Champions League place after they were defeated 2-1 by Brighton at the Amex stadium. Arsene Wenger conceded that Arsenal were now out of the running for a Champions League place after they were defeated 2-1 by Brighton at the Amex stadium. The Pundit - Graeme Souness \"That was a typical Arsenal performance. They had 68 per cent of the ball today, so between box to box they dominated the ball, they are on the front foot all the time. \"But in the two important areas, the box you defend in and the box you have to be brave and attack things, they came up short. That is Arsenal, pretty, pretty, pretty, but not very effective.\" 0:23 Arsenal's latest loss to Brighton on Sunday was typical of the club in recent times, according to Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness.

"report": "2:54 HIghlights: Man City 1-0 Chelsea HIghlights: Man City 1-0 Chelsea Champions-elect Manchester City continued their title procession with a 1-0 victory over Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium. Bernardo Silva opened the scoring for the second game running, bundling the winner home 34 seconds into the second half as City moved 18 points clear at the top of the Premier League. Antonio Conte's decision to not start a recognised striker backfired as Chelsea, missing midfield lynchpin N'Golo Kante, failed to register a single effort on target en-route to a fourth defeat in five. The 25th victory of City's stellar season leaves Pep Guardiola needing just four more victories to dethrone Chelsea and claim a maiden title in English football. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Laporte (7), Otamendi (7), Zinchenko (6), Gundogan (6), De Bruyne (7), D Silva (7), B Silva (7), Sane (7), Aguero (7).

Subs: Giroud (5), Emerson (5), Morata (n/a). Man of the Match: David Silva. The champions will have no doubt travelled to the home of their successors hoping to replicate last week's dominant first-half display at Old Trafford, but, as has been the case this season, City showed why they are 16 points clear of United with a dominant display of their own. Chelsea were unable to break up City's precise passing game in the opening exchanges and errors soon followed as Cesc Fabregas was caught in possession in his own area by Leroy Sane. The ball ran for Sergio Aguero but a block from Antonio Rudiger denied the Argentine his 200th City goal. Danny Drinkwater chases down Sergio Aguero at the Etihad Stadium After Bernardo Silva curled a shot onto the roof of the Chelsea goal, Oleksandr Zinchenko was fortunate only to see yellow for a lunge on Victor Moses that allowed Willian to race clear, but his driven cross was blocked. Normal service soon resumed and City so nearly took the lead on 27 minutes as Kevin de Bruyne's free-kick found Sane at the back post, and his shot was cleared off the line by Cesar Azpilicueta. Team news City made two changes from Thursday’s win over Arsenal as Oleksandr Zinchenko and Aymeric Laporte replaced Danilo and Vincent Kompany. Chelsea followed suit as Cesc Fabregas and Pedro got the nod ahead of N’Golo Kante and Alvaro Morata. City had the ball in the Chelsea net three minutes before as Nicolas Otamendi applied the finishing touch to a clever quick free-kick, but Aguero was ruled offside in the build-up and it was chalked off. City's dominance continued after the break and it took less than a minute for the pressure to tell as Bernardo Silva ghosted in behind Marcos Alonso to turn David Silva's cross beyond Thibaut Courtois. Bernardo Silva (C) scores the opening goal for Manchester City against Chelsea A deluge midway through the second half prevented the hosts from adding further gloss to the victory, but the conditions, and a toothless Chelsea attack, did little to dampen the mood as City edged ever closer to the title. Opta stats Man City will end the day 18 points clear at the top of the Premier League, the biggest lead ahead of second place since March 2006, when Chelsea were 18 points ahead of Manchester United. David Silva has assisted 12 goals for City in all competitions this season, his most in a campaign since 2011/12, when he assisted 19 goals. Chelsea have lost four consecutive away matches in all competitions for the first time since January 2003, when they lost to Man Utd (twice), Leeds and Arsenal. Pep Guardiola is only the second manager to complete a league double over Antonio Conte, after Delio Rossi (for Sampdoria in 2012/13). Only Sergio Aguero (15) has scored more goals for Manchester City in 2018 in all competitions than Bernardo Silva (5). Chelsea failed to register a single shot in the first half, the first time they'd not had a shot in the first half of a Premier League game since 2003/04 (when Opta began recording the data). The managers Pep Guardiola: \"It was so important, a win today is another step closer. We need four victories to be champions, it is in our hands and if our behaviour is like today we will be champions. Against a strong team like Chelsea, who are still the champions, and beat them in the way we did today, that is why it is so good.\" 3:07 Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola hailed his side's performance as 'perfect' as they took another step towards the title after beating Chelsea 1-0 in the Premier League. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola hailed his side's performance as 'perfect' as they took another step towards the title after beating Chelsea 1-0 in the Premier League. Antonio Conte: \"The players followed my instructions. We prepared the game this way, not to concede space in between the lines. But to concede a goal 30 seconds after half-time was a pity because it was difficult for us to come back.\" 4:05 Chelsea boss Antonio Conte defended his defensive tactics believing them to be necessary to restrict space for Manchester City, but concedes they were not good enough in attack. Chelsea boss Antonio Conte defended his defensive tactics believing them to be necessary to restrict space for Manchester City, but concedes they were not good enough in attack. Man of the Match - David Silva It proved to be another trademark performance from the Spaniard. With Conte choosing not start either Alvaro Morata or Olivier Giroud, City were tasked with breaking down Chelsea and yet again Silva was key in doing so.

Second-half goals from Ashley Barnes (56) and substitute Chris Wood (80) brought the alarming run to an end in Sean Dyche's 250th game in charge, as the Clarets reached the coveted 40-point mark, five adrift of sixth-placed Arsenal. Cenk Tosun had headed Everton in front with his first goal for the club on 20 minutes, but Sam Allardyce's men were made to pay for a poor defensive performance, compounded by Ashley Williams' late red card, as they slipped to a fifth consecutive away defeat. Player ratings Burnley: Pope (7), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (7), Mee (6), Ward (6), Cork (6), Gudmundsson (6), Westwood (6), Lennon (7), Hendrick (6), Barnes (8). Subs: Wood (7). Everton: Pickford (7), Keane (5), Williams (3), Martina (5), Coleman (6), Gueye (5), Sigurdsson (6), Davies (5), Calvert-Lewin (5), Walcott (5), Tosun (6). Subs: Bolasie (5), Rooney (5), Niasse (5). Man of the Match: Ashley Barnes. Allardyce stressed the importance of scoring first and Everton nearly delivered on 15 minutes, despite Burnley's encouraging start. Gylfi Sigurdsson squared for Theo Walcott at the end of a slaloming run, but the forward, distracted by team-mate Tom Davies, fired over. But Allardyce's wish was soon fulfilled as Walcott's cross from the right was flicked into the path of Tosun by Seamus Coleman, and the January signing powered a header beyond Nick Pope. Everton's Cenk Tosun celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game during the Premier League match at Turf Moor Everton, buoyed by going in front, tried to double their lead but Pope denied Tosun a quick-fire double and Walcott from converting the Turk's cross on 28 minutes. Burnley rallied, though, and thought they had drawn themselves level when a whipped Matt Lowton cross found Barnes on the half-hour, but a stunning point-blank save from Jordan Pickford preserved the Toffees' lead until the interval. Team news James Tarkowski ended a four-game absence to replace Kevin Long in Burnley’s only change. Sam Allardyce recalled Seamus Coleman, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Cenk Tosun for the trip to Turf Moor. Aaron Lennon and Michael Keane lined up against their former clubs. The Clarets, bolstered by the addition of Chris Wood, continued to lay siege to the Everton goal after the break. Another fine Pickford save prevented Aaron Lennon from scoring against his old club on 50 minutes, moments before the England goalkeeper tipped a Ben Mee header onto the bar. But the pressure finally told as Lowton's long ball released Barnes in behind the doing Everton defence, and the striker finally broke Pickford's resolve with a fierce, near-post drive. Oumar Niasse blazed an acrobatic volley over eight minutes after coming off the bench before Sigurdsson fired a great chance wide two minutes later. But Burnley had the final word as Wood rose high to head Johann Berg Gudmundsson's corner home with 10 minutes remaining, Everton's hopes of a comeback extinguished when William saw red for striking Barnes. Opta stats Burnley have equalled their best Premier League points tally in a single season (40 - level with 2016-17), with nine games remaining in 2017-18. Everton have now lost 19 competitive games in 2017-18; their most in a single season since 2005-06 (21). This is the first time that Burnley have won a Premier League game after going behind under Sean Dyche (61 games - W1 D12 L48). Cenk Tosun is the 10th Turkish player to score in the Premier League and the first to do so since Jem Karacan on 4th May 2013 (for Reading v Fulham), 1764 days ago. The managers Sean Dyche: \"Now we're on 40 points, it took us the whole of last season to get that and now we've got nine to go. I think it's a real marker of how far we've come in a relatively short space of time. 2:47 Burnley boss Sean Dyche praised his players' mental toughness as they came from a goal down to win 2-1 against Everton at Turf Moor Burnley boss Sean Dyche praised his players' mental toughness as they came from a goal down to win 2-1 against Everton at Turf Moor \"We're constantly looking for ways to move the club and the team forward season-on-season and there are good signs of that. We want to go again of course and go beyond 40 but it is a fine mark for a club like us at this stage of the season.\" Sam Allardyce: \"We missed too many chances, I think that's the bottom line. After that, I think two very simple goals were gifted to Burnley. 5:18 Sam Allardyce felt Everton handed Burnley a win by not converting key chances during their 2-1 defeat at Turf Moor Sam Allardyce felt Everton handed Burnley a win by not converting key chances during their 2-1 defeat at Turf Moor \"I think it was such a big game today for us to win to go level with Burnley. With the fantastic season they've had, for us to get level with them today had we won with such a bad season that we've had, it wouldn't have looked quite so bad but we only have ourselves to blame for today's defeat.\" The pundit Jamie Redknapp: \"They are going to find some points and they will stay up, but looking forward to next season, Evertonians want a little bit of optimism but at the moment, there's not a lot to be excited about. When I look at them, I don't see a team. \"I played against Everton for many years with really good players. They had a philosophy of how they wanted to play, they were aggressive, got the ball into wide areas but I look at them now and go 'what are they?' There's no real talent that's going to get me on the edge of my seat when I watch Everton.\" Man of the Match - Ashley Barnes Man of the Match, @BurnleyOfficial’s Ashley Barnes 1 goal 5 attempts 4 on target 3 chances created#PL pic.twitter.com/RjXr1KmKB0 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) March 3, 2018 It looked as though Barnes would have to settle for an afternoon of frustration as his exploits in the first half were met by the brilliance of Jordan Pickford in the Everton goal. But the Burnley striker plugged away and got his just rewards, inspiring a comeback with his well-taken equaliser, which saw him score in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2014.

from Leicester's 1-1 draw with Bournemouth Riyad Mahrez's stunning stoppage-time free kick gave Leicester City a 1-1 draw with Bournemouth at the King Power on Saturday afternoon. Bournemouth went ahead on 35 minutes courtesy of Josh King's penalty after the Norway international had been fouled in the box. However, with the game entering the seventh minute of injury time, Mahrez stepped up to curl a 30-yard free kick past Asmir Begovic as the home side extended their winless run to five Premier League matches. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Amartey (6), Morgan (6), Maguire (7), Fuchs (6), Albrighton (7), James (6), Ndidi (7), Silva (5), Mahrez (8), Vardy (6) Subs: Chilwell (7), Iheanacho (6), Diabate (7) Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Francis (9), Steve Cook (7), Ake (8), Adam Smith (6), Daniels (7), Gosling (7), Lewis Cook (7), Stanislas (7), King (7), Wilson (6) Subs: Surman (6), Mousset (6) Man of the match: Simon Francis As a result, both teams stay in midtable security, with the eighth-placed Foxes still four points ahead of their opponents in 11th. Bournemouth had the better of the first half and after Junior Stanislas had wasted a glorious opportunity to give his side the lead, with the winger side-footing wide of a gaping goal, the visitors did make a deserved breakthrough 10 minutes before the break. Riyad Mahrez (right) celebrates his last-gasp equaliser against Bournemouth Callum Wilson strode forward into the box, before the ball broke kindly to Charlie Daniels, who then centred for King. However, despite there appearing to be little danger, Marc Albrighton - having been switched to right wing back in place of the injured Daniel Amartey - upended the striker. Referee Lee Probert had no hesitation in pointing to the spot, with King keeping his cool to send Kasper Schmeichel the wrong way, nonchalantly rolling the ball in the bottom right-hand corner of the net. Team news Leicester forward Shinji Okazaki missed out again with a knee problem, while Bournemouth winger Ryan Fraser dropped to the bench. However, Leicester - who themselves had spurned a golden chance to take the lead when Mahrez shot straight at Begovic when one-on-one with the Cherries goalkeeper just before the quarter-hour mark - improved drastically after the interval. Ben Chilwell's goalbound effort was deflected over the bar on the hour-mark, before Harry Maguire saw two well-struck drives blocked near the goal line, the second by team-mate Kelechi Iheanacho, who inadvertently deflected the defender's shot inches wide of the near post. Joshua King (left) is congratulated by Nathan Ake and Callum Wilson after opening the scoring at the King Power The hosts must have thought their last chance of salvaging a point had gone when Dan Gosling somehow managed to get his body in the way of Mahrez's close-range effort with just two minutes to go. But that was reckoning without the Algeria international, who managed to bend his last-gasp free kick around Bournemouth's wall and out of reach of a diving Begovic for his ninth Premier League goal of the season. Opta stats The Foxes remain winless against Bournemouth in the Premier League (P6 W0 D5 L1) - the only other team they've played as often without winning in the competition is Bolton Wanderers (six games, no wins). Mahrez's goal was his 36th for Leicester in the Premier League, however his first from a direct free-kick - he had taken 27 direct free-kicks without scoring in the competition before today Bournemouth have scored in 10 consecutive games for the first time in the Premier League, netting in every game they've played since Boxing Day 2017 Since their debut Premier League season in 2015/16, only their opponent's Leicester (12) have won more penalties away from home than Bournemouth (nine) The Cherries have converted both of their penalties in the Premier League this season (v Stoke and Leicester City); this after missing three in a row prior to the 2017/18 campaign Despite having 14 shots (inc. blocks) in the second half, Mahrez's late equaliser was Leicester's only shot on target following the break There have been just seven goals in the six Premier League games between Leicester and Bournemouth, with neither side scoring more than once in a game Daniel Amartey (left) and Junior Stanislas battle for possession at the King Power Stadium Managers Puel: \"I cannot say I was optimistic, like my players I believed until the end and the last opportunity. I know it was the last opportunity for us. \"And I know he is a good player under pressure and he scored it. And like Jamie Vardy, we have some great players in our squad and in this condition in the last seconds of the game, it is a pleasure and amazing this goal.\" 3:44 Leicester boss Claude Puel was pleased with his side's belief after a late equaliser against Bournemouth and praised the attitude of goalscorer Riyad Mahrez Leicester boss Claude Puel was pleased with his side's belief after a late equaliser against Bournemouth and praised the attitude of goalscorer Riyad Mahrez Howe: \"It has been a tough afternoon for us as we did a lot of things right today. I thought we defended very well in the second half, it was always going to be difficult as it is fine margins when you are only 1-0 up away from home. \"You are always going to come under pressure, which we did, we defended set plays and everything so well. We put our bodies on the line and felt like we deserved win, but it was not meant to be. \"I have not seen the goal again, but it was a quality finish from their perspective. But there are things that we can look at, analyse and try and do better for next time. \"But at that stage of the game it is all about trying to see it out and get over the line. They were causing us a problem from set plays, we had dealt with them pretty well all afternoon, but that was a moment of magic from their perspective.\" 1:30 Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe thought his side deserved a win after conceding a late equaliser at Leicester but believes they did a lot of things right on the day. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe thought his side deserved a win after conceding a late equaliser at Leicester but believes they did a lot of things right on the day. The pundit - Phil Thompson \"Leicester should have been better in the first half, but there was only one goal in it. They then pushed and pushed, throwing men forward, but I must admit I was disappointed in Leicester's attitude and passing. They just kept on giving the ball away all the time, it was dreadful, they were lethargic and just never got going. Bournemouth, though, were far the better team in the first half and thoroughly deserved their goal.\" 3:24 Phil Thompson says he was disappointed with Leicester's performance against Bournemouth with the away side 'by far the better team' in the first half following a 1-1 draw between the two sides Phil Thompson says he was disappointed with Leicester's performance against Bournemouth with the away side 'by far the better team' in the first half following a 1-1 draw between the two sides Man of the match - Simon Francis Bournemouth's captain was a rock at the heart of the visitors' back line all afternoon long, getting his head on virtually every ball into the box, as well as making a succession of vital clearances. So no one will have felt more aggrieved when Mahrez levelled matters late on for Leicester to deny the Cherries what would have been a huge win in their efforts to stay in the top flight. 10 - Bournemouth have scored in 10 consecutive games for the first time in the Premier League; netting in every game they've played since Boxing Day 2017.

"2:35 Southampton 0-0 Stoke Southampton 0-0 Stoke Southampton and Stoke played out a tense but turgid 0-0 draw at St Mary's that leaves both sides still precariously placed near the bottom of the Premier League. Badou Ndiaye came close to breaking the deadlock in the first half but the midfielder's header was tipped around the post by Alex McCarthy. Southampton were the better side in the second period and Jack Butland was forced into making saves from Joshua Sims and Cedric Soares before substitute Sofiane Boufal headed wide from close range. The result leaves Stoke in the drop zone in 19th place, with the Saints only a point outside of the relegation places. Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (6), Cedric (6), Stephens (7), Hoedt (6), Bertrand (7), Lemina (7), Romeu (6), Redmond (7), Sims (6), Tadic (6), Carrillo (6).

Subs: Pieters (6), Jese (6), Crouch (6) Man of the match: Kurt Zouma Mame Diouf leaves the pitch clutching his wrist after colliding with Wesley Hoedt For Stoke manager Paul Lambert, it is the second straight game his side have shown their battling qualities away from home to take a point having drawn at Leicester, and their defensive improvement under the Scot was on display once more. Kurt Zouma and Bruno Martins Indi impressed in containing the Southampton forward line, but the only incident of note in the first 45 minutes came when Mame Diouf was forced off the pitch after a collision with Wesley Hoedt. Diouf had appeared to intentionally stamp on the Dutch defender's foot, an incident that was not picked up by referee Anthony Taylor, and Hoedt got his retribution moments later as the Senegalese forward was forced off with a shoulder injury as both went up for an aerial challenge. Team news Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino made one change to the side that drew 1-1 at Burnley in the as Joshua Sims started in place of James Ward-Prowse. Stoke named an unchanged side to the one that drew at Leicester. Maxim Choupo-Moting is denied by a last-ditch Jack Stephens tackle Stoke came closest to breaking the deadlock before the interval as Ndiaye rose to meet Xherdan Shaqiri's cross but McCarthy did well to get down to his left to tip the header around the post. Southampton improved in the second period as Sims forced Butland into an immediate save with his feet before a fine last-ditch tackle from Jack Stephens on Maxim Choupo-Moting denied Stoke on the counter-attack. But it was largely one-way traffic towards the visitors' goal as Cedric's rising half-volley forced Butland into an acrobatic save before Boufal somehow headed wide from Nathan Redmond's cross with the goal at his mercy. But the lack of quality in the final third, so often the issue for both sides all season, meant neither deserved to win as they both were forced to settle for a point. Opta stats Southampton have picked up just one win in their last 16 Premier League games (D9 L6), and are winless in their last eight at St Mary's. Stoke registered an away clean sheet in the Premier League for the first time in their last 10 games in the competition, since a 1-0 win against Watford in October. Saints have failed to score in three consecutive home Premier League meetings with Stoke, their joint-longest run without scoring against a single opponent on home soil in the competition (also v Wimbledon in 1998 and Bolton in 2003). The Potters have failed to find the back of the net in five of their last nine league games, netting just five goals in total in those games. Southampton mustered 18 shots in this game, the most they've attempted without scoring in a Premier League game since the opening day of the season against Swansea (29). Under Paul Lambert, Stoke have lost just one of their six Premier League games (W1 D4), after losing six of the eight before that (W1 D1) The managers Mauricio Pellegrino: \"We deserved to get something more. I thought we dominated the game in the second half. But it's about efficiency. We couldn't convert the possession into goals. \"Obviously, when you make a change you want to make an impact in the game, and we played with more tempo in the second half. We have to learn to do this from the beginning.\" 2:28 Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino says his side dominated the game and deserved to win after a draw at home to Stoke. Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino says his side dominated the game and deserved to win after a draw at home to Stoke. Paul Lambert: \"I think any point you get in this division is really good. It's a tough game, and we lost Mame (Diouf) at a tough time as I thought he was a threat, and we looked really good going forward on the counter-attack in the first half. \"We defended strongly and we may have lost this game a month or so ago. It's another positive point, and I'm delighted with the team not getting beat. I love it, I love the pressure of it. It's big-time football, and I can't praise the lads enough for their efforts.\" 2:09 Stoke boss Paul Lambert believes it is a good point for his side after a draw at Southampton and says he is loving the pressure situation down at the bottom of the Premier League. Stoke boss Paul Lambert believes it is a good point for his side after a draw at Southampton and says he is loving the pressure situation down at the bottom of the Premier League. Man of the match - Kurt Zouma In a game of few chances, the Stoke defence continued their resurgence with Zouma showing further signs of maturity during his loan spell from Chelsea. His positional play was outstanding here, and the clean sheet owed much to his discipline and athleticism during Southampton's second-half onslaught. Southampton whipped countless balls into the box through Ryan Bertrand and Redmond, but the French defender made several vital clearances and limited the number of shots on Butland's goal. Kurt Zouma impressed with another imperious display at the back for Stoke The pundit - Paul Merson \"Southampton were the better side, definitely second half. Stoke were dangerous on the counter-attack but it was just their final pass which wasn't good enough. \"I wouldn't say Southampton lay siege on the Stoke goal but I thought Butland was very today, and fair play to him as he made a mistake last week. \"Southampton will be kicking themselves now as they have all these away games now and are also in the FA Cup. They go to Wigan and other teams will be playing on that day. \"They'll be playing catch up. The best chance fell to Boufal and if it was Carrillo or Gabbiadini they would've scored. I don't know where the goals are going to come. They just huff and puff.\" What's next?

Andre Ayew - on his first start for Swansea since returning to the Liberty in January - laid the ball off for Sung-Yueng Ki to open the scoring eight minutes in, before Ki then supplied the cross for Mike van der Hoorn to make it 2-0 in the 32nd minute. With no recognised central defenders on the pitch after Winston Reid had to be withdrawn through injury in the first half, West Ham continued to look vulnerable, and Swansea took full advantage. The hosts scored two more in the second half through Andy King three minutes after the break - on his first start for Swansea - and Jordan Ayew from the penalty spot in the 63rd minute, while Michail Antonio came off the bench to net a consolation 11 minutes from time for the visitors. The comfortable win sees Swansea continue their resurgence under Carlos Carvalhal, as a seventh successive home win in all competitions moves them out of the bottom three and up as high as 13th, climbing above West Ham on goal difference, who had the most miserable of afternoons in south Wales. Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (7), Mawson (8), Naughton (6), Fernandez (7), Van der Hoorn (7), Olsson (7), Clucas (7), King, Sung-yueng (8), Jordan Ayew (7), Andre Ayew (8).

Subs: Byram (5), Antonio (6). Man of the match: Sung-Yueng Ki A makeshift West Ham backline had no time to settle as Swansea raced into an early lead. Adrian, in the away goal, will feel he might have done better, as he got down very slowly as Ki's strike dribbled into the bottom corner from 20 yards. Swansea almost made it two moments later, but Federico Fernandez's prodded effort was blocked on the line by Declan Rice. Team news For the first time, Jordan and Andre Ayew started a Premier League match together for Swansea, against Andre’s former club. Two changes in total for the Swans from their last Premier League outing, with Nathan Dyer and Tom Carroll dropping to the bench, with Andre Ayew and Andy King, also making a first start for Swansea, coming in. Three changes for the Hammers, with Javier Hernandez, Winston Reid and Declan Rice replacing James Collins, Angelo Ogbonna and Joao Mario. Winston Reid started in the middle of a back three as the only recognised central defender, but his game was ended prematurely after he landed awkwardly when trying to block Fernandez's effort, amplifying David Moyes' problems, with no recognised centre-half on the bench. Sam Byram came into an even more makeshift back four. Things went from bad to worse for the visitors 32 minutes in as Swansea doubled their lead. Ki whipped a cross into the middle, Rice was caught flat-footed, leaving Van der Hoorn free to head home from close range. After the break, West Ham continued to look disjointed, and Swansea were soon three goals to the good through King. Andre Ayew's header was initially kept out by Adrian, but King was on hand to prod home the rebound. Poor defending continued to be commonplace as West Ham laboured, and after Cheikhou Kouyate had clumsily brought down Andre Ayew in the box, the former West Ham striker's brother stepped up to make it four from the spot. Mike van der Hoorn doubles Swansea's lead at the Liberty Stadium Antonio again came off the bench to net a consolation - the second time in a week that he has scored in a 4-1 West Ham defeat - to salvage some pride, but another defeat leaves Moyes' men looking over their shoulders, just three points clear of the relegation zone. Opta stats Swansea have won four consecutive Premier League matches on home soil for this first time since May 2016. This was West Ham's heaviest Premier League defeat against a side starting the day in the relegation zone since a 3-0 loss at Sheffield United in April 2007. West Ham United have conceded 37 goals away from home in the Premier League so far this season, more than any other side in the competition. Andy King is congratulated by teammate Andre Ayew after making it 3-0 Swansea have scored 14 league goals in nine matches under Carlos Carvalhal, having scored just 11 in their previous 20 Premier League matches this season before his appointment. The managers Carlos Carvalhal: \"It was rock and roll in the stadium. Sometimes you dance to the music your opponents give out to you, such as when we played Liverpool and Arsenal. But we put out our own music and I am very happy with the win. We played with high intensity and that's why it took a while for King and (Andre) Ayew to get ready.\" 2:45 West Ham boss David Moyes apologised to the supporters and says the players are disappointed with their own performances after a heavy defeat at Swansea. West Ham boss David Moyes apologised to the supporters and says the players are disappointed with their own performances after a heavy defeat at Swansea. David Moyes: \"I couldn't assess the performance because it was that bad. It is a big sorry to the supporters who travelled through the snow to get here today, and we let them down badly. The players were disappointed with their own performances. Since I have been at West Ham, it has certainly been our poorest performance\" Man of the match - Sung-Yueng Ki After a 14-game spell without a goal or an assist for Swansea in the Premier League, Ki has now a hand in four goals in his last four league apps (two goals, two assists) after his goal and assist in the first half at the Liberty. His corner caused havoc for Swansea's third goal, too. The South Korea international won 100 per cent of his duels as didn't neglect his defensive duties. Ensuring Ki extends his current contract beyond the summer must be a top priority. 4:31 Swansea boss Carlos Carvalhal says his team are continuing to progress after a convincing win over West Ham and says the Hammers were 'dancing to their rock and roll music' on the day.

Son put Spurs ahead in the 27th minute when he was played through and took the ball around Jonas Lossl before finishing into the empty net. The second goal arrived shortly after half-time when Son expertly guided a header into the corner from Harry Kane's brilliant cross.

The result is the ideal preparation for Spurs ahead of the second leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with Juventus on Wednesday, and moves them five points ahead of fifth-placed Chelsea, who play Manchester City on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Spurs dominated from the start and took the lead in the 27th minute when the excellent Son was played through by Dele Alli and coolly took the ball around Lossl before finishing across goal. Son beats Lossl for the opening goal Even before scoring, Son had looked Spurs' brightest player, with one brilliant turn and run in the 17th minute setting up Kane for a near-post shot that was well saved. Christian Eriksen's deflected free-kick hit the outside of the post shortly afterwards, while Lossl saved again from Kane later in the half as Spurs looked to extend their lead. After being denied a seemingly clear penalty when Terence Kongolo pulled down Son early in the second half, the hosts eventually scored their second in the 54th minute, moments after Huddersfield's best opening of the match when Tom Ince's powerful strike was pushed away by Hugo Lloris. Team news Son and Vertonghen replaced Wanyama and Lamela for Spurs from their last Premier League match while Huddersfield named an unchanged XI. Kane created the second goal with an excellent cross from the right touchline that bounced in the box for Son to head across goal and into the far corner. Spurs could have had more as they comfortably closed out the win but Kane shot wide from a corner and then saw an effort saved by Lossl. Heung-min Son celebrates scoring the opening goal Opta stats Mauricio Pochettino became the 19th manager to collect 100 Premier League wins, but the first non-European to do so in the competition. Pochettino reached 100 Premier League wins as a manager in 197 games - the joint-sixth quickest alongside Kenny Dalglish. Only Jose Mourinho (142), Alex Ferguson (162), Arsene Wenger (179), Rafa Benitez (181) and Claudio Ranieri (187) reached it in fewer games. Since a 1-4 loss to Manchester City in December, Tottenham have remained unbeaten in 11 Premier League games, winning eight - the longest current run in the division. Huddersfield have failed to score in 11 Premier League away games this season; more than any other top-flight side, with the Terriers conceding in 13 away games, only West Ham have conceded in more (14). Only Harry Kane (39) has been involved in more goals for Spurs in all competitions this season than Son Heung-Min (24 - 15 goals, 9 assists).

There's no doubt they were the better team and it was a deserved defeat even though in the second half we tried what we were able to do, but we got beaten by quality, that's something we have to accept. We have said this before, and I think everybody is able to leave with their heads up and we will prepare for a very exciting game which we have at our fortress of the John Smith's Stadium [against Swansea next Saturday].\" 2:27 Huddersfield boss David Wagner says his side were deservedly beaten by a quality Tottenham team Huddersfield boss David Wagner says his side were deservedly beaten by a quality Tottenham team Man of the match - Heung-min Son Restored to the starting line-up after missing out against Crystal Palace last weekend, Son staked his claim for a place in the XI against Juventus with an excellent display. He looked bright and threatening from the start and showed good composure and technique to score the opener, taking it around Lossl with his right foot and finishing with his left. The second goal was also well taken from a bouncing cross and he received a warm ovation when he was taken off in the 70th minute. What's next? Tottenham host Juventus in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 clash on Wednesday, having come back from 2-0 down to level the tie at 2-2 in Turin.

Deeney beat the offside trap from Will Hughes' excellent through-ball and fired high beyond Ben Foster with 13 minutes to go to increase the Hornets' top-half credentials. West Brom had chances to take the lead and might have got something from the game had Grzegorz Krychowiak hit the target early on, or Salomon Rondon done better when one-on-one after the break. Match ratings Watford: Karnezis (7), Janmaat (6), Prodl (6), Mariappa (6), Holebas (6), Capoue (4), Doucoure (6), Carrillo (6), Pereyra (7), Richarlison (5), Deeney (7). Subs: Okaka (6), Hughes (7), Britos (n/a). West Brom: Foster (6), Dawson (7), Hegazi (7), Evans (6), Gibbs (5), Krychowiak (6), Livermore (7), Brunt (6), Rodriguez (5), Phillips (6), Rondon (7). Subs: McClean (n/a), Burke (n/a), Field (n/a). Man of the match: Salomon Rondon But Deeney's strike condemned West Brom to a sixth straight defeat and put them eight points from Premier League safety, while the Hornets move a point within eighth-placed Leicester. The Baggies shaded the opening half, and Krychowiak tested the hosts' nervous looking-defence with a powerful drive inside four minutes, which may have put them ahead but for Adrian Mariappa's crucial block. West Brom came to frustrate Watford and had done a real job on the hosts until one mix-up shortly before the break allowed Daryl Janmaat a clear route to goal, only for his finish to make life easy for Ben Foster who turned it behind. The half-time team talks helped to liven up a limp encounter and Orestis Karnezis saved well at his near post from Rondon's 20-yard shot minutes after the restart. Team news Watford's one change was enforced, with Gerard Deulofeu missing out with injury and Andre Carrillo handed his first league start in nearly two months. Chris Brunt was kept in the West Brom starting line-u despite his dressing room dissent of Alan Pardew, while Gareth Barry missed out with a knee injury. But the key moments again evaded Pardew's side, who were inches from scoring when Jonny Evans' header was tipped onto the post by Karnezis. And soon after they were behind when Hughes spotted Deeney in space and with Evans trying to step up, the Hornets captain raced through before finishing with real confidence into the top of the net. Pardew threw on Oliver Burke and Sam Field in the dying moments in a desperate attempt to draw level, but will be increasingly concerned about his own prospects, as well as West Brom's, following a run of eight points from 15 Premier League games. Opta facts West Brom have lost five successive Premier League games for the first time since January 2011. Watford have won 10 points in five Premier League games under Javi Gracia (W3 D1 L1), more than they won in their first five under Marco Silva (8). The Baggies have won just one of their last 27 Premier League games (W1 D11 L15). Will Hughes has been involved in four goals in his last four Premier League appearances for Watford (two goals, two assists). The managers Javi Gracia: \"We got three important points in a tough game. It's not easy to win back-to-back home games, and I'm proud of the players. I'm very pleased for the supporters and we will try to do the same next week against Arsenal. 3:24 Watford boss Javi Gracia says he was proud of his players after a win over West Brom and had praise for captain Troy Deeney. Watford boss Javi Gracia says he was proud of his players after a win over West Brom and had praise for captain Troy Deeney. \"Troy has scored two very important goals in two games, and I always say the captain is an important player on and off the pitch. I'm very happy for him. \"There are more possibilities to choose players and for our selection. First of all, I'm happy for them because the players have been injured for a long time and to come back with the team is something special for them.\" Alan Pardew: \"People will turn this situation into a personal situation with myself, but it's about West Brom, it's not about me. If the consequences are I lose my job, that will be what it is. 2:17 West Brom boss Alan Pardew says his side paid the price for one mistake but believes there is something to build on after defeat at Watford. West Brom boss Alan Pardew says his side paid the price for one mistake but believes there is something to build on after defeat at Watford. \"All I can hope and what was on the surface today from the players was a commitment to try to address the situation. We know it's very, very tough. There's nine games left, there's a lot of to play for. \"A win can change the dynamic, but of course, when you look at our win ratio and our goal ratio you question that. So we've got to try to get a win and go from there.\" Man of the match - Salomon Rondon Rondon proved a real handful for the Watford defence all afternoon, drawing a foul and a booking out of Mariappa after half-time. Salomon Rondon took on more duels, and aerial battles, than any other player With some better finishing he could have put West Brom ahead, and he had more shots than anyone else on the field. Even then, his physical presence helped relieve pressure on their defence and allow them to get up-field time after time, and his defending from the front won possession back for the Baggies more than any other player on their side.

scored for the seventh consecutive game as Liverpool moved back into second place with a 2-0 win over Newcastle in the Premier League. It was not a vintage Reds performance but goals either side of half-time from Salah (40) and Sadio Mane (55) were more than enough to thwart a toothless Newcastle side, who remain just two points above the relegation zone. The Toon were lucky not to have captain Jamaal Lascelles sent off late on for a professional foul on Salah. Manchester United can leapfrog Liverpool back into the runners-up spot with a win over Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football. Rafa Benitez was returning to Anfield as an opposition manager for a third time having never lost in the away dugout. However, it was a case a damage limitation from the first whistle for the visitors.

Subs: Joselu (6), Perez (5), Hayden (6) Man of the match: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain They held out until just before the break when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain burst onto a loose ball and slipped Salah in down the right where he slotted it under Martin Dubravka for his 32nd goal of the season. The only glimpse of goal Newcastle conjured up came during injury time in the first-half when Loris Karius tipped over Mohamed Diame's curling effort that was heading for the top corner. Team news Jurgen Klopp made two changes from the win over West Ham with Dejan Lovren and Jordan Henderson returning at the expense of Joel Matip and James Milner, who had been carrying a knock. Meanwhile, Mikel Merino replaced the injured Jonjo Shelvey in midfield for Newcastle. The game was over as a contest when Mane scored the 200th goal of the Jurgen Klopp era on 55 minutes. Roberto Firmino did the damage with a classy through ball and Mane swept home his fifth goal in his last three games. There was still time for Salah to breeze past Lascelles injury time but his shout for a penalty was turned down despite Lascelles looking like a guilty party. Man of the match: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Fresh from his dynamic showing against West Ham, the England international sparked Liverpool into life with an assist for the key opening goal against a stubborn Newcastle defence. His energy through the middle of the park caused the visitors problems throughout and his quality on the ball stood him out from the crowd on what was a stuttering performance from the Reds. Mohamed Salah celebrates with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after giving Liverpool the lead Opta stats Liverpool have set a new Premier League record of most consecutive home games of scoring against a single opponent, netting in 22 consecutive matches against Newcastle at Anfield. No player within the big five European leagues has scored in more competitive club games than Salah (26 games) in 2017-18. The Egyptian has now scored against 14 of the 19 different opponents he's faced in the Premier League this season.

Arsenal 0-3 Man City Arsenal 0-3 Man City It was a case of déjà vu as Manchester City swatted aside Arsenal 3-0 in Pep Guardiola's 100th game in charge on Thursday night. After meeting in the Carabao Cup final four days earlier, where City triumphed 3-0, a huge gulf between the two sides was on show again in freezing conditions at the Emirates Stadium. Guardiola's side raced into their 3-0 lead inside 33 minutes with a spell of attacking football that oozed quality and style, summed up by goals from Bernardo Silva (15), David Silva (28) and Leroy Sane (33). Arsenal created opportunities but were wasteful in front of goal as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed a penalty (53). The win sends City 16 points clear at the top of the Premier League and means they have already matched Arsenal's points tally of 75 from last season with 10 games still to play. Player Ratings Arsenal: Cech (6), Bellerin (5), Koscielny (6), Mustafi (6), Kolasinac (6), Xhaka (5), Ramsey (6), Mkhitaryan (6), Ozil (6), Welbeck (6), Aubameyang (5) Subs: N/A Man City: Ederson (8), Walker (7), Kompany (7), Otamendi (7), Danilo (7), Gundogan (7), D Silva (8), De Bruyne (8), B Silva (8), Aguero (8), Sane (9). Subs: Zinchenko (6), Toure (6), Jesus (6) Man of the match: Leroy Sane Those that made the trip down the M6 from Manchester were rewarded for their commitment with a fantastic opening period from their team. Sane danced his way down the left wing before pinging a pass out to Bernardo Silva, who took a touch and curled a wondrous effort into the top corner on 15 minutes. If the first was good, the second goal was even better as Arsenal were cut open again by Sane down the left. He turned Henrikh Mkhitaryan inside and out, before finding Sergio Aguero in the box. The striker waited before playing a perfect pass to David Silva, who finished past Petr Cech. Team news Arsene Wenger made four changes with Jack Wilshere nowhere to be seen, having completed 90 minutes in the Carabao Cup final. According to the club, he was nursing a knee injury. Manchester City changed two from the Carabao Cup final. Claudio Bravo dropped back to the bench with Ederson and the injured Fernandinho was replaced by Bernardo Silva. The searing nature of City's attacking did not relent and Sane got his deserved goal on 33 minutes. This time City attacked down their right and some amazing one-touch interplay between Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne ended with Sane poking home at the back post. Arsenal were given a golden opportunity to stage an unlikely comeback just after the break when Nicolas Otamendi fouled Mkhitaryan in the box, kicking through the back of his legs. However, Aubameyang hit the penalty far too close to Ederson, who dived to his left and parried the ball clear. As the temperature started to drop, so did Arsenal's belief and City strolled through the remainder of the match. Arsene Wenger sits head bowed Man of the match: Leroy Sane Rarely has one man ran a team so ragged like Sane did in the first-half. He was the catalyst for all City's attacking brilliance, playing a huge part in the opening two goals before netting the third himself. This was by far his best performance since returning from ankle ligament trouble. His manager agreed. Guardiola said: \"In the first game he came back he wasn't top, but today was the first time he's been back and played quality. The first goal was a brilliant action and he scored the third. He played a really good game.\" 2:09 Jamie Carragher says the Arsenal board should make an announcement on Arsene Wenger’s future now to change the negative feeling around the club into a positive one.

Opta stats Arsenal suffered their joint-heaviest home Premier League defeat, having also lost by three-goal margins to Coventry (1993), Middlesbrough (2001) and Chelsea (twice in 2009). The Gunners have lost more matches in all competitions in 2018 than any other Premier League team (7). Aguero has had a hand in 14 goals in his last nine Premier League starts (11 goals, 3 assists). Man City have saved 11 of the last 19 penalties they have faced in all competitions (excluding penalty shootouts), with Ederson saving three of the five he has faced this season, including both in the Premier League (also against Crystal Palace). Manager reaction Guardiola: \"It's important to maintain the 16 points in front - we need five more games to be champions. It's never easy, when you win the title, you think you can relax or not be focused but we were. So far, we've had an amazing Premier League season.\" Wenger: \"When your confidence is low the first thing that goes is the fluidity and movement - the spontaneous side of the game. You could see that tonight. I don't deny City's quality but we're going through a difficult patch. That's part of football. We must stay united inside and focus on the next game and put the effort it.\" 4:18 Arsene Wenger felt that Manchester City took advantage of Arsenal's lack of confidence as they run out convincing 3-0 winners at the Emirates.

Tottenham Harry Kane headed an 88th-minute winner to earn Tottenham a 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday lunchtime. The England striker notched his 35th goal of the season - and the 150th of his club career - to deny Palace a precious point in their fight against relegation after they had defended resolutely for long spells. The late winner spared the blushes of Serge Aurier who had missed an open goal three minutes earlier and saw Spurs climb back into the top four above Chelsea on goal difference, ahead of the Blues' trip to Manchester United on Sunday afternoon. Palace, who play Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool in three of their next four fixtures, remain 17th, only above Swansea on goal difference. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (8), Wan Bissaka (6), Fosu-Mensah (6), Tomkins (7), Van Aanholt (7), Milivojevic (6), Riedewald (5), McArthur (7), Townsend (6), Benteke (6), Sorloth (6). Subs: Delaney (n/a), Lee (n/a) Tottenham: Lloris (7), Aurier (6), Sanchez (6), Dier (7), Davies (8), Wanyama (6), Dembele (6), Eriksen (7), Alli (6), Lamela (5), Kane (7) Subs: Moura (6), Son (6) Man of the match: Wayne Hennessey (Crystal Palace) During a tight first half, Tottenham were unfortunate to twice be denied penalties. Referee Kevin Friend was unmoved when Wayne Hennessey appeared to trip Ben Davies in the eighth minute - and the goalkeeper made a vital save moments later when he blocked Kane from close range. Friend did momentarily point to the spot in the 29th minute when Timothy Fosu-Mensah tripped Kane in the area, but the referee quickly changed his mind when his assistant raised his flag for offside. Team news Jan Vertonghen missed the game for Tottenham after picking up a knock in training, while Toby Alderweireld was ruled out with a hamstring complaint. Crystal Palace were without a raft of first-team players including Yohan Cabaye, Julian Speroni, Joel Ward, Martin Kelly, Scott Dann, Mamadou Sakho, Jeffrey Schlupp, Jason Puncheon, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Wilfried Zaha and Bakary Sako. Kane uncharacteristically volleyed a simple chance across the goal and wide from inside the six-yard box on 53 minutes and Hennessey dived to his right to push away a firm Aurier shot as Spurs dominated the second half. Hennessey made another fine save 19 minutes from the end as he kept out Davies' low shot at full stretch and he had to be alert again eight minutes from time when Benteke diverted Kane's shot goalwards. Harry Kane celebrates his late winner Aurier somehow missed a golden opportunity five minutes from time when Davies' left-wing cross found him at the far post with an open goal to aim at but he haplessly stood on the ball when it appeared he would tap in the winner. However, Palace's resistance was dramatically broken with two minutes left in normal time as Eriksen floated a corner to the far post and Hennessey could not get a firm hand on Kane's header. Match stats Spurs are now unbeaten in their last 15 games in all competitions (W9 D6). That's their longest run since going 16 without defeat between December 1998 and March 1999. Harry Kane scored the 150th goal of his club career in all competitions, with 134 of those coming as a Spurs player. Kane has netted 23 goals in 34 Premier League London derbies - equalling Didier Drogba's total in the competition (23 in 64). Crystal Palace are winless in their last five Premier League games (D2 L3); their worst run since Roy Hodgson took charge. Palace haven't won any of their eight Premier League games when Wilfried Zaha didn't feature this season (P8 W0 D0 L8). The managers 3:11 Mauricio Pochettino admits that Crystal Palace made life very difficult. Mauricio Pochettino admits that Crystal Palace made life very difficult. Mauricio Pochettino (Tottenham): \"They tried to make it difficult for our game but, of course, the conditions weren't great to move the ball quick, but we created chances. We dominated the whole game and it would have been a shame if we did not score at the end because we deserved to secure the victory.\" Roy Hodgson (Crystal Palace): \"It's a cruel blow, but we know what a cruel game football is, so we have to pick ourselves up and try and go again. At the moment we don't have the fire-power and the players that we would need to go toe-to-toe with these teams.\" 2:40 Roy Hodgson was pleased with his injury-hit side’s performance. Roy Hodgson was pleased with his injury-hit side’s performance. Man of the Match - Wayne Hennessey Kane was denied by a fine Wayne Hennessey save in the first half Spurs dominated this match, but Palace will feel they were worthy of a point for their resolute defending and for the outstanding display of their goalkeeper. He rushed out to deny Kane in the opening 10 minutes and was alert to keep out an Aurier drive and a Kane effort which deflected wickedly off Benteke. His best save was at full stretch from Davies in the 71st minute and Kane's late winner was particularly cruel after an excellent performance. What's next? Crystal Palace's next Premier League game is in eight days' time when they host Manchester United on Monday Night Football. Tottenham host Rochdale in an FA Cup replay at Wembley on Wednesday evening, before resuming their top-four push with a home game against Huddersfield on Saturday afternoon."}, {"date": "25/02/2018",

and set up another as Manchester United came from behind to beat Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford on Nissan Super Sunday. The Belgium international scored his first goal against a top-eight club this season with United's equaliser (39), after Willian fired the dominant champions ahead (32). Lukaku then crossed for substitute Jesse Lingard to head the winner 15 minutes from time. The victory sees United reclaim second place in the Premier League from Liverpool and open a potentially crucial six-point gap over fifth-placed Chelsea in the race for the top four.

Man of the Match: Romelu Lukaku Chelsea's positive midweek performance against Barcelona may have been marred by Lionel Messi's away goal but the champions showed no sign of self-pity as they flew out of the traps, the restored Alvaro Morata turning Marcos Alonso's cross onto the bar inside five minutes. Such was the dominance of the visitors' bright, exuberant start that it took United until the 27th minute to register an effort on goal. First Lukaku had a shot blocked before, a minute later, Alexis Sanchez's toe poke at the end of flowing counter was comfortably saved by Thibaut Courtois. Willian wheels away after firing Chelsea into the lead at Old Trafford But just as it seemed the hosts had found a foothold in the game, Chelsea struck as Willian played a one-two with Eden Hazard and bludgeoned a shot through David de Gea's defences. It was no more than Chelsea deserved, as was the lead at the break, but United's only moment of quality denied them that as Sanchez and Martial combined at the end of an intricate move to free Lukaku, who slotted the equaliser home from six yards. Romelu Lukaku scored and provided an assist in Manchester United's victory Chelsea continued in the second period from where they had left off, though, as Willian released Morata through on goal on 49 minutes, but Chris Smalling, having initially lunged in, recovered to block the Spaniard's shot. Danny Drinkwater's dipping 20-yard strike drew a fumble from De Gea shortly after, before his counterpart Courtois pulled off a stunning fingertip save to deny Lukaku an acrobatic second on 67 minutes. Team news Paul Pogba started in a midfield three along with Nemanja Matic and Scott McTominay, while Victor Lindelof partnered Chris Smalling in the United defence. Alvaro Morata got the nod up front forr Chelsea with Eden Hazard and Willian. Danny Drinkwater replaced Cesc Fabregas in midfield. But having been denied, Lukaku turned provider, curling a fine cross from the right onto the head of Lingard, who steered his 13th goal of the season beyond Courtois to ensure Jose Mourinho got the better of old foe Antonio Conte. Opta stats Manchester United have won two of their last three matches against Chelsea (L1) - one more than they managed in their previous 14 combined against the Blues (one). Chelsea have lost back-to-back away Premier League matches for the first time since November 2015, when they were managed by Jose Mourinho. United have lost just one of their last 35 home league matches against the reigning top-flight champions (W20 D14). Jesse Lingard celebrates his winner for Manchester United Chelsea lost a Premier League match in which they scored first for the first time since last April against Crystal Palace - they had won 22 games consecutively when scoring first before today. Romelu Lukaku found the net against one of the sides currently occupying the top eight of the Premier League for the first time this season - he had played 10 games without scoring before this match. Jesse Lingard has scored 13 goals in all competitions for Manchester United this season - only Lukaku (22) has scored more. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"We beat a very good team, and to beat a very good team you need to be organised, but you need to also to have a humble spirit where everybody works, everybody fights, everybody tries to follow a game-plan. I repeat - we beat a very good team.\" 4:03 Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho says his side showed great spirit and organisation to beat a fantastic Chelsea side.

With the kind of flat-track bully display he usually reserves for the so-called lesser clubs, once he got going, Lukaku was at the spearhead of the late-surging United attack, and his influence was telling.

The Potters looked on course for only their second league victory under Paul Lambert when Xherdan Shaqiri curled a fine effort home two minutes before half-time. But, for the second away game running, a vital three points were surrendered when Butland spilled a fierce Marc Albrighton cross into his own net on 70 minutes. After Butland atoned with a stunning stop to deny Riyad Mahrez, Leicester struck the woodwork twice, but Stoke held on for a point which leaves them 19th in the Premier League. Leicester climb to seventh. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (5), Simpson (6), Morgan (5), Maguire (6), Chilwell (6), James (6), Ndidi (6), Albrighton (6), Mahrez (6), Gray (5), Vardy (6).

Subs: Johnson (5), Adam (5), Campbell (5). Man of the Match: Xherdan Shaqiri Leicester had Stoke on the ropes with a bright start which yielded three corners in the first two minutes, but that early momentum soon dissipated as the visitors settled. Badou Ndiaye drew Kasper Schmeichel into a comfortable save from the edge of the area on 13 minutes while Riyad Mahrez, making his first league start since his January move away from Leicester fell through, fired wide on the half hour. An uneventful first half look to be meandering to a close until Wilfried Ndidi lost possession while trying to usher the ball out of play, Joe Allen threaded Shaqiri into space and the Switzerland international curled a fine effort beyond Schmeichel at the end of a purposeful run. Xherdan Shaqiri celebrates scoring the opening goal during the match between Leicester City and Stoke City Shell-shocked after going behind, Leicester so nearly gifted Stoke a second early in the second period as Shaqiri returned a poor Schmeichel clearance with interest from 40 yards, but his effort narrowly missed the target. And the Foxes looked bereft of ideas against a resolute Stoke outfit until an Albrighton's cross from the right proved too hot for Butland to handle, and he turned the ball into his goal. Team news Riyad Mahrez made his first start since his Deadline Day move to Man City fell through, while Matty James and Marc Albrighton were drafted into the Leicester side. Stoke were without injured captain Ryan Shawcross as Geoff Cameron, Bruno Martins Indi and Kostas Stafylidis got the nod. Butland soon made amends, though, thwarting Mahrez's shot from the edge of the area with a point-blank save, moments before tipping Harry Maguire's drive onto the post. A last-gasp block from Kurt Zouma prevented Mahrez from converting a one-on-one before Matty James saw a header cannon against the post in the final minute as Stoke clung on for a point in a game they will feel they should have won. Leicester players celebrates as Stoke goalkeeper Butland reacts after deflecting Marc Albrighton's cross into his own net Opta stats After winning five of their first eight Premier League games under Claude Puel (D2 L1), Leicester have enjoyed just two victories in the last 11 (D4 L5). Stoke have won just one of their last nine top-flight games (D4 L4), scoring a total of just six goals in that period. Since the start of last season, the Potters have scored seven own-goals in the Premier League, more than any other side. Xherdan Shaqiri has scored in three consecutive games in Europe's big five leagues for the first time ever. Tyrese Campbell made his Premier League debut 4326 days after his father Kevin Campbell last made an appearance in the competition (April 2006 v Newcastle). The managers Claude Puel: \"I think it was not enough to win the game. I think a draw is perhaps a fair result today. It was a fantastic save from their goalkeeper. This team in this moment play well, they have a good spirit, good defence, and Shaqiri can make the difference.\" Paul Lambert: \"I think as I've said before, Shaqiri is a real world class footballer, and he was unlucky with his vision in the second half. He makes things happen. Thankfully he's playing ever so well, which is great for us, but I couldn't fault the team in every department.\" Man of the Match - Xherdan Shaqiri In a game which offered little in terms of attacking threat, Stoke's attacking maestro rose to the occasion. His goal was sublime and his overall performance, ensuring Stoke had an outball as Leicester applied the pressure, were vital in securing a point.

The Magpies cruised into a 2-0 first-half lead thanks to a Dwight Gayle double (17, 45+1) and looked to be heading for victory but with ten minutes to play, Adam Smith hammered home via the underside of the crossbar (80). Bournemouth then piled on the pressure and former Magpie Gosling tapped in with just a minute remaining to see the points shared. Although Newcastle are now four games without defeat in the Premier League, results elsewhere mean they drop to 15th in the table with 29 points, while Bournemouth remain 10th. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (7), Steve Cook (7), Ake (7), Fraser (6), Lewis Cook (7), Gosling (7), Daniels (5), King (6), Wilson (6), Stanislas (7).

Subs used: Atsu (6), Hayden (5), Manquillo (4). Man of the match: Jonjo Shelvey. Bournemouth had their best spell of the first half early on and had two good chances in the opening ten minutes. Gosling could only send a darting Junior Stanislas cross over the bar with his head, before Martin Dubravka was forced into a low save to keep out a shot from Callum Wilson after Stanislas' free-kick. But Newcastle deservedly took the lead in the 17th minute. Jonjo Shelvey played a sublime ball over the top for Matt Ritchie to latch onto down the right-hand side. He then flashed a ball across the face of goal, and after ricocheting off Asmir Begovic and Steve Cook, the ball landed at the feet of Gayle, who back-heeled it into the net. Team news Bournemouth made one change from their last game with Josh King coming into the XI for Jordon Ibe. Newcastle were unchanged from their win against Man Utd. He added his second on the stroke of half-time after Bournemouth failed to properly clear a Newcastle corner. It allowed Paul Dummett to float a cross to Ayoze Perez at the back post, who then slotted the ball across the face of goal - and under the body of Begovic - for Gayle to tap home. Both sides had chances to score the next goal throughout the second half. The best for Newcastle came in the 72nd minute as Perez sent the ball wide of goal from point-blank range after a free-kick, before Dubravka was forced into a leaping save to keep out a powerful header from Steve Cook. Dan Gosling celebrates his equalising goal for Bournemouth But Bournemouth made the breakthrough with ten minutes of normal time left. After some great hold-up play, Josh King found Lewis Cook down the left, who in turn flicked the ball into the path of Smith on the edge of the box and after taking a touch, the defender hit a fierce volley that pinged into the back of the net via the underside of the crossbar. It put wind into the sails of Bournemouth, who had been off-colour for much of the game, and they scored the equaliser in the 89th minute. After a flick from Lys Mousset, Nathan Ake surged down the left-hand side of the box before putting in a cross, which found the feet of the waiting Gosling and he hit home from close range into the top corner to ensure the points were shared. Dwight Gayle celebrates his first goal for Newcastle Opta stats Bournemouth have picked up 13 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, a joint-high along with Everton. Newcastle failed to win a Premier League game after being two goals up at half-time for the first time since February 2012 (2-2 v Wolves). Bournemouth have gone eight Premier League home games without a clean sheet, their longest-ever run without a shutout at the Vitality Stadium in the competition. Dwight Gayle ended a run of 11 Premier League appearances without a goal, via his first Premier League brace since May 2016. The managers Eddie Howe: \"We have to be satisfied with the point we have. It's been a strange afternoon because for a long spell of the game, we weren't what we wanted to be and at 2-0 down, it looked like a long way back. 2:07 Eddie Howe felt it was a strange day as his side looked off the pace for large parts of their draw with Newcastle before two late goals rescued a point Eddie Howe felt it was a strange day as his side looked off the pace for large parts of their draw with Newcastle before two late goals rescued a point \"But credit to the players, we found something, changed the system, changed players and for 20 minutes, we looked like the team we want to be on a more consistent basis. At the end there, I thought we were going to win the game. Rafa Benitez: \"I think it's a pity because the team was doing well and had chances to score the third goal but that is football and the Premier League. We were really pleased with the first half and even at the start of the second half, but when we conceded the goal, we lost the composure and control.\" 1:51 Rafa Benitez says it was 'a pity' that his side gave up 80 minutes of hard work, as they conceded twice to draw at Bournemouth Rafa Benitez says it was 'a pity' that his side gave up 80 minutes of hard work, as they conceded twice to draw at Bournemouth Man of the match - Jonjo Shevley It was an assured performance from Shelvey at the Vitality Stadium, especially in the first half where Newcastle looked very comfortable. He had a hand in setting up Gayle's opening goal with a superb pass over the top, and produced a few more although they did not prove as fruitful. He also put a shift in when taking advantage of some sloppy Bournemouth play and showed off what a talent he can be. What's next?

Murray opened the scoring early on from the penalty spot (18), before doubling the home side's lead with his seventh goal in his last nine games (69). Anthony Knockaert then added a third with 17 minutes to go and despite Lewis Dunk's 85th-minute own goal, substitute Jurgen Locadia completed the scoring with his first goal for his new team since joining from PSV in January.

Meanwhile, Swansea - whose 10-game unbeaten run in all competitions comes to an end - fall back into the relegation zone, albeit on goal difference. Brighton took an 18th-minute lead after referee Mike Dean decided that Mike Van der Hoorn had fouled Murray in the box, although there appeared to be minimal contact. Brighton's Glenn Murray has scored four goals in four Premier League games Murray kept his cool from the spot, however, to send Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way as the striker calmly chipped the ball down the middle. Both sides then had chances to score just before half-time, with Shane Duffy heading Pascal Gross' right-wing corner against the top of the bar. Team news Brighton had no new injury concerns, while Alfie Mawson started in defence for the Swans with the centre back having recovered from a knee problem. Then in first-half stoppage time, Jordan Ayew cut in from the left and drilled a low shot against the post, with the ball striking Matt Ryan on the head, before Martin Olsson somehow missed the gaping goal from the rebound. Brighton went further ahead following a lovely team goal involving outstanding duo Jose Izquierdo and Gross, who played a one-two on the edge of the box. And the Colombian's pull back from the left-hand byline was then tucked home by Murray for his 10th league goal of the season. Brighton's Anthony Knockaert scored Brighton's third The hosts then made it 3-0 as Knockaert rounded off another fine move involving Gross and Murray, before Swansea - who by this stage had thrown on Tammy Abraham and Andre Ayew as further forwards - pulled a goal back when Dunk deflected the former's shot past Ryan. In the final minute Brighton scored a fourth for the first time in the Premier League as Izquierdo again got free to the left byline, before the winger's pull back found Dale Stephens. And the midfielder then drilled the ball back across the box for club-record signing Locadia to net from close range. Opta stats Swansea suffered their first defeat in their last six top-flight games (W3 D2), conceding one goal more against Brighton than in their previous five games combined. Murray has netted four goals in his last four Premier League games, as many as in his previous 15 in the competition. Izquierdo has been directly involved in a goal in each of his last three Premier League games (2 goals, 1 assist), after managing just two goals and two assists in his previous 20 this season. Gross has had a hand in three goals in his last three Premier League games (1 goal, 2 assists), and has scored or assisted 12 overall this season in the competition, more than any other Brighton player. Dunk has scored four own goals in the Premier League this season - the joint-most by a player in a single season in the competition's history (also Martin Skrtel in 2013-14). Brighton winger Anthony Knockaert (centre) takes on the Swansea defence The managers Chris Hughton: \"It was a worthy scoreline, particularly in the second half as the game opened up. \"And generally as games open up in that way, somebody is going to benefit, and it was us today. We have not been big goal scorers this season, but on a day with that little bit more guile and a better final pass, we could have had more. \"At the moment, particularly at home, we look more likely to score goals than perhaps we did earlier in the season. And that is something we will need to continue.\" 3:37 Chris Hughton felt his Brighton side fully deserved their big win over Swansea Chris Hughton felt his Brighton side fully deserved their big win over Swansea Carlos Carvalhal: \"When we were losing 1-0 I was thinking we must change things, so we put Ayew in attack.

He has now netted 10 times in the league this campaign, with only three other Englishmen having scored more - Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane, Man City's Raheem Sterling and Leicester City's Jamie Vardy.

1 Southampton FT Burnley 1 - 1 Southampton Manolo Gabbiadini's 90th-minute equaliser pulled Southampton out of the relegation zone with a late 1-1 draw at Burnley. The Italian substitute latched onto Josh Sims' cross and lashed beyond Nick Pope to give the Saints a draw they just about deserved with his first goal in four months. Ashley Barnes earlier put the hosts in front with a scrappy finish from Jeff Hendrick's flick, having kept Southampton at arm's length for the most part. But Sims forced Pope into a world-class save as they pressed for a late equaliser before Gabbiadini's goal, which lifts them to 16th in the table and leaves Burnley 11 games without a Premier League win. Match ratings Burnley: Pope (6), Lowton (6), Long (7), Mee (7), Ward (7), Lennon (7), Cork (7), Hendrick (5), Westwood (6), Gudmundsson (7), Barnes (8). Subs: n/a. Southampton: McCarthy (7), Cedric (6), Hoedt (7), Stephens (6), Bertrand (6), Romeu (8), Lemina (6), Ward-Prowse (5), Tadic (6), Redmond (7), Carrillo (6). Subs: Sims (7), Boufal (6), Gabbiadini (n/a). Man of the match: Oriel Romeu. Southampton registered only two touches inside the Clarets box before the break, but created the best chance of the opening period when they did. Nathan Redmond's smart reverse pass found Dusan Tadic, who shot first-time but was denied by a combination of Pope and Ben Mee, who both got something on his curler. At the other end, Johan Gudmundsson and Barnes both headed wide, but a game between two sides lacking in confidence was predictably cagey. Team news Burnley added an extra man into midfield with Ashley Westwood replacing forward Sam Vokes. Southampton's one change saw Nathan Redmond replace Pierre Hojbjerg, with Dusan Tadic moving central. The Saints re-emerged better after a ticking off from Mauricio Pellegrino but still fashioned little, and Burnley took the lead when Gudmundsson's shot was saved by Pope, and Barnes touched Hendrick's header in on the line. But the arrival of Sims turned things around for the visitors, and he used his pace to good effect to pull a stunning save from Pope inside the last 10 minutes. With moments of normal time remaining, Sims pounced after Bobby Madley inadvertently blocked off Ashley Westwood in midfield, before crossing for Gabbiadini to score for the first time since October 15. Manager reaction Sean Dyche: \"We all know what this division's about. If you lay your hands on anyone in the top half everyone goes on the floor. 1:47 Burnley manager Sean Dyche felt his side's performance merited three points, after a late Southampton goal left them with just a draw. Burnley manager Sean Dyche felt his side's performance merited three points, after a late Southampton goal left them with just a draw. \"Ironically our centre-half gets pulled and goes on the floor and it's no foul. Everyone will have to work that out for themselves. \"There's nothing we could do about the rest of it today. That was a winning performance. We just need a bit of luck, and control the things we can control as we have done all season.\" Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It was difficult. Burnley are a team who don't concede too many, but we have a good feeling because the game was tight without too many chances for either side. \"We competed in the second half better, but at home Burnley are strong, maybe stronger than us, and we didn't move the ball quick enough. 2:28 Mauricio Pellegrino felt it was one of his side's better points of the season as a late goal earned Southampton a point at Burnley. Mauricio Pellegrino felt it was one of his side's better points of the season as a late goal earned Southampton a point at Burnley. \"The substitutions had a big impact on the team. Hopefully Manolo can regain his confidence. We've got 10 games and I need everybody to be ready to contribute.\" Opta facts The Clarets have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last five home PL games, this after keeping four in the five games before this run. Southampton haven't lost any of their last nine Premier League games in which they've started the day in the relegation zone (W4 D5), since a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool in December 2012. Manolo Gabbiadini netted his first Premier League goal in 15 appearances and first since bagging a brace against Newcastle in October 2017. Ashley Barnes netted his fourth Premier League goal of the season, no Burnley player has scored more this term (level with Chris Wood). Man of the match - Oriel Romeu Romeu won a lot of the battles in midfield and kept Burnley at bay when they overloaded the flanks. He was very rarely beaten on the floor or in the air and was unlucky to be withdrawn as Southampton chased a draw late on. What's next? Southampton return to St Mary's, where they are currently on course for their lowest ever Premier League home points tally, while Burnley host Everton next Saturday."}, {"date": "24/02/2018", "arena":

4-1 West Ham Liverpool maintained their unbeaten record at Anfield in the Premier League this season and moved up to second with a 4-1 win over West Ham. Ahead of Manchester United against Chelsea on Super Sunday, this looked a good opportunity for Jurgen Klopp's men to improve their top-four chances and they did not fluff their lines with goals from Emre Can (30), Mohamed Salah (50), Roberto Firmino (57) and Sadio Mane (77). Salah's strike was his 25th goal in his last 25 appearances and set a new Premier League record of 20 left-footed goals in a Premier League season - surpassing Robbie Fowler's longstanding achievement. Michail Antonio notched a consolation for West Ham (59), who caused problems for Liverpool in the first half courtesy of Marko Arnautovic, but David Moyes' side are now just three points off the relegation zone. Player Ratings Liverpool: Karius (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Matip (7), Van Dijk (7), Robertson (7), Oxlade-Chamberlain (7), Can (7), Milner (7), Mane (7), Firmino (8), Salah (8). Subs: Solanke (6), Moreno (6), Lallana (6) West Ham: Adrian (5), Cresswell (6), Collins (6), Ogbonna (5), Zabaleta (6), Evra (5), Joao Mario (6), Kouyate (6), Noble (6), Lanzini (6), Arnautovic (8). Subs: Rice (6), Antonio (7), Hernandez (6) Man of the match: Mohamed Salah West Ham paid tribute to Bobby Moore on the 25th anniversary of his death and fans were given commemorative shirts at Anfield The entertaining nature of the game was evident in the opening minutes, where both teams hit the woodwork. Salah found space in the box but Adrian pushed his effort onto the post before Arnautovic broke clear of Virgil van Dijk and attempted to beat Loris Karius with a delicate chip, but his sensational effort was tipped onto the crossbar. Klopp's men took the lead when Salah's corner was met by Can, who was supposed to be being marked by Hammers' debutant Patrice Evra. It was Liverpool's 100th goal of this season in all competitions. It didn't take long after the break for Salah to get in on the act as he reversed a clever shot past Adrian after a run by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Team news Liverpool made one change from their last Premier League clash with Southampton with James Milner replacing Georginio Wijnaldum. The headline news was that Patrice Evra made his West Ham debut as David Moyes has selected a cautious team to deal with Liverpool’s electric attack. Evra and Manuel Lanzini were the only changes from their win over Watford – Michail Antonio and Javier Hernandez dropped out. Firmino added a third when Can played him in and the Brazilian finished into the empty net with a no-look finish after rounding the goalkeeper. Antonio scored within moments of coming on when he found a gaping hole in the Liverpool backline but Liverpool regained control and Mane completed the victory by lifting over Adrian from close range. Roberto Firmino made it 3-0 Man of the match - Mohamed Salah Who else? From the first attack of the game it was clear to see Salah's high level had not been affected by a mini-break of matches for Liverpool. He struck a post with a fine low effort early on and was a constant menace down the right-wing before capping his display with a clever low finish to double Liverpool's advantage. Special mention should also go to Arnautovic for West Ham, whose play was dripping in quality throughout and was unlucky not to score. Mohamed Salah celebrates after doubling Liverpool's lead Manager reaction: Jurgen Klopp \"When I woke up this morning I didn't expect a game like this - I only hoped for it. \"It was a joy to watch. It was a fantastic football game - it was fluid, flexible, intense, aggressive, angry and full of desire. I saw a lot of things I wish to see in a football game - it's not often a game delivers all of that, today was one of those days.\" David Moyes \"It was a tough day, but we played a good team in form. We've done quite well against the top teams since I've been at the club and I thought for periods today we also did quite well.\" Opta stats Liverpool have scored 4+ goals in three consecutive Premier League games versus a single opponent for the first time since doing so against Norwich between 2012-2013. David Moyes has never won against Liverpool at Anfield in all competitions as a manager (D7 L8), failing to win with Everton, Man Utd, Sunderland and now West Ham. Salah has been directly involved in 31 Premier League goals this season (23 goals, 8 assists), more than any other player. Evra made his Premier League debut for West Ham, the Frenchman is the fifth oldest outfield player to make an appearance this season (36y 284d). What's next?

Alex Pritchard then saw an attempt blocked by the head of team-mate Mounie, who was standing some two yards out following Florent Hadergjonaj's cross, while Ben Foster did superbly to block the follow-up shot from Van La Parra. Just before half-time, it was West Brom who should have broken the deadlock, but the unmarked McClean could only volley over from Matt Phillips' chipped ball in. Team news One West Brom change saw Kieran Gibbs in for Gareth McAuley, while Jonny Evans reclaimed the captain’s armband. There were two changes for Huddersfield in midfield, with Jonathan Hogg and Alex Pritchard replacing Tom Ince and Philip Billing. Huddersfield were rewarded for a bright start to the second half when Van La Parra latched onto Collin Quaner's low cross. The visitors doubled their lead eight minutes later, with Alex Pritchard playing a defence-splitting pass for Mounie, who curled the ball around the onrushing Foster. Steve Mounie celebrates scoring Huddersfield's second goal against West Brom at The Hawthorns Dawson did head West Brom back into contention with half an hour to go, but the defender was then guilty of a missed opportunity late on, as he could only shoulder the ball over from three yards out when looking to meet another corner. Craig Dawson pulled a goal back for West Brom Opta stats Huddersfield Town have won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since their opening two fixtures of the season. West Bromwich Albion are the first side the Terriers have ever done a Premier League double over since reaching the competition. Under Alan Pardew, West Brom have accrued just eight points in 14 Premier League matches (W1 D5 L8), four fewer than their first 14 games of the campaign before his arrival (W2 D6 L6). Rajiv van La Parra has scored two of his three Premier League goals against the Baggies (67%). The managers 1:49 Alan Pardew said his side made things difficult for themselves after two errors cost them in their defeat to Huddersfield. Alan Pardew said his side made things difficult for themselves after two errors cost them in their defeat to Huddersfield. Alan Pardew: \"Three wins in 37 games says it all really - we've got to find a way. However we get it, maybe it can spark us into life. We've got players who can perform better than they have done today. We need to bring those performances to the pitch somehow. \"You have to persist in your values and in what you think is right,\" Pardew added. \"We'll set our team up as strong as we can next week and try a game of football.\" David Wagner: \"It's a massive win, of course it is. I spoke before about how important this game is, that it's a final for both teams. We won it and we are delighted for all the supporters, the players and all the backroom staff, for all the effort they brought from training onto the pitch. \"It was a final for both teams. We came over this period of the first five, 10 minutes without conceding a goal, even if they didn't have the clear-cut chances. 2:40 David Wagner said his side showed everything necessary to win a massive game against West Brom in the Premier League. David Wagner said his side showed everything necessary to win a massive game against West Brom in the Premier League. \"It was an open game.

Paul Merson looks back on Huddersfield's win over West Brom in the Premier League. Man of the match - Rajiv van La Parra In a tightly-contested game, it was Van La Parra and Pritchard's willingness to take the game to West Brom after the break which ultimately put the game beyond the hosts. And while Pritchard got himself an assist, it was Van La Parra who scored the vital opener, adding to the goal he scored in the 1-0 win when the teams met back in November. Rajiv van La Parra opened the scoring for Huddersfield at The Hawthorns The Dutchman could have had a second later on, only to be denied by the feet of Foster, while a match-high six tackles shows it wasn't just in attack where Van La Parra flourished. Victory will feel extra sweet for the former Wolves player. What's next? It's a week until both sides are back in Premier League action. West Brom travel to Watford next Saturday for a 3pm kick-off, while Huddersfield head to Wembley to take on Tottenham at the same time."}, {"date": "24/02/2018", "arena": "Vicarage Road",

Deeney struck late as Watford secured a 1-0 win against Everton in the Premier League at Vicarage Road on Saturday. Captain Deeney scored his first goal from open play in 27 matches in the 79th minute of what was at times a drab affair to seal Javi Gracia's second win in charge. Victory moves Watford up to 10th, one point behind Everton and six points clear of the relegation zone. For Everton, their miserable away form continues with Sam Allardyce's side picking up just one win on the road since a 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace on January 21, 2017. Player ratings Watford: Karnezis (6), Janmaat (7), Mariappa (7), Prodl (7), Holeba (7), Doucoure (6), Capoue (6), Deulofeu (7), Pereyra (5), Richarlison (5), Deeney (7). Subs: Femenia (6), Carrillo (6), Okaka (7). Away Team: Pickford (7), Martina (6), Williams (6), Keane (6), Kenny (6), Davies (6), Gueye (5), Rooney (5), Sigurdsson (6), Walcott (6), Niasse (6). Subs: Bolasie (6), Tosun (5), Calvert-Lewin (6). Man of the match: Troy Deeney. Both sides struggled in what was a lacklustre opening 45 minutes, with chances few and far between neither team showed any real ambition in attack. Everton's best moment came in the 18th minute when Tom Davies, who was making his 50th Premier League appearance, released Oumar Niasse and the Senegal striker's deflected effort was parried away by Orestis Karnezis at his near post. Ashley Williams and Cuco Martina of Everton speak during the match against Watford Gerard Deulofeu, who was later forced from the field because of injury, was Watford's only bright spark in the first half and he combined with Etienne Capoue, but the midfielder's shot sailed high over the crossbar. After the break, Everton almost broke the deadlock when Michael Keane's header nearly picked out the far corner. Team news Watford made one change with Pereyra coming in for Zeegelaar. Gomes, Britos, Femenia and Okaka all return to the bench. Everton made two changes with Williams and Kenny replace Mangala and Coleman. Gracia reacted by sending on Stefano Okaka and Kiko Femenia in the 56th minute and the latter almost broke the deadlock when benefitting from Jordan Pickford's poor clearance. However, the England goalkeeper atoned for his error with a smart save to deny the substitute. Watford were ahead moments later when Deeney produced one of the few moments of quality in the game, turning in the penalty area after being picked out by Okaka's pass before powering an unstoppable shot past Pickford with 11 minutes remaining. Opta stats Watford kept a clean sheet at Vicarage Road for the first time in their last eight top-flight games. Everton have registered just one win in their last 22 Premier League away games (D9 L12), losing each of the last four. Watford enjoyed only their third win over Everton in their last 25 meetings in all competitions (D3 L19). Watford are up to 10th after beating Everton After picking up 10 points in his first four Premier League games as Everton boss, Sam Allardyce has seen his side accrue just nine in the last 10. Watford had to wait until the 55th minute to register their first shot on target of the game, via a Troy Deeney effort (there had only been one before that from Everton). Deeney scored from open play for the first time in his last 27 Premier League games (v West Brom April 2017). Man of the Match - Troy Deeney There were not many performances of note at Viacarge Road so Deeney gets the nod for producing the moment of quality that one the game. Picked out in the penalty area by Okaka, Deeney's turn and finish was brilliant - a strike worthy of winning any game. What's next? Everton face a trip to Turf Moor to face Burnley on Saturday, live on Sky Sports Premier League at 12.30pm, while Watford host West Brom, also on Saturday (3pm)."}, {"date": "12/02/2018", "arena":

Hazard scored twice as Chelsea bounced back from consecutive Premier League defeats with a 3-0 victory over West Brom on Monday Night Football to move back into the top four. After making a shaky start, Hazard settled the nerves around Stamford Bridge with a brilliantly-worked opener in the 25th minute, but the hosts continued to look vulnerable at the back as West Brom missed several chances to equalise. Victor Moses capitalised on a fortunate deflection to double Chelsea's advantage in the 63rd minute, before Hazard scored a stunning third eight minutes later to make sure of a crucial three points for Chelsea. The victory sees Chelsea climb back above Tottenham into fourth after just a third win in 11 in all competitions - easing the pressure on head coach Antonio Conte in the process - while West Brom's problems continue as they stayed rooted to the bottom of the Premier League, seven points from safety with 11 games remaining. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (6), Azpilicueta (7), Rudiger (6), Christensen (6), Moses 7), Kante (6), Fabregas (6), Zappacosta (6), Pedro (6), Giroud (6), Hazard (8).

Subs: Burke (5), Rodriguez (6). Man of the match: Eden Hazard West Brom suffered a huge blow to their game plan in the third minute as Daniel Sturridge was forced off with an injury but his replacement, Jay Rodriguez, could have won a penalty with his first touch, but no foul was adjudged to have been committed by Cesc Fabregas. Rodriguez remained in the thick of the action and he drilled a first-time effort wide having latched onto a misplaced header from Moses. Chelsea did settle into the match and went close to breaking the deadlock after 16 minutes but Davide Zappacosta saw his back-post effort well saved by Ben Foster. The West Brom stopper then saved Olivier Giroud's tame effort from point-blank range with his legs. Team news Olivier Giroud made his first start for Chelsea after his Deadline Day move from Arsenal, and Alvaro Morata was fit enough for a place on the bench. Antonio Conte also dropped captain Gary Cahill to the bench as one of four changes from the 4-1 humbling at Watford a week ago. Captain Jonny Evans made his first West Brom appearance since the close of the Transfer Window, re-taking the captain's armband and replacing Gareth McAuley at the heart of defence. There were two other changes for the visitors, with Grzegorz Krychowiak and Kieran Gibbs also recalled. But Giroud turned provider to help Chelsea take the lead. Hazard fed the ball into the France international, he backed into his man, cushioned the pass back in Hazard's path, for the Chelsea forward to sweep the ball home. Giroud then came close to a first Chelsea goal, but he could not quite get the desired connection on an overhead kick from close range. After the break, Chelsea again struggled to find their rhythm, and could easily have conceded an equaliser after Andreas Christensen had been caught on the ball by Salomon Rondon, but the West Brom hitman was denied by a smart Thibaut Courtois stop before Jonny Evans headed wide from the resulting corner. Victor Moses tucks away Chelsea's second against West Brom Those misses proved costly as Chelsea wrapped up victory in the space of eight minutes. First, Moses fed the ball into Fabregas, who tried to flick the ball through for substitute Alvaro Morata, Craig Dawson made the block, but inadvertently diverted the ball back into the path of Moses, who stroked the ball into the net. Then, Hazard carried the ball to the edge of the box, cut inside, before rifling a strike past Foster at his near post to cap a man-of-the-match display. Opta stats Chelsea have won all four Premier League meetings against West Brom under Antonio Conte without conceding a single goal. West Brom have not beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in any of their last 17 visits in all competitions (D3 L14), since winning 1-0 in the League Cup in November 1983 under Ron Wylie. West Brom have won just one of their last 25 Premier League matches (D11 L13). Eden Hazard has had a hand in 105 goals in the Premier League for Chelsea (68 goals, 37 assists) - only Didier Drogba (159) and Frank Lampard (237) have been involved in more for the club. The managers Antonio Conte felt securing three points was the most important thing as Chelsea returned to winning ways Antonio Conte felt securing three points was the most important thing as Chelsea returned to winning ways Antonio Conte: \"I think we forced Giroud to play because we had Morata injured, and it was important to have a point of reference like him. He could become an important player and at the same time I had a good answer from Alvaro and we must be happy, because to have two strikers in contention for us is very important.\" Alan Pardew: \"It was a blow to lose Daniel on his first run.That didn't give us the perfect start. We just can't seem to get the goals that get us the wins, and they need to come, and come quickly, so Daniel's recovery will be important now - we need to get him back.\" Alan Pardew says West Brom need to start scoring soon if they are to remain a Premier League side Alan Pardew says West Brom need to start scoring soon if they are to remain a Premier League side The pundit - Thierry Henry \"I don't know what he saw there [Hazard for Chelsea's third], but he saw it. Even Ben Foster doesn't see the ball. Hazard uses Gibbs as a protection. \"When he picks it up, if you are Eden Hazard, and a quality player, sometimes you finish the job. I love people that think about the team, but just finish it. Why not?\" Olivier Giroud touchmap v West Brom Man of the match - Eden Hazard Chelsea needed their leading light to produce the goods to bring their losing streak to an end, and the Belgium international didn't disappoint. Hazard's goals have dug Chelsea out of many a hole before, and his continued ruthlessness was the difference at Stamford Bridge once more. Hazard has now scored with six of his last eight shots on target in the Premier League. What's next? Chelsea's next fixture sees them take on Hull in the FA Cup on Friday night, with their next league fixture being another home clash with Manchester United on February 25.

Mounie helped Huddersfield Town end an eight-game winless run with a 4-1 win over Bournemouth at the John Smith's Stadium on Sunday. Huddersfield took an early lead after Mounie set up Alex Pritchard for his first Premier League goal, only for Junior Stanislas (13) to soon level matters for the visitors. Mounie's thumping header gave David Wagner's team the lead again after 27 minutes - the striker's third goal in his last four appearances - before Steve Cook's own goal from Mounie's deflected shot (66) increased the hosts' advantage midway through the second half.

Huddersfield, seeking their first victory of 2018, made a dream start after taking a seventh-minute lead. A simple ball over the top released Mounie down the left flank and the striker drove into the area, before pulling the ball back for the Pritchard to sweep home his first-ever goal for the Terriers. Alex Pritchard is congratulated by Steve Mounie (right) after opening the scoring However, the home side's lead lasted just six minutes. Huddersfield's defence tried unsuccessfully to catch Ryan Fraser offside on the right-hand touchline, before the winger crossed for the unmarked Stanislas to cushion the ball and coolly side-foot past Jonas Lossl. Huddersfield went in ahead at the break, though, as Mounie rose highest to power Aaron Mooy's inviting free kick into the back of the net just before the half-hour mark. In the second half, Bournemouth were guilty of giving the ball away carelessly in midfield to Mooy. The Australian powered forward, before crossing for Mounie to shoot at goal, with Steve Cook deflecting the forward's effort past Asmir Begovic. Team news Jonathan Hogg and Christopher Schindler were fit to start, but striker Laurent Depoitre was out as boss David Wagner made four changes from their FA Cup fourth-round replay win over Birmingham. Steve Cook featured, despite picking up a a hamstring injury last week, as manager Eddie Howe stuck with the same team that beat Stoke City 2-1 at home last Saturday. The scoring was complete in the fifth minute of injury time when the impressive Pritchard's dribble was ended by Dan Gosling's clumsy challenge in the box, with Van La Parra keeping his cool from the spot to hand Huddersfield a first league win in nine games. Opta stats Huddersfield scored more goals against Bournemouth (4) as they managed in their previous eight Premier League games combined (3) Bournemouth are the seventh team Huddersfield have beaten in all four tiers of English league football, along with Bradford, Brentford, Bury, Grimsby, Portsmouth and Watford Pritchard has been involved in three goals in three league games against Bournemouth (2 goals, 1 assist) All three of Junior Stanislas' goals in the Premier League this season have come away from home, while he's also netted in consecutive away games in the competition for the first time Ryan Fraser has been involved in five goals in his last six Premier League games (three goals, two assists), as many as in previous 30 matches Bournemouth defender Steve Cook (left) clashes with Huddersfield winger Rajiv van La Parra Managers David Wagner: \"It was a huge win for all of us. We said before the game that this is massive for us and that after Old Trafford we had the difficult fixtures behind us. \"Now it's time to build up momentum against opponents which are in front of us, against whom we are more competitive. \"But it's one thing to speak about it and another thing - and this shows character - to do it and the players have done that.\" Alex Pritchard celebrates after scoring his first-ever Premier League goal for Huddersfield Eddie Howe: \"I apologise to them for the performance. There's not much else I can say. \"When you're aware of the financial and time sacrifices that people make, you want to reward them with an inspiring performance, one that they can go away and talk about for many years. I don't think that will be happening after that. \"I knew that Huddersfield would have wanted to get the crowd involved in the game today very early. \"Unfortunately for us, we allowed that to happen by conceding early. We fought back very well, but after that, we just faded away. It wasn't great from us. We had no control.\" Man of the Match - Steve Mounie The 23-year-old was a real handful all afternoon long, with the Bournemouth defence unable to cope with the powerful forward. Mounie set up Pritchard for the opener, before putting his side back in front with an excellent header.

Matt Ritchie scored the winner after 65 minutes - his first Premier League goal of the season - after Dwight Gayle's clever lay-off found him in plenty of space to slot past David de Gea. Anthony Martial had Man Utd's best chances but he was denied by debutant goalkeeper Martin Dubravka in the first half and then saw two shots blocked on the line in quick succession in the 77th minute. Alexis Sanchez also saw an effort blocked after taking the ball past Dubravka.

Defeat also leaves Man Utd embroiled in the battle for the top four, with only a six-point lead over fifth-placed Chelsea, who play West Brom on Monday Night Football. Mourinho has still never won a Premier League match at St James’ Park (P7 W0 D3 L4) and has managed more away league games at Newcastle without winning than at any other club in his managerial career Newcastle made a positive start as Jonjo Shelvey's strike was pushed away by David de Gea and Ayoze Perez shot narrowly wide. But the visitors soon settled and Dubravka had to tip an effort from Jesse Lingard around the post before denying Martial when he was through on goal. That was to be the best opening of the first half, with Martial also heading wide from a cross and Newcastle seeing strong penalty appeals waved away when Chris Smalling appeared to take out Dwight Gayle on the corner of the box. Paul Pogba is challenged by Jonjo Shelvey Man Utd started strongly after the break and Sanchez spurned a chance to score the opener when he took the ball around Dubravka but didn't shoot first time, allowing Florian Lejeune to get back and block. Newcastle took the lead less than 10 minutes later. Smalling was booked for diving and, from the resulting free-kick, Lejeune headed across goal where Gayle laid off for Ritchie to fire in unmarked. Team news January signing Dubravka made his debut in goal for Newcastle while Lejeune started in place of Clark. There was no place in the squad for Slimani, who remains out with an injury. For Manchester United, Pogba, Jones, Martial and Young returned to the starting XI in place of Mata, Rojo, McTominay and Shaw. The advantage would not be relinquished despite strong Man Utd pressure, with Dubravka saving from Ashley Young and Martial seeing two shots blocked on the line after a corner fell to him six yards out. There was to be one final chance with almost the last kick of the match but Dubravka capped a fine debut by reacting sharply to tip away Michael Carrick's shot. Opta stats Jose Mourinho has now lost six times against Rafa Benitez in all competitions, only against Pep Guardiola (9) has he suffered more defeats as a manager. Newcastle enjoyed their first win in nine Premier League home games (D3 L5), since beating Crystal Palace in October. Manchester United have lost five games in the Premier League this season, equalling their tally for the whole of last season. Matt Ritchie ended a run of 43 shots this season without scoring in the Premier League, which was the longest such run in the division. Man Utd have won only one of the nine Premier League matches this season after conceding the opening goal of the game (D3 L5), courtesy of a 4-1 win v Newcastle in November. Manchester United have had three players booked for dives in the Premier League this season (Valencia, Herrera, Smalling), a joint high along with Bournemouth. The managers Rafa Benitez: \"When you play a top side like Manchester United you know every ball is important because if you make a mistake they will punish you. You have to work like they did today, it was an amazing effort.\" Rafa Benitez was delighted with his side’s work rate Rafa Benitez was delighted with his side’s work rate Jose Mourinho: \"They [Newcastle] fought like animals, that's a good word in football, and I hope they understand it as a compliment. They have everything they had and then the gods of football were with them. But they fought like animals to have luck on their side...They must have the best feeling of all, sometimes a better feeling than when you play fantastically well and you are better than the opponent.\" Jose Mourinho was full of praise for Newcastle’s spirited display Jose Mourinho was full of praise for Newcastle’s spirited display Man of the match - Jonjo Shelvey Dubravka produced a superb display on his debut, looking assured in his handling and making several key saves. But Shelvey takes the honours for a fantastic all-round performance. He was composed on the ball, picked out a number of good passes and also defended well. He made more passes (54) than any other Newcastle player, more tackles (four) and had more touches (84). It was Shelvey's fifth win in his last seven appearances against Manchester United and he played a crucial part in securing the result. What's next? Newcastle are not in action again until Saturday, February 24 when they go to Bournemouth in the Premier League.

goals for each other as Liverpool won 2-0 on Virgil van Dijk's return to Southampton. Salah laid on the opener for Firmino inside six minutes and the Brazilian returned the favour with a sublime back-heel as the Egyptian notched his 22nd Premier League goal of the season just before half-time. Southampton had their chances to leave a blemish on the latest chapter of Van Dijk's career, but he tasted victory for in the league for the first time following his £75m January move to Anfield to leave the Saints in the bottom three after one win in an alarming 14-game run. Liverpool, meanwhile, are looking up rather than down with Jurgen Klopp's 50th win as Reds boss moving them to within two points of second-placed Manchester United following their defeat at Newcastle. Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (6), Cedric (5), Stephens (6), Hoedt (5), Bertrand (6), Lemina (6), Romeu (5), Hojbjerg (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Tadic (5), Carrillo (6).

Subs: Lovren (n/a), Milner (6), Lallana (5). Man of the Match: Mohamed Salah. Klopp predicted a hostile reception for Van Dijk and that proved correct as the defender's every touch was vehemently booed by the home faithful, including a clearance which led to Liverpool's opener. Centre-back Wesley Hoedt failed to deal with a long ball, allowing Salah to race in behind and square for Firmino to apply the finishing touch to a clinical counter. Roberto Firmino of Liverpool scores his sides first goal during the Premier League match between Southampton and Liver Liverpool failed to build on their early advantage though, allowing Southampton - who had the lion share of possession in the first half - to steady and create three chances. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg registered Saints' first attempt on target on 18 minutes but Loris Karius was quick off his line to thwart the midfielder's drive after he got inside Andrew Robertson. Team news Southampton made one change from the side which won 3-2 at West Brom as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg replaced Sofiane Boufal. Joel Matip and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain started for Liverpool, who were without captain Jordan Henderson as his gradual return to fitness continued. A frantic 29th minute saw January signing Guido Carrillo head a James Ward-Prowse cross straight at Karius before Dusan returned the favour for the Saints midfielder, whose header drew a fine fingertip save from the Reds stopper. Liverpool awoke from their slumber and a sensational second came three minutes before the break as Firmino dissected the Saints defence with a sublime back-heel, releasing Salah to stroke the ball beyond Alex McCarthy with a first-time finish. Mohamed Salah celebrates with Roberto Firmino As Van Dijk soaked up Saints' attempt at a second-half fight, Liverpool sat back and utilised their rapid counter attacks, although, with the damage done in the first half, no further goals were needed. Opta stats Jurgen Klopp has won 50 of his 95 Premier League games in charge (D28 L17) - the ninth fastest manager to do so in terms of games (95). Southampton have won just once in their last 14 Premier League games (D7 L6), keeping just one clean sheet in the process. Liverpool have scored more Premier League away goals in this campaign (34) than they managed in the entirety of 2016-17 (33). Mohamed Salah has been directly involved in 29 Premier League goals this season (22 goals, 7 assists), the most by a Liverpool player in their debut season for the club in the competition.

We deserved the three points, got a clean sheet and no injuries - nearly perfect.\" Jurgen Klopp says their result over Southampton – a 2-0 win at St. Mary’s – with no injuries, a clean sheet and a couple of goals was ‘nearly perfect.’ Jurgen Klopp says their result over Southampton – a 2-0 win at St. Mary’s – with no injuries, a clean sheet and a couple of goals was ‘nearly perfect.’ Man of the Match - Mohamed Salah There were certainly question marks over Salah's return to the Premier League when Liverpool splashed more than £30m on him in the summer - but as debut seasons go, they don't come much better than the Egyptian's at Anfield. Mohamed Salah was on target for Liverpool against Southampton He effortlessly dispatched Firmino's back-heel to take his goals tally for the season 29, 22 of which have come in the league. With only Harry Kane able to boast a better return, the signing of Salah looks as shrewd as any. What's next? The fifth round of the FA Cup takes centre stage next weekend, with Southampton travelling to West Brom, who eliminated Liverpool in the previous round.

Tottenham a 1-0 victory in the north London derby at Wembley. Kane's 101st Premier League goal came from a superb towering header from 10 yards after 49 minutes from Ben Davies' cross, his seventh goal in seven league games against Arsenal. Spurs had a flurry of chances to add a second as Kane headed just wide, Christian Eriksen hit the woodwork from a free-kick and both Erik Lamela and Dele Alli spurned one-on-one opportunities. Kane puts Tottenham ahead in the North London derby Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Trippier (7), Sanchez (8), Vertonghen (8), Davies (7), Dier (7), Dembele (7), Son (7), Eriksen (7), Alli (7), Kane (8). Subs: Wanyama (5), Lamela (6). Arsenal: Cech (6), Bellerin (7), Mustafi (7), Koscielny (5), Monreal (6), Elneny (5), Xhaka (6), Wilshere (5), Ozil (6), Mkhitaryan (5), Aubameyang (5). Subs: Iwobi (5), Welbeck (5), Lacazette (5). Man of the Match: Harry Kane Alexandre Lacazette missed a fine last-gasp chance for Arsenal, but the result means the Gunners have not beaten Spurs away from home in five attempts. Spurs go up to third, four points behind second-place Man Utd. During a first half lacking in opportunities, Kane came closest with a free header inside the area, nodding over Petr Cech's bar, before Spurs came out firing after the break. In front of a record Premier League attendance, Kane made amends for his earlier miss within four minutes, towering above Laurent Koscielny from Davies' left-wing cross to head superbly into the bottom left corner past Cech. Team news Arsenal made two changes from the 5-1 win over Everton; Jack Wilshere and Mohamed Elneny came in for Alex Iwobi and hat-trick hero Aaron Ramsey, who was out with a groin injury. Spurs were unchanged from their 2-2 draw at Liverpool, and named Lucas Moura on the bench for the first time since his move from PSG. Kane reacts after heading over the bar in the first half Kane came close with another header moments later, glancing wide in acres of space, before his fierce volley from 18 yards was beaten away well by Cech. Spurs were fully on top when Eriksen's free-kick from the edge hit the bar via the outstretched hand of Cech, while Arsenal created a rare opportunity at the other end as Jack Wilshere's curling effort from 20 yards forced a fine save from Hugo Lloris. Alli was put through on goal by Erik Lamela with 20 minutes remaining, but poked inches wide of goal as Cech came rushing out, and Cech then did well to block Lamela's effort while one-on-one at an acute angle. The onslaught continued as Cech beat away Kieran Trippier's half-volley at the far post, and as full-time approached, Lamela dragged an effort wide from an angle after again being found free behind a lacklustre Arsenal defence. Arsenal did have two last-gasp opportunities, but sub Lacazette first blazed over on the volley from 12 yards, before poking just wide after drifting behind the Spurs defenders. Spurs midfielder Dele Alli battles for the ball in the first half Man of the match - Harry Kane Who else? He's been the top performer in this derby several times, and Kane came up trumps once again at Wembley. His header was superb - head and shoulders above Laurent Koscielny - while Arsenal's appeals for a foul were waved away by Anthony Taylor. Kane could, and perhaps should, have a hat-trick to his name, but his all-round forward play in the second half allowed Spurs to open up their opponents with ease. The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"If we analyse the 90 minutes the team played so well. In the second half, the first 25, 30 minutes we played amazing football, created a lot of chances and we had the capacity to push them and create many more chances. It was an amazing game. Our players deserve the full credit and I would like to congratulate them. Now we must keep going.\" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino praised his team after they beat Arsenal 1-0 in the north London derby. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino praised his team after they beat Arsenal 1-0 in the north London derby. Arsene Wenger: \"This was, of course, a game we couldn't afford to lose. That makes it (the top four) difficult now, but as long as we have a mathematical chance we have to fight. There was more at stake than just a derby, I said that before the game and that's why it's so disappointing to lose a game the way we lost it.\" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says a top four finish will be much tougher after losing 1-0 to Tottenham. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says a top four finish will be much tougher after losing 1-0 to Tottenham. Opta stats Spurs have kept a clean sheet in consecutive home league games against Arsenal for the first time since September 1975. Mauricio Pochettino's side have scored in their last 15 Premier League games - the longest current run in the division. Harry Kane has now scored seven goals in his seven Premier League north London derby appearances - only Emmanuel Adebayor has scored more in the fixture (eight). Petr Cech has now gone nine Premier League games without a clean sheet, his longest run in the competition. Arsenal had one shot on target from six attempts v Tottenham, their fewest in a Premier League match since losing 4-0 at Liverpool on August 27 (no shots on target) What's next?

Crystal Palace Everton 3-1 Crystal Palace Everton scored three second-half goals to move nine points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with a 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace at Goodison Park. Gylfi Sigurdsson broke the deadlock just 45 seconds into the second half with his shot deflecting in off James Tomkins, before Oumar Niasse headed in his eighth goal of the season from Cuco Martina's cross five minutes later. Tom Davies stretched the hosts' lead (76), tapping in from Sigurdsson's cut-back, before Luka Milivojevic gave Palace late hope after slotting in from the penalty spot following a handball by Ashley Williams. Oumar Niasse celebrates scoring Everton's second at Goodison Park Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Martina (6), Coleman (6), Keane (6), Mangala (6), Gueye (8), Davies (7), Rooney (7), Walcott (7), Sigurdsson (7), Niasse (7). Subs: Kenny (6), Williams (6), Schneiderlin (n/a) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Ward (6), van Aanholt (6), Fosu-Mensah (5), Tomkins (6), Milivojevic (6), McArthur (6), Cabaye (6), Townsend (5), Sorloth (7), Benteke (6). Subs: None Man of the match: Idrissa Gueye Morgan Schneiderlin was jeered by a section of home supporters when he emerged as a late substitute, but Everton move up to ninth in the table on 34 points while Palace sit 14th, two points above the relegation places. It was Palace who first went close to breaking the deadlock after a back-pass from Eliaquim Mangala forced Jordan Pickford to misjudge and present the ball straight to Yohan Cabaye, but the Frenchman's attempt from the halfway line drifted wide of the left-hand post. Wayne Hennessey was finally forced into action after 27 minutes as Idrissa Gueye cut inside Cabaye before seeing his shot tipped around the post by the Wales stopper. Team news Everton boss Sam Allardyce made four changes to the side that were dismantled by Arsenal. Seamus Coleman, Tom Davies, Wayne Rooney and Gylfi Sigurdsson returned as Jonjoe Kenny, Ashley Williams, Morgan Schneiderlin and Yannick Bolasie dropped out. Crystal Palace handed Alexander Sorloth his first start replacing the injured Wilfried Zaha. Joel Ward came in for Martin Kelly in the one other change.. Allardyce was forced into a change before the break as Mangala - on his home debut since joining on loan from Manchester City - was forced off with a knee injury after clashing with Hennessey. Everton substituted Seamus Coleman, only recently back from a broken leg, at half-time with Allardyce confirming afterwards that he will have a scan on a suspected muscle problem on Sunday. But the home side were ahead just seconds into the restart when Niasse forced a mistake out of Tomkins before Sigurdsson stepped inside and fired a shot beyond Hennessey via the defender's outstretched leg. Tom Davies made it 3-0 with a smart close-range finish Palace had barely had enough time to regroup before they found themselves further behind as good work from the lively Davies allowed Martina to cross for the unmarked Niasse to head home. Palace came close to reducing the deficit when Christian Benteke met Cabaye's cross to head inches wide of the post with Pickford rooted to the spot, and after Hennessey saved Niasse's shot with 14 minutes remaining, Sigurdsson was on hand to set up Davies for a simple tap-in from close range. Moments after Schneiderlin had been booed onto the pitch by a minority of home supporters, Williams handled Benteke's acrobatic shot inside the box allowing Milivojevic to dispatch his consolation penalty past Pickford. The managers Sam Allardyce: \"We've been like that at home most of the time that I've been here. It's eight home games since I've been here and we've picked up 17 points. \"We would've had another clean sheet but for another penalty like against Leicester when that was another penalty, so two clean sheets would've been nice but it puts the Arsenal result and performance way back in everybody's mind.\" Everton boss Sam Allardyce praised his side's home form after victory against Crystal Palace but admits his team must improve on the road. Everton boss Sam Allardyce praised his side's home form after victory against Crystal Palace but admits his team must improve on the road. Roy Hodgson: \"It's very frustrating because when we came in [at half-time] we were happy with how we'd played in the first half. We had managed to keep Everton at bay, and we'd created one or two chances of our own. \"To go down to a deflected goal right at the start of the second-half was very disappointing and very frustrating. But I thought that even at 2-0 we came back and started to play some good football and weren't totally out of it until the third goal.\" Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson was happy with his side's first half performance but says they were punished for their mistakes after the break in defeat to Everton. Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson was happy with his side's first half performance but says they were punished for their mistakes after the break in defeat to Everton. Opta stats Everton are unbeaten in their last seven Premier League games against Crystal Palace (W3 D4), although this was their first win against them at Goodison Park since April 2005. No team have won more penalties than Crystal Palace this season (7), with Luka Milivojevic scoring more goals from the spot than any other player in this campaign (5). Gylfi Sigurdsson has been involved in seven goals in his last six Premier League starts against Crystal Palace - he has scored three and assisted four goals. Tom Davies scored his first goal for Everton since 9th April 2017 against Leicester, 307 days ago. Since his debut in January 2012, Gylfi Sigurdsson has scored 17 goals from outside the box; more than any other current Premier League player. Oumar Niasse has both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time in his career. Man of the match: Idrissa Gueye Wayne Rooney rarely conceded possession in a deep role while Theo Walcott's directness caused Palace countless problems but the pair - along with Tom Davies and Gylfi Sigurdsson - were allowed to run freely because of Gueye's discipline and fight.

Jose Izquierdo made the breakthrough just past the half-hour mark after one of the strikes of the season - his second in a week - and now been directly involved in four of Brighton's last seven league goals. Xherdan Shaqiri brought Stoke level with a curling effort midway through the second half, the hosts' first effort on goal in the match, before Charlie Adam saw his late spot kick kept out by Ryan. As a result, Stoke stay in the drop zone - albeit on goal difference - while Brighton remain three points from safety. Player ratings Stoke: Butland (6), Bauer (6), Zouma (6), Shawcross (6), Pieters (6), Allen (6), Fletcher (6), Ndiaye (8), Shaqiri (7), Choupo-Moting (6), Diouf (6) Subs: Adam (7), Berahino (5), Jese (7) Brighton: Ryan (8), Bong (6), Dunk (8), Duffy (8), Schelotto (6), Stephens (8), Propper (8), Gross (7), March (6), Izquierdo (9), Murray (8) Subs: Kayal (6), Knockaert (7), Ulloa (6) Man of the match: Jose Izquierdo Izquierdo almost gave the visitors the perfect start after just two minutes, only for Jack Butland to deny the winger by turning his curling effort over the bar with a brilliant stop. However, the Colombia international was not to be denied and opened the scoring for Brighton after 32 minutes following a wonderful team goal. Solly March is chased down by Badou Ndiaye (right) at the bet365 Izquierdo picked up possession on the left flank before exchanging passes with Solly March and driving forward. The wide man then played another neat one-two with Dale Stephens, before cutting inside and placing the ball past Butland. Stoke boss Paul Lambert brought on forwards Saido Berahino and Jese Rodriguez in the second half in a bid to bring more invention to his team's attack, and the move paid dividends for the Scot. Team news Darren Fletcher returned in midfield for Stoke, as did Mame Biram Diouf in attack and Jese was also back on the subs' bench for the first time this year. Meanwhile, Solly March replaced Anthony Knockaert in midfield for Brighton, but club-record signing Jurgen Locadia had to settle for a place on the bench. The hosts equalised after 68 minutes when Brighton backed off Shaqiri on the edge of the area as the Swiss placed a low shot into the bottom left-hand corner of the goal, the first time he has scored in back-to-back league contests. In the final minute, though, Stoke had a great chance to claim all three points after referee Robert Madley decided Dale Stephens had pulled back Jese in the box. However, after an irate Jese was not given penalty responsibilities, Ryan then dived full length to his right to keep out Adam's well-struck spot kick. Stoke City's Xherdan Shaqiri (left) is congratulated after equalising The midfielder almost tucked home the rebound too, but Lewis Dunk made a miraculous goal-saving tackle on the line, before Anthony Knockaert was on hand to brilliantly head Mame Biram Diouf's injury-time header off the line again in a breathless finale. Opta stats Stoke are unbeaten in their last 17 home games against Brighton in all competitions (W9 D8 L0), since losing 1-0 in a second tier match in September 1961 Brighton are unbeaten in three successive league games for the first time since November (W1 D2).

I know that is the answer nearly everybody says, but I have not had a chance to look at it. \"Before that, there might have been one or two little ones that might have gone our way, but that one I would have to see again. \"Nobody likes to see that (players fighting over who to take a penalty). Charlie scored the last one against Coventry and he felt confident he was going to score. So I am a great believer that if you feel confident, step up and hit it.\" Stoke boss Paul Lambert was delighted with his side's second half performance after changing the system at half-time in a 1-1 draw with Brighton. Stoke boss Paul Lambert was delighted with his side's second half performance after changing the system at half-time in a 1-1 draw with Brighton. Chris Hughton: \"At the time I thought it was soft, but I was not sure and presumed I would come in here and see something different. I still think it is incredibly soft, there are two players grappling each other and if anything Dale is almost pushing him off him. \"The lad goes down very, very easily and probably we feel a little bit of justice done with the save, which was a super save. And of course Lewis Dunk with some brilliant defending from that.\" Brighton boss Chris Hughton believes his side had the better of the chances in their draw with Stoke and thought the penalty awarded to the hosts was soft.

It is just a simple tap-in, but he forgets there are people behind him.

Man of the Match - Jose Izquierdo Brighton's wide man was a joy to watch all afternoon, almost giving his side an early lead with a delightful curler that extended Butland to the full, before deservedly putting the visitors ahead. There appeared little danger when the 25-year-old picked up possession near the left flank. However, in the blink of an eye, the ball was in the back of Stoke's net after a fantastic goal involving two majestic one-twos - with the winger finishing off the move with a composed finish.

Burnley Swansea continued their rapid improvement under Carlos Carvalhal as Ki Sung-Yueng's late goal secured a 1-0 victory over Burnley at the Liberty Stadium to move them two points clear of the relegation zone. The South Korean struck with nine minutes remaining following a mazy run from Tom Carroll as Swansea won for the fourth time in the Premier League under Carvalhal. Burnley had had the better chances, but Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes failed to capitalise on good openings as Sean Dyche's side, now without a win in ten, continued to flounder in front of goal. Burnley stay seventh as a revived Swansea make it 14 points from seven games since Carvalhal's appointment and moved up to 15th. Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (7), Ki Sung-Yueng (8), van der Hoorn (6), Mawson (7), Dyer (7), Carroll (8), Olsson (7), Clucas (7), Jordan Ayew (7), Naughton (7), Fernandez (6) Subs: Abraham (7), King (6), Ayew (7) Burnley: Pope (7), Lowton (7), Taylor (7), Cork (7), Mee (5), Vokes (6), Barnes (7), Hendrick (5), Gudmundsson (5), Lennon (7), Long (7) Subs: NKoudou (6), Afrield (7), Wells (7) Man of the match: Ki Sung-Yueng Both sides took time to adapt to the wet pitch in south Wales, with plenty of balls skipping off the turf in a first half that lacked precision. In the 11th minute, Vokes chested the ball down and shot wide on the turn from 20 yards following a knock-down from Barnes, and Barnes went close himself minutes later when he lobbed over Lukas Fabianksi's bar from the edge of the box. Aaron Lennon challenges for the ball Burnley were carrying the greater first-half threat, and Aaron Lennon tested Swans full-back Martin Olsson with some clever footwork on 30 minutes and stood the ball up for Johann Gudmundsson at the far post, but the Icelander struck his effort over the bar when he had time to bring it under control. Sam Clucas had the hosts' clearest chance of the half when he received Ki's ball into feet and turned Kevin Long, but the strike from the Swans midfielder was waved over the bar by Nick Pope. Team news Andre Ayew began on the bench for Swansea after re-signing from West Ham, with Carols Carvalhal bringing back a clutch of first-team regulars after the midweek FA Cup win against Notts County. Burnley were still without James Tarkowski as they looked to end their winless run, with Ashley Barnes and Sam Vokes partnering each other up-front. Barnes had Fabianksi scrambling when he drove a low shot wide of the post early in the second half, and the Polish goalkeeper showed strong wrists to beat away Gudmundsson's driven effort minutes later as the visitors stretched their hosts. But it was Swansea who finally made the breakthrough, Carroll dancing across the Burnley box and his lay-off was left by Jordan Ayew for Ki who stole in and struck low past Pope. Jordan Ayew challenges for the ball Opta stats Burnley's winless run in the Premier League now stands at 10 games - the longest current streak in the division (D5 L5). Swansea have won all three of their Premier League home games against Burnley; the only side they've faced more than once at the Liberty Stadium and have a 100 per cent record against in the competition. Only Tottenham (15) have won more Premier League points than Swansea (14) since Carlos Carvalhal took charge of the Swans. Ki Sung-Yueng scored his first Premier League goal since May 2016 at West Ham, ending a run of 37 games without one in the competition. As well as no player having more shots for the Welsh side (3), Ki Sung-Yueng also created the most goalscoring opportunities for his Swansea teammates in this match (3). Swansea have won their last three home games in the Premier League, after winning just two of their opening 11 this season. The managers Carlos Carvalhal: \"When we arrived we were in the deep ocean. It was very deep and dark. We saw no fishes. We won some games, to put our noses out of the water. It was the first time we'd smelled the fresh air. \"Now, in this moment, we have started swimming and we can now go to the coast. But we must continue to swim to reach the coastline.\" Carlos Carvalhal Sean Dyche: \"I think it's just beginning to catch up with us. Not through all of this run, there's been some very good performances, but it's just caught up with us a bit. It's important in these next couple of weeks, then hopefully we'll get some bodies back. \"It was a tight one [today]. Not a great game but I don't think either team was worried about that. It's about points on the board. Another week where there's not a lot in the game, we had a few chances without being clinical.\" The pundit Phil Thompson: \"They [Swansea] just had Jordan Ayew who was the point man. But Sam Clucas didn't really get close to him, nor Ki. And it was playing out like that. I think we had two shots on target. \"It's an incredible turnaround. They were absolutely cut adrift Swansea, and then you go nine games unbeaten. 14 points from seven league games. And we'll continue with these glorious press conferences [from Carvalhal]. They've been absolutely terrific. \"The goal comes in the 82nd minute and Ki, in the D, he literally pushes Ayew out the way and Nick Pope can't even see it. He drills it right into the corner. Swansea just about deserved it.\" Man of the Match - Ki Sung-Yueng Capped a fine performance in the centre of midfield with the goal that could be so valuable in Swansea's bid to avoid the drop. Took care of the ball when many of those around him were outfoxed by the slippery surface and stood up well when Burnley looked to hit the hosts on the counter-attack. What's next?

2-0 Watford Marko Arnautovic scored on his return from injury as West Ham boosted their survival hopes with a 2-0 win over Watford on Saturday. Javier Hernandez gave the Hammers the lead at the London Stadium when he headed home in the 38th minute. Arnautovic, who was the Hammers' standout player in his first appearance since January 20, then made sure of victory when he finished from close range in the 78th minute. Player ratings West Ham: Adrian (6), Cresswell (7), Collins (7), Ogbonna (6), Zabaleta (6), Noble (7), Joao Mario (7), Kouyate (6), Antonio (7), Arnautovic (8), Hernandez (7) Subs: Byram (5), Rice (5), Hugill (5) Watford: Karnezis (5), Janmaat (5), Prodl (5), Mariappa (5), Zeegelaar (5), Holebas (5), Capoue (5), Doucoure (5), Richarlison (5), Deulofeu (5), Deeney (5) Subs: Pereyra (5), Lukebakio (5), Gray (5) Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic Watford were looking to build on their 4-1 win over Chelsea on Monday, but rarely threatened as they slipped to their eighth defeat in their last 12 matches. The result sees West Ham - for whom new signing Patrice Evra was an unused substitute - move alongside Watford in the Premier League table on 30 points, with both sides five points above the relegation zone. It also provides a timely boost for David Moyes, who lost his first game in charge of the Hammers 2-0 at Watford and whose future at the club was the subject of speculation during the week. Cheikhou Kouyate challenges Abdoulaye Doucoure for possession Watford were the first to threaten as Adrian kept out a header from Adrian Mariappa in the eighth minute, before Joao Mario saw a shot saved at the other end after some slick footwork from Arnautovic. West Ham improved as the first half wore on and went close as Hernandez had a goal ruled out for offside and then Arnautovic missed a clear opening from eight yards out when he shot at Orestis Karnezis. The breakthrough arrived in the 38th minute when Antonio skipped past Daryl Janmaat on the left and crossed for Hernandez to head in from 10 yards out. Javier Hernandez celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game Watford pressed more in the second half but failed to create any clear chances. Adrian was only called into action to palm clear a free-kick from Deulofeu, while Hernandez spurned chances to score West Ham's second as he over-ran the ball in the box and then saw a shot tipped away by Karnezis. Arnautovic eventually made sure of victory for the Hammers in the 78th minute as he finished from close range after Jose Holebas' attempted clearance rebounded into the six-yard area. Team news West Ham made two changes as Arnautovic returned from injury and Antonio also started. Evra was on the bench after joining in the week. Watford stuck with the same side that beat Chelsea on Monday. Opta stats West Ham have gone five games without defeat at the London Stadium in all competitions for the first time (W3 D2). Watford are winless in their last seven Premier League away games (D1 L6), failing to score on five occasions in that run. Javier Hernandez has scored in three of his last four Premier League games for West Ham (3 goals), as many as he'd scored in in his opening 17 this season (4 goals). Marko Arnautovic has had a hand in 10 goals in his last nine Premier League games for West Ham (7 goals 3 assists). The Hammers kept their first clean sheet since December (3-0 at Stoke), ending a run of eight games in which they had conceded. Chris Kamara says Watford didn’t create enough chances Chris Kamara says Watford didn’t create enough chances Man of the match - Marko Arnautovic Making his first appearance since January 20, Arnautovic wasted no time in getting back into his stride. He was West Ham's most creative player and regularly threatened with the ball at his feet, showing some clever touches and quick footwork to escape challenges. He capped off a fine individual display with a routine finish from close range. Manager reaction David Moyes on Arnautovic: \"He's getting no praise. He'll be told to keep at it, he'll keep getting pushed all the way. We are not letting him off the hook, he's got a bit to go. He only trained for three days but you can see the impact he's had, and playing as a centre-forward has freed him up a bit.\" David Moyes says the return of Marko Arnautovic has given West Ham a big boost David Moyes says the return of Marko Arnautovic has given West Ham a big boost Javi Gracia: \"We were very soft during all the match. The first half we didn't compete in the best way and they were more aggressive and dominated areas and we didn't create clear chances to score. We will try to do better next time.\" Watford manager Javi Gracia says his side struggled to compete against an aggressive West Ham Watford manager Javi Gracia says his side struggled to compete against an aggressive West Ham What's next?

5-1 Leicester Sergio Aguero's four-goal second-half haul saw Manchester City demolish Leicester City 5-1 at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League. Raheem Sterling put the hosts ahead after barely two minutes from Kevin De Bruyne's delightful cross, but their dominance counted for little once Jamie Vardy intercepted Nicolas Otamendi's wayward pass and slotted in an equaliser. The second half began just like the first when Aguero struck from close-range within three minutes and soon added another, both from De Bruyne deliveries, before sealing his hat-trick from a Kasper Schmeichel error and blasting in a late fourth off the crossbar. Man City's 16-point end-of-day lead at the top of the Premier League is the largest of any side since April 2013, while Leicester have now gone five games without a win and are only a point ahead of ninth-placed Everton. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Otamendi (6), Laporte (6), Zinchenko (6), De Bruyne (9), Gundongan (7), Fernandinho (7), B Silva (7), Aguero (9), Sterling (8). Subs: Danilo (6), Foden (N/A), Stones (N/A). Leicester: Schmeichel (4), Maguire (4), Dragovic (5), Fuchs (4), Albrighton (5), A Silva (5), James (5), Ndidi (5), Chilwell (4), Vardy (6), Diabate (5). Subs: Simpson (5), Mahrez (5), Iheanacho (5). Man of the match: Sergio Aguero The pre-match talk had been dominated by Riyad Mahrez, who was named among the substitutes by Claude Puel after ending his 10-day strike, and he was introduced after half-time to applause from both ends - but the game was long gone by then. In fact, it had barely kicked off when Leicester were undone by De Bruyne's perfect deep cross which Sterling turned home. But despite camping in the Leicester half, Man City were stung on the break when Vardy held off two despairing tackles and slotted in an equaliser. Team news Riyad Mahrez was left on the bench by Claude Puel who made two changes, bringing in Matty James and Ben Chilwell. Pep Guardiola also made two alterations from last weekend's draw at Burnley, bringing in Aymeric Laporte and Oleksandr Zinchenko. That earned the Foxes a foothold in the game, but after half-time Manchester City stepped up their level and De Bruyne side-footed an assist even better than his first to pick out Aguero in a crowded area, meaning the Argentine has now scored in seven straight home games for the first time in his Manchester City career. He and the Belgian were at it again five minutes later as De Bruyne played him in on the right, and Schmeichel got less on his driven shot than he should have. Sergio Aguero celebrates with team-mates after making it 3-1 But the goalkeeper had worse to follow when he passed straight to Aguero under no pressure in the closing stages, and with a typically composed chip he sealed his hat-trick. The hosts finished off an emphatic win as Aguero grabbed a fourth with a thunderbolt from the edge of the box, which sailed over Schmeichel and cannoned in off the crossbar. Opta stats • Both of Man City's two quickest goals in the Premier League this season have been scored by Raheem Sterling (38 seconds v Watford, 125 seconds v Leicester City). • This was the third time Aguero has scored 4+ goals in a single Premier League match, more than any other player in the competition's history. • Aguero is the fourth player to score 20+ goals in four consecutive Premier League campaigns - after Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry (five) and Harry Kane. Jamie Vardy celebrates his equaliser with Adrien Silva • Jamie Vardy is the first ever player to score against each of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd and Spurs in the same Premier League season. Man of the match - Sergio Aguero It's difficult to think that barely a year ago it looked like Aguero was never going to be a Guardiola favourite, because his display - as it has been so many times at the Etihad this season - was electric, especially after half-time. Sergio Aguero scores Manchester City's third goal Aguero may have been handed his hat-trick strike but his four-goal tally was down to his own making, with a little help from De Bruyne. He is now level with Mohamed Salah on 21 Premier League goals for the season, and only two behind top scorer Harry Kane in the running for the Golden Boot. What's next Man City now go to Basel on Tuesday in their Champions League last-16 first leg clash, while Leicester host Sheffield United on Friday evening in the FA Cup fifth round."}, {"date":

Chelsea Highlights: Watford 4-1 Chelsea Watford piled the pressure on Antonio Conte as a late flurry of goals secured a thumping 4-1 win over 10-man Chelsea on Monday Night Football. On a miserable night for the Premier League champions, the out-of-sorts Tiemoue Bakayoko was sent off after half an hour before Troy Deeney scored the opener from the penalty spot in the 42nd minute. Chelsea, who were beaten 3-0 at home by Bournemouth in their last game, looked as though they might snatch a point when Eden Hazard scored a brilliant equaliser in the 82nd minute. Player ratings Watford: Karnezis (6), Janmaat (8), Prodl (6), Mariappa (7), Zeegelaar (7), Holebas (6), Capoue (7), Richarlison (7), Doucoure (8), Deulofeu (8), Deeney (7) Subs: Gray (5),Carrillo (5), Pereyra (6) Chelsea: Courtois (4), Moses (5), Cahill (4), Luiz (4), Azplicueta (5), Zappacosta (5), Bakayoko (2), Kante (5), Pedro (4), Willian (4), Hazard (6) Subs: Fabregas (5), Giroud (5) Man of the match: Gerard Deulofeu But Watford scored three times in seven minutes through Daryl Janmaat, Gerard Deulofeu and Roberto Pereyra to secure victory for new head coach Javi Gracia on his home debut. While it was a perfect result for Gracia, it is likely to raise even more questions about Conte's future and how much longer he will remain in charge of Chelsea. The visitors were under pressure from the start, with Abdoulaye Doucoure dragging a shot wide, Deulofeu shooting into the side-netting and Deeney missing a glorious chance from a corner when he sliced off target. Willian spurned a good opening at the other end when he fired over from close range, but Chelsea otherwise rarely threatened. Tiemoue Bakayoko was sent off after 30 minutes They also lost possession too often, with the main culprit being Bakayoko, who was shown two yellow cards in five minutes and dismissed on the half-hour mark after catching Richarlison. The first half got worse for Chelsea when Courtois came sliding out and caught Deulofeu in the box. Deeney stepped up and dispatched the penalty with the goalkeeper staying in the middle of the goal. Watford went close to extending their lead in the second half as Deulofeu and Richarlison both shot narrowly wide. Team news Janmaat and Zeegelaar replaced Kabasele and Cleverley for Watford, with Deadline Day signings Ndong and Lukebakio on the bench. For Chelsea, Luiz started his first Premier League game since October and Zappacosta also came into the defence as Alonso and Christensen missed out. Willian replaced Barkley.Willian comes in for Barkley and January signings Giroud and Emerson are named as substitutes. Chelsea did improve after the introduction of Olivier Giroud and it looked like they might grab a point when Hazard fired in a fantastic shot from 25 yards. But parity did not last long as Watford responded in stunning fashion. Janmaat made it 2-1 in the 85th minute when he played a one-two, danced away from a couple of tackles and finished into the bottom corner. Deulofeu then fired in from Doucoure's through ball before Pereyra fired home in injury-time to round off a thumping win. Daryl Janmaat (L) celebrates scoring Watford's second goal Opta stats Chelsea have now lost more league games this season (6) than they did in the entire 2016-17 campaign (5). The Blues have lost consecutive Premier League games by a 3+ goal margin for the first time since October 1995 (1-4 vs Man Utd, 0-3 vs Blackburn). All three of Troy Deeney's Premier League goals this season have been penalties against 'big six' sides (Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea). Three players have now received red cards for fouls on Richarlison this season (Davinson Sanchez, Jonathan Hogg and Tiemoue Bakayoko), more than any other player in the division. Chelsea have been shown seven red cards in all competitions this season, two more than any other Premier League side (Watford 5). 0:39 Richarlison in tears? Richarlison in tears?

Milivojevic's second-half penalty saw Crystal Palace come from behind to earn a 1-1 draw with Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday. The Serbian made no mistake from the spot after Christian Benteke had been fouled by Ciaran Clark on 55 minutes to cancel out Mohamed Diame's 22nd-minute opener for the visitors. The result leaves both teams in the relegation scrap, as Newcastle remain 16th and one point above the drop zone, while Palace are two points and two places ahead of them in 14th. Newcastle opened the scoring from a poorly-defended corner when Kenedy's low cross from the right bounced once in the six-yard box into the path of Diame, completely unmarked at the back post, and he prodded the ball into an unguarded net. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (8), Fosu-Mensah (8), Kelly (6), Tomkins (6), Van Aanholt (8), Townsend (6), Milivojevic (7), Cabaye (7), McArthur (7), Zaha (7), Benteke (6). Subs: Sakho (6) Newcastle: Darlow (7), Yedlin (7), Lascelles (6), Clark (6), Dummett (6), Shelvey (6), Diame (7), Ritchie (6), Kenedy (7), Gayle (6), Perez (7). Subs: Atsu (6), Hayden (6), Merino (6) Man of the match: Patrick van Aanholt Wilfried Zaha and Benteke had earlier wasted one-on-one opportunities and Zaha had a further effort blocked by DeAndre Yedlin before Wayne Hennessey produced a brilliant double save at the other end, denying first Kenedy and then Ayoze Perez. As the first half drew to a close, Benteke was too slow to react when Zaha's deflected shot was pushed into his path by Karl Darlow and Palace were frustrated again when Yohan Cabaye's half-volley lacked power and was held by the Newcastle goalkeeper. However, they were presented with a route back into the game 10 minutes into the second half when Zaha crossed and Clark tugged Benteke's shirt in the six-yard box. Team news New signing Islam Slimani was unavailable for Newcastle with a thigh injury, but fellow Deadline Day arrival Martin Dubravka was on the bench. Crystal Palace made one change as Yohan Cabaye replaced the injured Bakary Sako. Alexander Sorloth was among the substitutes. Referee Andre Marriner pointed to the spot and Milivojevic converted the penalty, squeezing the ball home, despite Darlow diving the right way and getting a firm hand to it. The goal ignited the home team, but they missed a succession of chances as Benteke headed over, Andros Townsend skied a good opportunity and James McArthur failed to test Darlow with a left-footed effort from the edge of the area. Benteke thought he had won it in the 88th minute when his header beat Darlow, but Clark made a last-ditch clearance on the line while Jonjo Shelvey was perhaps fortunate not to concede a second penalty when he tugged the shirt of McArthur as Newcastle held on to their point. Rafa Benitez felt his side should have held a bigger lead at half time, but concedes a draw was an decent result. Rafa Benitez felt his side should have held a bigger lead at half time, but concedes a draw was an decent result. Opta stats Crystal Palace have lost just once in their last 10 home Premier League games (W4 D5). Only Andy Johnson (11) has scored more Premier League penalties for Crystal Palace than Milivojevic (6). Palace have conceded the opening goal of the game in 17 different Premier League games this season, no team has conceded the first goal more often. Seven of Newcastle's 24 Premier League goals this season have been scored via corners (29%), the highest percentage in the division. Christian Benteke remains goalless in 11 home Premier League games this season despite attempting 25 shots at Selhurst Park, the most of any player without a home Premier League goal this season. Only Everton (7) have taken more penalties in the Premier League this season than Palace (6), and no side have conceded more penalties than Newcastle (5). The managers Roy Hodgson (Crystal Palace): \"With the way we played in the first half and coming in at half time 1-0 down, I certainly would have taken it [a draw]. After watching the second half and how we dominated as we did, creating more chances and taking the game to Newcastle for the whole 45 minutes, I feel like the team is a little bit unlucky not to have got all three points in the end, certainly the second half performance merited that.\" Roy Hodgson says his side were unlucky not to beat Newcastle after missing several big opportunities. Roy Hodgson says his side were unlucky not to beat Newcastle after missing several big opportunities. Rafael Benitez (Newcastle): \"Scoring the second goal could change everything. We didn't do it and we conceded what I would say is a soft penalty because he was pushing my player and my player was pulling. That changed everything because obviously they had more confidence and they were pushing and we know they have very good players up front.\" Man of the Match - Patrick van Aanholt Crystal Palace dominated the second half and can count themselves unlucky not to have taken all three points after coming from behind. Their main threat came from wide areas and the two full-backs - Timothy Fosu Mensah and Van Aanholt - were both outstanding as they provided a constant supply line to targetman Benteke. We've given the nod to Van Aanholt for producing the best pass of the match in the ninth minute, putting Benteke through and forcing a fine save from Darlow. What's next? Palace travel to Everton in the Premier League next Saturday, while Newcastle have another date in front of the Sky Sports cameras as they host Manchester United on next week's Super Sunday."},

the thrilling 2-2 draw between Liverpool and Tottenham at Anfield Watch highlights of the thrilling 2-2 draw between Liverpool and Tottenham at Anfield Harry Kane scored an injury-time penalty after missing an earlier one for Tottenham to salvage a 2-2 draw in an extraordinary clash with Liverpool at Anfield on Super Sunday. Liverpool were leading 1-0 with 12 minutes left after Mohamed Salah's opener but Victor Wanyama thumped Spurs level before Kane won a penalty on 85 minutes. However, the England international spurned the opportunity and Salah sensationally put Liverpool in front in injury time with an exquisite solo effort. That looked the end of the drama but Spurs won a second penalty with their final attack when the linesman overruled referee Jon Moss for a Virgil van Dijk challenge on Erik Lamela. In front of a disgruntled home crowd, Kane made no mistake to become the player to reach 100 Premier League goals in the second-shortest time. Player Ratings Liverpool: Karius (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Van Dijk (6), Lovren (6), Robertson (7), Can (7), Henderson (7), Milner (7), Firmino (7), Salah (9), Mane (7) Subs: Oxlade-Chamberlain (5), Wijnaldum (5), Matip (5) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Trippier (5), Vertonghen (6), Sanchez (4), Davies (6), Dier (5), Dembele (6), Eriksen (7), Alli (6), Son (6), Kane (7) Subs: Lamela (7), Wanyama (8) Man of the match: Mohamed Salah With just three minutes gone, Liverpool's high press forced Eric Dier into a horrendous back-pass which was seized upon by Salah, who was presented with an easy finish past Hugo Lloris from 10 yards out. Tottenham looked rocked by the early goal as Liverpool continued to play with energy through Jordan Henderson and James Milner in midfield - however, the second goal evaded them with Milner and Roberto Firmino skewing shots wide after some creative play by Trent Alexander-Arnold. After the break Spurs started to find their rhythm and ask questions of Liverpool defensively. Team news Jurgen Klopp made two changes after the win at Huddersfield, and they were both defensive. Virgil van Dijk came in for Joel Matip and Trent Alexander-Arnold replaced Joe Gomez.Spurs were unchanged following the 2-0 win against Manchester United. The atmosphere around Anfield was becoming nervy with their team dropping deeper and Klopp switched to a back five for the final 10 minutes in order to see the game out. His defensive tactic didn't reap the required effect as Spurs levelled in spectacular fashion. Eriksen's cross from the left was palmed clear by Karius into the path of Wanyama, who struck a quite breath-taking half-volley into the top corner. Victor Wanyama (centre) and team-mates celebrate his screamer The drama wasn't done there as Spurs won a penalty in the 85th minute as Kane nipped through and went down under minimal contact from Karius. The script seemed set for the England international to net his 100th Premier League goal but his penalty was straight down the middle and Karius blocked it away. Liverpool then thought they'd won it when Salah somehow twisted and turned in the box, beating two Spurs defenders, and poked a fine finish into the net. With Anfield rocking, the home fans' joy quickly turned to anger when Lamela was felled by Van Dijk inside the area. The referee originally waved away the appeals but the linesman flagged and Moss brought the play back to award the penalty. This time Kane stayed cool and quite a bonkers match ended all square. The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"The result was massively influenced by the linesman's decisions. \"I am not allowed to go in their room until half an hour after the game, do you think the first thing he comes to me and tells me he made a mistake with the first penalty because it was clearly offside? Unbelievable.\" Jurgen Klopp was unimpressed with the two penalties awarded to Tottenham, saying 'it's hard to accept the decisions'.

It's important to recognise when they are right because it's a very difficult job for them.

Opta stats Harry Kane has scored 100 goals in the Premier League in just 141 appearances - only Alan Shearer (124) reached the 100 goals in the competition in fewer games. Mauricio Pochettino's side are winless in their last 11 away games against 'top six' opponents in the Premier League (D5 L6), and have won just one of their 19 such games under the Argentine (D7 L11). Mohamed Salah has netted 21 goals in just 25 games in the Premier League; the fewest appearances of any Liverpool player to reach 20 goals in the competition. The Egyptian is just the second Liverpool player to score 20 or more goals for the club in his debut Premier League campaign, after Fernando Torres in 2007/08 (24). Man of the match: Mohamed Salah The mesmerising Egyptian took his tally for the Premier League season to 21 with two very different finishes. After being gifted the opener by a stray Dier back pass, his second was a thing of beauty. With Liverpool struggling for ideas as the game ticked into added time, he twisted between two markers with an imperious piece of skill and poked home. It reminded many - including his manager - of a certain Argentinean playing for Barcelona. At this rate, he's not too far off his level. What's next?

While pre-match talk at Turf Moor was dominated by Pep Guardiola's decision to name only six substitutes, it appeared to be business as usual for City when Danilo curled in a sublime effort after 22 minutes. However, just minutes after Raheem Sterling missed an open goal for City, Gudmundsson met Matthew Lowton's cross (82) to ensure the spoils were shared.

Bernardo Silva celebrates with Danilo after Manchester City go 1-0 up at Turf Moor Ben Mee had two chances to level for the hosts, but saw Ederson palm away his volley before sending a header narrowly wide. Pope's chest denied Sergio Aguero just before half-time, and moments after the break it was the back of Lowton which denied the Argentine a certain goal.

Man City captain Vincent Kompany, Danilo and Ilkay Gundogan replaced Aymeric Laporte, Oleksandr Zinchenko and David Silva, while Pep Guardiola named just six substitutes.

Danilo has netted two goals in the Premier League this season, equalling his best return in a single campaign in Europe's big five leagues (2 for Real Madrid in 2015/16). Burnley manager Sean Dyche heaped praise on his teams fighting spirit and mentality as they battled to a 1-1 draw at home to leaders Manchester City. Burnley manager Sean Dyche heaped praise on his teams fighting spirit and mentality as they battled to a 1-1 draw at home to leaders Manchester City. Man of the match - Johann Berg Gudmundsson Ederson impressed in goal for City with his composure and two top-quality saves, but he was powerless to prevent Gudmundsson's leveller, despite getting a hand to the effort. Gudmundsson has been involved in seven goals for Burnley this season - three more than any other player - and his most memorable contribution of the campaign could well be this equaliser against the champions-elect. The Icelandic winger backed up his goal with three key passes for the hosts, the highest passing accuracy of all Burnley players (77 per cent) and more interceptions (five) than any other player on the pitch. The Managers Sean Dyche: \"We showed a fantastic mentality. We are on a tough run at the minute and people will say no wins in nine now with that result, but I think it's fair to say that's a big and important result. As you can see there is not a lack of belief. We've still got to have quality, we've still got to have an understanding of the Premier League but the collective mentality and the spirit here is unbelievable. It's a powerful thing. We all know you've got to have enough tactical savvy and technical ability but that team connection is the final cog in what we do here. It was on show here today.\" Burnley manager Sean Dyche heaped praise on his teams fighting spirit and mentality as they battled to a 1-1 draw at home to leaders Manchester City. Burnley manager Sean Dyche heaped praise on his teams fighting spirit and mentality as they battled to a 1-1 draw at home to leaders Manchester City. Pep Guardiola on Sterling's miss: \"It is football. Next day he is going to score a goal. Raheem scored against Southampton in the 96th minute. Today he missed one chance. That can happen.\" The pundit - Gary Neville Despite the result, City were still really good. Sometimes you are that good and that dominant in a game you can become a bit bored with being that dominant. The problem was not taking that final chance which kills the game off but it's not a massive problem for City. They still played very well. Burnley kept going and stayed in the game, but City were still the dominant team and they should have won the game. They'll be disappointed but they shouldn't be too down on themselves.

Bournemouth 2-1 Stoke Bournemouth produced a second-half comeback to beat Stoke 2-1 in the Premier League, as Paul Lambert suffered his first defeat as Potters manager. Lambert had won and drawn his first two league games in charge, and his side got off to the perfect start at the Vitality Stadium as Xherdan Shaqiri headed home in the sixth minute. But Bournemouth produced two goals in eight second-half minutes to complete their victory, with Josh King (71) netting the equaliser before Lys Mousset (79) nodded home at the back post to score his first Premier League goal. Bournemouth move up into ninth place on 31 points following the win, while Stoke drop into the bottom three on goal difference after Swansea drew 1-1 with Leicester.

Subs used: Stafylidis (4), Berahinho (n/a), Diouf (n/a). Man of the match: Xherdan Shaqiri. Stoke began the game well and found the back of the net after six minutes. New signing Badou Ndiaye nabbed the assist with a superb ball into the box meeting the head of an unmarked Shaqiri, who flicked home past Asmir Begovic. Ndiaye was involved again in the 21st minute as Stoke went close to their second. Peter Crouch flicked Moriez Bauer's pass to Ndiaye, who then powered towards goal before sending his effort just past the post. Team news Bournemouth made no changes to their XI from midweek. Stoke changed three players with Badou Ndiaye making his debut alongside Peter Crouch and Geoff Cameron who also came back into the XI. Bournemouth's best chance of the first half came in the 36th minute as they were denied by some superb defending from Erik Pieters. King raced away down the left before flashing an inviting ball across the face of goal. Jordon Ibe was there to tap home at the back post, but his effort was hacked off the line by Pieters, who himself ended up in the back of the net. Bournemouth began the second half well, and forced Jack Butland into a leaping save just minutes after the restart. King raced towards the edge of the box before hammering an effort towards goal, but the England goalkeeper kept him out with a superb stop. Crouch then headed onto the top of the post as Stoke pushed for second. Joshua King celebrates scoring his side's first goal with team-mates Bournemouth got their equaliser six minutes later. Lewis Cook slid the ball into the box and, after a collision between Joe Allen and Kurt Zouma, King latched onto the loose ball before slotting home. Mousset scored the winning goal eight minutes later and also opened his account in England's top flight. A great free-kick was whipped into the box from Ibe, meeting the head of the Frenchman at the back post who nodded home past Butland. Opta stats Bournemouth have enjoyed their first-ever league double over Stoke in their 13th season meeting the Potters in league competition. The Cherries are unbeaten in seven Premier League games (W4 D3), their longest -ever run without a loss in the competition. Badou Ndiaye is the first player to register an assist on his Stoke Premier League debut since Xherdan Shaqiri in August 2015. Josh King netted his 25th Premier League goal for the Cherries, seven more than any other Bournemouth player in the competition. The managers Eddie Howe: \"It is difficult in this division when you go behind with the quality of the players you're playing against, breaking a team down, it is tough and we knew it was going to be difficult. Stoke are a very well organised team under Paul and they had a game plan and they played very well in the first half.

The fitness levels are so good in this team and I think it showed again today.\" Paul Lambert: \"I thought we were excellent, I really did. How we've lost it, I don't know. I'm obviously really disappointed with losing the game but I'm not disappointed by how we've been playing. We played a good game and the very least, we should be leaving here with a draw.\" Despite losing to Bournemouth, Stoke’s Paul Lambert was pleased by their performance and singles but new signing Badou Ndiaye for praise Despite losing to Bournemouth, Stoke’s Paul Lambert was pleased by their performance and singles but new signing Badou Ndiaye for praise The pundit Phil Thompson: \"Bournemouth are on a bit of a run, it's seven Premier League games unbeaten.

He showed plenty of passion too, although he and Lambert must be sure to keep it under some sort of control after he was booked for dissent. What's next?

boosted their Premier League survival bid by completing the double over West Ham with a 3-1 victory at the Amex Stadium. Sensational second-half goals from Jose Izquierdo (59) and Pascal Gross (75) clinched a vital three points for Chris Hughton's men after Javier Hernandez (30) cancelled out Glenn Murray's (7) opener. The result lifts Brighton up to 13th in the table, level on points and goal difference with 12th-placed West Ham, who they trail only by goals scored. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (7), Schelotto (7), Dunk (7), Duffy (7), Bong (7), Knockaert (7), Stephens (7), Propper (7), Izquierdo (8), Gross (8), Murray (8). Subs: March (6), Kayal (6), Ulloa (6). West Ham: Adrian (6), Collins (6), Ogbonna (5), Rice (5), Bryam (5), Zabaleta (5), Noble (6), Kouyate (5), Cresswell (6), Mario (5), Hernandez (6). Subs: Hugill (5), Antonio (5). Man of the Match: Jose Izquierdo. After a bruising opening few minutes, during which Gaetan Bong and Aaron Cresswell were injured in aerial duels, Brighton capped their positive start with the opening goal. Referee Roger East played a brilliant advantage after Cresswell scythed Knockaert down, and Pascal Gross released Murray who slotted his 10th goal of the season. Glenn Murray slides the ball under Adrian to make it 1-0 Having dusted himself down, Knockaert nearly doubled Brighton's lead on the quarter-hour mark but he sliced wide from Bong's cross. It took West Ham until the 25th minute to register their first attempt on goal as Sam Byram's header was scrambled off the line by Shane Duffy. Brighton's appeal for a penalty fell on deaf two minutes later despite Knockaert's goal-bound shot striking Angelo Ogbonna's arm - and, to add insult to injury, West Ham were soon level. West Ham United's Javier Hernandez celebrates scoring their equaliser at the AMEX Stadium Having started the attack, Hernandez skipped around three Brighton defenders and rifled an unstoppable drive into the top corner to haul the Hammers level on the half-hour mark. Knockaert failed to convert two chances to restore Brighton's lead before Byram headed over as the Hammers ended the half strongly. Team news Chris Hughton made one change from Brighton's 1-1 draw at Southampton as Anthony Knockaert replaced Solly March. David Moyes, meanwhile, named an unchanged side but there were spots on the bench for Deadline Day signing Jordan Hugill and Michail Antonio, who returned from an internal disciplinary. West Ham started the second period as tamely as they had the first, though, and it wasn't long until Brighton converted their dominance through Izquierdo's unstoppable drive - his third Premier League goal of the season. And there was to be no way back for the Hammers this time as Brighton added a crucial third in similarly spectacular fashion, Gross jinking inside Ogbonna to seal the victory with a rasping drive. Opta stats Brighton registered their first win in their last seven Premier League games (D3 L3), with their three-goal haul as many as they managed in their previous six top-flight games combined. West Ham have lost four Premier League games against newly-promoted sides in a single season for only the second time (twice v Brighton twice v Newcastle), after also doing so in 2006/07. Glenn Murray has netted five goals in his last seven appearances in all competitions for Brighton, as many as he managed in his previous 19 games for the Seagulls this season. Pascal Groß has been directly involved in 11 Premier League goals this season (5 goals, 6 assists), more than any other Brighton player. Javier Hernandez netted his 43rd Premier League goals, all of which have come from inside the box. Only Tim Cahill has scored more with 100% of them coming from inside the box (56). The managers Chris Hughton: \"In terms of end product, that was the most satisfying performance we've had at home this season. It was maybe as good as we've been with regards to threatening and looking like we could get more goals.\" Brighton boss Chris Hughton was full of praise for his side after their 3-1 win over West Ham in the Premier League.

Man of the Match - Jose Izquierdo On an afternoon when Brighton's attacking players proved too hot to handle for West Ham, it was the Colombia international's stunning second-half strike which will live long in the memory.

1 Swansea FT Leicester 1 - 1 Swansea Swansea City's revival under Carlos Carvalhal continued as Federico Fernandez's second-half header earned the strugglers a hard-earned 1-1 draw with Leicester City at the King Power on Saturday afternoon. Leicester, still missing Riyad Mahrez, broke the deadlock early on when Jamie Vardy scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season with one of the England international's trademark strikes. However, the Swans levelled matters eight minutes after half-time when skipper Fernandez headed home Sung-Yueng Ki's corner - just his second-ever league goal for his side. As a result, the Foxes stay eighth in the table, while the visitors move up to 17th and out of the relegation zone, albeit only on goal difference. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (6), Maguire (7), Dragovic (6), Fuchs (6), Albrighton (6), Ndidi (7), Diabate (8), Silva (7), Iheanacho (7), Vardy (7) Subs: Gray (6), James (6), Okazaki (6) Swansea: Fabianski (6), Olsson (6), van der Hoorn (6), Mawson (7), Fernandez (8), Naughton (7), Sung-yueng (7), Fer (6), Dyer (5), Clucas (7), Ayew (7) Subs: Carroll (6), Routledge (6), Bony (6) Man of the match: Federico Fernandez Despite being without Mahrez, who was still absent after handing in a transfer request in midweek, the Foxes dominated proceedings before the break. It took the home side just 17 minutes to take the lead after a well-worked goal involving Harry Maguire, who strode forward and found Kelechi Iheanacho. The forward then showed some neat feet to evade two opponents in a tight space outside the area, before releasing Vardy, who made no mistake with a trademark side-footed finish into the corner of the net. Federico Fernandez (right) celebrates after equalising at the King Power It could have been worse for the Swans at the interval, though, but for a miraculous goal-line clearance by Alfie Mawson to prevent Iheanacho from scoring, seconds after Lukasz Fabianski has also denied the impressive Fousseni Diabate with an excellent stop. Leicester did then have the ball in the net on the half-hour mark, only for Wilfred Ndidi's effort to rightly be ruled out after Diabate was judged offside earlier in the move, but only after a consultation between referee Anthony Taylor and his assistant. Leicester's players congratulate Jamie Vardy (right) after they broke the deadlock at the King Power Whatever Carvalhal said to his players at the break, however, had the desired effect with Swansea coming out a changed team in the second half, drawing level after 53 minutes. Ki swung in a left-wing corner and centre-back Fernandez rose highest to power a header past a helpless Kasper Schmeichel for the Argentine's first goal in two years. Team news Leicester were without Riyad Mahrez, who handed in a transfer request earlier in the week, with Fousseni Diabate replacing the Algerian on his league debut. However, captain Wes Morgan was still out with a hamstring problem Meanwhile, Swansea's deadline-day signing Andre Ayew was absent with a hamstring injury. The Swans then held on for a point that could prove vital come the end of the season in their bid to beat the drop. Opta stats The Foxes are unbeaten in their last 14 home games against Swansea in all competitions (W10 D4), since a 2-3 defeat in October 1950 After a run of seven consecutive away defeats in the Premier League, the Swans are unbeaten in their last three on the road (W1 D2) Ki - who provided the assist for Swansea's leveller - made his 155th Premier League appearance, overtaking Park Ji-Sung as the South Korean with the most apps in the competition Swansea's equaliser came from their only shot on target in the match Leicester have lost just one of their last seven home Premier League games, winning four and drawing two 6 - No player has scored the opening goal in more Premier League games than Jamie Vardy this season (6, level with Sergio Aguero and Harry Kane). Party. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 3, 2018 The managers Claude Puel: \"It is big frustration this afternoon, Swansea defended very well. We played very well, especially in the first half, against this team that has just had good results against Liverpool and Arsenal. They had just one chance in the game.\" Carlos Carvalhal: \"One point is important because the history of Swansea at Leicester is very, very bad. We achieve one point against a strong team. My team also showed that we do not just have commitment, they have the belief they can turn things around, they are strong in this moment.\" Man of the match - Federico Fernandez Not only did the Swansea captain get his team back on level terms with a vital second-half header at the King Power, but the former Argentina international central defender also turned in a rock-solid performance at the back throughout for the visitors. What's next? Leicester travel to runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City next Saturday tea time.

Utd 2-0 Huddersfield Alexis Sanchez opened his Manchester United goalscoring account on his home debut as they beat Huddersfield 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday. After a first half lacking in chances, United went ahead 10 minutes after the break through Romelu Lukaku's 97th Premier League goal, turning home Juan Mata's fine cross (55). Sanchez then grabbed his first United goal in unconventional fashion, seeing a penalty he had originally won saved by Jonas Lossl, only to sweep the rebound into the net (68). Romelu Lukaku celebrates his goal with team-mates Alexis Sanchez and Jesse Lingard Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Valencia (6), Smalling (7), Rojo (7), Shaw (6), Matic (8), McTominay (6), Mata (8), Lingard (6), Sanchez (7), Lukaku (7) Subs: Pogba (6), Rashford (6), Martial (6) Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Hadergjonaj (5), Schindler (5), Zanka (5), Kongolo (4), Smith (6), Van La Parra (5), Billing (5), Hogg (5), Quaner (4), Depoitre (4) Subs: Mooy (5), Hefele (4), Ince (5) Man of the match: Juan Mata The result means United claw back two points on leaders Manchester City following their earlier draw at Burnley, and are now 13 points behind in second. Huddersfield, without a win in eight, are down to 19th. Paul Pogba was named on the bench after an under-par showing in the midweek defeat by Tottenham, and United struggled to break down a stubborn Huddersfield in the first half. Jesse Lingard and Sanchez stung the hands of Lossl in the Huddersfield goal, but United felt they should have had a penalty when Terence Kongolo's hefty aerial challenge on Scott McTominay went unpunished. Team news Jose Mourinho made four changes from Wednesday night's defeat at Spurs; Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw, Scott McTominay and Juan Mata came in, replacing Phil Jones, Ashley Young, Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial. Huddersfield made three changes; Tommy Smith came in for Chris Lowe, Rajiv van la Parra replaced Aaron Mooy and Collin Quaner was in for Steve Mounie. Players surround referee Stuart Attwell after the penalty appeal Sanchez was at the centre of much of United's play in the second half, seeing an effort denied by a last-ditch Tommy Smith block inside the box, before United got the opener their second-half intensity deserved. After being played in behind Smith on the left flank, Mata's first-time cross was swept past Lossl by Lukaku from 10 yards with his left foot. The goal settled United, and it was 2-0 after 68 minutes as Sanchez was brought down by sub Michael Hefele just inside the box. The Chilean stepped up, saw his spot-kick superbly saved by Lossl, but it fell back into his path to turn home with ease from seven yards. United saw out the game with ease, with David de Gea not required to make a save for the entire game. Manchester United paid tribute to the victims of the Munich air disaster 60 years on Manchester United paid tribute to the victims of the Munich air disaster 60 years on The managers Jose Mourinho: [On Old Trafford atmosphere] \"It's not Portsmouth. I remember Portsmouth - such a small stadium, the atmosphere was absolutely incredible. In here, the atmosphere is a bit quiet and there is not very (much enthusiasm). But the players like to play at home.\" David Wagner: \"They have shown character today, and we have difficult games which we have played now, and now have opponents in front of us where we have the chance to take some points. If we show the same commitment we have shown today we will get the opportunities to gain some points.\" The pundit Matt Le Tissier: \"United were by far the better team. Huddersfield didn't have a shot on goal as far as I can remember. It wasn't free-flowing, attractive, zipping the ball around, one-touch football or anything. It was a little bit ground out but they did the job. \"But they'll need to play better in their next two home games against Chelsea and Liverpool. They'll have to be a little bit more creative in the final third.\" Opta stats Huddersfield are the 20th consecutive team to lose their first Premier League visit to Old Trafford, since Derby County won there 3-2 in 1996/97. This was the 15th clean sheet Manchester United have kept in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. The Terriers failed to score for the 10th time in Premier League away games this season, more than any other side in the competition. Alexis Sanchez has had a hand in nine goals in his last ten Premier League games against newly-promoted sides (8 goals, 1 assist). Fans, officials and players take part in a minute silence in tribute to the Manchester United players involved in the Munich air disaster Man of the match - Juan Mata The Spaniard pulled the strings in midfield for United, providing four key passes, two more than the entire Huddersfield side. His cross for Lukaku's opener was superb, after a first half where United failed to gain any width in the final third Nemanja Matic was a close second in the man-of-the-match running, but Mata's class told at Old Trafford.

Stephens failed to clear Chris Brunt's inviting corner, and Hegazi rose highest to plant a firm header beyond Alex McCarthy for his second goal of the season. But Southampton recovered from the early set-back to come close to equalising through Dusan Tadic. Tadic pounced on a mistake by Brunt to cut inside and shoot onto the roof of the net via a deflection, before Guido Carrillo met Ryan Bertrand's low cross to force Ben Foster into a smart save around the near post. But West Brom were pegged back from the following corner as Sofiane Boufal picked out Lemina 25 yards out and the former Juventus midfielder fired a venomous shot into the top corner beyond the dive of Foster. James Ward-Prowse celebrates scoring in Southampton's win at West Brom The hosts had barely gathered themselves before Saints completed the turnaround as, from the next corner, Ward-Prowse's cross was flicked into the net by Stephens at the near post. Ward-Prowse heaped further misery on the hosts with a well-struck free-kick 10 minutes after the restart that flashed beyond Foster. Rondon then rose to meet Brunt's cross to halve the deficit and give West Brom hope. Jay Rodriguez appeared to be barged in the back by Bertrand with 10 minutes remaining but referee Michael Oliver waved away the protests.

Southampton secured their first Premier League win in 13 attempts, having previously lost five and drawn seven before today's win. Since his Premier League debut in August 2008, Chris Brunt has provided 31 assists from set plays, more than any other player. Mario Lemina, who scored his first ever Premier League goal, is the third player from Gabon to score a goal in the competition after Daniel Cousin and Didier Ndong. Ahmed Hegazi scored his first Premier League goal since netting on his debut in the competition back on the opening weekend versus Bournemouth, ending a run 24 games without one. Jack Stephens has scored in consecutive league games for the first time in his career. The managers Alan Pardew: \"It was a tough game for us. Their midfield were technically better than us. It was a good start but we couldn't build on it. \"We've conceded from two set pieces today which is not like us. We just couldn't find the energy. We were just a yard off the pace.\" West Brom boss Alan Pardew says his side were a yard off the pace after their 3-2 loss to Southampton in the Premier League. West Brom boss Alan Pardew says his side were a yard off the pace after their 3-2 loss to Southampton in the Premier League. Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It's massive for us the three points, especially for belief and confidence. Most of my players now are fit and physically ready. \"I think we showed a good level and we played with our natural strength to dominate them. But it's just one game, we still have to do a lot of things.\" Mauricio Pellegrino says Southampton’s win over West Brom is massive and will raise the confidence of the side. Mauricio Pellegrino says Southampton’s win over West Brom is massive and will raise the confidence of the side. Pundit reaction Paul Merson: \"West Brom next play Chelsea and that's the Monday night game so they could be seven points adrift. When it went 3-2, they never had another opportunity. They never got a head of steam. \"Alan Pardew will come out and say they should've had two penalties, and one of them is stonewall - Bertrand on Rodriguez. But you've got to ask questions of the performance They just weren't good enough.\" Paul Merson described West Brom as 'poor' after they threw away an early lead against Southampton to lose 3-2 at The Hawthorns Paul Merson described West Brom as 'poor' after they threw away an early lead against Southampton to lose 3-2 at The Hawthorns Man of the match: James Ward-Prowse A recent win over Brighton remains West Brom's solitary Premier League victory in their last 24 games, and the chief conspirator behind their latest downfall was Ward-Prowse. The midfielder has been Southampton's stand-out performer during a disappointing season, and he will hope to grab the attention of England manager Gareth Southgate in the coming months. Ward-Prowse has been directly involved in four goals in his last two away Premier League appearances (three goals, one assist), as many as in his previous 28 combined. His second-half free-kick proved decisive. What's next? West Brom are next in action on Monday Night Football when they take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on February 12, while Southampton host Liverpool on Super Sunday next weekend."}, {"date":

5-1 Everton Arsenal 5-1 Everton Aaron Ramsey scored a first career hat-trick and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted on his debut as Arsenal eased past Everton 5-1 at the Emirates on Saturday. Ramsey scored twice in the opening 20 minutes (6,19), either side of a headed goal from Laurent Koscielny (14). Arsenal's club-record signing Aubameyang made it 4-0 with a clever chipped finish in the 37th minute, even though he was clearly in an offside position. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (6), Bellerin (7), Koscielny (8), Mustafi (7), Monreal (7), Ramsey (9), Xhaka (7), Iwobi (7), Ozil (7), Mkhitaryan (8), Aubameyang (7) Subs: Ospina (5), Wilshere (5), Kolasinac (6) Everton: Pickford (4), Kenny (4), Mangala (3), Williams (4), Keane (3), Martina (4), Gueye (4), Schneiderlin (4), Walcott (5), Niasse (5), Bolasie (5) Subs: Tosun (5), Calvert-Lewin (6), Davies (5) Man of the match: Aaron Ramsey Everton did improve in the second half and managed to pull a goal back through substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin (64), but the hosts had the final say as Ramsey completed his hat-trick in the 74th minute, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan providing his third assist of the game. The result was the perfect response for Arsenal after their midweek defeat to Swansea, and belied comments from Sam Allardyce on Friday that the Gunners were \"defensively weak\". Instead it was Everton who struggled defensively, particularly in the first half when their back three - which included new signing Eliaquim Mangala - was regularly exposed and caught out of position. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates after scoring Arsenal's fourth Ramsey opened the scoring in the sixth minute, finishing from close range after Mkhitaryan crossed into the middle. Mkhitaryan then shot narrowly wide from 25 yards before Koscielny stooped to head in from a corner. Ramsey was given too much space to fire in a deflected shot in the 19th minute as Arsenal continued to dominate. Theo Walcott was denied a goal on his return to the Emirates by a brilliant block from Mustafi before Aubameyang was played through on goal but saw his shot saved by Jordan Pickford. Aubameyang did finish a few minutes later, cutely chipping over the goalkeeper from Mkhitaryan's pass, although he was a few yards offside. Team news January signings Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan both started for Arsenal with Lacazette dropping to the bench. Ramsey replaced Wilshere in midfield. Mangala made his debut after signing from Manchester City on Deadline Day, while Rooney, Tosun and Sigurdsson started on the bench. Nacho Monreal hit the bar from a corner before half-time and saw a shot deflected wide as Arsenal pressed for more goals. The Gunners' level did drop after the break, though, and Oumar Niasse hit the post from Walcott's excellent cross before Calvert-Lewin headed in to make it 4-1 in the 64th minute. But, even though Petr Cech was forced off with injury, Arsenal managed to have the final say as Mkhitaryan won the ball on the right side and crossed for Ramsey to sweep home and complete his hat-trick. Opta stats Arsenal v Everton is the highest scoring fixture in Premier League history (151 goals), with Arsenal's 105 against the Toffees a record for one team against another in the competition. The Gunners have beaten Everton 96 times in league competition, more than one side has ever beaten another in Football League history. Aaron Ramsey became the 20th player to score a Premier League hat-trick for Arsenal, more than any other team can boast in the competition. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang became the eighth player to score on his first Premier League appearance for Arsenal, after Steve Bould, Kevin Campbell, Freddie Ljungberg, Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri, Thomas Vermaelen and Alexandre Lacazette. All three of Henrikh Mkhitaryan's chances created for Arsenal have been converted. Indeed, he became the first Arsenal player to record three assists in a Premier League game since Santi Cazorla vs Wigan in May 2013 (4).

Overall, two players [Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan] integrated well into our game and they looked as if they had played for us forever.\" Sam Allardyce: \"None of our first XI in the first half played anywhere near their best and that is why we were tumbling goals left, right and centre with our pathetic performance. None of it was any good. We got better in the second half but far too late...all the team played crap.\" Man of the match - Aaron Ramsey Mkhitaryan came close to taking the honours after a fine all-around display, but Ramsey was the star of the show. He got the ball rolling with the opening goal and then fired in to make it 3-0. He remained involved in the midfield throughout and confidently swept in to secure his hat-trick. What's next?

a 3-0 win at Stamford Bridge to extend their unbeaten run in the Premier League to six games. Eddie Howe's men had an 11-day break between games and their freshness showed in west London as Chelsea failed to find the net on the day they signed striker Olivier Giroud from Arsenal. After a goalless first half, there was a 16-minute blitz from the visitors as Callum Wilson (51) swept home the opener before Junior Stanislas (64) poked home the second. Not long after, former Chelsea defender Nathan Ake (67) tapped home to seal the three points for Bournemouth. It moves the Cherries into the top half of the table, while Chelsea slip down into fourth place on goal difference with Liverpool leapfrogging them into third. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (5), Alonso (6), Zappacosta (6), Cahill (6), Christensen (6), Azpilicueta (6), Bakayoko (5), Kante (6), Barkley (5), Hazard (7), Pedro (6). Subs used: Rudiger (6), Fabregas (6), Hudson-Odoi (6). Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Francis (7), S Cook (7), Ake (7), Gosling (6), Daniels (6), L Cook (6), Fraser (7), Stanislas (7), Ibe (7), Wilson (8). Subs used: King (6), Pugh (n/a), Mousset (n/a). Man of the match: Callum Wilson. The opening exchanges of the first half did not see a plethora of chances, and Jordon Ibe was the first to really test either goalkeeper in the 25th minute. He swerved into space by the top left corner of the box before going for goal, but it was straight into the arms of Thibaut Courtois. Gary Cahill could have put Chelsea ahead six minutes later as he directed a corner towards goal in the six-yard box, but his header whistled over the top of the crossbar. Not long after Marcos Alonso lofted a fine cross into the box from the left flank, but Eden Hazard could not connect with his head as the ball was cleared behind by the Bournemouth defence. Team news Antonio Conte made four changes with Thibaut Courtois, Cesar Azpilicueta, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Ross Barkley coming in. Bournemouth made one change with Adam Smith replaced by Junior Stanislas. In the 39th minute Davide Zappacosta whipped in a delivery from the right corner of the box, finding Alonso in the middle but he could only direct his header wide of the post. It took just six minutes of the second half for Bournemouth to open the scoring. After a poor giveaway from Tiemoue Bakayoko, the ball fell to Wilson who played a lovely give and go with Ibe before striding into the box. He then swept home past the oncoming Courtois to put the visitors ahead. Junior Stanislas celebrates with Lewis Cook Bournemouth go 2-0 up at Stamford Bridge Wilson was involved again as Stanislas netted the second for Bournemouth in the 64th minute. The former flicked the ball into path of his team-mate, who got away down the left of the box before toe-poking the ball through the legs of Courtois. Three minutes later, and Bournemouth put themselves out of sight through a familiar Stamford Bridge face. After a corner, Wilson kept the ball alive on the left of the box before playing it to Stanislas at the top of the area. He tried to hammer home, but his effort was deflected into the path of Ake at the back post and the former Blues defender tapped home before wheeling off to celebrate. Eden Hazard vies with Nathan Ake But Chelsea should have been awarded a penalty in the 73rd minute after Ake controlled a Pedro header with his arm inside the six-yard box, but referee Lee Probert waved away the claims as Bournemouth took all three points back to the south coast. Opta stats The Blues suffered their joint-heaviest home defeat in Premier League history, with this their seventh defeat by a three-goal margin at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea have lost five games in the Premier League this term; as many as they did in the entirety of the 2017/18 campaign. Eddie Howe's side have equalled their longest unbeaten run in the Premier League, last going six unbeaten in the competition in December 2015. Only Sergio Aguero (five) has scored more Premier League goals than Callum Wilson (three) in 2018. Man of the match - Callum Wilson Callum Wilson celebrates putting Bournemouth ahead at Stamford Bridge A great performance from the Bournemouth striker, who was a constant menace for the away side and gave Andreas Christensen a real run for his money in the first half before the goals started flowing. Wilson of course scored the opener, but also had a hand in the two further goals with an assist to his name for the second, not to mention the numerous positive runs he made for his side during the game at Stamford Bridge.

"Everton 2-1 Leicester: Theo Walcott scores twice as Toffees hold on to win 2:53 Everton 2-1 Leicester Everton 2-1 Leicester Theo Walcott scored twice as Everton survived a second-half fightback from Leicester City to win 2-1 on Seamus Coleman's return to the side at Goodison Park. Sam Allardyce's men secured their first win in seven games thanks to Walcott's first goals since joining the club from Arsenal in a £20m deal earlier this month. But Jamie Vardy's 72nd-minute penalty set up a frantic finale in torrential conditions on Merseyside, with Kelechi Iheanacho striking both the post and bar before Matty James had a shot cleared off the line. The result means Everton remain in ninth place, but they close the gap to Leicester in eighth to three points. Seamus Coleman made his long-awaited return from injury at first-team level Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (8), Martina (7), Keane (7), Jagielka (7), Gueye (7), Davies (7), Sigurdsson (6), Rooney (6), Walcott (9), Niasse (6). Subs: Schneiderlin (6), Williams (6), Calvert-Lewin (6) Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Chilwell (5), Maguire (6), Amartey (5), Dragovic (5), Ndidi (6), James (6), Gray (5), Albrighton (6), Okazaki (5), Vardy (6). Subs: Fuchs (6), Iheanacho (5), Diabate (5) Man of the match: Theo Walcott After making the better start, Leicester were unfortunate not to take the lead when Marc Albrighton's short corner was headed onto the crossbar by Wilfred Ndidi. Everton came into the game in poor form, forcing Allardyce into making seven changes to his side, but the tension growing among the home supporters was released after 25 minutes. Daniel Amartey played Ben Chilwell into trouble and with the young left-back failing to clear, Gylfi Sigurdsson dispossessed him and found the unmarked Walcott to slot home beyond the out-stretched Kasper Schmeichel. Theo Walcott celebrates after scoring his first Everton goal against Leicester Team news Seamus Coleman returned to the Everton starting line-up after 10 months out with a broken leg. Coleman joined Michael Keane, Phil Jagielka, Tom Davies, Idrissa Gueye, Wayne Rooney and Oumar Niasse in returning. Jonjoe Kenny, Mason Holgate, Ashley Williams, Morgan Schneiderlin, Nikola Vlasic, James McCarthy and Cenk Tosun dropped out. Leicester manager Claude Puel made the one change to the side that beat Watford. Riyad Mahrez was replaced by Demarai Gray. Seamus Coleman, returning to the Everton side for the first time in 10 months, combined well with Walcott down the right to provide a constant outlet, and it was the former Arsenal winger who extended Everton's lead six minutes before the break. Moments after Oumar Niasse had dragged a shot wide following a dreadful attempted clearance by Amartey, Michael Keane headed Wayne Rooney's cross into the path of Walcott for a simple finish at the far post. There were very few signs of a Leicester comeback until Wayne Rooney brought down Ndidi inside the box with 18 minutes remaining, allowing Vardy to step up and blast his penalty past Jordan Pickford. Jamie Vardy pulled a goal back for Leicester in the 72nd minute Leicester ought to have completed the turnaround four minutes later as Iheanacho's flick from Albrighton's corner bounced off the crossbar before the Nigeria international hit the post on the rebound. James met Ben Chilwell's cross from the left to shoot past Pickford but Cuco Martina saved a certain goal with his last-ditched clearance as Everton escaped with all three points. Opta Stats Everton recorded their first win in the Premier League since December 18th (3-1 v Swansea), ending a run of six games without one. After going unbeaten in their first four away games under Claude Puel in the Premier League (W2 D2), Leicester haven't won any of their four games on the road since (D1 L3). Theo Walcott has been directly involved in three goals in his first two Premier League appearances for Everton (two goals and one assist); as many as he had in his previous 20 games in the competition prior to joining the Toffees. This was Walcott's first brace in the Premier League since October 2016, when he netted twice for Arsenal against Swansea in a 3-2 win. Since the start of last season, only Kevin De Bruyne (29) and Christian Eriksen (21) have more assists in the Premier League than Gylfi Sigurdsson (16). Jamie Vardy has converted nine of his 11 penalties in the Premier League, with two of those coming against Everton. The managers Sam Allardyce: \"It was a very important win for us today, and Coleman coming back is a great boost. He'll be dead on his feet tomorrow. With Arsenal coming up so quickly, he'll want to play but I'm not so sure that will be right for us. We'll have a look and see how he recovers. \"I spoke to him at half-time and told him to play with his head. If you feel yourself fatiguing, give us a wave and we can bring Jonjoe [Kenny] on. But when you see him still running forward at the end, he showed that he was right and I was wrong! Everton boss Sam Allardyce singled Theo Walcott and Seamus Coleman out for praise after their 2-1 win over Leicester in the Premier League. Everton boss Sam Allardyce singled Theo Walcott and Seamus Coleman out for praise after their 2-1 win over Leicester in the Premier League. Claude Puel: \"We made a good start with a good balance of the team and we had a good control of the game. After the first goal, we lost control and Everton put us under pressure and we didn't give a good response. \"We played well in the second half and we finished with strong quality but without reward in the end. I thought we deserved the draw, but it's a good lesson for the future.\" Claude Puel says his Leicester side lost control of their match with Everton despite improving in the second half.

Man of the match: Theo Walcott Walcott will face his former club Arsenal this weekend full of confidence after his well-taken double. The 28-year-old brought energy to the right side of Everton's front line, dovetailing superbly with the excellent Coleman in their first appearance together. Walcott was denied the match ball in the second half after his shot was cleared off the line by Harry Maguire, but his first-half contribution alone made him the game's stand-out player. What's next?

Newcastle 1-1 Burnley An unfortunate own goal from Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow allowed Burnley to earn a 1-1 draw at St James' Park in the Premier League on Wednesday. Darlow diverted the ball into his own net in the 85th minute after saving a Sam Vokes header from close range, the rebound off the bar striking him on the top of the head and across the line. It was a crushing moment for Newcastle who had taken the lead through captain Jamaal Lascelles in the 65th minute, after Joselu had a penalty saved in the first half. Team news Newcastle made eight changes from their FA Cup defeat against Chelsea. Only Karl Darlow, Jamal Lascelles and Ciaran Clark kept their places in the starting XI. Burnley mad two changes with Kevin Long coming in for James Tarkowski and Ashley Westwood replacing Steven Defour. Newcastle debutant Kenedy impressed playing from the left of midfield, looking the most likely to make something happen in the game. The Chelsea loanee almost opened the scoring for Newcastle when he cut in from the right and curled a shot from 20 yards which Nick Pope did well to tip onto the post, especially as it was deflected on its way by Kevin Long. Christian Atsu pounced on the rebound but his tame shot from eight yards was held by Pope. Jamaal Lascelles heads in the opener Kenedy was at the centre of things again when he played a one-two with Mikel Merino. The Brazilian received the ball back in the area and his drag back bamboozled Phil Bardsley who crudely took him down, with referee Simon Hooper pointing to spot. But Joselu stepped up to strike a weak penalty to Pope's left, which he palmed away. Joselu had a penalty saved Kenedy would remain in the thick of things after the break and provided the assist for Newcastle's opener, swinging in a corner for Lascelles to lose Kevin Long in the area to reach the cross at the front post and head home. Newcastle were looking comfortable until Burnley went very direct resulting in the goal, as Vokes diverted Long's header towards goal only for Darlow to be unlucky when the ricochet Player ratings Newcastle: Darlow (7), Yedlin (6), Lascelles (7), Clark (7), Dummett (6), Atsu (6), Merino (7), Diame (7), Kenedy (8), Perez (7), Joselu (6) Subs: Murphy (7), Gayle (6), Ritchie (6) Burnley: Pope (8), Bardsley (6), Long (7), Mee (7), Taylor (7), Gundmundsson (7), Arfield (6), Cork (6), Westwood (6), Hendrick (7), Barnes (7) Subs: Nkoudou (6), Vokes (6), Lennon (6).

Rafa Benitez: \"I think we created enough for winning the game and this kind of game, when you have two or three chances from the penalty and we hit the post, you have to take your chances and then you will not be defending fouls and corners and all these things. \"We have to keep going. The positives are that we created a lot of chances and we were capable to win the game and just take the chances.

It's a definitely a penalty for Jack Cork, he turns in the box and realises he's not going to get there, throws his body in the way, brings Cork down, it's a definite penalty but we just can't get one.\" Opta stats Newcastle are winless in eight Premier League games at St. James' Park (W0 D3 L5), their worst run since April 2009 (also eight without a win). Burnley haven't won any of their last 51 Premier League games when they've conceded the first goal (D10 L41). All three of Jamaal Lascelles' goals in the Premier League this season have been headers from corners. Joselu is the first Newcastle player to miss a Premier League penalty since Loic Remy on Boxing Day 2013 against Stoke. Nick Pope has faced five Premier League penalties in just 22 appearances - Joselu's effort was the first one he'd saved. Kenedy became first Brazilian to play for Newcastle in the Premier League since Claudio Caçapa in December 2008, and just the third Brazilian to appear for them in Premier League history along with Fumaca. Karl Darlow is just the second Newcastle goalkeeper to score a Premier League own-goal, after Shay Given in October 2007 against Everton. Newcastle fans displayed a Kevin Keegan quote before kick-off in protest against owner Mike Ashley Man of the Match - Kenedy The Brazilian showed the extra quality that Newcastle have missed all season. On his debut he showed guile on the ball, set up a goal and was very close to scoring himself. If Newcastle are to stay up, it looks like he will become a key man for them. What next?

Despite all of Southampton's time on the ball, they were unable to find a way past Brighton's resolute defence as both sides left with a hard-fought point.

Cedric's sliced effort was easily collected by Ryan before Ezequiel Schelotto did well on the stroke of half-time to block out James Ward-Prowse's look on goal. Mauricio Pellegrino introduced forwards Guido Carrillo and Sofiane Boufal and both had a positive influence on the match, with Boufal winning the free-kick which resulted in Southampton's equaliser in the 64th minute. Ward-Prowse's low free-kick deflected off Jose Izquierdo and into the path of Stephens, who turned the ball in to score his second goal in as many games. Southampton continued to push for goal, with Carrillo unleashing a shot from range that went narrowly over the bar and Hojbjerg having an attempt from distance that Ryan did well to clutch to his chest. Opta stats Southampton have failed to win any of their last 12 Premier League games (D7 L5) since beating Everton in November. Brighton have picked up just two points in their last seven away Premier League matches (W0 D2 L5). The Saints have lost only one of their last 28 home Premier League games against newly promoted clubs, but all three of their matches this season have ended as draws. Glenn Murray has equalled his best scoring season in the Premier League (seven goals), also scoring seven in 2014-15 for Crystal Palace. Three of Murray's seven Premier League goals this season have been scored from the penalty spot, with only Sergio Aguero and Jamie Vardy (4) scoring more penalties in the Premier League this season. Jack Stephens registered his first ever Premier League goal in his 30th appearance. Man of the Match - Sofiane Boufal Boufal came off the bench after half-time and made an immediate impact on the game. His dangerous runs caused Schelotto problems down the left flank and drew plenty of fouls, including the one which resulted in Southampton's equaliser.

Fernandinho was the unlikely scorer of City's first goal, latching onto Kevin De Bruyne's pass to put the hosts ahead in the 19th minute. De Bruyne started and finished off a move after the break (68), while Sergio Aguero added a third late on (89) for his 17th league goal of the season. City increased their gap at the top after Manchester United lost 2-0 at Tottenham, while struggling West Brom are now four points from safety.

The hosts could have had more before the break, but Foster denied De Bruyne on two occasions, while the Belgian also skimmed the bar with a long-range attempt. Fernandinho celebrates his side's opening goal with team-mate David Silva The only negative for City in the first half was the injury to David Silva, who was forced off after a challenge with Sam Field and replaced by Ilkay Gundogan. Team news Aymeric Laporte made his Manchester City debut with John Stones feeling unwell. For West Brom, Arsenal target Jonny Evans was ruled out with a hamstring injury, while new loan signing Daniel Sturridge was named on the bench. After the break, Raheem Sterling fired just wide of the top corner, prompting Pep Guardiola to urge the winger to the sidelines for a reassuring hug and kiss. Moments after Foster superbly denied Bernardo Silva, City moved two clear thanks to De Bruyne, who evaded James McClean's attempt to bring him down before latching onto Sterling's return pass. And just days after a poor tackle ruled Leroy Sane out for six weeks, Guardiola was baffled to see Matt Phillips escape with a yellow for a dangerously high challenge on Brahim Diaz. Club-record signing Aymeric Laporte (R) made his debut in defence alongside Nicolas Otamendi Daniel Sturridge almost had a debut goal for the visitors after coming off the bench late on, but Kyle Walker was on hand to deny the forward before he played a follow-up attempt into the side-netting. Aguero had the final say of the evening, taking Sterling's pass in his stride before calmly dinking the ball over Foster from a narrow angle. Opta stats Manchester City scored their 100th goal in 38 games in all competitions this season (now 101) - they've reached this figure in each of their last five campaigns, only doing so quicker in this time in 2013-14 (34 games). Man City have won their last 13 league games in a row against West Brom, their longest such run against a single opponent in their history. Indeed, this is also West Brom's longest losing streak against a single team in their league history. Kevin De Bruyne provided his 38th league assist since his Man City debut in September 2015, at least four more than any other player in Europe's big five leagues (Lionel Messi, Neymar and Mesut Ozil with 34). Man of the match - Kevin De Bruyne One goal for the brilliant Belgian, and he'll know he could have scored more, having seen three attempts saved by Foster. De Bruyne proved why he is the front-runner to take all the individual accolades this season, assisting Fernandinho, and stepping up to take control of the game in midfield after David Silva went off injured. Pep Guardiola hailed his side's performance in their win over West Brom as outstanding. Pep Guardiola hailed his side's performance in their win over West Brom as outstanding. The managers Pep Guardiola (on West Brom's tackles): \"I have an opinion. The referees have another one. So they are the bosses, they have to take a decision.

In a game of very few clear-cut chances, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fired wide midway through the first half before Richarlison failed to convert Watford debutant Gerard Deulofeu's cross just before the break. Stoke, who moved out of the relegation places, paraded new £14m signing Badou Ndiaye at half-time but the Senegal international did not bring the hosts any luck as the scrappy nature of the contest continued. Xherdan Shaqiri went closest to a winner for the hosts but his powerful strike was palmed to safety by Orestis Karnezis as both sides had to settle for a share of the spoils. Player ratings Stoke: Butland (7), Bauer (6), Zouma (7), Shawcross (7), Pieters (6), Shaqiri (7), Allen (6), Adam (6), Fletcher (5), Choupo-Moting (7), Diouf (6). Subs: Crouch (6), Berahino (n/a). Watford: Karnezis (7), Kabasele (6), Mariappa (6), Prodl (6), Holebas (6), Deulofeu (7), Doucoure (6), Capoue (7), Cleverley (6), Richarlison (7), Deeney (7). Subs: Gray (6), Carrillo (n/a), Pereyra (6). Man of the match: Gerard Deulofeu. The opening chance of the night fell to Sebastian Prodl in the second minute but Jack Butland got down well to smother the shot. Watford were unable to build on that positive start but Stoke also struggled to find any sort of rhythm and it took until the 26th minute for them to create an opening, Adrian Mariappa blocking Charlie Adam's shot before Choupo-Moting curled the rebound wide of the far post. Troy Deeney is put under pressure by Darren Fletcher At the other end, Butland had to tip Jose Holebas' corner kick against the crossbar and just before half-time Watford went close again when Deulofeu's cross was met at the near post by Richarlison, but he prodded his effort wide. After the break, Mame Biram Diouf was perhaps lucky to escape with only a yellow card after shoving Christian Kabasele off-the-ball, although replays showed the Watford defender going to ground particularly easy. Team news After making a winning start against Huddersfield 11 days ago, Stoke boss Paul Lambert picked the same starting line up. Javi Gracia made four changes after seeing Watford go out of the FA Cup at Southampton on Saturday. New signing Gerard Deulofeu made his debut while Tom Cleverley and Troy Deeney returned from injury and Sebastien Prodl was recalled. Stoke's best chance fell to Shaqiri but the Swiss star's powerful drive was kept out by Karnezis, who also saved from Crouch before Ryan Shawcross slid in to block Abdoulaye Doucoure's goal-bound effort in the 70th minute. Substitute Roberto Pereyra had one final chance to win the game late on when a loose ball fell to him 10 yards out, but Butland was alert to the danger, block at his near post to preserve the point which lifted Stoke back out of the relegation places. Opta stats At least one team has failed to score in 11 of the last 12 league meetings between these two sides (15 goals total). Stoke City have gone five games unbeaten against the Hornets in the Football League (W4 D1) for the first time since April 1995 (run of six). All six of Watford's Premier League managers have now failed to win their first game in charge of the club in the competition (D4 L2). Indeed, each of their last four such bosses, including Javi Gracia, have drawn their Premier League opener with the Hornets (also Quique Sanchez Flores, Walter Mazzarri and Marco Silva). Stoke City have picked up four points from their two Premier League games under Paul Lambert (W1 D1), as many as they had in their previous eight prior to his arrival (W1 D1 L6). Watford have failed to win any of their first four league games in a calendar year for the second consecutive year having also done so in 2017. Gerard Deulofeu made his first Premier League appearance since he lined up against his current club Watford on the 10th of December 2016 whilst at Everton, 417 days ago. Man of the Match - Gerard Deulofeu Gerard Deulofeu made his Watford debut against Stoke On a night where the defences dominated, Deulofeu showed some bright moments that will give the Watford fans some hope. The loan signing from Barcelona was involved Watford's best moments going forward, his early cross almost created the opening goal for Richarlison in the first-half , while his cut back in the second-half picked out Doucoure, but the midfielder's shot was brilliantly blocked by Shawcross. All in all it was a solid night's work for the Spaniard, who will hope to build on his performance against Chelsea next week. What's next? Both sides are back in Premier League action at the weekend with Stoke travelling to Bournemouth on Saturday, while Watford host Chelsea, live on Monday Night Football."}, {"date": "31/01/2018",

Eriksen's strike was timed at under 11 seconds - the first goal United had conceded for over 600 minutes of Premier League football - stunning the visitors, before Phil Jones put through his own net in the 28th minute to send the hosts on course for only a second win from six against top-six opposition this season.

A record Premier League attendance of 81,978 witnessed a defeat that leaves United with a mountain to climb if they are to catch rivals Manchester City at the top, with the gap now 15 points. The three points sees Spurs close the gap on Liverpool and Chelsea in third and fourth respectively to two points, ahead of Spurs' trip to Anfield on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Trippier (7), Vertonghen (7), Sanchez (9), Davies (7), Dier (7), Dembele (7), Alli (7), Eriksen (9), Son (8), Kane (7). Subs: Lamela (6), Wanyama (N/A), Sissoko (6). Away Team: De Gea (6), Jones (3), Smalling (4), Young (4), Valencia (6), Matic (4), Pogba (5), Martial (5), Lingard (6), Sanchez (5), Lukaku (5). Subs: Mata (5), Herrera (5), Fellaini (N/A). Man of the match: Christian Eriksen Wembley was still filling up as Eriksen caught United napping. Harry Kane knocked a long ball down, Heung-Min Son's effort was blocked, but Eriksen was on hand to sweep home the loose ball to leave United's defenders looking at each other in disbelief. United responded well with Jesse Lingard denied by a fine block from Hugo Lloris, before Martial fired over after showing great feet to sneak into the penalty area. For all United's attacking threat, at the back, they were carved open time and again by Spurs. Firstly, Kane, closing in on a 100th Premier League goal for Spurs, was denied by a smart David de Gea stop, before Spurs doubled their lead. Team news Alexis Sanchez made his Premier League debut for United, and my word, what an attacking side the Chile international was part of! United went with a front four of Romelu Lukaku, Jesse Lingard, Anthony Martial and Sanchez – away from home! Sanchez for Juan Mata was the only change from the side who beat Burnley in United’s last league outing. Two changes for Spurs from their draw against Southampton ten days ago, with Moussa Sissoko and Serge Aurier replaced by Kieran Trippier and Christian Eriksen. Trippier fired the low cross in the direction of Kane, Jones got their first, but couldn't adjust his feet quickly enough, diverting the ball past De Gea into his own net. That was the third own goal Spurs have benefited from in the Premier League this season - more than any other club. Again United responded well, with Martial almost immediately denied by Lloris, but they remained vulnerable at the back for the rest of the half, with Eric Dier and Kane going close to adding to the scoreline. After the break, United continued to press. Pogba lofted a fine pass over the top for Lukaku, who used his strength before being denied by a smart Lloris stop. Then came the strange turn of events, as Fellaini came on for Pogba, only to be withdrawn seven minutes later. Fellaini jogged off, without showing any obvious sign of injury, but seemed to be consoled by Mourinho as he left the pitch. Phil Jones' own goal put Tottenham 2-0 ahead Kane's quest for that record goal rumbles on, as he twice went close late on. In the end, Tottenham didn't need their talisman to find his scoring touch, with one of their best team performances of the season yielding a much-needed three points. Opta stats Eriksen's strike was his 50th in all competitions for Spurs since joining in 2013 - second only to Harry Kane at the club in that time (128). Tottenham have won three successive home league games against Manchester United for the first time since September 1966. Kane had eight shots (including blocked), two more than the entire Man Utd team. Only twice in his Premier League career has he had more shots in a game without scoring (10 vs Burnley in August and Brighton in December). Romelu Lukaku has netted just 15 goals in 63 Premier League appearances against the \"Big Six\" (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur) compared to 81 in 147 against non-big six sides. Man of the match - Christian Eriksen Christian Eriksen celebrates after making it 1-0 after 11 seconds Back to his very best, Eriksen had United's defence in the palm of his hand at Wembley, and the visitors just couldn't handle him. Eriksen put in eight crosses, two less than United managed as a team, while providing six key passes. The weight of his through balls were exquisite, and deserved to be finished off. If Kane had brought his shooting boots, Eriksen would easily have racked up three assists. What's next?

Swansea 3-1 Arsenal Petr Cech's calamitous error helped Swansea to a shock 3-1 victory over Arsenal at the Liberty Stadium. Nacho Monreal (33) continued his excellent goalscoring form, giving the Gunners the lead but Swansea, who beat Liverpool in their last league outing, hit back straight away through Sam Clucas (34) to go in level at the break. The hosts were given a helping hand on their way to all three points when Cech hit an attempted clearance straight to Ayew, and the 26-year-old had the easiest of finishes to give his side a much-deserved lead. Wenger sent on Henrikh Mkhitaryan for his debut and used Olivier Giroud from the bench, despite speculation surrounding his future, but it was Clucas who put the finishing touch on Swansea's superb night, sweeping home from close range after poor defending to send the hosts out of the relegation zone for the first time in three months Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (7), Naughton (7), Van der Hoorn (7), Fernandez (7), Mawson (8), Olsson (7), Fer (8), Ki Sung-Yeung (7), Clucas (9), Dyer (8), Ayew (8). Subs: Bony (n/a), Carroll, Routledge. Arsenal: Cech (4), Bellerin (5), Mustafi (5), Koscielny (5), Monreal (6), Elneny (5), Xhaka (4), Ramsey (5), Iwobi (4), Ozil (6), Lacazette (5). Subs: Mkhitaryan (6), Giroud (5). Man of the match: Sam Clucas In tricky conditions, Swansea made the brighter start and Alfie Mawson looked set to open the scoring in the eighth minute after meeting Nathan Dyer's cross at the far post, but Aaron Ramsey's last-gasp block got Arsenal out of jail. The Gunners needed another perfectly timed sliding tackle, this time from Mohamed Elneny, to deny Clucas, who was bearing down on goal after being played in by Leroy Fer. There were shouts for a penalty from the hosts but referee Lee Mason rightly waved away the appeals with Elneny getting a clear touch on the ball. Shkodran Mustafi and Nathan Dyer in action during the at The Liberty Stadium Arsenal struggled to get going as an attacking force but they were in front in the 33rd minute when Mesut Ozil picked out the run of Monreal at the far post, and the full-back poked the ball past Lukasz Fabianski and into the back of the net to net his fourth Premier League goal of the season. Swansea were unlucky to be behind but they struck back immediately as Mawson's through ball picked out the run of Clucas, and the midfielder swept the ball past the onrushing Cech. Team news Swansea were unchanged from their 1-0 victory over Liverpool just over a week ago. Meanwhile, Arsenal made one change from their 2-1 win over Chelsea in the League Cup with Aaron Ramsey replacing the ill Jack Wilshere. New boy Henrikh Mkhitaryan was named on the bench along with Olivier Giroud, who has been linked with a move to Chelsea. Arsenal were more assured at the start of the second half but all their improvement was undone when Cech's awful clearance went straight to Ayew, who made no mistake from close range to roll home his fifth goal in nine games. Giroud, who could be set for a move away from the Emirates on Deadline Day, and new signing Henrikh Mkhitaryan were sent on in a bid to rescue the Gunners, but Swansea should have extended their lead when Shkodran Mustafi's poor header picked out Dyer and the forward's shot struck the outside of the post from 14 yards. Henrikh Mkhitaryan takes his place on the bench ahead of the Premier League match between Swansea City and Arsenal at The Liberty Stadium Swansea did get a third as Ayew burst past Mustafi and the excellent Clucas reacted first to beat Cech at the near post to complete a brilliant night for the hosts. Opta stats Swansea have won consecutive Premier League games for the first time this season. Carvalhal is just the fifth manager to win his first two matches against Wenger's Arsenal in all competitions (also Alex Ferguson, Luis Enrique, John Gregory and Roy Evans). Arsenal have accrued 13 points from their 13 away games this season; only in 2005/06 had they won fewer points on the road at this stage of a Premier League season (12). Arsenal have lost 15 points from winning positions this season in the Premier League; only Watford have dropped more (16). Monreal has netted four goals in his 21 Premier League games this season, after managing just one in his previous five top-flight campaigns with Arsenal (134 games). Since his Premier League debut in September 2013, Ozil has registered 49 assists, five more than any other player. Ayew has been involved in more Premier League goals for Swansea than any other player this season (five goals, two assists), with all seven of his goal involvements coming in the second half. Man of the Match - Sam Clucas Sam Clucas makes it 3-1 Clucas just loves playing against Arsenal. All three of the midfielder's top-flight goals for Swansea have come against Arsenal, and have come with his only three shots on target for the Welsh side in the Premier League. It was not just his goals that caught the eye though as he produced a brilliant performance from midfield. He was a thorn in the side of the Arsenal defence all night and his work rate epitomised everything good about Swansea's performance. The pundit - Matt Le Tissier I know Arsenal had the majority of the possession but Swansea's gameplan worked to perfection. When they went 1-0 down it was a little bit harsh because Arsenal hadn't really threatened to that point. It was their first attempt on target and the key to the whole performance was how quickly Swansea got back in the game. They got the equaliser within 60 seconds and you could see the belief that it gave the stadium and the players. They stuck to their gameplan. They were fortunate to go in front because Petr Cech pretty much handed it to them on a plate, though Mustafi didn't do him too many favours with the backpass. Arsenal brought on Mkhitaryan a minute before that goal, but he didn't have any impact on the game and Arsenal didn't make Fabianski make a top-class save. It was just not good enough from Arsenal in terms of chances created. .@SwansOfficial have already won as many @premierleague games this season under Carlos Carvalhal as they did under Paul Clement (both 3).

Palace had taken the lead through Christian Benteke in the 24th minute - just the Belgium international's second league goal of the season - before Noble equalised from the penalty spot two minutes before half time. Javier Hernandez had a glorious chance to turn the match on its head in the 51st minute, but his header was too close to Wayne Hennessey in the Palace goal. With suspensions and injuries limiting manager David Moyes' options, the hosts seemed to run out of steam in the second half. Nonetheless, the result extends West Ham's unbeaten league run to six, moving them into the top half of the table, while Palace climb to 12th, three points clear of the relegation zone. Player ratings West Ham: Adrian (7), Cresswell (6), Zabaleta (6), Byram (6), Rice (7), Collins (6), Kouyate (6), Noble (6), Joao Mario (7), Ogbonna (6), Hernandez (7). Subs: Oxford (N/A). Crystal Palace: Hennessey (7), van Aanholt (6), Tomkins (6), Fosu-Mensah (6), Kelly (6), Milivojevic (6), Bakary Sako (5), McArthur (5), Townsend (7), Zaha (7), Benteke (6). Subs: Cabaye (6) Man of the match: Joao Mario Despite being forced to make so many changes to their starting line up, it was West Ham who started on the front foot, and could have been in front early on through newboy Joao Mario on his first West Ham start, but the Portugal international volleyed wide from a good position. Hernandez was then denied by a fine tackle by James Tomkins just as he was about to pull the trigger, before Palace countered to open the scoring. Andros Townsend threw the stepover on this return to the side, darted into the box, before clipping the perfect cross into the middle for Benteke to head home from close range. Christian Benteke celebrates scoring Crystal Palace's opening goal against West Ham The hosts responded well, and were level just before the interval through Noble from the spot. Tomkins - up against his former club - felled Hernandez in the box after good work from Joao Mario, gifting Noble the chance to equalise, which he coolly converted. Hernandez then had a great chance to turn the match on its head just six minutes into the second half, and should his header have been a yard either side of Hennessey, he would have found the net. The Wales international 'keeper's save was acrobatic, but he shouldn't have been allowed to get there. The rest of the half was a rather languid affair, with neither side really creating any openings of note as the rain came down in the capital. A draw was a fair result. Opta stats West Ham are unbeaten in their last six Premier League encounters with Crystal Palace (W3 D3), with both games ending level this season. Palace have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 13 Premier League London derbies away from home - last recording a shutout in December 2014 against QPR. The Hammers are unbeaten in their last six Premier League outings (W2 D4), their longest run without a defeat since April 2016 (10 games unbeaten). Mark Noble (left) celebrates after equalising from the penalty spot Since losing their first London derby of the season against Tottenham, West Ham have remained unbeaten in the next five (W1 D5), the Hammers' longest unbeaten streak since November 2005 (five games unbeaten). Mark Noble is the 11th player to score 20+ penalties in the Premier League. The pundit - Phil Thompson Palace probably missed an opportunity with the injuries West Ham have got. West Ham will be happy with a point out of this and a 1-1 draw was probably about the right thing. Benteke got the opener for Palace, but him and Zaha were poor tonight. It's so tight down there and the bottom half has been squeezed up after Swansea's result - but I think both of these teams should be alright. Man of the match - Joao Mario It is fair to say that it did not work out for Joao Mario at Inter Milan, so trying to resurrect your career at a Premier League side fighting at the other end of the table is difficult. The quality of his play, at times, at London Stadium showed why Moyes was so keen to bring the Portuguese in. His pass that led to West Ham winning a penalty was exquisite, as he enticed the entire Palace backline out before threading it through for Hernandez. Palace weren't shy in making challenge, but the West Ham newboy kept getting up and coming again.

0-3 Liverpool Liverpool got back to winning ways on Tuesday evening as they swept past Huddersfield with a 3-0 win in the Premier League. After going 18 games unbeaten, Jurgen Klopp's side had lost their last two games in all competitions but got back on top against a scrappy Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium. Emre Can (26) opened the scoring with a deflected volley before Roberto Firmino (45+1) squeezed the ball home at the acutest of angles. Mohamed Salah (78) added the third from the penalty spot in the second period after Philip Billing fouled Can in the box. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Hadergjonaj (5), Kongolo (6), Schindler (6), Jorgensen (6), Lowe (6), Mooy (5), Hogg (6), Billing (5), Mounie (4), Depoitre (4).

Subs used: Oxlade-Chamberlain (n/a), Wjnaldum (n/a), Solanke (n/a). Man of the match: Emre Can. Liverpool are still in fourth and move five points clear of Tottenham ahead of their match against Manchester United on Wednesday while Huddersfield remain in 14th spot on 24 points - one above the relegation places. It was Huddersfield who had the first chance of the game in the 17th minute, testing Loris Karius. Chris Lowe burst down the left flank before cutting the ball back for an unmarked Laurent Depoitre who swept towards goal, but Karius got down low to push the effort away before pouncing on the loose ball. Team news David Wagner made seven changes from the weekend with Terence Kongolo, Florent Hadergjonaj, Jonathan Hogg and Steve Mounie retaining their starting spots. Liverpool made six changes, Joel Matip, Emre Can, Mo Salah, Roberto Firmino and Saido Mane all keeping their spots in the XI. Liverpool made the breakthrough nine minutes later with a fine volley from Can. Andrew Robertson's cross from the left-hand side was well cleared by Christopher Schindler, but the rebound fell to the feet of the German who hammered a volley towards goal. It nestled into the bottom corner after taking a deflection off Billing's heel. Huddersfield could have added the next goal in the 40th minute as they won a free kick by the top right corner of the box, but Lowe's effort just whipped past the far post. Just after the one minute of added time was announced, Liverpool scored their second. A superb flick from Sadio Mane set Firmino away down the left of the box, taking on goalkeeper Jonas Lossl at the near post. He managed to squeeze the ball around him at the tightest of angles, with the ball taking a nick off the bottom of the post before landing in the far corner. Mohamed Salah scored Liverpool's third from the spot Liverpool mostly dominated the second period, and forced two fine saves from Lossl early on after the break. Can pumped an inviting ball into the box, which met the head of Mane, but his effort went straight into the hands of the goalkeeper. Lossl, who then pushed a fierce drive from James Milner over the crossbar a few minutes later. Mane had another headed effort in the 69th minute after Can delivered a cross for him once again, but this time, it went flying past the post. The Reds added their third in the 78th minute after Billing pushed Can over in the box. Salah stepped up to take and thrashed the ball home to see Liverpool take all three points back to Anfield. Roberto Firmino celebrates as he doubles Liverpool's lead Opta stats This was the 58th ground that Liverpool have played at in the Premier League; they've won at more different stadiums than any other side in the competition (54). Huddersfield are without a win in their last seven Premier League games (three draws followed by four losses) and have enjoyed just two wins in their last 14 in the competition (D3 L9). Mohamed Salah has had a hand in 25 Premier League goals this season, the most of any player in the competition (19 goals, 6 assists). Roberto Firmino has been directly involved in 10 goals in his last 12 Premier League appearances against newly promoted teams (eight goals, two assists). The managers David Wagner: \"It was hard work. There is no doubt that this was a deserved defeat. The quality side has won today. Against a team of this quality the important situations have to go in your favour to be successful.\" Jurgen Klopp: \"Of course, that was the reaction we needed to show. I think everybody saw it was not brilliant. It was not our best game we played so far, but it was very mature and, in the end, very deserved it.\" The pundit James Milner holds off Christopher Schindler during the Premier League match Charlie Nicholas: \"The result is everything for Liverpool. They started well then had a lull when the strikers didn't get going for a spell. Firmino is the one who leads it and Mane was keen and enthusiastic but you could see he is desperate for a goal. He needs to lift his composure levels. \"It was a decent performance for Liverpool and a fabulous result for them as it squeezes Chelsea and Man Utd and the two North London clubs have to play catch-up. However, Huddersfield were awful.\" Man of the match - Emre Can Emre Can celebrates after he scores for Liverpool For a player who has constantly been linked with a move away fronm Liverpool, it was a fantastic performance from Can who scored a smashing opener - albeit with a deflection - and won the penalty after coming out on top in his tussle with Billing. He also provided some superb crosses for his team-mates throughout the game, twice doing so for Mane in quick succession but the forward could not get his headers past Lossl. A solid all-round performance from Can. What's next?

Highlights: Swansea 1-0 Liverpool Alfie Mawson scored the winner as Swansea boosted their survival hopes with a battling 1-0 victory over Liverpool on Monday Night Football. Mawson punished a tame defensive header from Virgil van Dijk - who was making his Premier League debut for the Reds - five minutes before half-time to hand the Swans a vital victory in their battle against the drop. Liverpool pushed for an equaliser but failed to build on their thrilling win over Manchester City as Roberto Firmino struck the post and Mawson blocked Adam Lallana's rebound in a thrilling finale in stoppage-time. But the night belonged to Swansea as they moved level with 19th-placed West Brom at the bottom of the table and three points from safety, while Liverpool missed the chance to go third and remain fourth. Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (8), Naughton (7), Mawson (8), Van der Hoorn (7), Fernandez (7), Olsson (6), Fer (7), Clucas (7), Ki (6), Dyer (6), Ayew (7). Subs: Carroll (6), Bony (5). Liverpool: Karius (5), Gomez (5), Van Dijk (5), Matip (5), Robertson (6), Wijnaldum (5), Can (5), Oxlade-Chamberlain (5), Mane (5), Firmino (5), Salah (5). Subs: Lallana (5), Ings (5). Man of the Match: Alfie Mawson Lukasz Fabianski bravely smothered Sadio Mane's effort on nine minutes before he could convert from Emre Can's lofted through ball, while Martin Olsson hacked Firmino's goal-bound effort off the line five minutes later. Swansea were on the back foot but had the ball in the Liverpool net as Jordan Ayew fired home from a narrow angle on 17 minutes, but it was chalked off after the officials spotted the ball had gone out of play. Federico Fernandez is suspected to have broken his nose while celebrating Alfie Mawson's winner Van Dijk came within inches of scoring as he glanced a header wide on 23 minutes, and he almost turned provider seven minutes later when his chipped pass released Mohamed Salah, who fired a volley over. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain registered the first attempt on target soon after but for all of their dominance it was Swansea who took the lead as Van Dijk's poor defensive header set up Mawson to fire home from six yards. Team news Carlos Carvalhal made three changes following Swansea’s 1-1 draw at Newcastle as Kyle Naughton, Federico Fernandez and Leroy Fer returned. Virgil van Dijk made his first Premier League start for Liverpool, who were captained by Emre Can. Mane had a glorious chance to haul Liverpool level on the stroke of half-time but he volleyed Salah's cross wide, and the trend continued in the second half as the visitors, confronted by a resilient defensive display, continued to misfire. Salah and substitute Danny Ings drew fine saves from the inspired Fabianski before Firmino headed against the post deep into added time and Mawson's stunning intervention prevented Lallana from converting the rebound. Swansea brought Liverpool's 15-game unbeaten run in the Premier League to an end Opta stats Since the start of 2014/15, this is only the third time the team starting the day bottom of the table has beaten a team in the top four (W3 D4 L20). Swansea have earned seven points in their four Premier League games under Carlos Carvalhal (W2 D1 L1), two more than they'd picked up in their 12 before his arrival (W1 D2 L9). This was Liverpool's first defeat in 15 Premier League games (W10 D4), and just their third in the competition overall this season. Klopp has lost three Premier League games against Swansea, more than he has vs any other opponent in the competition. Mawson is only the second Swansea player to score more than once in the Premier League at the Liberty Stadium this season, after Tammy Abraham (3). Liverpool had 20 shots to Swansea's three in this match, but only managed two more (4) attempts on target than the hosts (2). The managers Carlos Carvalhal: \"It is not exactly the way we wish to play but, given the circumstances, to win 1-0 against a strong team and get the points we needed was good. My players were gladiators at the end and we achieved a very important win.\" Carlos Carvahal used a superb analogy to describe how he got Swansea to beat Liverpool, saying even a Formula 1 car would get stuck in London traffic.

Southampton 1-1 Tottenham Harry Kane scored his 99th Premier League goal but it was not enough for Tottenham to beat Southampton in a 1-1 draw on Super Sunday. The striker moved within one of becoming the 27th Premier League centurion when equalising on 18 minutes after Davinson Sanchez had inadvertently put through his own net three minutes earlier. Both teams created chances to win it in an entertaining clash in torrential conditions on the south coast as Southampton stretched their winless run to 11 games in the Premier League. The result leaves Mauricio Pellegrino's men in the bottom three, a point from safety, while Spurs remain in fifth, two points off Liverpool in fourth, who play Swansea on Monday Night Football.

Subs: Lamela (5), Trippier (6), Wanyama (5) Man of the match: James Ward-Prowse Heading into this game, Southampton's attackers had scored a total of 12 goals from a combined 93 appearances this season. Tottenham were in charitable mood and did the Saints' strikers job for them on 15 minutes when Sanchez turned a Ryan Bertrand cross into his own net. Pellegrino's team had scored the opening goal in three of their last four home games, but failed to win any of them. The problem reared its head again as Spurs levelled three minutes later when Kane simply wanted it more than his marker Jack Stephens and bulleted home a header from close range. Moussa Sissoko spurned a glorious opportunity from six yards on 30 minutes while Stephens headed inches wide from an excellent James Ward-Prowse delivery six minutes later. As the rain relented, so did the clear-cut chances in the second period. Team news Mauricio Pellegrino made two changes with Mario Lemina and Manolo Gabbiadini coming in for Steven Davis and Shane Long. There were two key absentees for Spurs with Hugo Lloris and Christian Eriksen both out through illness. Dele Alli, who was subdued, drilled a low effort wide from 20 yards while Kane tried in vain to reach his milestone but a big chance evaded his clutches. Substitute Erik Lamela nearly nicked it for Spurs late on but somehow he failed to convert from no more than three yards out after a magnificent block by Stephens. There was still time for Southampton debutant Michael Obafemi - fresh from impressing in the under-17s - to spurn the chance to be an instant hero, missing his kick from eight yards with the goal gaping. Man of the match: James Ward-Prowse Fresh from scoring three goals in his last two games, the midfielder was in dynamic mood. Crashing into tackles to disrupt Tottenham's flow while also providing great quality from set-pieces with his gem of a right-boot. He really should have had an assist to his name but Stephens managed to head wide in the first-period after Ward-Prowse had put a free-kick on a plate for him.

Indeed, the Saints have now lost nine points from leading positions at St Mary's this season; more than any other Premier League side on home soil. There were just 197 seconds between Southampton's opener and Harry Kane's equaliser for Tottenham. Kane has netted 11 goals in his last six starts in all competitions for Tottenham Hotspur. In fact, Kane has scored six goals in his last five Premier League games against Southampton, including three in his last three at St Mary's. Aged 17 years, 199 days, Obafemi became the second youngest player to make a Premier League appearance for Southampton after Luke Shaw (17y 116d). Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says their 1-1 draw with Southampton was a tough game but a fair result and admitted his side's performance wasn't great. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says their 1-1 draw with Southampton was a tough game but a fair result and admitted his side's performance wasn't great. Managers Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino: \"The players aren't fighting just for me, they are fighting for themselves and the club. The club is bigger than me and the players. We need to respect our fans and our board and the people that believe in us. My first commitment is to win myself as it's my profession - I want to win every game.\" Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was an even game, a difficult game to play. In possession, we made a lot of mistakes that allowed them lots of transitions. We created two massive chances but if you analyse the game it was a fair result. It wasn't our best version tonight -the pitch didn't help us but it was the same for both teams. We need to improve.\" Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino says he was very happy with the spirit his side showed during their 1-1 draw with Tottenham. Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino says he was very happy with the spirit his side showed during their 1-1 draw with Tottenham. What's next?

win at Brighton Watch highlights of Chelsea's 4-0 Premier League win at Brighton An inspired performance from Eden Hazard helped Chelsea back to winning ways in the Premier League with a comprehensive 4-0 victory against Brighton at the Amex Stadium. Antonio Conte's side were without a win in five games in all competitions heading into the clash on the south coast, but Hazard set the Blues on their way in the third minute before Willian rounded off a sensational team goal three minutes later to give the visitors the perfect start. Brighton's response to the early setback was good, creating a number of decent chances but Willy Caballero was on top form to deny Tomer Hemed and the crossbar kept out Davy Propper's header early after the interval. Ezequiel Schelotto was also denied by a smart block from Caballero and the hosts were eventually made to pay for their wastefulness in front of goal as Hazard (77) added his second of the afternoon and Victor Moses (89) rounded off the scoring as Chelsea wrapped up all three points to move above Liverpool into third. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Suttner (5), Schelotto (7), Duffy (6), Dunk (5), Goldson (6), Gross (6), March (6), Stephens (6), Propper (7), Hemed (5). Subs: Kayal (5), Murray (5), Izquierdo (5). Away Team: Caballero (8), Rudiger (7), Christensen (7), Azpilicueta (7), Alonso (6), Moses (7), Kante (8), Bakayoko (7), Willian (8), Hazard (9), Batshuayi (7). Subs: Luiz (6), Zappacosta (6), Musonda (7) Man of the match: Eden Hazard Before kick-off, the Amex Stadium rose as one for a minute's applause to mark the passing of Cyrille Regis and both teams sported black armbands in respect of the former striker. Once underway, Chelsea burst out of the blocks and they were ahead in the third minute when Moses' cross was diverted into the path of Hazard by Dale Stephens, and the Belgium international took a touch before firing the ball into the corner of the net for his 100th league goal. Antonio Conte praised the performance of his Chelsea side Antonio Conte praised the performance of his Chelsea side Goals had been hard to come by with the Blues scoring just once in their last four matches in all competitions, but they had a second inside six minutes courtesy of Willian. The Brazil international was involved in some slick interplay with Hazard and Michy Batshuayi, leaving the Brighton defence all at sea before expertly finishing past Mat Ryan. After their horror start, Brighton gradually grew into the game and they thought they should have had a penalty when Caballero, after making a mess of a cross, appeared to clip Schelotto, but nothing was given by referee Jon Moss. Team news Chris Hughton made five changes from the defeat at West Brom. Bruno, Gaetan Bong, Anthony Knockaert, José Izquierdo and Glenn Murray all dropped out. Willy Caballero made his first Premier League appearance for Chelsea with Thibaut Courtois ruled out due to an ankle injury. Gary Cahill, Cesc Fabregas and Alvaro Morata (suspended) also missed out, while £15m signing Ross Barkleywas named on the bench. The hosts were creating chances - Caballero superbly denied Hemed from close range - and they looked to Moss again just before half-time as Schelotto went down in the penalty area once again, this time under a challenge from Tiemoue Bakayoko, but again the referee waved away the appeals. After the break, Chelsea remained a threat on the counter but it was Brighton creating the clearer cut chances, Propper heading Pascal Gross' cross past Caballero only to see the ball crash back off the crossbar. Minutes later, Chelsea were nearly out of sight but Ryan did brilliantly to get a vital hand to Willian's free-kick to divert the ball onto the post and away from goal. Chances still continued to fall Brighton's way but Caballero proved hard to beat as the Argentine goalkeeper blocked Schelotto's low drive from 12 yards Victor Moses celebrates scoring his side's fourth goal They were made to pay for the missed chances late on as Hazard capped another mazy run with a ruthless finish before Moses latched onto substitute Charly Musonda's inch-perfect 40-yard to seal a resounding away victory. Opta stats Brighton have picked up just one win from their last 13 Premier League games (D5 L7), failing to score in nine of these. Brighton manager Chris Hughton claims his side should have been awarded two penalties Brighton manager Chris Hughton claims his side should have been awarded two penalties Chelsea have won 45 of their 76 away games against newly-promoted sides in the Premier League, a joint-high figure (Arsenal have also won 45). The Blues extended their top-flight unbeaten run to eight games (W5 D3), their longest streak without a defeat since March (also eight). Willian made his 50th consecutive Premier League appearance, the longest current run of any player in the competition. He has been directly involved in eight goals in his last five Premier League starts for Chelsea (3 goals, 5 assists), as many as he managed in his previous 20. Eden Hazard celebrates with Willian after scoring the opening goal of the game Hazard's opener was his 100th goal in league football (now 101), with 65 coming for Chelsea and 36 for Lille. He has now scored (65) or assisted (37) 102 Premier League goals for Chelsea; taking him ahead of Gianfranco Zola (101) to outright third for the club in the competition (Lampard 237, Drogba 159). Batshuayi registered his first assist in his last 31 Premier League appearances, since he set up Diego Costa on his debut in the competition in August 2016. Man of the Match - Eden Hazard Hazard was in the mood at the Amex Stadium. Every time he got on the ball he terrified Brighton's defenders and his finishing was at its exquisite best as his double inspired Chelsea to a comprehensive away victory. His perfermonace left Jamie Redknapp, who watching the game in the studio for Sky Sports, purring. \"If VAR looked at his performance today, then some it would have illegal as he was that good\", the former Liverpool midfielder said. \"Willian was fantastic as well - as was Batshuayi, but Hazard was playing a different game. He was at his energetic, beautiful best today.\" Man of the Match, @hazardeden10 2 goals from 2 shots on target 3 chances created 92 touches (game high) 5th time in 6 seasons at @ChelseaFC that he has scored 10+ goals (all comps) pic.twitter.com/F4TSTwxJt3 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) January 20, 2018 The pundit - Thierry Henry \"Hazard is unplayable when he's in that mood. When he plays like this it's more than likely Chelsea are going to win the game. \"I like what Antonio Conte does. I watched the game against Leicester and they weren't scoring goals - Conte took him off. When you do that to a player like him with the quality he has, it woke him up. From the beginning, he meant business. Eden Hazard rides a challenge by Dale Stephens \"Conte did it last season ahead of a game with Arsenal and we all know what he did to Arsenal with that goal last year. I like the way Hazard reacted from the Leicester game. \"That's the job of the boss - sometimes a player might be tired, sometimes a player needs a reminder that he's not doing enough. I'm not saying Hazard wasn't. Usually when you take the main player off after an hour when you're supposed to win that game. It got the reaction of, 'OK, I'm on the bench, but we'll see next week'.\" What's next? Chelsea are back in action on Sky Sports on Wednesday when they face Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final, second leg. It's cup action for Brighton as well when they take on Middlesbrough in the FA Cup fourth round next Saturday at the Riverside."}, {"date": "20/01/2018", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance":

shrugged off the absence of Alexis Sanchez as they romped to a 4-1 victory over Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday. With Sanchez not in the squad as talks continue over a move to Manchester United, the Gunners blew Palace away with four goals in a dazzling opening 22 minutes. Nacho Monreal, Alex Iwobi and Laurent Koscielny all finished from close range before Alexandre Lacazette fired in after a slick passing move. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (6), Bellerin (6), Koscielny (7), Mustafi (7), Monreal (7), Wilshere (8), Elneny (7), Xhaka (8), Ozil (8), Iwobi (7), Lacazette (7) Subs: Maitland-Niles (6), Kolasinac (5), Nelson (5) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (5), Van Aanholt (5), Tomkins (4), Kelly (4), Fosu-Mensah (4), Milivojevic (5), Cabaye (4), McArthur (4), Zaha (5), Sako (4), Benteke (4) Subs: Riedewald (5) Man of the match: Mesut Ozil Palace improved in the second half but could only pull back a consolation goal in the 78th minute through Luka Milivojevic. The win is Arsenal's first in 2018 and provides a timely boost after defeat at Bournemouth last weekend and then a week dominated by transfer speculation. With several key players back, the Gunners made a rampant start as Monreal headed in from a corner in the sixth minute before crossing for Iwobi to make it 2-0 shortly afterwards. Laurent Koscielny celebrates after scoring Arsenal's third goal Monreal was also involved in the third goal as he knocked a corner across goal for Koscielny to tap in. Palace looked all at sea defensively and they were cut apart in the 22nd minute by a superb goal that saw the excellent Ozil combine with Wilshere and then backheel for Lacazette to rifle into the bottom corner. The only negative in the first half for the Gunners was Monreal going off with injury, having just returned from almost a month out. Team news Ozil, Monreal and Koscielny all returned to the starting XI for Arsenal along with Elneny. Cabaye replaced Riedewald for Palace. Petr Cech did make a late save in the 44th minute from a deflected shot from Wilfried Zaha, and Palace improved after the break as Arsenal's level dropped. Christian Benteke wasted Palace's best chance when he shot at Cech, and it took until the 78th minute for the visitors to finally respond when Milivojevic volleyed in from a corner. Arsenal wasted chances to score themselves as Iwobi and Lacazette were both denied by Wayne Hennessey, but their early flurry ensured the second half was more than comfortable. Opta stats Arsenal went 4-0 up in the opening 22 minutes in this game - the earliest a side has led by that many in a Premier League game since Liverpool against the Gunners themselves in February 2014 (20 minutes). Alexandre Lacazette's strike was the 500th by French players for Arsenal in the Premier League (excluding own goals) - 358 more than any other side in the competition. Nacho Monreal was involved in three of Arsenal's goals before being substituted (1 goal, 2 assists) - as many as in his previous 43 Premier League games combined (2 goals, 1 assist). Roy Hodgson is now winless in all 11 of his Premier League away London derbies as manager (D3 L8). Crystal Palace have now lost just two of their last 13 Premier League games (W5 D6), with both defeats coming against Arsenal. Man of the match - Mesut Ozil With Sanchez looking set to leave, keeping Ozil seems imperative for Arsenal based on this performance. Returning to the side after nearly three weeks out, he pulled the strings for the Gunners and produced a number of clever flicks and one-touch passes.

United got the only goal of the game in the 54th minute, Martial's third in four games, striking in off the bar from 12 yards after good work from Romelu Lukaku. Burnley had chances to equalise in the second half, hitting the bar from Johann Gudmundsson's free-kick, but their search for a win extends to eight in all competitions. Paul Pogba controls the ball while under pressure from James Tarkowski Player ratings Burnley: Pope (6), Bardsley (6), Tarkowski (6), Mee (7), Taylor (5), Cork (5), Defour (5), Arfield (5), Gudmundsson (6), Hendrick (5), Barnes (5) Subs: N'Koudou (NA), Vokes (NA), Wells (NA) Man Utd: De Gea (6), Valencia (6), Jones (8), Smalling (7), Young (8), Matic (6), Pogba (6), Mata (6), Lingard (6), Martial (7), Lukaku (6) Subs: Fellaini (6), Rashford (NA), Herrera (NA) Man of the match: Phil Jones The result means Man Utd are nine points behind Man City before their late kick-off against Newcastle on Saturday, while Burnley are down to eighth. As expected, Henrikh Mkhitaryan was left out of the matchday squad as talks for a swap deal with Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez continue, with the Chilean himself missing Arsenal's win over Crystal Palace. During a first half lacking in opportunities for either side, Ashley Young came closest, nutmegging Gudmundsson near the corner flag before curling just wide of the far post. United got their breakthrough nine minutes into the second half through Martial, who finished well as he was found in space by Lukaku after fine hold-up play from the Belgian on the right. Team news Jose Mourinho made just one change after the 3-0 win over Stoke, with Ashley Young returning from suspension to replace Luke Shaw. For Burnley, Scott Arfield came in to replace Sam Vokes as Sean Dyche opted for one striker at Turf Moor. Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho looks on at Turf Moor Burnley hit the bar from Gudmundsson's dipping free-kick just three minutes after the goal, before the Icelandic midfielder's dangerous ball across the face of goal evaded Ashley Barnes by inches thanks to a fine deflection from Chris Smalling. Martial should have had a second late on, forcing a fine save out of Pope at his near post after being found in space again in the penalty area, and despite a late Burnley rally, Jose Mourinho's side held on. United have now earned five straight clean sheets in all competitions as they look to keep up with rivals City in the Premier League title race. Opta stats Man Utd have won back-to-back league games at Turf Moor for the first time since May 1963. Man Utd have won five of their last six away Premier League games (D1) after winning just two of the 10 prior to this run (D4 L4). Burnley have lost three consecutive Premier League home games for the first time since April 2010. Burnley have won one of their last 25 matches against Manchester United in all competitions (D10 L14). Anthony Martial celebrates after scoring the first goal of the game The managers Sean Dyche: \"I think we've more than matched Man Utd in the application of the players, for quality of the play, some really good play from us today, and certainly the tactical format. \"But inevitably you don't come away with what you want, which is a minimum of a point and a maximum of a win.\" Burnley boss Sean Dyche was pleased with his side's performance Burnley boss Sean Dyche was pleased with his side's performance Jose Mourinho: \"It was very hard. We played against a brave team, a team that plays with strength, that knows how to get points, and that's why they are in a comfortable position. \"We knew it was going to be difficult, especially if you don't score goals to kill the match, so at 1-0 it will always be a game until the last second.

He registered a team-high 13 clearances and five interceptions, and won a an impressive 90 per cent of his aerial duels against Burnley's front men. Jones has been impressive for United of late, and has contributed heavily to Mourinho's side going five games without conceding in all competitions.

Oumar Niasse scored within 57 seconds of coming off the bench to rescue a 1-1 draw for Everton against West Brom at Goodison Park. Jay Rodriguez put the Baggies on course to claim back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time under Alan Pardew when he opened the scoring after seven minutes. A disjointed Everton display took a turn for the worse when James McCarthy suffered an horrific double leg fracture early in the second half, which left West Brom striker Salomon Rondon distraught. But the Toffees dug deep to claim a point as Niasse volleyed debutant Theo Walcott's knock-down home with his first touch on 70 minutes. Rondon recovered to rattle the bar in stoppage-time but there was to be no winner as Everton boss Sam Allardyce had to settle for a draw from his 1,000th competitive game as a manager. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Kenny (5), Holgate (5), Williams (5), Martina (5), Schneiderlin (5), McCarthy (6), Walcott (6), Sigurdsson (6), Vlasic (4), Tosun (5).

Subs: McAuley (6), Livermore (6), McClean (6). Man of the Match: Salomon Rondon. Goodison Park remembered the late Cyrille Regis with a touching minute's applause ahead of kick-off, and his former club made a start he would have been proud. Less than a minute after Grzegorz Krychowiak had blazed over from a one-on-one, the Poland international's pass with the outside of his foot set Rodríguez through on goal and he coolly slotted home his sixth goal of the season. Theo Walcott played apart in Everton's equaliser on his debut Everton registered their first shot on target in 251 minutes of Premier League football when Jonjoe Kenny's curling effort drew a save from Ben Foster on 38 minutes, before Rondon headed over seven minutes later as West Brom missed the chance to double their lead before the interval. Team news Theo Walcott made his Everton debut as Sam Allardyce made four changes following their 4-0 defeat to Tottenham. Alan Pardew named an unchanged side after West Brom's victory over Brighton. Everton brought on Yannick Bolasie at half-time but it failed to have the desired effect as the visitors continued to create the clear openings. Rondon wriggled clear of Mason Holgate on 58 minutes only to be denied by McCarthy's brave intervention, which resulted in the Republic of Ireland international sustaining a serious injury. Salomon Rondon was distraught after James McCarthy's injury Rondon was among a handful of inconsolable players who took time to gather themselves after the incident. Once the game got back up to speed, Niasse made an immediate impact from the bench, firing the equaliser within a minute of entering the fray, but there was still time for West Brom to go close to winning it as Rondon's swerving effort hit the bar in the closing stages. Opta stats Everton have gone six top-flight games without a win (D3 L3), their longest run without a victory since April 2016 (7). West Brom have enjoyed just one win in their last 22 Premier League games, drawing 11 and losing 10. Theo Walcott started a Premier League game for the first time since April 26 (Arsenal v Leicester), 269 days ago. Walcott registered his first Premier League assist in 28 games, since October 2, 2016 (Arsenal v Burnley), 475 days ago. Jay Rodriguez has had a hand in three goals in his last four Premier League games (2 goals, 1 assist), one more than he managed in his previous 19 for West Brom this season. The managers Sam Allardyce: It was difficult to watch today. It was difficult for every fan in the ground to watch after what they've watched a couple of weeks ago, when we beat Swansea and put in a resilient performance against Chelsea. I see a lack of confidence because the players have not moved forward from where we started. It's my job to keep going and pushing the players. Everton boss Sam Allardyce confirms defender James McCarthy has suffered a double leg break following a challenge with West Brom's Salomon Rondon. Everton boss Sam Allardyce confirms defender James McCarthy has suffered a double leg break following a challenge with West Brom's Salomon Rondon. Alan Pardew: It's not often you come to Goodison Park and feel slightly disappointed. We felt we could have won that game. We played well at times, took the lead, frustrated Everton and had them where we wanted them. They only had about two or three chances in the game and they scored from one. West Brom boss Alan Pardew says he leaves Goodison Park slightly disappointed with a draw after leading Everton. West Brom boss Alan Pardew says he leaves Goodison Park slightly disappointed with a draw after leading Everton. Man of the Match - Salomon Rondon West Brom's big man up front was a handful for the Everton defence throughout, but his courage to continue playing after his involvement in McCarthy's injury was admirable. The Venezuela international was in floods of tears while medical staff were tending to McCarthy, but he pulled himself together to see out the game. A visibly upset Rondon is consoled by Jonny Evans following a collision that resulted in injury to McCarthy And he so nearly claimed all three points for the Baggies with a host of chances late on, notably his stoppage-time effort which struck the bar, testament to his composure and professionalism. What's next? Everton are next in action when Leicester travel to Goodison Park on January 31.

Vardy scored from the spot in the first half after being fouled by Molla Wague in the box and Mahrez sealed the points in injury-time. The England striker's first chance of the game arrived in the fifth minute after he got the better of the centre-backs and went through on goal, but he fired a shot from inside the area straight at the deputising Orestis Karnezis. Wilfried Ndidi found the ball at his feet two minutes later when Mahrez whipped in a free-kick to Harry Maguire to the back post where he nodded it down to the midfielder, but his shot from six yards was blocked by Richarlison. Jamie Vardy celebrates after converting his penalty to make it 1-0 at the King Power Stadium Troy Deeney was the victim of a tight offside call when he latched onto an Abdoulaye Doucoure flick-on to smash home a shot from the edge of the area but the assistant referee already had his flag raised. Vardy earned and then scored a penalty six minutes before the break as he beat Wague to a Matty James pass into the box, resulting in the defending fouling the striker. The England international then stepped up to send Karnezis the wrong way. Andre Gray came off the bench in the second half and almost brought Watford level when he raced onto a looped ball over the top but Maguire chased him in time and got there to block his shot from six yards. Team news Leicester made eight changes from their win over Fleetwood in the FA Cup. Matty James was back in the midfield, while Dragovic keeps his place in defence.Heurelho Gomes missed out for Watford, so Orestis Karnezis was in goal. Troy Deeney started after an impressive display off the bench last week. The third and final change from the Southampton draw was Roberto Pereyra replacing Tom Cleverley. Watford ended up with three strikers and two wingers on, leaving plenty of space for Leicester to enjoy, but failed to create any late chances of their own. With Watford chasing the game in injury time, Adrien Silva led a Leicester break, playing the ball into space for Mahrez to run onto and dribble into the box where he struck a shot across the 'keeper and into the bottom corner. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Amartey (7), Dragovic (7), Maguire (8), Chilwell (7), Albrighton (7), Ndidi (7), James (7), Mahrez (8), Vardy (9), Okazaki (7) Subs: Gray (6), Silva (n/a) Watford: : Karnezis (7), Janmaat (5), Wague (5), Kabasele (6), Zeegelaar (6), Watson (6), Doucoure (6), Carrillo (6), Richarlison (6), Pereyra (5), Deeney (6) Subs: Prodl (6), Gray (6) Okaka (5) Man of the match: Jamie Vardy The result means Watford have now only won once in 11 games, putting added pressure on boss Marco Silva, while Leicester have moved up to seventh spot. Managers Claude Puel: \"Of course [I am] satisfied because it's a fantastic reward for the players, for the squad, because they work very hard in all the training sessions and it's important to continue this way. \"It was a tough game, I said before the game it would be a difficult game because it was a strong team full of quality on the pitch and we have had difficulties in the first game away against this team, we know this team, it was difficult but it's a fantastic reward for the players.\" Marco Silva: \"[It was a] tough game for both teams. We knew before and our opponent knew as well, it would be a tough game for both, I think it proved during the match. It was a balanced game, a really balanced game. \"I think if you analyse the match in general, I think they had two or three chances to score, they scored two goals; we had two or three chances and scored no goals.\" Claude Puel praises opponents Watford for making the match difficult during Leicester’s 2-0 win.

Riyad Mahrez has now scored in each of his last five Premier League games against Watford. Jamie Vardy has hit 10+ goals in each of his last three Premier League campaigns, scoring 47 goals in 94 appearances the process. Man of the match - Jamie Vardy The England striker was a thorn in the side of the Watford team, constantly putting the centre-backs under pressure and calmly slotting home his penalty, which he won.

manager as goals from Joe Allen and Mame Biram Diouf secured a 2-0 win over Huddersfield at the bet365 Stadium. After a dour opening half, Stoke broke the deadlock as Maxim Choupo-Moting's low cross was swept in by Allen (53) and victory was assured after Xherdan Shaqiri expertly found Diouf who slotted home via the post 16 minutes later. Huddersfield offered very little as an attacking threat and were fortunate not to fall further behind as Choupo-Moting blazed over in the closing stages. The victory moves Stoke out of the relegation zone above Southampton into 17th place while Huddersfield remain 14th having lost their last three league games with Liverpool and Manchester United up next. Mame Biram Diouf celebrates after scoring Stoke City's second goal Player ratings Stoke: Butland (6), Bauer (8), Pieters (6), Zouma (6), Shawcross (7), Allen (7), Fletcher (6), Adam (6), Shaqiri (7), Choupo-Moting (7), Diouf (7).

Subs: Sabiri (6), Quaner (6), Depoitre (5) Man of the match: Moritz Bauer Huddersfield manager David Wagner has already recruited Terence Kongolo and Alex Pritchard this month, but he may well look for further reinforcements after another blunt display. The Terriers offered very little as an attacking force and were fortunate not to go into the break behind as Jonas Lossl distinguished himself with a fine one-handed save to deny Shaqiri after the Swiss had been put clean through by Choupo-Moting. It was the only chance of note during an opening 45 minutes in which both sides looked shorn of confidence following recent poor runs of form. Stoke manager Paul Lambert celebrates his side's opening goal against Huddersfield Team news Stoke made four changes as Mame Biram Diouf, Charlie Adam, Ryan Shawcross and Erik Pieters replaced Stephen Ireland, Josh Tymon, Bruno Martins Indi and Peter Crouch. Huddersfield made three changes as Florent Hadergjonaj, Alex Pritchard and Steve Mounie replaced Tommy Smith, Joe Lolley and Laurent Depoitre. Stoke had never lost four consecutive Premier League games without scoring and after Shaqiri correctly had an acrobatic effort ruled out for offside, Lambert's men were rewarded for their more courageous approach. Charlie Adam released Choupo-Moting on the left and the Cameroon international kept his composure to pick out Allen, who fired low into the net despite a poor attempted clearance from Scott Malone on the line. Stoke had opportunities to double their lead through Shaqiri and Diouf before the pair combined for the latter to slot beyond Lossl via the post with 21 minutes remaining to the delight of their new manager. Moritz Bauer has made an excellent start to his Stoke City career Man of the match: Moritz Bauer Despite the 3-0 defeat by Manchester United last Monday, Bauer emerged with credit from his Stoke debut having had little time to get to know his new team-mates. The Austrian's marauding runs caused United problems that night, and the 25-year-old was bombing forward frequently once more as he provided an outlet down the right as well as solidity in defence. The managers Paul Lambert: \"We never looked like losing a goal and the energy for our goals was outstanding. We dominated the game without being too cutting. I thought the second half we were outstanding. \"The first goal set the tone and the second was just brilliant play. \"The back four were outstanding and the midfield three had terrific energy levels and the front three were a handful throughout the game. David Wagner: \"It's a frustrating result for sure and it's a deserved defeat, even if I can say my players gave everything. We have to be honest and say they were very aggressive and limited our offensive game. \"It's frustrating because of the result even if the effort and attitude was there. We'll try to recover as quickly as we can.\" Huddersfield manager David Wagner couldn’t fault his players saying they gave everything in their defeat to Stoke. Huddersfield manager David Wagner couldn’t fault his players saying they gave everything in their defeat to Stoke. Opta stats Mame Biram Diouf's goal was his 22nd in the Premier League for Stoke City - making him their joint-third highest goalscorer in the competition (Jonathan Walters 43, Peter Crouch 43, Marko Arnautovic 22). Paul Lambert earned his first win as Premier League manager in 11 games - since his Aston Villa side beat Leicester 2-1 in December 2014. The Potters kept their first clean sheet in the Premier League since October (1-0 at Watford), having conceded 30 goals in their 13 previous games. The Terriers are now winless in six Premier League games, losing each of the last three in a row (D3). Joe Allen has had a hand in four goals in his last five Premier League games (2 goals, 2 assists), as many as in his previous 43 combined.

Bournemouth went ahead with their first attempt on target when Fraser powered a shot beyond Hammers 'keeper Adrian at his near post after 71 minutes. However, their joy was short-lived with substitute Hernandez - whom the Hammers are reportedly willing to sell this January transfer window - tucking home a loose ball, nine minutes after coming on for the injured Manuel Lanzini. The draw means both sides extend their unbeaten Premier League runs to five games, with West Ham sitting one place and one point above Bournemouth in 11th. Javier Hernandez scored his first goal since October when levelling for the Hammers Expectation was high after the two sides had shared the spoils in a six-goal thriller on Boxing Day, and it was West Ham who started the strongest, with Aaron Cresswell seeing an effort from distance flash wide.

Bournemouth weathered the storm and went close to breaking the deadlock themselves when Lewis Cook curled an effort just wide following a well-worked corner routine. Momentum swung back West Ham's way after the break, but again Begovic kept them at bay when tipping away Zabaleta's cross before Lanzini could get a touch on it. Team news Having both recorded Premier League wins last weekend, West Ham and Bournemouth named unchanged XIs from those victories over Huddersfield and Arsenal respectively. Arnautovic then found himself through on goal, but the forward hesitated to strike with his left foot and allowed Steve Cook to come back and intercept. Ryan Fraser celebrates after scoring the opener at West Ham The visitors went ahead when Junior Stanislas played a perfectly-weighted pass for Fraser, who caught Adrian out with a near-post effort - but their lead lasted all of two minutes. From the kick-off, Arnautovic latched onto Hernandez's flick-on, but after seeing his attempt blocked, the Mexican stole in to secure West Ham a point. Opta stats West Ham are unbeaten in five Premier League games (W2 D3), their longest run without a league defeat since May (also 5). Bournemouth are also unbeaten in five Premier League games (W2 D3) for the first time since May (also 5). Eddie Howe oversaw his 100th Premier League game, making him the third youngest English manager to hit this milestone in the competition (40y 52d), after Glenn Hoddle (38y 36d) and Gareth Southgate (38y 150d). Ryan Fraser has been directly involved in four goals in his last three Premier League games (3 goals, 1 assist), as many as in his previous 26. Man of the match - Mark Noble The West Ham skipper threw himself about in the middle of the park, and on one occasion even flew in to make a diving header interception. Mark Noble made four tackles, one clearance on three interceptions on Saturday Four tackles, one clearance and three interceptions tells you only half the story of Noble's contribution for West Ham, for he was equally as impressive when setting the hosts up on the attack. All this after Noble revealed to Jamie Redknapp in Friday's Daily Mail he makes sure the players' bonuses are shared with every staff member - the man is West Ham through and through.

3-1 Newcastle Sergio Aguero's hat-trick helped Manchester City beat Newcastle 3-1 at the Etihad to keep Pep Guardiola's side 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League table. City broke the deadlock after 34 minutes when Aguero nodded in Kevin De Bruyne's inch-perfect cross, before the Argentinian's penalty doubled the lead (63). Four minutes later Jacob Murphy pulled one back with his first goal for Newcastle, only for that man Aguero to seal the win with his 11th hat-trick for City, and his 22nd goal of the season. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (7), Stones (6), Otamendi (6), Zinchenko (8), David Silva (7), Fernandinho (7), Sane (8), Sterling (7), De Bruyne (8), Aguero (9) Subs: Bernardo Silva (6) ,Diaz (6) Newcastle: Darlow (8), Dummett (8), Clark (7), Lascelles (6), Manquillo (6), Murphy (8), Diame (6), Atsu (6), Hayden (6), Shelvey (6), Joselu (5) Subs: Gayle (6), Perez (6), Yedlin (6) Man of the match: Sergio Aguero As a result, City stay 12 points ahead of rivals Manchester United at the summit, while the visitors are just two points clear of the relegation zone in 15th. City kicked off knowing United had won at Burnley to cut the gap at the top of the table to nine points, but if the home team were feeling the pressure, particularly after their first defeat of the league season to Liverpool on Sunday, then they did not show any signs of it in the first half. Jacob Murphy chips the ball over Ederson to pull a goal back for Newcastle United Right from the start Guardiola's team went on the attack against opponents clearly intent again on playing for a draw, with the visitors playing with five at the back in their attempts to frustrate City. For the opening half an hour of the contest, however, Rafa Benitez's plan appeared to be working, with Karl Darlow, despite City's domination of both possession and territory, not called upon to make a save. Benitez's game plan went out the window, though, when City - who had earlier seen a Raheem Sterling effort ruled out for offside - opened the scoring through Aguero 11 minutes before half-time. Team news David Silva returned for City after a stomach problem, but left-back Fabian Delph missed out with a knee injury, with Oleksandr Zinchenko replacing him on his Premier League debut. Newcastle striker Dwight Gayle was on the bench after picking up a knock against Swansea last weekend, although Florian Lejeune and Jesus Gamez were out with injury. Moments before Darlow had denied David Silva with an excellent point-blank save, only for City to take a quick throw to De Bruyne on the left flank. The Belgian, given too much time and space, looked up and crossed perfectly for Aguero to glance the home team ahead with the faintest of touches at the near post. City doubled their lead just past the hour-mark when Raheem Sterling's run into the box was ended when Javier Manquillo hauled the winger down, with Aguero, despite Darlow's best efforts, driving the ball home from the penalty spot. Sergio Aguero celebrates Manchester City's opening goal However, totally out of the blue Newcastle pulled a goal back as Ciaran Clark's inch-perfect through-ball released Murphy and faced with just Ederson to beat, the midfielder kept his cool to chip the advancing Brazilian. Any hope the visitors may have had, though, of escaping with an unlikely draw ended with seven minutes to go as Leroy Sane's mesmerising run and quick feet took him past a posse of Newcastle players, and the German then found Aguero, whose neat finish gave the striker a 'perfect' hat-trick. Opta stats City are now unbeaten in 21 Premier League matches against Newcastle (W18 D3) - extending their longest ever unbeaten run against a side in their league history Newcastle have lost nine consecutive top-flight away matches versus City - their joint-worst losing run against a team (also vs Spurs between 1928 and 1956) Aguero, who made his 200th Premier League appearance for ity, has had a hand in 16 goals against Newcastle in 11 appearances in the competition (14 goals, 2 assists) Aguero (22) is the third player to score 20+ goals in all competitions for a Premier League team this season after Harry Kane (28) and Mo Salah (24) De Bruyne and Sane have each provided 10 assists in the Premier League this season - a joint-high. Murphy scored his first Newcastle goal in what was his 19th appearance for the club in all competitions Sterling has won more penalties in the Premier League this season than any other player (4). Zinchenko completed 107 passes in this match, just four fewer than the whole of the Newcastle team combined (111) The managers Pep Guardiola: \"We are not going to buy a striker because we have him (Aguero) and in two to three weeks Gabriel (Jesus) is back. Sergio has his special talent because he didn't touch the ball before his first goal, and there are no words to describe how good he is in a special position, and I am so happy for him. \"The club always tries to improve the team and tries to help the guys to be closer to reach our targets, (but) if one person decides not to come we are not going to be sad - this chapter is over, it is finished and we are going to think about the future.\" Pep Guardiola celebrates Man City's first goal against Newcastle Rafa Benitez: \"Obviously I'm not happy because we lost, but the teamwork and team spirit was quite positive,\" he added. \"They had a penalty which was very soft and we had chances after that. It's a pity, but you have to say they are a very good team.\" Man of the Match - Sergio Aguero Aguero scored the first perfect Premier League hat-trick since the Argentina international himself recorded one against, of all teams, Newcastle in October 2015. Not only that, but in the absence of the injured Gabriel Jesus, the 29-year-old showed yet again just what a key figure he is in Guardiola's line-up, calming City nerves by opening the scoring before half-time. And then the forward ended any hope of a Newcastle fightback by netting his and City's third near the end, the player's seventh Premier League hat-trick since August 2011 and his 138th league strike for the club in just 200 appearances.

3-0 Stoke Manchester United closed the gap on runaway league leaders Manchester City with a 3-0 victory over Stoke on Monday Night Football. City's lead now stands at 12 points after goals from Antonio Valencia, Anthony Martial and Romelu Lukaku swept aside Stoke, who had their new boss Paul Lambert watching on from the stands. The former Aston Villa and Norwich manager would have taken heart from the performance in the first half where the visitors created multiple chances but either spurned them or were denied by David de Gea, who was keeping his 13th clean sheet of the season.

United did not have to wait long for their opener as their first shot resulted in a goal. United were in front with their first shot on goal on nine minutes when Valencia, back after a month out injured, rifled home an effort from just inside the area with left-foot. Stoke responded well, but Stephen Ireland fired two opportunities wide, the second after he had been left all alone from 15 yards out. Team News Jose Mourinho made three changes from their 2-0 victory over Everton (last Premier League game) with Chris Smalling, Antonio Valencia and Romelu Lukaku all returning. Henrik Mkhitaryan was left out of the squad. Stoke made five changes from their Premier League home defeat against Newcastle. Moritz Bauer, Bruno Martins-Indi, Josh Tymon, Stephen Ireland and Darren Fletcher all got the nod. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting then latched onto a loose ball in the box but his shot was blocked behind by Phil Jones. Martial made Stoke pay when he added a second seven minutes before the break. Paul Pogba provided the assist with a crisp pass that was swept home by Martial from 20 yards. Paul Pogba grabbed two assists David De Gea had to be alert to deny Xherdan Shaqiri just before half-time but that was the last of the Stoke threat as United bossed the second half. A third goal came and wrapped up the points 18 minutes from time. Martial's pass was controlled by Lukaku, who held off two defenders and fired home a powerful effort. Man of the match: Paul Pogba Pogba bossed this game, grabbing two assists which maintained his high level of form since returning from suspension. No player in the league has made as many assists (9) as the explosive midfielder.

comeback victory on an afternoon when Alexis Sanchez's January exit appeared ever closer. Hector Bellerin's scruffy finish to a fine move (52) looked like sealing a morale-boosting win for a side without the omitted contract rebel, but the hosts completed a second-half turnaround through Callum Wilson (70) and Jordon Ibe (74) to boost their survival hopes and further dent Arsenal's top-four ambitions. Arsene Wenger had admitted before the game that Sanchez's future would be resolved imminently, but while an end appears in sight to the saga that has long cast a shadow, the on-field troubles continue for a Gunners team embarrassed in the FA Cup a week ago and now winless in five games in all competitions.

Man of the match: Callum Wilson Jack Wilshere of Arsenal and Ryan Fraser of Bournemouth battles for possession Wenger - without injured Mesut Ozil as well as Sanchez, and forced to watch on again from the stands - saw Bournemouth start the brisker, Adam Smith fizzing an early shot just wide of Petr Cech's post. Ainsley Maitland-Niles twisted twice in the box to craft space, only to see his curling effort clip the bar (7), but though Jack Wilshere was impressing on familiar turf, real rhythm eluded both sides in a scrappy first half-hour. Danny Welbeck was thwarted by the out-rushing Asmir Begovic as Arsenal upped the ante, but the hosts appealed justifiably for a penalty when Alex Iwobi repelled a corner with a raised elbow (39) and then were denied by gutsy defending, Calum Chambers sliding in to deny Ryan Fraser. Team news Alexis Sanchez was omitted from the Arsenal squad and Mesut Ozil was also not involved but Jack Wilshere shrugged off an ankle injury to play against his former loan club. Lewis Cook and Dan Gosling started for Bournemouth with Harry Arter on the bench. A grim-faced Arsene Wenger serves the final game of his touchline ban during Arsenal's defeat at Bournemouth Bournemouth resumed with intent as the January sun broke through, but Arsenal made the breakthrough just seven minutes after the restart when Iwobi set free Bellerin with a slide-rule pass, his shot bobbling over the line after Begovic's half-save. Eddie Howe threw on Lys Mousset, Fraser shuffled to right wing-back, but a momentum shift had not looked likely until Wilson struck, stretching out a boot and beating Cech and Chambers to a ball swung in invitingly by Fraser. Callum Wilson scores Bournemouth's first goal Wilson swiftly turned provider as Arsenal lapsed at the back again, the striker afforded time to control Smith's pass, before letting Ibe lash low. Theo Walcott followed Aaron Ramsey off the bench but, having surrendered the lead, Arsenal never looked like mustering the response that earned Howe's men - now up to 13th - a timely first win over desperately disappointing opponents. Opta stats Bournemouth have recorded their first win against a side from the 'big six' in the Premier League since December 2016 (4-3 v Liverpool), ending a run of 14 winless games (D3 L11), including nine successive losses. Arsenal have picked up just 13 points after 12 Premier League away games (W3 D4 L5) - their worst record at this stage of a season since 2005-06 (12 points from 12 games). Arsenal have lost the last three Premier League games that Alexis Sanchez hasn't played any part in - 0-1 at Stoke, 1-2 at Watford and today against Bournemouth. At average age of 25 years and 56 days old, Arsene Wenger named his youngest Arsenal starting line-up in the Premier League since November 2012 v Aston Villa (25y 11d). Man of the match - Callum Wilson Jordon Ibe struck the winner but Callum Wilson proved pivotal, showing desire to poach the equaliser and then strength to hold up a ball with back to goal and set up the decisive strike. He has now scored three goals in three Premier League games against the Gunners - and recorded his first Premier League assist in this contest. What's next?

Highlights: Liverpool 4-3 Man City Liverpool brought Manchester City's unbeaten domestic run crashing to an end with a scintillating 4-3 victory at Anfield on Nissan Super Sunday. Sensational goals from Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah in nine devastating second-half minutes saw Liverpool become the first British side to beat Pep Guardiola's men since Arsenal in the FA Cup last April, ending their 33-game unbeaten domestic run in the process. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had fired the Reds ahead inside nine minutes, only for Leroy Sane to haul the runaway Premier League leaders level before half-time. Late goals from Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan set up a tense finale, and Sergio Aguero headed a late chance wide, but Liverpool held on to avenge September's 5-0 thumping at the hands of City, whose 81-year wait for a league double over the Reds extended. Player ratings Liverpool: Karius (6), Gomez (6), Lovren (6), Matip (7), Robertson (8), Wijnaldum (8), Can (8), Oxlade-Chamberlain (8), Salah (8), Mane (8), Firmino (8). Subs: Milner (6), Lallana (6), Klavan (n/a). Man City: Ederson (5), Walker (6), Otamendi (5), Stones (5), Delph (5), Fernandinho (6), Gundogan (6), Sterling (5), De Bruyne (6), Sane (6), Aguero (5). Subs: Danilo (5), B. Silva (6). Man of the Match: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Both sides lived up to their pre-match billing, trading blows from the first whistle before Liverpool drew first blood as Oxlade-Chamberlain's low 20-yard drive flew past Ederson. Liverpool continued to exert pressure but City steadied themselves and almost levelled through Aguero on 20 minutes, but he narrowly missed Kevin De Bruyne's cross. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrates giving Liverpool a ninth-minute lead Dejan Lovren, filling in for the injured Virgil van Dijk, then deflected a Sane shot inches wide soon after, while a bobbling De Bruyne effort saw City register their first attempt on target with 35 minutes on the clock. Ederson was a match to Salah's curled effort but the same could not be said for Loris Karius in the 40th minute as Sane's fierce near-post drive flashed home to haul City level before the interval. Leroy Sane scores for Manchester City against Liverpool in the Premier League. The second half continued in the same vein as Nicolas Otamendi crashed a header against the bar on 51 minutes, but Liverpool then embarked on a scintillating spell from which City could not recover. Ederson made saves from Salah and Oxlade-Chamberlain in quick succession before Salah clipped the bar at the end of a pulsating 56th minute. But the pressure soon told as Firmino shrugged off John Stones before chipping over the City 'keeper and into the net via the post. Team news Jurgen Klopp decided not to risk Virgil van Dijk, who sat out due to a hamstring strain, as Dejan Lovren returned. Mohamed Salah and Georginio Wijnaldum returned in the two other changes from Liverpool’s FA Cup win over Everton. Ederson, Kyle Walker, Nicolas Otamendi, Fabian Delph, Fernandinho and Sergio Aguero were recalled as Pep Guardiola made six changes to the side that beat Bristol City in the Carabao Cup. Mane then struck the post before thundering home a left-footed drive from the edge of the area, and a shell-shocked City went further behind as Salah punished Ederson's poor clearance to make it four with a lofted, long-range strike. Substitute Silva and Gundogan threatened to inspire the most remarkable comeback but, after Aguero headed wide in stoppage-time, City were left to come to terms with their first Premier League defeat since losing at Chelsea on April 5 2017. Sadio Mane put Liverpool 3-1 up with a thunderous left-footed drive Opta stats Liverpool inflicted Manchester City's first Premier League defeat since last April against Chelsea, bringing an end to their 30-game unbeaten run. Pep Guardiola has lost five matches against Jurgen Klopp in his managerial career, more than against any other manager. This was Manchester City's first 4-3 defeat in the Premier League since they lost to Manchester United by that scoreline in September 2009. Manchester City's run of 22 matches unbeaten from the start of the season can be bettered by only two teams in Premier League history - Arsenal in 2003-04 (38 games) and Man Utd in 2010/11 (24 games). Mo Salah has scored 24 goals and assisted another seven in 30 appearances for Liverpool in all competitions this season. The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"That's a game which proves why many people love this game. That is football. That's how football can look if two teams combine quality, skills with attitude. I never thought the result would be 4-1, even when we were 4-1 up, because for them it's always possible to come back. But we deserved the three points.\" Jurgen Klopp praised both Liverpool and Manchester City for the way both sides played during the Reds' 4-3 win over league leaders City Jurgen Klopp praised both Liverpool and Manchester City for the way both sides played during the Reds' 4-3 win over league leaders City Pep Guardiola: \"Congratulations Liverpool for the victory. I have to give credit to the opponent. We know how difficult Anfield is and how aggressive Jurgen Klopp's side are. We tried to make good build-up and found the spaces sometimes, but credit to Liverpool. You have to live this kind of situation during the season.\" Man City boss Pep Guardiola congratulated Liverpool on their 4-3 win over his side and insisted that they must now turn focus on their next game Man City boss Pep Guardiola congratulated Liverpool on their 4-3 win over his side and insisted that they must now turn focus on their next game Man of the Match - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Many questions have been asked about how Liverpool will go about replacing Philippe Coutinho but Oxlade-Chamberlain showed he is ready to step up. The former Arsenal forward has had a slow start to his Anfield career but he was outstanding on this occasion. His goal was a superb individual effort, with a crisp low drive capping a fine run. He seemed everywhere thereafter, contributing in defence and attack. What's next? Liverpool return to action at Swansea on Monday Night Football on January 22, while Manchester City look to return to winning ways two days earlier when they host Newcastle."}, {"date": "13/01/2018",

Leicester Chelsea 0-0 Leicester Chelsea failed to win for the fourth match in a row in all competitions as they scraped a 0-0 draw against 10-man Leicester on Saturday. The Blues had won their previous seven Premier League home matches, but were fortunate not to lose to the Foxes after a lacklustre display. Shinji Okazaki, Wilfred Ndidi and Riyad Mahrez all went close as the visitors created a number of chances in a dominant opening hour. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (6), Azpilicueta (6), Cahill (5), Rudiger (5), Moses (6), Bakayoko (5), Kante (5), Fabregas (4), Alonso (6), Hazard (4), Morata (4) Subs: Christensen (6), Willian (5), Pedro (5) Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Amartey (7), Maguire (8), Dragovic (7), Chilwell (5), Mahrez (8), Ndidi (7), James (7), Albrighton (6), Okazaki (7), Vardy (6) Subs: Gray (5), Iborra (5), Fuchs (5) Man of the match: Harry Maguire Ben Chilwell was sent off for the visitors in the 68th minute for a second yellow card, but Chelsea still created few clear openings and remain without a win in 2018. Antonio Conte had said before the match that Leicester were the \"worst\" side for Chelsea to face after a busy recent run of fixtures, and so it proved as the visitors came flying out of the traps and immediately applied pressure. Jamie Vardy pulls a shot across goal in the first half Okazaki missed the target from eight yards out, Jamie Vardy poked a shot wide and then dragged another across goal before Thibaut Courtois made an excellent diving stop to keep out a header from Ndidi. Kasper Schmiechel was hardly tested at the other end aside from pushing an effort from Cesc Fabregas away. And Leicester continued to create chances against a below-par Chelsea, with Mahrez firing over from the penalty spot and Marc Albrighton shooting past the post. Team news Rudiger started for Chelsea ahead of Christensen, with Barkley and Drinkwater not in the squad. Vardy, Chilwell and Dragovic came into the Leicester starting XI from their win over Huddersfield in their previous Premier League match. Chelsea lost Gary Cahill to injury and did not improve after half-time as the Foxes controlled possession and went close to the opener with a deflected shot from Mahrez that spun just wide. The hosts were handed a way into the game when Chilwell was dismissed after two bookings in five minutes, but even then the closest they came was an effort from Tiemoue Bakayoko that went over the bar. Opta stats Chelsea have drawn three consecutive games 0-0 in all competitions for the first time in their history. Leicester had 12 shots in the first half - the most of any visiting team in the opening 45 minutes of a Premier League match at Stamford Bridge since 2003-04. However, they managed just two shots after the interval. The Foxes have kept consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since May 2017. Only Watford (4) have been shown more red cards than Leicester (3) in the Premier League this season. The managers Antonio Conte: \"Everyone is frustrated after another 0-0. We played the game against Arsenal on Wednesday night and didn't have a lot of time to recover. I saw many players were very tired and they didn't recover from the Arsenal game. But at the same time I saw great will and desire to win the game.\" Chelsea’s Antonio Conte said everyone is frustrated after drawing 0-0 with Leicester Chelsea’s Antonio Conte said everyone is frustrated after drawing 0-0 with Leicester Claude Puel: \"We deserved the point and perhaps more with all the chances we had. In the first half it was crazy not to find the possibility to score...we had a lot of chances without finding the clinical edge.\" Leicester’s Claude Puel said he was disappointed with only a point Leicester’s Claude Puel said he was disappointed with only a point Man of the match - Harry Maguire It was a close call between the excellent Mahrez and Maguire, but the defender shades it for an impressive display, even after his side had been reduced to 10 men. He looked composed on the ball, showed good strength on several occasions to win possession and kept Morata under wraps throughout. It was the kind of performance that might only serve to increase interest in his services from Manchester City. What's next? Chelsea have a busy upcoming schedule ahead as they host Norwich in an FA Cup replay on Wednesday and then travel to Brighton on Saturday in the Premier League, live on Sky Sports. They then take on Arsenal in the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on January, Wednesday 24, also live on Sky Sports.

Sako's first-half goal was enough to continue Crystal Palace's Premier League resurgence as they ground out a narrow 1-0 victory over Burnley at Selhurst Park. Roy Hodgson's side took a 21st-minute lead against the below-par Clarets when Sako picked up Christian Benteke's pass and fired an angled shot through the legs of James Tarkowski and past goalkeeper Nick Pope. The second half was devoid of any real chances for either side to kill the game, though Sam Vokes and Ashley Barnes were presented with half-chances to force an equaliser for the visitors and Benteke headed over from close range.

Fed by strike partner Benteke, Sako drifted out to the left-hand side, jinked past Phil Bardsley as he entered the box, before hitting an angled shot past Pope. Roy Hodgson has guided the Eagles to 12th place in the Premier League after their uncertain start to the season While Tarkowski looked shaky on a number of occasions, fellow centre-back Ben Mee made a key challenge three minutes later when he raced back to deny James McArthur a certain goal after Wilfried Zaha had chipped the ball over the onrushing Pope. The first half had been difficult for the Clarets in terms of chances created, and the second half continued in a similar fashion with the visitors unable to bring either Vokes or Barnes into the game to test Wayne Hennessey. Team news Roy Hodgson made four changes from the side that lost 2-1 to Brighton in the FA Cup on Monday evening, with Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke among those returning. Yohan Cabaye dropped to the bench, while Andros Townsend and Jeffrey Schlupp missed out as the latest additions to the casualty list at Selhurst Park. Sean Dyche made three changes of his own for the trip to the capital after the Clarets' FA Cup thrashing by Man City last weekend. Phil Bardsley, James Tarkowski and Steven Defour returned, with Tottenham loanee Georges-Kevin N’Koudou forced to settle for a place on the bench. Tottenham loanee Georges-Kevin N'Koudou was introduced just after the hour mark and showed some flashes of the flair he is capable of, but as Sean Dyche's men rallied and to get themselves back into contention, Benteke came within inches of making it two. The Belgian frontman ghosted past Mee before pulling the trigger inside the 18-yard box, but Tarkowski's subsequent presence seemingly distracted him and he could only drive a shot into the side netting. Opta stats The Eagles' victory today was their 50th at home in the Premier League. Crystal Palace have kept consecutive home clean sheets in the Premier League - having kept just one in their previous 14 at Selhurst Park. Bakary Sako has scored more goals in all competitions than any other Crystal Palace player, with his strike today being his sixth of the season. Goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey made more passes than any other Crystal Palace player in the match (36). Only Southampton (10) are on a current longer winless run in the Premier League than Burnley (6). Man of the match - Timothy Fosu-Mensah Another stellar showing from the Manchester United loanee as he helped his loan employers to a second clean sheet in three Premier League games. The Dutchman put in a performance that defied his 20 years, winning an extraordinary seven tackles as the Eagles kept Sean Dyche's men at bay and ground out a narrow victory over this season's overperformers. Timothy Fosu-Mensah impressed once again for Palace The managers Roy Hodgson: \"I have no desire in January to celebrate being in 12th place. The only thing that interests me is where we are on the final day, and being one place above the relegation zone. Anything else would be a huge bonus, especially having seven games, seven defeats and no goals. \"It's nice now that things are no longer looking so bleak, and we should enjoy that, but there will be lots more games like today where you do enough to merit the three points, and then suffer in the second half because a one-goal lead can always be cancelled out.\" Sean Dyche: \"I was pleased particularly with the second half today. I thought they were better in the first half and they played a very simple format but delivered it well in a 4-2-4, getting the ball forward quickly and looked a handful. \"But in saying that, we've come a long way as a club and I was so pleased in the second half; we are on the front foot, we are going after teams away from home and that's a good sign of some of the work we've done and the way the team has progressed this season. I've been pleased with that but we've got to get back to winning ways.\" Burnley’s Sean Dyche insists Burnley are moving forward despite the side being six games without a win following their defeat to Crystal Palace. Burnley’s Sean Dyche insists Burnley are moving forward despite the side being six games without a win following their defeat to Crystal Palace. What's next?

Mark Noble capitalised on a mix-up between Jonas Lossl and Joe Lolley to give the Hammers the lead with a cool finish (25), before Lolley made amends five minutes before the interval with a sublime equaliser for the Terriers. Marko Arnautovic restored West Ham's lead just 11 seconds into the second period when he latched onto Cheikhou Kouyate's flick, and the Austrian then turned provider for Lanzini's first away Premier League goal since November 2016 (56). Manuel Lanzini scores West Ham's third goal Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (5), Smith (6), Malone (6), Schindler (5), Zanka (5), Hogg (5), Mooy (6), Van La Parra (6), Ince (5), Lolley (6), Depoitre (5). Subs: Kongolo (6), Pritchard (6) West Ham: Adrian (6), Cresswell (7), Zabaleta (7), Ogbonna (7), Collins (7), Masuaku (7), Obiang (7), Noble (7), Kouyate (7), Lanzini (8), Arnautovic (9). Subs: Ayew (6), Rice (n/a) Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic Lanzini completed the rout five minutes later following another swift counter-attack as the Hammers moved above their opponents into 11th in the table, with Huddersfield dropping to 13th place. Moyes has now completed a double century of wins in the English top flight, with only Harry Redknapp, Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson - watching on from the stands at the John Smith's Stadium - having achieved more. After a cagey opening, West Ham profited from a disastrous breakdown in communication between Huddersfield 'keeper Lossl and Lolley from a goal-kick, as Arnautovic forced the midfielder into conceding possession on the edge of his own penalty area, allowing Noble to sweep in the 50th goal of his career. Mark Noble fired West Ham in front after a defensive mix-up Team news Huddersfield made three changes as Scott Malone, Jonathan Hogg and Laurent Depoitre replaced Chris Lowe, Danny Williams and Steve Mounie. James Collins returned to the West Ham defence along with Aaron Cresswell in place of Winston Reid and Declan Rice while Marko Arnautovic replaced Javier Hernandez up front. But Huddersfield, and in particular Lolley, responded well to the setback. Lanzini over-ran the ball to Mathias Jorgensen and, once Tom Ince had invited Tommy Smith forward from the right, the ball was worked wide by Aaron Mooy to Lolley and he stepped inside Noble to curl a wonderful strike into the bottom corner. David Wagner's side finished the half in the ascendancy but they were made to pay for a sluggish start to the second period as, from the kick-off, Angelo Ogbonna's long ball forward was flicked on by Kouyate to Arnautovic, who lifted the ball over Smith before firing low to Lossl's left and into the net. The Terriers were rocked by the bolt out of the blue, and their problems increased as, five minutes later, Arnautovic sped away from Christopher Schindler to lay the ball into Lanzini's path and the Argentinian flashed his shot across Lossl for a slick third. Joe Lolley equalised for Huddersfield with a brilliant strike five minutes before the break Moyes was delighted to call upon Arnautovic after he recovered from a hamstring injury, and further signs of his blossoming relationship with Lanzini were on show for West Ham's fourth as the Austrian winger spun Schindler on the touchline before allowing Lanzini to take the ball off his toes to cut inside and blast his second into the roof of the net. Opta stats This was David Moyes' 200th win as a manager in the Premier League, becoming the fourth person to achieve this feat after Alex Ferguson (528), Arsene Wenger (468) and Harry Redknapp (236). West Ham have won eight points in their last four Premier League away games (W2 D2 L0), as many as in their previous 15 combined. 69 per cent of Huddersfield's home goals conceded in the Premier League this season have been against London clubs (11/16). Huddersfield have conceded seven goals in their last two Premier League games, this after conceding six across their previous six. Marko Arnautovic is the sixth player to score in 3+ consecutive Premier League away games for West Ham and first since Diafra Sakho in October 2014. Mark Noble has now scored (35) or assisted (27) 62 Premier League goals for West Ham - only Paolo Di Canio (78) has had a hand in more for the club. Marko Arnautovic produced a sublime finish to restore the Hammers' lead The managers David Wagner: \"It was a frustrating day because we made too many easy mistakes. The first is an individual mistake that should never happen. With the second one we needed to be stronger and we tried to play offside for the third. \"West Ham have creative individuals who were able to hurt us. We had too many players who were below par today. \"We have to make sure this never happens again, but we know exactly what went wrong. Unfortunately not everything in football goes to plan.\" David Wagner says his Huddersfield side made easy mistakes that you can’t do in the Premier League as they fell to a 4-1 defeat against West Ham. David Wagner says his Huddersfield side made easy mistakes that you can’t do in the Premier League as they fell to a 4-1 defeat against West Ham. David Moyes: \"It's a really big win. The teams from 10th down, anyone can beat each other on any day so it's a big win for us. \"I was a bit disappointed going in 1-1 at half-time, and we told them that. I want our fans to see what we can be like, we're giving fans a reason for coming away from London for away games. \"We had fantastic support and hopefully this attracts more players to the club.\" David Moyes praises his forwards but insists it was a team effort as West Ham won 4-1 at Huddersfield in the Premier League. David Moyes praises his forwards but insists it was a team effort as West Ham won 4-1 at Huddersfield in the Premier League. The pundit Matt Le Tissier: \"Arnautovic was outstanding this afternoon. He was different class and was the difference between the two teams He was a thorn in the Huddersfield side. \"I don't know what Moyes has done to him, but he looked like an absolute world-beater today. \"Once West Ham got in front in the second half, Huddersfield over-committed men forward and Lanzini was able to profit from that. On the counter, they looked very dangerous.\" Matt Le Tissier reflects on West Ham's 4-1 rout at Huddersfield where a brace from Manuel Lanzini and goals from Mark Noble and Marko Arnautovic condemned the Terriers to defeat. Matt Le Tissier reflects on West Ham's 4-1 rout at Huddersfield where a brace from Manuel Lanzini and goals from Mark Noble and Marko Arnautovic condemned the Terriers to defeat. Man of the match - Marko Arnautovic Arnautovic was absent from West Ham's goalless draw with Shrewsbury Town in the FA Cup third round, but David Moyes' decision to protect him was vindicated as the Austrian returned to torment the Huddersfield defence with another display of his improvement since the Scot's arrival. It's now six goals in his last seven games for Arnautovic, who provided Manuel Lanzini with both his strikes - meaning for the first time in his Premier League career, the forward was involved in three goals in a single game. What's next? Huddersfield will look to regroup when they head to the bet365 Stadium to face Stoke City next Saturday, while West Ham have an FA Cup third-round replay against Shrewsbury Town on Tuesday before entertaining Bournemouth at the London Stadium next Saturday."}, {"date": "13/01/2018", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51444, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup":

earn Newcastle a point from a 1-1 draw at St James' Park. After Newcastle missed a number of chances to take the lead, Jordan Ayew headed Swansea in front on the hour-mark. Joselu levelled for the Magpies in the 68th minute - just four minutes after replacing Dwight Gayle - although the Swans could have stolen all three points in injury-time when Wilfried Bony saw his shot cleared off the line by DeAndre Yedlin. The draw leaves Swansea four points from safety, while Newcastle sit 14th in the Premier League table, three points above the drop zone, and now winless in their last seven league games at home. Player ratings Newcastle: Darlow (6), Yedlin (6), Clark (7), Lascelles (6), Dummett (7), Shelvey (6), Diame (6), Ritchie (7), Perez (6), Atsu (7), Gayle (7) Subs: Joselu (6), Merino (n/a) Swansea: Fabianski (6), Bartley (7), Van der Hoorn (6), Mawson (7), Olsson (7), Carroll (7), Clucas (6), Ki (6), Dyer (6), Ayew (6), McBurnie (5) Subs: Roberts (6), Bony (6), Narsingh (n/a) Man of the match: Kyle Bartley Gayle twice came close to breaking the deadlock for Newcastle, but he directed a first header straight at Lukasz Fabianski in the Swansea goal before sending a second wide of the mark. Newcastle continued to press for an opener, but Ayoze Perez squandered the best opportunity of the half when firing too close to Fabianski after Matt Ritchie's delightful ball over the top. Carlos Carvalhal's side remain bottom of the Premier League table, four points from safety Swansea saw claims for a penalty turned down before half-time, with referee Graham Scott waving away protests despite Mo Diame appearing to block Mike van der Hoorn's attempt with his elbow. Team news Newcastle made four changes to the side that beat Luton 3-1 in the FA Cup, with Karl Darlow, DeAndre Yedlin, Mo Diame and Christian Atsu all returning to the XI. Tammy Abraham (hip) and Renato Sanches (hamstring) were out for the visitors, while Ki Sung-Yeung returned as one of seven changes to the side that drew 0-0 with Wolves. After the break, Gayle sent an effort wide of Fabianski's far post, and Newcastle were made to pay for their missed chances when Swansea struck with 60 minutes on the clock. Ayew's initial header was superbly saved by Karl Darlow, but the rebound fell kindly for the Swansea forward, who made no mistake with his second header. Rafael Benitez responded by replacing Gayle with Joselu, and the move paid off when the forward latched onto a rebound and rolled the ball into the far corner. Joselu celebrates his goal with Jonjo Shelvey Swansea substitute Bony could have grabbed the headlines in the third minute of stoppage time, but his low effort was blocked by Yedlin on the line after Darlow had come out to deny Luciano Narsingh. Opta stats Newcastle have failed to win any of their last seven home Premier League games (D2 L5) - their longest winless run since April 2009 under Joe Kinnear and also Alan Shearer (8 games). Indeed, it's Rafael Benitez's longest winless run on home soil in the Premier League as manager. Swansea have won four points in their two Premier League away games under Carlos Carvalhal - as many as they'd won in their previous nine in the top flight. The Swans have kept just one clean sheet in their last 10 Premier League games, conceding 20 goals in the process. All four of Joselu's Premier League goals for Newcastle have come on home soil. Man of the match - Kyle Bartley After picking up a yellow card 10 minutes into the match, Bartley looked somewhat cagey for the remainder of the first half, knowing he was one mistake away from an early bath. However, the Swansea captain typified their resolute performance after the break, making a match-high eight clearances, as well as two tackles and one block to deny Newcastle on numerous occasions. Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez says his side should of took their chances in the first half of their 1-1 draw against Swansea in the Premier League. Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez says his side should of took their chances in the first half of their 1-1 draw against Swansea in the Premier League.

The team has to take their chances, not just the strikers. If we create, it doesn't matter if it's a winger or a midfielder, we have to be more clinical in front of goal.\" Swansea boss Carlos Carvalhal believed his side should have had a penalty after a Mo Diame handball in his side’s 1-1 draw against Newcastle in the Premier League.

Watford a dramatic 2-2 draw against Southampton. Midfielder James Ward-Prowse scored twice for Mauricio Pellegrino's side in the first half (20, 44) but Andre Gray pulled one back for Watford just before the hour mark, before Doucoure levelled things up in the last minute, stooping to head home but sweeping in with his arm. Southampton's protestations to referee Roger East were lengthy but to no avail, with a draw leaving them just one point above the relegation zone. Player ratings Watford: Gomes (7), Janmaat (7), Wague (6), Kabasele (7), Zeegelaar (6), Cleverley (5), Doucoure (6), Watson (5), Carrillo (6), Richarlison (6), Gray (7).

Subs: Lemina (6), Boufal (n/a), Sims (n/a) Man of the match: Troy Deeney Ward-Prowse's first goal came thanks to determined work from Shane Long down the right who pulled the ball from the right for the midfielder to calmly slot home. Southampton centre-back Wesley Hoedt almost made it 2-0 in the 26th minute when he decided to try and chip Heurelho Gomes from 40 yards but the goalkeeper just about got back in time to divert the ball away. James Ward-Prowse is congratulated by team-mates after making it 1-0 The home team were second best in every department, summed up by Daryl Janmaat losing a 50-50 with Tadic, allowing the Southampton man to cross for Long who would have scored if it wasn't for a last-ditch block from Marvin Zeegelaar. It was Long's work-rate which brought the second goal as he raced onto a clearance, before playing in Dusan Tadic who held the ball until Ward-Prowse reached the area and the laid it off so he could get his second of the match. Team news Following their FA Cup escapades last week, there were a few changes for both teams. There were three changes for Watford as Ben Watson, Richarlison and Andre Gray came in for Etienne Capoue, Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney. Mauricio Pellegrino mixed things up at the back by replacing Jan Bednarek and Maya Yoshida with Cedric Soares and Wesley Hoedt, while Dusan Tadic came in for Sofiane Boufal further up the pitch. Troy Deeney's half-time introduction made Watford look a more dangerous side, and he set up Janmaat for a shot which Alex McCarthy had to tip onto the bar, only for Gray to head home the rebound from three yards out. After considerable pressure from Watford, Doucoure finally made it pay when he latched onto a chipped pass from Deeney in the 90th minute, but the midfielder missed the ball with his head so palmed it beyond the onrushing Alex McCarthy. There were protestations aplenty from Southampton and Doucoure looked sheepish as he ran off to celebrate after a quick look at the assistant referee but the goal stood. The draw means Southampton, who sit in 16th place, have not won in the last 10 games, while Watford are in 10th. The managers Marco Silva: \"Everybody has seen the goal, I don't need to talk about the goal. Something can happen, and this season we've had other moments when the decisions are against us, but that is football. I understand Southampton, I understand their manager, they are unhappy like I was more than one time in games when mistakes are against us.\" Marco Silva says he understands Southampton’s frustration over Abdoulaye Doucoure’s equaliser but insists Watford have had other moments this season where decisions went against them. Marco Silva says he understands Southampton’s frustration over Abdoulaye Doucoure’s equaliser but insists Watford have had other moments this season where decisions went against them. Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It [the handball] is so clear, the linesman is there but there's nothing we can do. We expect this that they will react, especially with direct play with the strikers but I think we controlled well much of the time but with this direct action we didn't have this fortune that you need to win this type of game \"For us it is difficult to analyse as they didn't create many chances. But for long ball, second ball, they've got strong players and every single action is dangerous. \"We made a couple of mistakes in the second-half but even with this we didn't deserve to draw this game.\" Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino was disappointed to see Watford’s late equaliser not ruled out for handball after his side drew 2-2 in the Premier League.

Abdoulaye Doucoure has scored more goals (7) and more home goals (4) than any other Watford player in the Premier League this term. What's next? In a week's time, Watford will travel to face Leicester. Southampton have a tough task ahead of them on Sunday, January 21 when they host Tottenham, live on Sky Sports Premier League. Man of the match - Troy Deeney The Watford skipper was inspirational after he came off the bench at half-time.

Evans, who has been linked with a move away from the Hawthorns, put the hosts ahead in the fourth minute before Dawson doubled their lead 10 minutes after half-time. Brighton came closest to pulling a goal back through Anthony Knockaert, who skied his effort over the bar from close-range midway through the second half, but West Brom held on for a comfortable victory. Three points for Pardew means West Brom are now two points off Premier League safety, while Chris Hughton's Brighton drop down to 15th.

Matt Phillips' drilled corner was instinctively nodded on by Jay Rodriguez before Evans acrobatically nodded the ball home from close range. The hosts continued to pile on the pressure with Dawson coming close five minutes later from another Phillips corner as Brighton continued to struggle defending set-pieces. On the half-hour mark, appeals for a West Brom penalty were turned after Phillips' rifled shot hit Glenn Murray's arm before Lewis Dunk came close moments later. His close-range effort was well blocked by Dawson in what was a comfortable first-half performance from Pardew's men. Team news Three changes for West Brom. Craig Dawson, Jonny Evans and Matt Phillips came in for Allan Nyom, Gareth McAuley and James McClean. Brighton made eight changes to the side that beat Palace 2-1 in the FA Cup on Monday night. Even though Brighton started the second half on the front foot, Dawson doubled West Brom's lead. Chris Brunt's driven cross was ferociously attacked by the right-back, who bulleted his header into the ground before the ball bounced into the roof of the net. Brighton responded by applying some heavy pressure and were helped by the introduction of Sam Baldock off the bench. He kick-started a chance for Murray before he found Knockaert, but somehow the Frenchman missed the glorious opportunity from five-yards out despite having plenty of space and time. 4 - All four of West Brom's Premier League goals at the Hawthorns under Alan Pardew have come from set pieces (three from corners and one from the penalty spot). Schemers. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) January 13, 2018 Evans and Dawson both had to hobble off late on while Salomon Rondon saw two shots from range narrowly miss the goal in added time to conclude a momentous day for Pardew while ending West Brom's 20-match winless run in the league. Opta stats Alan Pardew picked up his first Premier League win in charge of West Brom, in what was the Baggies' first win in the competition by more than one goal since March 2017 (3-1 v Arsenal). The Seagulls have won just one of their last 12 games in the Premier League (D5 L6), failing to score at all in eight of these fixtures. Chris Hughton hasn't won any of his five games against Alan Pardew-led sides in the Premier League (D2 L3), managing just one goal across those meetings. Excluding penalties, Brighton have conceded more goals from set pieces than any other team in the Premier League this season (16). Man of the Match - Craig Dawson Dawson headed in West Brom's second goal The 27-year-old performed excellently down the right flank for West Brom as he caused Brighton's defence all kinds of problems with his positioning and physicality. As well as coming close from another corner, he nearly grabbed a goal at the near post up against goalkeeper Mat Ryan. But he was rewarded for his hard work with a superb second goal as he showed great desire to double West Brom's lead. Unfortunately, though, he had to leave the pitch following a head collision with Ahmed Hegazi.

Some really good performances today. I was really pleased for the players. They've responded well since I've been in and its nice that they're seeing the reward for the work we've put in at the training ground.\" Chris Hughton says his Brighton side weren’t productive enough in front of goal as they lost 2-0 to West Brom. Chris Hughton says his Brighton side weren’t productive enough in front of goal as they lost 2-0 to West Brom. Chris Hughton: \"Hugely disappointing because I don't think there was a lot between the two teams. \"We found it difficult defending set plays and corners and we've conceded goals and worked as hard on defending set plays as we have done all season and that's the difference between the two teams. \"The first goal really hurts us because you saw the crowd here today and they're buoyed by the fact they're 1-0 up. The fact they don't get that goal I think we are right in it. On the balance of play I don't think there was much difference between the two teams.\" What's next?

Gylfi Sigurdsson's corner was flicked on by debutant Cenk Tosun, finding the head of Wayne Rooney, and although his glancing effort beat Hugo Lloris, the linesman already had his flag raised. Team news Tottenham made one change with Mousa Dembele replacing Moussa Sissoko. Cenk Tosun made his Everton debut in one of six changes as Gylfi Sigurdsson, James McCarthy, Idrissa Gueye, Jonjoe Kenny and Phil Jagielka also came into the side. This seemed to put the fire into Tottenham as Son scored the opening not long after. A great switch of flanks from Eriksen saw him pick out Serge Aurier on the right hand side, who in turn fizzed an inviting ball into the box. Son was there waiting to tap home, and continue his fine run of form in front of goal. The South Korea international was involved again as Kane netted his first of the game two minutes after the restart. He took the ball around Jonjoe Kenny before bursting down the left-hand side, with his cross into the box tapped home by a waiting Kane as he equalled Sheringham's record. Son could have added the third in the 58th minute, collecting a cross-field pass from Kane before cutting across the top of the box and striking, but his thunderous effort thrashed against the woodwork before going wide, although Kane made sure to net another Spurs goal a minute later. Heung-Min Son celebrates after giving Tottenham a first half lead Eric Dier curled the ball into the area and Kane was again waiting to tap home, with the effort ricocheting off his foot and shin before bobbling past Jordan Pickford as he took his Premier League goals tally for Tottenham to 98 and became their leading goalscorer in the competition - and counting. But perhaps the best goal of the evening came in the 81st minute after a fine flowing move saw Eriksen net Spurs' fourth. Five players were involved in the build-up, but it was a superb back heel from Alli at the edge of the box that found Eriksen on the left, before he powered home to seal a superb Spurs victory. Opta stats Phil Jagielka challenges Harry Kane during the game at Wembley Harry Kane became only the third player to score at least 20 goals in four consecutive Premier League campaigns, after Thierry Henry (5) and Alan Shearer (4). This was Tottenham's biggest margin of victory in a game against Everton since a 10-4 win in October 1958. The result was also Sam Allardyce's 19th Premier League defeat by four or more goals - the most of any manager in the competition. Everton failed to record a shot on target for the fourth time in a Premier League match this season - no side has failed to do so in more games (Swansea also 4). The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"He [Harry Kane] can do everything because of his mentality and how he is as a professional. He can achieve all he wishes and he wants. \"It is unbelievable the way that he is able to work and his willingness. He is always thinking to try to improve, improve, improve, score goals and improve for the team.\" Sam Allardyce was disappointed by the performance from his side Sam Allardyce: \"Maybe I have a bit of responsibility by playing too much attacking-minded players and not as many defending-minded players. I should have got back to being a bit more boring and a bit less adventurous. \"It was a shock second-half performance. I saw some of the good signs of the players last week against Liverpool, and I saw some of the worst signs second half tonight. It was massively worrying in terms of how can a performance become so bad in such a short period of time.\" Man of the match - Heung-Min Son Heung-Min Son celebrates with Dele Alli and Harry Kane after scoring While Kane may take the headlines for breaking more records, it was in fact Son who was the most attacking player on the field and was involved in three of the four Spurs goals. He continually powered towards goal whenever he had possession, linking up superbly with Alli and Kane on numerous occasions. He could have added more to tally too, having been denied by the woodwork and goalkeeper Pickford. And of course, let's not forget he matched his own record on Saturday, scoring in five successive home Premier League games and will be hoping to surpass this against Manchester United in a few weeks' time (January 31). 5 - Son Heung-Min is just the second Spurs player to score in five consecutive home Premier League games after Jermain Defoe, who did so between November and December 2004.

West Ham Heung-Min Son's late piledriver cancelled out Pedro Obiang's stunning effort to spare Tottenham's blushes in a 1-1 draw with West Ham at Wembley. The relegation-threatened Hammers spent the majority of the game on the back foot but Obiang's 70th-minute thunderbolt - their first shot on target - moved them to within reach of an unlikely victory. But Son's 10th goal of the season salvaged a point for Spurs, who remain fifth in the Premier League. David Moyes' men extended their unbeaten Wembley run to nine games, and climbed up to 15th in the table as a result. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (5), Aurier (6), Vertonghen (6), Sanchez (6), Davies (6), Dier (6), Sissoko (5), Alli (6), Eriksen (6), Son (7), Kane (6). Subs: Lamela (5), Wanyama (5), Llorente (5). West Ham: Adrian (7), Zabaleta (7), Ogbonna (7), Reid (7), Rice (7), Obiang (8), Kouyate (6), Masuaku (6), Lanzini (6), Noble (6), Chicarito (6). Subs: Carroll (6), Ayew (6). Man of the Match: Pedro Obiang West Ham's goal was under threat from the first whistle. Declan Rice was forced to hook a Kane effort, which flashed across goal, away on four minutes before a flap from Adrian at the resulting corner presented Eric Dier with a chance, but his effort was blocked. The Hammers weathered the early Spurs onslaught but remained firmly on the back foot; the offside flag coming to their rescue as Kane's deflected effort was correctly ruled out. Harry Kane was unable to extend his record scoring run into 2018 Kane drew Adrian into action with the game's first shot on target on 28 minutes, and Son and Eriksen tested the Hammers goalkeeper soon after as Spurs cranked up the pressure. However, West Ham reached the interval unscathed, with Kane unable to take Serge Aurier's 34th-minute knock-down into his stride before Eriksen's deflected effort drew a fingertip save from Adrian. Team news Despite having just a 48-hour turnaround from their last outings, both managers made just three changes apiece. Mauricio Pochettino recalled Harry Kane, Serge Aurier and Moussa Sissoko following Spurs’ win at Swansea, while David Moyes drafted in Mark Noble, Declan Rice and Javier Hernandez – Andy Carroll dropped to the bench despite his two goals against West Brom. A misplaced pass from Davinson Sanchez released Javier Hernandez through on goal shortly before the hour, but the Spurs centre-back showed great pace to recover. Pablo Zabaleta's last-gasp intervention denied Kane at the end of a flowing 67th-minute attack, with Alli heading the rebound over, and West Ham's dogged defensive display was soon rewarded as Obiang's thunderous strike beat Hugo Lloris all ends up. Pedro Obiang celebrates his spectacular strike Spurs stirred but required a moment of brilliance to break West Ham's resolve as Son's swerving 25-yard effort found the top corner. The hosts then pushed for a winner, but the Hammers held on for a valiant point at the home of their fierce rivals.

Opta stats In four London derbies in all competitions under David Moyes, West Ham have managed just three shots on target. However, they've scored two of them, and have lost just once (W1 D2). Pedro Obiang's strike in the 70th minute was West Ham's first shot of any kind in this match. Son Heung-min has been directly involved in 12 goals in his last nine home games for Tottenham in all competition (7 goals, 5 assists). Spurs have never lost a Premier League game on a Thursday (P11 W6 D5 L0) - it's the highest number of games played by a team on a specific day without defeat in the competitions history. Harry Kane has scored just three goals in his last 10 Premier League London derby matches, failing to find the net on eight occasions in that run. After a run of 13 defeats in 16 Premier League games against 'big six' opponents (W1 D2), West Ham are unbeaten in their last three against them (W1 D2).

We dominated the game. Yes, sometimes things like this happen in football; you push, force and have chances to score, but it's impossible to score. I'm happy with the effort and performance having had 48 hours to prepare.\" David Moyes: \"The biggest thing for us was how long we didn't allow Spurs to score. I didn't want to come here and get beaten by four or five. I would love to have the players Spurs have. At the moment we don't. My job as the coach is to find a way to get results, which we did.\" Man of the Match - Pedro Obiang LONDON, ENGLAND - JANUARY 04: Pedro Obiang of West Ham United (grounded) celebrates with teammates after scoring his sides first goal during the Premier L There seemed nothing on when Obiang collected the ball on the left flank some 30 yards from the Tottenham goal, but the Spaniard stunned Lloris with a rising rocket of strike which flew into the top corner. West Ham's first shot of the match was worth the wait, and so nearly claimed a victory their dogged defensively display deserved. What's next?

"3:02 Highlights: Arsenal 2-2 Chelsea Highlights: Arsenal 2-2 Chelsea Hector Bellerin's 92nd-minute equaliser rescued a point for Arsenal in a thrilling 2-2 draw with Chelsea at the Emirates. Marcos Alonso's 84th-minute strike looked to have secured a vital three points for the champions, but Bellerin struck deep into stoppage-time as the points were shared. Jack Wilshere's first Premier League goal since May 2015 had fired the Gunners into a deserved 63rd-minute lead, but Eden Hazard hauled Chelsea level from the penalty spot four minutes later. The result sees Chelsea and Arsenal remain third and sixth in the Premier League, with both teams missing the chance to leapfrog Manchester United and Tottenham respectively. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (7), Holding (6), Mustafi (6), Chambers (5), Bellerin (7), Xhaka (6), Wilshere (7), Maitland-Niles (6), Ozil (8), Sanchez (7), Lacazette (6).

Subs: Drinkwater (5), Zappacosta (6), Willian (5). Man of the Match: Eden Hazard. Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil were chief tormentors to the Chelsea defence in a pulsating first half, but the game's first chance fell to Alvaro Morata, who fired woefully wide on 14 minutes after misjudgement from Calum Chambers released him on goal. The game then burst into life on 17 minutes. Seconds after an Ainsley-Maitland Niles penalty appeal was declined, Thibaut Courtois tipped a fierce Sanchez drive onto both posts before smothering the rebound. Jack Wilshere turns away from goal to celebrate after giving Arsenal the lead The Belgium international was in inspired form, denying Alexandre Lacazette's low effort at full stretch. His counterpart Petr Cech, meanwhile, had to be alert to tip Tiemoue Bakayoko's rasping effort over on 28 minutes. Ozil flashed a shot inches wide on 39 minutes before Cesc Fabregas' curling effort drifted wide on the stroke of half-time, after which Cech was on hand to deny Hazard's low effort and Alonso's header in quick succession. Eden Hazard scores Chelsea's equaliser from the penalty spot Arsenal soon regained the initiative, though, with Lacazette drawing another save from Courtois before his resolve was finally broken by Wilshere's thunderous near-post drive on 63 minutes. However, the Gunners' lead lasted just four minutes as Bellerin was penalised for a foul in the area on Hazard, and the Belgian dusted himself down to haul Chelsea level from the spot. Marcos Alonso celebrates scoring Chelsea's second goal with Danny Drinkwater and Alvaro Morata Morata fired over on 71 minutes and a deflected N'Golo Kante shot narrowly missed the target as the champions pushed for a second, which came when Alonso poked Davide Zappacosta's cross home from close range. Back came Arsenal in a thrilling finale as Bellerin's whipped effort flashed past Courtois in stoppage-time, but the Gunners almost lost it again as Cech thwarted Morata before Zappacosta thundered the rebound against the crossbar in the dying seconds. Team news Mesut Ozil, Rob Holding and Ainsley Maitland-Niles were recalled as Arsene Wenger made three changes following the Gunners’ 1-1 draw at West Brom. Cesc Fabregas started against his former club and Eden Hazard returned for Chelsea after sitting out their 5-0 thrashing of Stoke, two of four changes made by Antonio Conte. Opta stats Arsenal have avoided defeat against Chelsea in their two league meetings of the season (D2) for the first time since 2011/12. Antonio Conte has enjoyed just one victory in his six meetings with the Gunners in all competitions since the start of last season (D3 L2). This game was Arsene Wenger's 60th meeting with Chelsea in all competitions - making them the side he's faced the most as Arsenal boss (W22 D17 L21). Jack Wilshere scored his first goal in his last 43 Premier League games, since netting against West Brom in May 2015. Each of the 14 penalties Petr Cech has faced in the Premier League with Arsenal has been scored. Since the start of last season, Marcos Alonso has been directly involved in 16 Premier League goals (12 goals, 4 assists), four more than any other defender. Hector Bellerin bagged his first goal in his last 22 Premier League games, since netting at the tail-end of last season against Everton. 0:53 Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry agreed the Hazard penalty award was correct Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry agreed the Hazard penalty award was correct The managers Arsene Wenger: \"It was a fantastic football game. Overall I believe it could have gone both ways, the regret we have is that we were first on the scoring sheet. After that, we got again a farcical decision and mentally we were shocked. Then we could have lost the game but we had the resources to come back, and in the end maybe it's a fair result.\" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger gives his reaction to his sides thrilling 2-2 draw with Chelsea.

Man of the Match - Eden Hazard Restored to the Chelsea line-up after sitting out against Stoke, Hazard returned fresh, fit and with a vengeance. On a night where so many performed well, the Belgium international just edged ahead of his peers with a scintillating display. Eden Hazard celebrates with Gary Cahill after making it 1-1 at the Emirates Stadium He tormented the Gunners back line, transiting defence to attack in a blink of an eye. His guile in the area to win and convert a penalty so nearly inspired a comeback victory and, while Bellerin's equaliser may have shared the points, the spotlight belonged to Hazard. What's next?

Crystal Palace as they came from behind to secure a 2-1 victory over Southampton at St Mary's. It was all going so well for the Saints as Shane Long ended his goal drought with his first strike since last February but James McArthur drew Palace level when he fired in from close range from Christian Benteke's knockdown. The Eagles crowned an improved second-half performance as Andros Townsend set up Milivojevic who found the bottom corner from the edge of the box to complete the turnaround. Shane Long ended a 35-game wait for a goal in the first half Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (6), Yoshida (6), Stephens (5), Bertrand (6), Pied (6), Hojbjerg (6), Romeu (7) Ward-Prowse (6), Boufal (6), Tadic (6), Long (7). Subs: Davis (5), Gabbiadini (5), Redmond (5) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Kelly (6), Fosu-Mensah (7), Tomkins (7), Schlupp (6), Milivojevic (7), Cabaye (6), McArthur (7), Townsend (7), Zaha (7), Benteke (7). Subs: Van Aanholt (6), Sako (8) Man of the match: Bakary Sako Palace's resurgence under Roy Hodgson continues with the side now up to 14th while Southampton are now 17th, outside of the drop zone on goal difference. Pressure grows on Mauricio Pellegrino, whose side had an extra day to prepare for the game and looked the sharper team in the first half. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg came close to capping a fine move after 15 minutes but his 25-yard shot was tipped over by Wayne Hennessey. But Palace - who have now won 11 points from losing positions this season - hadn't heeded the warning as two minutes later, they fell behind through an unlikely source. James McArthur fired Palace level from close range after 69 minutes Team news Southampton made two changes as Ryan Bertrand and Jeremy Pied replaced Sam McQueen and Wesley Hoedt. Crystal Palace made three alterations as Martin Kelly, Jeffrey Schlupp and James McArthur came in for Scott Dann, Patrick van Aanholt and Jairo Riedewald. Long had waited 1,320 minutes since his last goal - scored in a routine 4-0 win over Sunderland at the Stadium of Light - and produced a confident finish as he swivelled and fired low past Hennessey having collected Jeremy Pied's pass 12 yards out. The relief was written across his face, and the Republic of Ireland forward played with a newly-found swagger as he nearly met Dusan Tadic's through-ball to double his account on the stroke of half-time. Aware his side had been second best, Hodgson made a tactical change at the break as Wilfried Zaha was moved closer to Benteke and Patrick van Aanholt was introduced but it was his second change which had a significant impact. Bakary Sako had watched on from the bench for over an hour but within five minutes of coming on, Palace were level. Sako lifted the travelling fans and after winning his side a free-kick, Townsend's delivery at the second attempt was knocked down by Benteke for McArthur to score. Southampton offered little after the interval. Palace, sensing their opponents were out of ideas, completed the turnaround as after Sako combined with Townsend down the right, Milivojevic was in the right place to sweep home a sublime winner. Opta stats Only Everton (12) have won more points from losing positions in the Premier League this season than Crystal Palace (11). Crystal Palace earned their first top-flight away win against Southampton in 10 attempts, their last being a 3-2 win at the Dell in November 1990. Shane Long's goal was his first in 1,320 minutes of Premier League football, ending a run of 26 games without a goal since netting at Sunderland in February 2017. James McArthur's goal was his fifth in all competitions this season, equalling his best return in a single season in English football (also 2016-17). Luka Milivojevic scored his sixth Premier League goal for Crystal Palace, but his first that wasn't from the penalty spot. The Eagles are now unbeaten in five Premier League away games (W2 D3), their longest such run in the competition since February 2015. The managers Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It's a difficult game for us to digest because in the first half we dominated the game. We gave them the possibility to react in the second half by playing five yards deeper. We let them come into the game. \"The confidence went after they scored the second goal. We have to react and learn from this situation as we're in a difficult position now.\" Roy Hodgson: \"My players deserve enormous credit. It's four points over the Christmas and New Year programme. We showed signs of weariness in the first half. \"The pitch was heavy and didn't suit our style of play but we got over that in the second half. It's a very important three points. The players deserve enormous credit for their work.\" Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace deserve enormous credit following their 2-1 victory at Southampton and for picking up four points over the New Year period. Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace deserve enormous credit following their 2-1 victory at Southampton and for picking up four points over the New Year period. The Pundit Tony Cottee said on Soccer Special: \"In the first half Southampton were the better team and deserved to be a goal up and I don't know whether the weather played a factor, but Southampton were really poor in the second half. \"Credit must go to Roy Hodgson who brought on Bakary Sako, who made a real difference. Palace played really well in the second half and Southampton are in massive trouble now.\" Man of the match: Bakary Sako Palace had looked leggy in the first half on a boggy pitch on the south coast following a drainage problem, but Sako's introduction with just over 20 minutes remaining injected urgency into their play. In truth, the Eagles had produced a much-improved display in the second period but were without a goal to show for their efforts before the former Wolves forward provided the power to rally his team-mates for an extra push. Sako was involved in both Palace goals as he worked tirelessly down both channels to win the free-kick which led to McArthur's equaliser before chasing a hopeful pass from Townsend in the build-up to Milivojevic's winner. Bakary Sako produced a fine cameo off the subs' bench for Palace What's next? Southampton will look to put the defeat behind them when they travel to face Fulham in the FA Cup third round on Saturday before a trip to Watford in the Premier League on January 13. Crystal Palace head into their M23 derby at Brighton in the FA Cup on Monday night in high spirits before returning to face Burnley in the Premier League the following Saturday."}, {"date":

Llorente heads in controversial opener against his former club 2:52 Swansea 0-2 Tottenham Swansea 0-2 Tottenham Fernando Llorente scored a controversial header on his return to Swansea as Tottenham battled to a 2-0 win in difficult conditions at the Liberty Stadium. With Harry Kane starting on the bench due to a cold, Llorente capitalised on his first Premier League start for Spurs when meeting Christian Eriksen's cross (12), albeit from an offside position. Swansea improved after the break, with Mike van der Hoorn hitting the post, but Dele Alli killed the game off with a fortunate second late on (89). Defeat leaves Swansea rooted to the bottom of the table, while Spurs are now four points behind fourth-placed Liverpool with a game in hand.

Davinson Sanchez picked up a yellow for an off-the-ball foul on Martin Olsson in the first half, and he was lucky to escape a second booking when bringing down the same player after the break. Team news There were three Swansea changes with Mike van der Hoorn, Angel Rangel and Nathan Dyer coming in. Llorente was one of four Spurs changes - Danny Rose was out of the squad, while Kieran Trippier, Ben Davies and Erik Lamela were all named in the starting XI. After Sanchez was hauled off by Mauricio Pochettino, and moments after Kane was introduced, Alli came within inches of scoring Spurs' second, but he could only head wide while under pressure from Van der Hoorn. Harry Kane came on for Fernando Llorente during the second half Spurs were living dangerously at 1-0, and they needed a last-ditch challenge from Ben Davies on Jordan Ayew and the fortune of seeing Van der Hoorn head against the post to preserve their lead. However, after Heung-Min Son volleyed narrowly wide, Alli scored the all-important second when receiving a delightful ball from Kane out wide. It fell kindly for the midfielder after Lukasz Fabianski saved the initial attempt, but after converting the rebound, all three points were secured on a tough evening for Spurs. Dele Alli celebrates after scoring Tottenham's second goal in the 2-0 win Opta stats This was Swansea's 11th defeat at the hands of Spurs in the Premier League (P14 W0 D3 L11); their most against any opponent in the competition. The Swans have won just one of their last 20 games against \"top six\" sides in the Premier League (D4 L15), with that win coming just under a year ago against Liverpool (3-2 at Anfield). Mauricio Pochettino's side have scored at least two goals in five of their last six Premier League games (18 overall - an average of three per game). Spurs have kept consecutive clean sheets away from home in the Premier League for the first time since September, in their first two of the 2017/18 campaign. Fernando Llorente's was in an offside position when Christian Eriksen's cross came in for the opener Man of the match - Christian Eriksen While those around him struggled with the playing surface, Eriksen thrived at the Liberty Stadium. The Dane proved he was still able to create on a wet and windy night when providing the assist for Llorente, while his delivery throughout was exemplary.

Subs: Barry (5), Burke (5), Robson-Kanu (5). Man of the Match: Andy Carroll. With West Ham without a win in three, and West Brom winless in 19, there was an understandable degree of caution from both sides for the opening quarter of this bottom-of-the-table clash. Salomon Rondon's chipped effort nestled on the roof of the net on 14 minutes and that drew a response from the Hammers as Manuel Lanzini's rasping drive forced Ben Foster into action seven minutes later. James McClean celebrates after scoring the opening goal at the London Stadium The Baggies had a helping hand against Arsenal as a contentious penalty saw them snatch a point, and fortune was on their side once more as McClean's strike, after some pitiful defending from Winston Reid, deflected off Pedro Obiang and over the hapless Adrian. West Brom pushed for a second but going behind galvanised the disjointed Hammers as Lanzini's low 39th-minute effort drew another fine stop from Foster, who bravely thwarted Kouyate from converting Carroll's knock-down four minutes later. Team news Winston Reid returned to captain West Ham in Mark Noble’s absence while Andy Carroll made his first start since November 24. Salomon Rondon recovered from the hamstring injury which ruled him out of West Brom’s draw with Arsenal – one of four changes Alan Pardew made ahead of his reunion with his former employers. Jake Livermore started after Matt Phillips was injured in the warm-up. Adrian stopped a Jonny Evans toe-poke on the line before the break from which West Ham returned revitalised, Carroll turning Marko Arnautovic's whipped cross over within a minute of the restart. But Carroll was not to be denied as he hauled the Hammers level with a towering header from Aaron Cresswell's cross shortly before the hour - his first goal since April 1. Andy Carroll scores West Ham's equaliser And, after Jake Livermore was involved in an altercation with West Ham supporters following his 64th-minute substitution, Carroll capped his return to form by firing Arnautovic's cross home from a narrow angle at the death. Opta stats West Brom are now winless in 20 Premier League games - only three clubs have ever had a longer winless run in the competition (Derby 32, Sunderland 26 and Norwich 21). Andy Carroll now has eight goals in his last eight Premier League starts in the month of January. Only Joey Barton (5) has assisted more Premier League goals for Andy Carroll than Aaron Cresswell (4). James McClean has scored three goals against West Ham in the Premier League (7 apps), he hasn't scored more than one against any other side in the competition. McClean's opener for West Brom was his first Premier League goal in 472 days - that goal also came against the Hammers. Marko Arnautovic has now been directly involved in six goals in his last six league games (5 goals, 1 assist) - he had been involved in none in his previous 11 before this run. The managers David Moyes: \"You can see how important a win that was. They were top goals from Andy. I don't know if there are many centre halves that could have dealt with his leap for the first goal, and I must say the ball in is terrific. You have to give him great credit for the finish for the second.\" David Moyes said Andy Carroll's opener couldn't be defended against and praised the forward's impact in West Ham's win over West Brom.

Alan Pardew: \"That's a tough one to take, the two-day turnaround cost us in the end. We just ran out of legs, we couldn't keep going. To concede in that manner is heart-breaking for the players. It was difficult for us, they had more energy than us and it showed.\" Alan Pardew said their congested fixture list took it's toll on his players as they conceded late against West Ham. Alan Pardew said their congested fixture list took it's toll on his players as they conceded late against West Ham. Man of the Match - Andy Carroll West Ham look to have escaped with a point after an abject display in front of their own supporters but, having already equalised, Carroll provided the perfect finishing touch. Andy Carroll celebrates after scoring a late winner at the London Stadium The Hammers frontman buried a trademark header to end the longest goal drought of his career and, like London buses, his second soon followed as he fired home from a tight angle to snatch the victory. The pundit Matt Murray: \"Wow, what a game. I thought with so much riding on it down the bottom that West Brom away from home might play on the counter-attack and make it an edgy affair, but right from the start both teams were going for it. West Ham, through Andy Carroll, were calm and clinical at the end then they deserved it.\" What's next? West Ham make the trip to Wembley on Thursday to take on London rivals Tottenham - live on Sky Sports Premier League - before travelling to Shrewsbury in the FA Cup on Sunday. In between those games, West Brom head to Devon for their FA Cup third-round clash with Exeter City."}, {"date": "02/01/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53556, "home_team": {"name":

season as Manchester City got back to winning ways with a 3-1 win over Watford on Tuesday. City were denied maximum points for the first time since August against Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve but started 2018 in blistering fashion as Sterling scored after just 38 seconds. With Kevin De Bruyne surprisingly fit to start after being stretchered off at Palace and John Stones and David Silva back in the team, City netted further goals courtesy of a Christian Kabasele own goal (13) and Sergio Aguero (63). Watford, who grabbed a late consolation from Andre Gray (83), have now just won one of their last nine matches and although they sit 10th are just five points above the drop zone. Player Ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (6), Stones (7), Otamendi (6), Delph (7), Fernandinho (8), De Bruyne (8), D.Silva (8), Sterling (7), Sane (8), Aguero (7) Subs: Toure (6), Danilo (6) Watford: Gomes (5), Janmaat (6), Wagué (6), Zeegelaar (3), Capoue (6), Carrillo (5), Kabasele (4), Watson (5), Doucoure (6), Richarlison (6), Gray (6). Subs: Sinclair (6), Pereya (6), Cleverley (6) Man of the Match: Kevin de Bruyne Leroy Sane set the tone early on with a fantastic run down the left and his cross was tapped home by Sterling for his 18th goal of the season. Stones, back in the side after 12 games out injured, should have doubled the lead on five minutes but ballooned a chance over from close range. Team news Pep Guardiola made five changes with John Stones, Fabian Delph, David Silva, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero all coming in. There were two changes for Watford from their late reverse against Swansea with Andre Gray and Etienne Capoue replacing Stefano Okaka and Tom Cleverley. The second goal came on 13 minutes when De Bruyne delivered from the right and the unfortunate Kabasele slid the ball into his own net. Further chances were created by the hosts as De Bruyne curled a free-kick off the crossbar and Silva - returning after missing four of the last five games - blazed over. City made it 3-0 after the break when De Bruyne fizzed in a delivery that was too hot for Heurelho Gomes to handle and Aguero poked in. Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva celebrate City's second goal of the game Watford at least had the final say when Andre Carillo crossed from the right and Gray tuned it home. Man of the match: Kevin De Bruyne What a boost his inclusion must have been for his team-mates at kick-off. He bossed this game from start to finish in typically classy fashion. It was his cross that forced the own-goal and another wicked delivery from the Belgian led to Aguero's strike. His right boot is a thing of beauty. Opta stats Since he took charge of his first away Premier League game on January 22 last year, Marco Silva has lost more away Premier League games than any other manager (13). Sterling's goal after 38 seconds was Man City's third fastest goal in Premier League history, behind Jesus Navas against Spurs in November 2013 (13 seconds) and Geovanni against Wigan in December 2007 (29 seconds). Aguero has only scored more goals against Newcastle United (11) in all competitions for City than he has against Watford (10). Manager reaction Pep Guardiola: \"It was excellent, brilliant. We started really good and the second half was really good again. It was a good reaction after dropping points at Selhurst Park. We faced this team really well. Three more points, simple as that. \"We created lots of chances to score five or six, but it wasn't to be. The aim is to be better than the opponent in every game and we did it.\" Marco Silva: \"What I can say now is to come here, compete and do our best to take a good result when you start a game like this. We weren't aggressive in our defence, it was too easy for them. The first 25 minutes we were too slow and we knew before the match they would push our team back.\" Pundit reaction - Charlie Nicholas \"It should have been more, in all honesty. City were in second gear and went into third when it suited them. It was a comfortable win despite Gray's consolation at the end and I think Pep will be chuffed to bits. I know it's his second season but he's not used to all these fixtures. It's a continuation of last year.\" What's next?

Man of the Match: Jose Izquierdo Knockaert picked up a knock in the warm-up but emphatically allayed those pre-match injury fears inside five minutes when he fired Jose Izquierdo's cross home from a narrow angle - the first Premier League goal of 2018. Anthony Knockaert celebrates scoring the opening goal Wilson failed to connect with Charlie Daniels' 12th-minute cross as the Cherries pushed for an equaliser, before referee Michael Oliver rejected the visitors' penalty appeals after Harry Arter's shot struck Knockaert's arm. Asmir Begovic and Mathew Ryan were both called into action to deny shots from Murray and Jordon Ibe before Cook haunted his former employers by hauling Bournemouth level with a stunning looping header. Steve Cook (3rd L) climbs highest to head home Bournemouth's equaliser The impressive Pascal Gross remained at the heart of the Brighton attack and so nearly set up Izquierdo for a second, but a brilliant point-blank save from Begovic ensured parity at the interval. Just as they had in the first half, Brighton flew out of the traps and got their just reward as Izquierdo unselfishly squared for Murray to slot his sixth Premier League goal of the season. Glenn Murray celebrates scoring his team's second goal with Jose Izquierdo Brighton had two chances to pull further clear of Bournemouth but Shane Duffy's volley on the hour was blocked before Izquierdo opted to shoot instead of teeing up Davy Propper at the end of a counter, and Begovic thwarted his effort. Team news Eddie Howe made four changes following Bournemouth’s win over Everton. Marc Pugh, Charlie Daniels, Harry Arter and Benik Afobe were recalled, while Ryan Fraser missed out through injury. Chris Hughton made three changes from Saturday's goalless draw at Newcastle as Markus Suttner, Jose Izquierdo and Ezequiel Schelotto returned to the starting line-up. Ibe struck the post with a thunderous 25-yard drive on 73 minutes before Bournemouth punished Brighton's profligacy as Wilson fortuitously poked home after a goalmouth scramble to snatch a point. Opta stats In what was Chris Hughton's 150th competitive match in charge of Brighton, the Seagulls ended a run of three consecutive league defeats against Bournemouth with this draw. Bournemouth have now gone eight league matches unbeaten against Brighton (W4 D4), with their last defeat coming back in January 2008 (2-3). Brighton scored as many goals today (2) as they did in their previous nine Premier League games, having failed to score in seven of their previous nine league matches. Callum Wilson's goal meant that Bournemouth have now scored 50 away goals in the Premier League. Callum Wilson has scored 16 Premier League goals without providing an assist - the most a player has scored in the competition without setting up a team-mate, overtaking Branko Strupar (15 goals, 0 assists). Glenn Murray now has six Premier League goals this season, just one off his best-ever tally in a single PL campaign (seven goals in 2014-15). The managers Chris Hughton: \"I thought we were very good in the goalscoring department today. That regards our intensity in the game and our work in the final third. I'm just hugely disappointed that having gone in front on two occasions, and creating the chances to win the game, we didn't.\" Brighton manager Chris Hughton claimed his side should have clinched all three points given their performance in the 2-2 draw with Bournemouth in the Premier League. Brighton manager Chris Hughton claimed his side should have clinched all three points given their performance in the 2-2 draw with Bournemouth in the Premier League.

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe claims poor defending gifted Brighton two goals but he praised his side for battling back to claim a point. Man of the Match - Jose Izquierdo It's fair to say Izquierdo has failed to scale the heights many envisaged he would following his club-record switch to Brighton. Like so many before him, the Colombia international has taken his time to adjust to the English game, but Monday's at times scintillating performance was strong indication he's finally found his feet. Izquierdo became the first Brighton player to register two assists in a single Premier League game, and while a third assist for Propper failed to materialise, his display will have no doubt offered a crumb of comfort to the Seagulls. What's next? Attention turns to the third round of the FA Cup as Brighton host rivals Crystal Palace and Bournemouth entertain Wigan.

Klavan scored an injury-time winner to earn Liverpool a hard-fought 2-1 victory against Burnley on New Year's Day. With Mohamed Salah and Phillipe Coutinho both not in the Liverpool squad, it was Sadio Mane who broke the deadlock for the visitors in the 61st minute at Turf Moor with a fine strike. Johann Gudmundsson looked to have grabbed a point for Burnley when he replied in the 88th minute, but Klavan headed in the decisive goal deep into injury-time. Player ratings Burnley: Pope (6), Bardsley (6), Tarkowski (6), Mee (7), Taylor (6), Gudmundsson (7), Defour (6), Cork (6), Arfield (6), Hendrick (6), Barnes (6) Subs: Vokes (6), Wells (5) Liverpool: Mignolet (6), Alexander-Arnold (6), Lovren (7), Klavan (7), Gomez (6), Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Can (6), Wijnaldum (6), Mane (7), Solanke (6), Lallana (7) Subs: Milner (5), Firmino (5), Matip (5) Man of the match: Dejan Lovren The win stretches Liverpool's unbeaten run in all competitions to 16 matches, while Burnley have now not won in five games in the Premier League. With the rain teeming down, chances were few and far between in the first half. Burnley's Ashley Barnes fired wide in the eighth minute from inside the box, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain went closest for Liverpool when he saw a shot pushed away by Clarets 'keeper Nick Pope. Klavan scores Liverpool's winner Having not had much of the ball in the opening 25 minutes, the home side grew into the half and Scott Arfield shot just past the post in the 38th minute. Both sides continued to struggle to create clear chances in the second half, but Mane put Liverpool ahead in the 61st minute with a brilliant goal, controlling well and drilling a shot past Pope from just inside the box. Pope then saved well from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Oxlade-Chamberlain while Barnes volleyed narrowly wide at the other end. Team news Tarkowski replaced Long for Burnley, while Liverpool made seven changes. Van Dijk was not available despite completing his transfer from Southampton on the day, and Salah and Coutinho missed out with injury. Mignolet returned in goal in place of Karius and Lallana made his first start of the season. Burnley threw on Sam Vokes and Nahki Wells in a bid to snatch an equaliser and it was the former who flicked on a cross for Gudmundsson to finish at the back post with a stooping header. That looked as though it would be enough to ensure a draw, until Dejan Lovren headed a free-kick goalwards in the 94th minute and Klavan headed in almost on the line. Opta stats Liverpool have now gone 16 games unbeaten in all competitions (W11 D5), their outright longest run under manager Jurgen Klopp. Burnley have conceded more goals in their last two fixtures at Turf Moor in the Premier League (five) than they did in in their first nine of the season (three). Johan Berg Gudmundsson has been directly involved in six Premier League goals this season, at least two more than any other player for Burnley. Sadio Mane has had a hand in five goals in his last four Premier League games away from Anfield (two goals, three assists), as many as his previous 15 combined. Ragnar Klavan scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool in his 34th appearance in the competition; it was the first goal by an Estonian in Premier league history. The managers Sean Dyche: \"I thought we had done enough to earn another point. We're so frustrated with a soft goal right at the end but impressed with the mentality: superb physically, tactically very good - particularly defensively - and there is so much to be pleased with. But we're left with that horrible feeling.\" Burnley boss Sean Dyche was frustrated with the late defeat Burnley boss Sean Dyche was frustrated with the late defeat Jurgen Klopp on Sadio Mane: \"He came into the dressing room and the whole team got up and gave him a hand, because they know. He will be back on top. He has made steps. We need him, we need him so much for all the things that are coming. I am happy because I had a lot of players with moments where it wasn't clicking and they never scored. Sadio still scores, and that's really cool!\" Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said his side deserved to beat Burnley Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said his side deserved to beat Burnley Man of the match - Dejan Lovren On the day that Liverpool sealed the £75m signing of Virgil van Dijk, it was perhaps fitting that it was their oft-maligned centre-backs who combined to score the winner. While Klavan got the final touch, it was laid on a plate for him by Lovren, who rose well to flick on a free-kick. Lovren was also solid in defence for Liverpool, winning 15 aerial duels - six more than any of his team-mates - and making 10 clearances. What's next? Liverpool host Merseyside rivals Everton in the third round of the FA Cup on Friday before facing Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday, January 14, live on Sky Sports.

A slick second half performance from Leicester saw them beat Huddersfield 3-0 on New Year's Day, which also marked the long-awaited debut of Adrien Silva. After a goalless opening half, it took Riyad Mahrez (53) just seven minutes of the second to net the opener before Islam Slimani (59) chipped home over Hudderfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl. Silva, who was officially registered by Leicester on January 1 and given permission to be included in the matchday 18 by the Premier League, came on for his debut in the 86th minute before Marc Albrighton (90+2) rounded off the scoring late on. 0:51 Silva makes Leicester debut Silva makes Leicester debut Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Morgan (n/a), Maguire (7), Fuchs (7), Amartey (7), Albrighton (7), Okazaki (7), James (7), Ndidi (7), Mahrez (8), Slimani (8). Subs used: Dragovic (6), Gray (6), Silva (n/a). Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Smith (6), Lowe (6), Jorgensen (5), Schindler (7), Mooy (6), Van La Parra (5), Lolley (6), Williams (6), Ince (5), Mounie (5). Subs used: Quaner (5), Malone (5), Depoitre (n/a). Man of the match: Islam Slimani. Leicester have ended a run of five league games without a win although they remain in 8th spot, while Huddersfield are now winless in four matches but stay in 11th place. Both sides could have nicked an early goal, with Chris Lowe fizzing a shot towards goal in the second minute, but it ended up straight in the hands of Kasper Schmeichel. Slimani then headed a curling Christian Fuchs cross just over the crossbar, but the offside flag was already raised. Leicester were forced into an early first half change after Wes Morgan injured himself when tackling Steve Mounie at full stretch. He was replaced in the 28th minute by Aleksander Dragovic, with Schmeichel taking the captain's armband. Team news Leicester made three changes with Shinji Okazaki, Matty James and Islam Slimani coming into the XI. Jamie Vardy was out injured and Adrien Silva started on the bench. For Huddersfield, they switched five players with Tommy Smith, Chris Lowe, Danny Williams, Joe Lolley and Steve Mounie coming into the side. Chances were at a premium for much of the first half, but the hosts went close again in the 34th minute. Fuchs delivered a long throw into the box but Harry Maguire was unable to see off three Huddersfield defender to head home. The rebound fell to Wilfred Ndidi at the top of the area, but he could only strike past the post. But Leicester turned on the magic after the break, and Mahrez opened the scoring in the 53rd minute. Another throw in from Fuchs caused problem for Huddersfield who failed to clear it properly, allowing Albrighton to hook the ball back into the box. It landed to Mahrez near the back post, who hit the ball first time to see it hammer into the bottom left corner. Six minutes later and it was another fine goal from the Foxes with the two Algerian internationals linking up. Mahrez released Slimani into the box, with the striker racing onto the ball and going one-on-one with Lossl before superbly chipping over the Huddersfield stopper to double Leicester's lead. Islam Slimani challenges Christopher Schindler during the Premier League match Ndidi could have added the third in the 83rd minute but his bullet header could only rattle the woodwork, and it was three minutes later when Silva made his debut as he replaced Matty James with the fans singing his name for the remainder of the game. They were given even more to cheer about in the second minute of injury time as Albrighton slotted home Leicester's third. After some great work from Slimani in the middle of the park to pick out Demarai Gray on the right of the box, the latter flashed the ball across the face of goal for Albrighton at the back post and he duly slotted home to start 2018 in winning fashion for the Foxes. Marc Albrighton celebrates scoring Leicester's third goal with Christian Fuchs Opta stats Riyad Mahrez has both scored and assisted in the same league game for the first time since February 2016 against Manchester City. Leicester are now unbeaten in 14 Premier League home games against newly-promoted opposition (W9 D5 L0) since losing 0-5 to Bolton Wanderers in August 2001. Marc Albrighton now has five assists in his last nine league games for Leicester - this after going 12 games without setting up a teammate prior to this run. Huddersfield have now failed to find the net in eight of their 11 away fixtures in the Premier League - no side has failed to score more often on the road this season than they have (Brighton and Crystal Palace also on 8). Adrien Silva made his Leicester debut against Huddersfield The managers Claude Puel: \"It was a tough game against a good team with quality, a strong defensive unit and good structure. They have good players and tried to play good football but we started very well with a good attitude with quality on the pitch. \"Perhaps in the last 15 minutes before half-time, it was not enough for us but we came back in the second half with a positive outlook and it was a good feeling because I think all the players enjoyed the game with three fantastic goals. It is a good reward for the team and our fans too.\" Leicester boss Claude Puel says his side scored three fantastic goals which was a great reward for their performance in the win over Huddersfield Leicester boss Claude Puel says his side scored three fantastic goals which was a great reward for their performance in the win over Huddersfield David Wagner: \"I think now we are experienced enough, we've played 22 games in the Premier League, we know what it's all about. Small margins decide the games and today, in the first half, we had the best opportunity of the game, we missed it. \"In the second half, we gave the goal away much too easily and this cannot happen at this level. It will cost you, and today, it was us. We have to accept it but we have to try again in the next game.\" Huddersfield boss David Wagner was satisfied with his side's performance but was left frustrated at giving away the first goal in what turned out to be a 3-0 defeat at Leicester Huddersfield boss David Wagner was satisfied with his side's performance but was left frustrated at giving away the first goal in what turned out to be a 3-0 defeat at Leicester The pundit Paul Walsh: \"The first half was a disappointment from both sides, it was very scrappy with both sides giving the ball away. Leicester moved the ball with a lot more purpose in the second half but even so the goal came out of nothing and it's a great finish. That settled Leicester down and from there he started to play, Mahrez started to play, Albrighton became more prominent. \"Puel will be delighted with the performance. I couldn't really work out what the plan was from Huddersfield's point of view, but it was a comfortable victory for Leicester.\" Leicester captain Wes Morgan went off injured in the first half Man of the match - Islam Slimani Usually playing second fiddle to Jamie Vardy - who was injured - Slimani certainly staked a claim for a more regular starting place. His work rate was second to none, often using his strength to beat the Huddersfield defence, and he linked up superbly with fellow Algerian Mahrez throughout the game as the latter assisted Slimani for his well-taken goal. Islam Slimani scores Leicester's second goal with a chip over Jonas Lossl His performance meant the fans were singing his name throughout the second half in appreciation - only Silva received more attention on his debut - with the new year starting brightly for the striker. Now is his chance to keep the momentum going. What's next? Both sides are in FA Cup action on Saturday, with Leicester travelling to Fleetwood - the former side of Foxes striker Jamie Vardy - while Huddersfield will visit Sky Bet League One side Bolton."},

Hughes left the field to cries for him to quit from his own supporters after Stoke slipped to a 1-0 home defeat to Newcastle. Ayoze Perez's winner 17 minutes from time meant 2018 kicked-off in the same vein as 2017 for Hughes, who now has overseen seven defeats in his last 10 matches. Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow repelled a late charge from the hosts, including two wonderful saves from Mame Biram Diouf but Stoke rarely carried the quality needed to break through. The pressure has cranked up on Mark Hughes Newcastle's second win in 13 matches moves them up three places to 13th and they are now four points clear of the relegation zone. Although Stoke do remain outside the relegation zone by two points, the owners - the Coates family, who have been reluctant to change managers in the past - have a big decision to make as it seems Hughes has lost the majority of the fans' backing. Player Ratings Stoke: Butland (7), Pieters (6), Wimmer (6), Edwards (5), Zouma (5), Cameron (5), Allen (6), Adam (7), Shaqiri (3), Crouch (5), Choupo-Moting (7). Subs: Diouf (6), Berahino (5) Newcastle: Darlow (8), Clark (7), Lascelles (7), Manquillo (7), Yedlin (7), Atsu (6), Shelvey (7), Murphy (7), Diame (7), Ritchie (6), Perez (8) Subs: Gayle (7), Hayden (6), Dummett (6) Man of the Match: Ayoze Perez Newcastle should have taken the lead midway through the first half when Ciaran Clark somehow sent the ball over the crossbar from close range after Perez's clever flick. Stoke carried a greater threat after the break but only had an Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting shot, which Darlow tipped over the bar, to show for their efforts. Team news Mark Hughes made six changes after the humbling defeat at Chelsea with Erik Pieters, Kurt Zouma, Joe Allen, Xherdan Shaqiri, Peter Crouch and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting all returning. Rafa Benitez made five changes as Javier Manquillo, Jonjo Shelvey, Mo Diame, Jacob Murphy and Ayoze Perez all were handed starts. Newcastle went close at the other end when Jonjo Shelvey sent a free-kick just wide, and the away end erupted 12 minutes later when Perez opened the scoring. The striker met a fine cross by Jacob Murphy and shot past Butland. It was Butland's opposite number Darlow who then came to the fore in the closing stages as Stoke went direct. Diouf's close-range acrobatic volley was saved one-handed by Darlow before he showed quick reactions again minutes later to deny Diouf, whose diving header was somehow blocked away. Man of the match: Ayoze Perez The match winner never gave Stoke's back four a moment's rest. He buzzed around the front-line, winning crucial free-kicks and laying foundations for attacks, especially in the first half when he linked brilliantly with Christian Atsu. His goal was a poacher's finish from close range and was a moment his endeavours deserved. Manager reaction Mark Hughes: When asked if he fears the sack, he replied: \"That's not my decision - I know what I feel. We've got a group of players that are playing with a lack of confidence. When that happens their ability to make key decisions becomes tough. We're not overwhelmed by it - we've got to make sure we pick ourselves up.\" Rafa Benitez: \"We started really well this season then we had a bad run and lost confidence - but still the team was working hard. It is one thing me as a manager saying the players are working and don't give up, but you could see it today. It was an example of a team working hard. \"Stoke worked so hard and it was difficult for us.\" Opta stats Rafael Benitez has lost just one of his 13 managerial matches against Hughes in the Premier League (W6 D6 L1). Stoke have now conceded the first goal of the game on 15 occasions in the Premier League this season; more often than any other team. Perez's strike was Newcastle's first goal at the Bet 365 stadium since November 2012 (first goal in four visits). Stoke's total of 20 points after 22 games is their worst haul at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1984-85 (11 points). What's next? Stoke face a trip to League Two side Coventry on Saturday in the FA Cup third round while Newcastle host Luton in the same competition."}, {"date": "01/01/2018", "arena": "Goodison Park",

Martial and Jesse Lingard ensured Manchester United returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory at Everton. After United's 2017 came to a close with three successive draws, it looked as though a familiar tale was brewing after a sluggish first half at Goodison Park. However, United upped the ante after the break, with Martial curling in a beauty from the edge of the area in the 57th minute before Lingard scored in similar fashion with nine minutes remaining. Captain Paul Pogba provided the assist for both goals, and it was his man-of-the-match display that helped lift United back into second place in the Premier League table, 12 points behind leaders Manchester City.

A vital interception from Marcos Rojo prevented Oumar Niasse from getting an attempt on target for Everton, while Toffees 'keeper Jordan Pickford could only tip Martial's cross away before Cuco Martina made the clearance. United were on top towards the end of the first half, but Pogba and Herrera saw attempts from outside the area deflect wide. Team news Wayne Rooney came in to captain the Toffees against his former club - one of seven Everton changes. Meanwhile, Marcos Rojo, Ander Herrera and Anthony Martial started for United, with Ashley Young (suspended), Romelu Lukaku and Zlatan Ibrahimovic (both injured) out. Anthony Martial thumps his chest after scoring the opening goal After the break, United found their groove, with Mata stinging the gloves of Pickford before his delightful effort from distance clipped the outside of the post. A dominant spell eventually paid dividends for United when they scored from a counter-attack, with Pogba picking out Martial, who set himself on the edge of the area before curling his effort beyond Pickford. Jesse Lingard celebrates with Paul Pogba after scoring United's second United then survived a brief Everton onslaught - Niasse going closest with a header - before Lingard bent in the all-important second goal after ghosting past Michael Keane 20 yards out. Opta stats This was Manchester United's 35th Premier League win against Everton - this is more than any other team against any other opponent in the competition. Anthony Martial has been directly involved in six goals in his last five appearances against Everton in all competitions (four goals, two assists). Paul Pogba has been involved in 10 goals in 12 Premier League games this season (three goals, seven assists) - one more than he was involved in the whole of last season in 30 games. Since the start of December, only Harry Kane (eight) has scored more Premier League goals than Jesse Lingard (six). Man of the match - Paul Pogba 0:49 The commentator's curse!

Pogba slips just as Jamie Carragher names the midfielder man of the match Pogba pulled the strings for United at Goodison Park. Playing on the left of a midfield three, the Frenchman often found himself out wide for the visitors, but his most-telling moments came from that side - most notably the two assists for Martial and Lingard. \"That's where he is at his best,\" Thierry Henry said in the studio after the match. \"That was vintage Juve Pogba.\" Man of the match Paul Pogba gave his shirt away to a lucky young lad named Mo – who happens to be an Everton ball boy Man of the match Paul Pogba gave his shirt away to a lucky young lad named Mo – who happens to be an Everton ball boy The managers Sam Allardyce: \"Defensively we have to be very solid. Today in the first half we were not too bad, but in the second half we decided we weren't going to bother closing United down. \"On the first goal, we were outside United's box and they go all the way - we back off, we back off, we back off, we back off, we back off into our box and onto the penalty spot with Martial on the ball, and he picks his head up and pops it into the top corner. \"You look and say, 'Well lads, if you're going to back off like that, then everyone can have a free shot and score against you'.\" Sam Allardyce says although Manchester United were clearly the better side, Everton gifted their opponents both goals in the 2-0 victory at Goodison Park Sam Allardyce says although Manchester United were clearly the better side, Everton gifted their opponents both goals in the 2-0 victory at Goodison Park Jose Mourinho: \"The boys deserved it. I keep saying our draws were not bad performances, they had situations that made it more difficult for us and we made our mistakes, especially in the matches against Leicester and Burnley, but the boys were fantastic, their attitude, commitment, pride, their effort, everything was really top class and on top of it we played very well. \"We were always in control. We moved the ball, we had lots of movement, we changed our profile because we didn't have [Romelu] Lukaku, we had to try to win a different way and I am really pleased with the points. Even without points I would be proud of what the boys did.\" Jose Mourinho says Manchester United's 2-0 win against Everton was especially pleasing because it was just what his team deserved after three draws Jose Mourinho says Manchester United's 2-0 win against Everton was especially pleasing because it was just what his team deserved after three draws The pundit - Thierry Henry \"What you have in that team is top quality - Pogba, Lingard, Mata, Martial, Rashford came off the bench. They created chances. \"I understand when Mourinho talks about the players that were missing, but, trouble? I don't think the word would be trouble with the players that I see here. \"Everton were in trouble, not United. I'm sure he [Mourinho] would love to have all the players around him to choose from. But you still have quality there.\" Graeme Souness says few will sympathise with Jose Mourinho’s injury problems given the size and quality of Manchester United's squad Graeme Souness says few will sympathise with Jose Mourinho’s injury problems given the size and quality of Manchester United's squad What's next?

Man City Crystal Palace 0-0 Man City Manchester City's winning streak in the Premier League came to end on New Year's Eve as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Crystal Palace, who had a stoppage-time penalty saved. Pep Guardiola's side had looked unstoppable heading into the Selhurst Park clash, having won their last 18 league games, but were held by a well organised Eagles team, who themselves have now lost just one of their last 10 matches. Palace could have won it in second-half added time when they were awarded a penalty, but Luka Milivojevic's effort was saved by Ederson to leave Roy Hodgson's side in 17th on 19 points. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (7), Fosu-Mensah (8), Tomkins (7), Dann (n/a), Riedewald (7), Van Aanholt (6), Cabaye (7), Milivojevic (6), Townsend (6), Zaha (8), Benteke (7). Subs used: Kelly (7), Puncheon (4), Lee (n/a). Man City: Ederson (8), Walker (7), Otamendi (7), Mangala (6), Danilo (6), Gundogan (6), Fernandinho (7), De Bruyne (7), B. Silva (6), Sane (6), Jesus (n/a). Subs used: Aguero (6), Sterling (7), Toure (n/a). Man of the match: Timothy Fosu-Mensah. City are 14 points clear at the top of the table and are still unbeaten in the Premier League, but Guardiola has confirmed Gabriel Jesus will be out for up to two months following an injury in the first half, while Kevin De Bruyne was stretchered off with a leg injury in second-half stoppage time. It was an even opening at Selhurst Park and either could have taken an early lead, with Bernardo Silva scuffing a shot wide from Danilo's cross in the second minute before Patrick Van Aanholt's bouncing volley, which took a nick off a Man City player on the way through, was pushed away by Ederson. City's streak City's run of 18 consecutive victories already represented a Premier League record, but Palace's resilience means they fell one short of the European record set by Bayern Munich, also then managed by Pep Guardiola, in 2014. The first half was marred by injuries and early substitutions for both sides. Scott Dann was stretchered off in the 20th minute with his knee in a brace after a tackle on De Bruyne before Jesus hobbled off in tears two minutes later after he also looked to pick up a knee injury. Aguero, who replaced Jesus, went closest in the first half as he rattled the woodwork in the 28th minute. After a lay off from De Bruyne in the middle of the park, the Argentine produced a mazy run to the edge of the box before striking, but it could only rattle the upright before going wide. Gabriel Jesus was injured for Man City at Selhurst Park Team news Crystal Palace made four chances with Wayne Hennessey, Timothy Fosu Mensah, Jairo Riedewald and Patrick Van Aanholt coming into the XI. Man City made three changes with Eliaquim Mangala, Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus starting. City continued to have chances in the second half, and went close 12 minutes after the restart as Ilkay Gundogan and De Bruyne played a neat one-two on the edge of the area but the German curled his shot past the post. Wayne Hennessey then thwarted another close effort as Leroy Sane tried to poke home at the back post, but it struck the Welshman on the chest before going behind. Crystal Palace had two huge chances to win it late in the game, with Andros Townsend thrashing an effort over the crossbar from eight yards in the 77th minute after a fizzing Zaha cross through the box. But it was on the 90-minute mark that Zaha was fouled by Sterling in the area and referee Jon Moss instantly pointed to the spot. Andros Townsend missed a late chance for Crystal Palace After a recent disagreement with Christian Benteke over penalties, it was Milivojevic who stepped up but his effort was read well by Ederson, who got down low to his right and pushed away the ball with his legs to set City on the break. But the stretchers were called on once again as a nasty tackle from Jason Puncheon on De Bruyne saw both players go to ground and eventually carried off after some medical treatment, with the Belgian wearing a brace on his right knee to round off an eventful afternoon in south London. Opta stats This was Man City's first away goalless draw in the Premier League since March 2016 against Norwich City, ending a run of 34 matches in which at least one goal was scored. Only two teams have won more Premier League points in a calendar year than Man City in 2017 (98) - Man Utd in 1993 (102) and Chelsea in 2005 (101). This was Crystal Palace's fourth clean sheet in their last eight Premier League games, as many as they'd managed in their 25 matches prior to this. Manchester City goalkeepers have saved 10 of the last 17 penalties they've faced in all competitions, with four different goalkeepers saving those 10 (Hart, Bravo, Caballero and Ederson). Christian Benteke is foiled by Eliaquim Mangala and Ederson during the Premier League match Man of the match - Timothy Fosu-Mensah It was a superb performance from the Crystal Palace defender as he helped to shut out the Premier League's top scorers in what was a good showing overall from the Eagles. He had the not-always-easy task of keeping Sane quiet which he managed well, with the German restricted to few chances during the entertaining encounter. Kevin De Bruyne was stretchered off against Crystal Palace What's next?

Rodriguez struck a controversial late penalty as West Brom stole a 1-1 draw against Arsenal in the last Premier League game of 2017. Just minutes after Alexis Sanchez's free-kick had deflected off James McClean and into his own goal for what looked to be Arsenal's winner (83), Calum Chambers was adjudged to have handled in the area, allowing Rodriguez to step up and equalise (89). Alex Iwobi had struck wide in the first half and Ben Foster denied Alexandre Lacazette in the second, before the late drama at The Hawthorns. Matt Phillips and Jack Wilshere battle for the ball Player ratings West Brom: Foster (6), Dawson (6), Hegazi (7), Evans (6), Gibbs (6), Phillips (6), Livermore (6), Barry (6), Brunt (5), Rodriguez (7), Robson-Kanu (6) Subs: McClean (5), Krychowiak (5), Nyom (5) Arsenal: Cech (6), Koscielny (6), Chambers (6), Mustafi (6), Bellerin (6), Xhaka (6), Wilshere (6), Kolasinac (5), Sanchez (7), Iwobi (5), Lacazette (7) Subs: Maitland-Niles (6), Mertesacker (5), Welbeck (5) Man of the match: Alexis Sanchez The result means Arsenal are fifth, three points off the top four going into 2018, while West Brom are 19th, above bottom side Swansea on goal difference. During an open start, Lacazette saw an effort deflect just wide of goal, before Iwobi should have done better having curled high and wide in space in the box. Iwobi's effort from the right of the box then forced a good save out of West Brom goalkeeper Foster, who saw the ball late through a crowd of players, but both defences ultimately cancelled each other out in the first half. Team news There was just one change apiece at the Hawthorns as Salomon Rondon missed out through injury, replaced by Hal Robson-Kanu. For Arsenal, Mesut Ozil was also out with a knee injury, meaning Alex Iwobi came in. Alexandre Lacazette holds off Jonny Evans Arsenal pressed after the break as Foster then got down superbly to block Lacazette's left-footed effort from inside the box after a neat one-two with Iwobi on the edge. Petr Cech was finally forced into action as Rodriguez found space 20 yards from goal, but his shot was beaten away well by the Arsenal goalkeeper. Arsenal looked to have grabbed a winner seven minutes from time as Sanchez won a free-kick on the edge of the box. He stepped up to take it low, and the ball looked to be heading wide before deflecting off McClean and past the stranded Foster. All 10 outfield Arsenal players celebrated with Sanchez, after much debate midweek about divided celebrations in the win at Crystal Palace. Alexis Sanchez gestures to the Arsenal travelling support at The Hawthorns But just minutes later at the other end, Mike Dean controversially awarded West Brom a penalty after former Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs had touched the ball onto Chambers' arm. Chambers had his arms close to his chest in a natural position, and despite huge protests from the Arsenal players, the decision stood before Rodriguez slotted home low. The protests continued after the final whistle, with Cech shown a yellow card, as Arsene Wenger's record 812th Premier League game in charge ended on a sour note. The managers Alan Pardew: \"When you keep talking to a team about doing the right things, application and 'learning your luck,' when it doesn't happen it is hard. Alan Pardew says his side deserved a break Alan Pardew says his side deserved a break \"But we got something today at last. The decision is a tough one on Arsenal. I've seen it and wow, he could not have given it, could have given it, whatever, but we deserved the break. If we put that much commitment and effort in, we will get enough breaks to win.\" Arsene Wenger: \"It's disappointing to see that but what can you do? You can talk and talk and talk but it doesn't change anything. I would like to remind that I did fight very hard with David Dein [former FA vice-chairman] many years ago that the referees become professional but their level, unfortunately, doesn't go up.\" \"It's difficult to accept. It's more than the decision that is involved in that and it is not the first time it has happened. But it's best we don't talk about. We know deeply what it is going on and we just have to deal with it.\" Arsene Wenger insisted it was definitely not a penalty Arsene Wenger insisted it was definitely not a penalty The pundit - Jamie Redknapp \"It's a horrendous decision, it really is. It's a grey area in football right now because there's no doubt at all, that he's not put his hand to the ball, that's ball to hand. We want consistency in the games. \"What defenders tend to do nowadays is put their hands behind their backs, just to take it out the equation but there his arms are in a natural position, he's balanced and if anything he doesn't want that ball to his arm, it's a really poor, poor decision.\" Opta stats Arsenal have scored in all 24 of their Premier League games against West Brom - the best 100 per cent record in the competition. Petr Cech has failed to save any of the 13 penalties he has faced in all competitions for Arsenal - only two 'keepers have faced more at a single club without saving one (Brad Friedel at Aston Villa, Craig Gordon at Sunderland both 15). Albion are now winless in 19 Premier League games - only three clubs have ever had a longer winless run in the competition (Derby 32, Sunderland 26 and Norwich 21). Arsene Wenger took charge of his 811th Premier League game - more than any other manager in the competition (W468 D198 L145). Man of the match - Alexis Sanchez On a day when Arsenal were not at their best, everything went through Sanchez in the final third. The Chile international was positive every time he got the ball and it was his free-kick that deflected in off McClean for Arsenal's goal. Sanchez had six shots (three more than any other Arsenal player) and made three key passes (more than any other Arsenal player). He remains a crucial player for the Gunners even as he enters the final six months of his contract. What's next Arsenal now host Chelsea on Wednesday evening, live on Sky Sports Premier League from 7.45pm, before going to Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup on Sunday.

Fraser had met Josh King's cross to volley the Cherries in front after 33 minutes, but Everton equalised 12 minutes into the second half as Oumar Niasse set up Idrissa Gueye to level following a mistake from Steve Cook. But Fraser, who was the game's stand-out player, was not to be denied as the Scot cut inside and saw his shot deflect off Michael Keane and beyond Jordan Pickford to the delight of the home crowd. Cherries forward Josh King was forced off in the first half through injury Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (6), S. Cook (6), Ake (7), Smith (7), L.

Subs: Rooney (6), Niasse (7), Bolasie (6) Man of the match: Ryan Fraser The result moves Eddie Howe's side out of the Premier League relegation zone and up to 14th, while Everton remain ninth after a first loss since Sam Allardyce took charge. Bournemouth had never gone nine games without winning in the Premier League, and they created the better chances of the first half with Callum Wilson denied by Everton 'keeper Pickford after he had wriggled free of both Keane and Phil Jagielka with 18 minutes on the clock. More patient work from the hosts led to Jordon Ibe forcing Pickford into another save at his near post, but Bournemouth were finally rewarded for their more courageous approach, albeit thanks to a mistake. James McCarthy conceded possession cheaply in midfield and the ball was worked by Wilson into the path of King down the right, with his cross then thrashed home on the volley by Fraser. Ryan Fraser scored twice as Bournemouth beat Everton 2-1 at the Vitality Stadium Team news Bournemouth were unchanged from the side that drew 3-3 with West Ham on Boxing Day. Everton made four changes to the side that were held to a goalless draw against West Brom as Yannick Bolasie, Mason Holgate, Ashley Williams and Tom Davies were replaced by Phil Jagielka, James McCarthy, Idrissa Gueye and Aaron Lennon. Everton had been toothless - the closest they came to scoring came after Adam Smith's poor back pass was intercepted by Dominic Calvert-Lewin, but the forward hesitated and his cross to Aaron Lennon was cleared by Nathan Ake. Allardyce had seen enough and opted to bring on Wayne Rooney for McCarthy at the interval, but it was his second change - the arrival of Niasse in the 54th minute - that helped haul his side level after 57 minutes. A dreadful clearance from defender Cook was intercepted by Gylfi Sigurdsson who threaded a pass through to Niasse, the Senegalese striker then invited his compatriot Gueye onto the ball and he dispatched his finish with aplomb to Asmir Begovic's right. Idrissa Gueye equalised for Everton after a mistake from Steve Cook Having surrendered a winning position to West Ham on Boxing Day courtesy of two goalkeeping mistakes, home supporters may have feared the worst, but it was Bournemouth who showed greater desire to clinch victory thereafter as Ibe's shot clipped the crossbar. And the Cherries were not to be denied with Ake producing a perfectly-timed block to deny Sigurdsson, before Fraser went on another barnstorming run down the left and fired in off the unfortunate Keane. Man of the match: Ryan Fraser Fraser was a constant thorn in the Everton side with young right-back Jonjoe Kenny enduring one of his toughest assignments since being drafted into the Everton side. The Scot combined well with Adam Smith down Bournemouth's left and capped a lively display with his first Premier League brace. While there was a slice of good fortune about his late winner, Fraser was rewarded for his persistence, having caused endless problems to the Everton defence as the hosts secured a crucial victory thanks to his contribution. The managers Eddie Howe: \"It was another incredible game. We've ended up with four points from the last two games. We showed tremendous character, and I was delighted to see the second goal go in. \"Unless you've been following us the past few weeks, you won't know we've been shooting ourselves in the foot a little bit with individual errors but we showed great character to fight back and win the game. I thought we deserved it.\" Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe praised his side’s performance, in particular two-goal Ryan Fraser in their 2-1 win against Everton in the Premier League.

Sam Allardyce: \"I feel disappointed because of the way we gave it away, really. We gave them the opportunity to score the winner even though it's got a bad deflection and gone into the net. We shouldn't have allowed them to get into that position in the first place. \"We had good possession in their half and just gifted it back to them. They punished us in the end.\" Everton boss Sam Allardyce was disappointed with the way his side gave away both Bournemouth goals in their 2-1 loss to the Cherries in the Premier League.

Pundit reaction Charlie Nicholas: \"A big slice of luck played a part [in the winner]. I was really disappointed with Everton and the home team deserved this. \"Wilson got a little too selfish for me and he was frustrating his team-mates. Fraser's shot is probably going wide but the deflection takes it past Pickford, who I thought was excellent. \"He made four or five top-class saves, so for me Bournemouth deserved it, although it's a late goal coming. I'm sure Eddie Howe and the boys won't care as it's a great three points for them.\" Charlie Nicholas admits he was disappointed by Everton’s display against Bournemouth, and that Eddie Howe’s men deserved the win.

intensified on Saturday. Goals from Antonio Rudiger (4), Danny Drinkwater (9), Pedro (24), Willian (74) and Davide Zappacosta (88) sent Chelsea into second above Manchester United, who were later held at home by Southampton. Meanwhile, Stoke, who were without defensive duo Ryan Shawcross and Kurt Zouma, have now conceded 49 goals this season - a league high - and remain just two points above the drop. Mark Hughes' side have now won only twice in 11 matches and are very much looking over their shoulder. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (7), Rudiger (7), Azpilicueta (7), Cahill (6), Moses (6), Alonso (6), Kante (7), Drinkwater (7), Pedro (8), Willian (8), Morata (6) Subs: Bakayoko (6), Zappacosta (7), Batshuayi (6) Stoke: Butland (6), Wimmer (4), Edwards (4), Cameron (4), Tymon (3), Fletcher (4), Adam (6), Afellay (4), Sobhi (6), Diouf (6), Berahino (4) Subs: Choupo-Moting (5), Ngoy (3) Man of the Match: Willian Chelsea were ahead inside three minutes, which set the tone for a dismal afternoon for the visitors. Willian fired a set-piece in from the right and Rudiger rose highest to nod home. Stoke barely got out of their half in the opening quarter and were two behind on nine minutes when Pedro's cross dropped to Drinkwater on the edge of the box, where he found the top corner with a special dipping volley. Team news Antonio Conte decided to rest Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas and Tiémoué Bakayoko – in came Pedro, Willian and Danny Drinkwater. Mark Hughes freshened up his squad, making six changes. Saido Berahino, Ibrahim Afellay and Josh Tyman all made rare starts. Willian supplied Pedro with a firm pass on 24 minutes and the Spaniard spun Josh Tymon before firing past Jack Butland into the far corner. Mame Biram Diouf had a goal ruled out for handball just before the break while Alvaro Morata wasted a one-on-one with Butland. Saido Berahino could have ended his goal drought but was thwarted by Thibaut Courtois. Willian fired a home a penalty - one that he won himself - before Zappacosta, a second-half sub, added a fifth after a terrible headed clearance by Tymon. Man of the match: Willian The Brazilian identifies Chelsea strength in depth going forward. With Eden Hazard rested, Willian slotted into the free role with aplomb, creating havoc with his movement and powerful running. Pedro ran him close for the award but his yellow card for an unnecessary dive in the second-half blotted his copybook. Opta stats Chelsea have conceded just four goals in their last 12 Premier League games, keeping eight clean sheets on the way. Stoke's total of 20 points after 21 games is their worst-ever haul at this stage of a Premier League season. Willian has been directly involved in six goals in his last four Premier League games against Stoke (4 goals, 2 assists). Five of Pedro's last seven Premier League goals have come from outside the box. Manager reaction Antonio Conte \"We started the game very well, with great desire to score early. \"In this type of game if you are able to score early the game can become easy because your opponent has to change their plan and then gives more space to your strikers.\" Mark Hughes \"We were stretched today - a little bit too much. \"We didn't have the tools to have a go at Chelsea. We're playing today, we're playing Monday. We've got injuries in key areas. That back four clearly hasn't played together, with two young full-backs. They found it difficult, which is understandable. It's a huge leap to what they're used to. \"At times they'll make mistakes and at this level you get punished. You have to factor that in and we understand that.\" Pundit reaction - Matt Le Tissier \"They [Stoke] weren't a threat going forward. Berahino had the only effort on goal that I can remember Courtois making a save from and they really weren't a threat all afternoon. \"It [Chelsea's first goal] was a bit bizarre. There was a free-kick on the right hand side, and Willian has whipped it in. A nice bit of curl, a nice bit of dip, and Rudiger's got up.

0-0 Burnley Huddersfield 0-0 Burnley Jeff Hendrick saw a strong penalty appeal waved away by referee Paul Tierney as Burnley and Huddersfield drew 0-0 for the second time in the Premier League this season. There were few clear-cut chances for either side but Burnley will feel aggrieved at not being given a penalty on the hour mark when Hendrick seemed to be caught by Jonas Lossl's trailing leg after dribbling round him. Former Huddersfield striker Nahki Wells almost came back to haunt his old employers late on but he saw his close-range effort blocked by Lossl meaning both teams had to settle for a point. Thanks to results elsewhere, both teams remain in the same positions that they were in before kick-off with Burnley in seventh and Huddersfield 11th, six points clear of the relegation zone. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Hadergjonaj (5), Jorgensen (6), Schindler (7), Malone (6), Hogg (7), Mooy (6), Ince (5), Van La Parra (6), Quaner (6), Depoitre (6). Subs: Smith (6), Lolley (5), Williams (6). Burnley: Pope (6), Bardsley (6), Long (6), Mee (6), Taylor (6), Arfield (7), Cork (7), Hendrick (7), Defour (7), Berg Gudmundsson (8), Barnes (6). Subs: Vokes (7), Wells (6). Man of the Match: Johann Berg Gudmundsson. Sean Dyche was unhappy that his side were not awarded a penalty Only the current top four teams in the Premier League table have won more away points this season than Burnley and they made a strong start with Hendrick passing into an empty net before correctly being adjudged to be offside after 13 minutes. Not long after, Johann Berg Gudmundsson had another good chance for the visitors after he slalomed his way into the penalty area before screwing a shot wide under pressure from two Huddersfield defenders. Gudmundsson was having plenty of joy against Scott Malone on the right wing and after skipping past him again he teed up Steven Defour for a shot on the edge of the area with the Belgian side-footing a shot inches wide of the far post. Team news David Wagner rotated his full-backs with Florent Hadergjonaj and Scott Malone replacing Tommy Smith and Chris Lowe while Laurent Depoitre started in place of Steve Mounie up front.Burnley, on the other hand, were unchanged from the side that drew 2-2 against Manchester United on Boxing Day. Burnley continued to look the more threatening side after the break and Scott Arfield drew a decent stop from Lossl after playing a neat one-two with Hendrick on the edge of the area. Then with an hour played the game's most contentious moment arrived when Hendrick rounded Lossl before going down under his challenge. Despite strong Burnley appeals, the referee opted not to award a spot-kick and decided against booking Hendrick for going to ground. Huddersfield's Collin Quaner takes a shot With only four minutes remaining, Wells, who joined Burnley from Huddersfield on Deadline Day in August, latched onto Sam Vokes' header but could not divert his shot on the stretch beyond Lossl. Opta stats Only Manchester City (30), Chelsea (20), Manchester United (18) and Liverpool (18) have won more away points in the Premier League this season than Burnley (17). Indeed, Burnley have kept as many away clean sheets in the Premier League this season (4 in 11 games), as they did in the whole of 2016-17 (4 in 19 games). Huddersfield Town are now unbeaten in their last four Premier League games (W1 D3) - their longest streak in the competition. Burnley have lost just three of their 21 league meetings with Huddersfield Town since March 1971 (W11 D7 L3). Both fixtures between these two teams this season finished 0-0 - the first time they've shared two goalless draws in a single league campaign. This was the eighth time this season that Burnley named an unchanged starting XI in the Premier League; more often than any other team. Man of the match - Johann Berg Gudmundsson Usually, it is Burnley's defensive players who stand out most but Johann Gudmundsson's attacking performance really caught the eye in what was a tight game. Gudmundsson was Burnley's most creative player against Huddersfield The Iceland international absolutely terrorised Huddersfield's left-back Scott Malone in the first half with his dribbling and looked the most likely player to conjure up a moment of magic all afternoon. Burnley created nine chances in total and Gudmundsson was responsible for six of them which highlights how influential he was. The managers David Wagner: \"I haven't seen the video footage [of Burnley's penalty appeal] to be honest. I was too far away. Maybe we were lucky in this case but on many times this season we have been unlucky. \"It was a very tough game for us I'm very pleased with this point and a clean sheet as well. I think everyone can see why Burnley are 7th in the Premier League. \"They had the better chances and more chances so it was a point that we had to work very hard for but Burnley were the better team today.\" Sean Dyche: \"I don't think I need to say too much about it because hopefully everyone will see it and hopefully it will be shown again and again because it is impossible to not give us a penalty in my opinion. \"I'm in a league where penalties are given for all sorts of reasons and that is as blatant a penalty as you will see. \"I think what is peculiar about football at the minute is that players who go down in a diving manner get them. Jeff Hendrick hasn't done that, he's gone down in a really natural manner and hasn't got it. \"His back foot was clearly taken away from him and everyone on the pitch can see it apart from the most important person didn't.\" What's next? Both teams are next in action on New Year's Day with Huddersfield facing Leicester City at the King Power while Burnley host Liverpool at Turf Moor."}, {"date": "30/12/2018", "arena": "Anfield",

Liverpool 2-1 Leicester Mohamed Salah continued his impressive season as he scored twice to help Liverpool come from behind and beat Leicester 2-1 at Anfield on Saturday. With £75m signing Virgil van Dijk watching in the stands, Liverpool's need for defensive improvement was highlighted in just the third minute as they lost possession around their own box and were punished by Jamie Vardy. Salah wasted two good chances to score before half-time, but made amends in the second half as he levelled in the 52nd minute and then netted the winner in the 76th minute.

Leicester, meanwhile, have now not won in five matches, despite taking an early lead at Anfield when Joel Matip's pass out of defence was cut out and Vicente Iborra played through for Mahrez to tee up Vardy for a tap-in from eight yards. Liverpool's new record signing Virgil van Dijk visited Anfield before the game Liverpool's new record signing Virgil van Dijk visited Anfield before the game Salah spurned two good opportunities to reply as he placed a shot wide from inside the box and then missed the target after racing clear down the right side. Liverpool continued to press and probe but without any reward until the second half. Team news Karius replaced Mignolet in goal for Liverpool while Mane, Milner, Lovren and Gomez started ahead of Wijnaldum, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Klavan and Alexander-Arnold. Leicester made four changes as Fuchs, Gray, Iborra and Amartey came in for Chilwell, King, Dragovic and Okazaki. Salah eventually levelled for the hosts in the 52nd minute when he collected Sadio Mane's backheel and controlled well before finishing down the middle of the goal. Liverpool continued to look the more threatening side and Salah went close again as he lobbed an effort over the bar. Salah celebrates scoring his second goal Leicester's best moments came from Christian Fuchs' long throws, but, after one resulted in Wilfried Ndidi firing just wide from the edge of the box, Salah completed the turnaround when he spun away from Harry Maguire and shot past Schmeichel. Opta stats Liverpool have scored 77 goals in their 30 games in all competitions this season - their highest ever total at this stage of a campaign as a top-flight club. Liverpool have gone 15 games in all competitions without defeat (W10 D5) - their joint-longest unbeaten run under Jurgen Klopp (also a 15-game run ending in November 2016). Salah (23 goals) has scored more goals in all club competitions this season than eight Premier League clubs (Crystal Palace, Burnley, Brighton, Swansea, WBA, Huddersfield, Southampton & Newcastle). Since August 2014, Vardy has scored more goals in the Premier League against 'big six' opposition than any other player (22 goals in 41 apps). Vardy (7) has scored more Premier League goals against Liverpool than versus any other team. In fact, only Andrew Cole (11) and Thierry Henry (8) have scored more Premier League goals versus Liverpool than Jamie Vardy. The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"Our reaction to going 1-0 down was the best reaction we have showed, it was a big step and the mentality was fantastic today. The crowd were fantastic and helped us a lot. It can happen at Anfield that people are not that patient but today they saw that the team tried everything so it was one of the best atmospheres we have had so far, and we needed it. This game was pretty much perfect apart from the situation around the first goal.\" Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says his side were pretty much perfect Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says his side were pretty much perfect Claude Puel: \"It's a big disappointment as a squad because they gave their best. We had a fantastic start to the game with the goal and we tried to keep this result and perhaps to score again.

However, he responded well after the break to secure victory for Liverpool. He showed excellent close control for the first goal and turned away well from Maguire for the second. The double brings the curtain down on a remarkable second half of 2017 for the 25-year-old. What's next?

Isaac Hayden made a superb run down the right flank in the 13th minute before whipping the ball into the box, but his delivery evaded the heads of Dwight Gayle and Christian Atsu with Bruno sending the ball away. Nine minutes later and Ryan was eventually tested as Mikel Merino's brilliant long ball picked out the run of Gayle on the right. He latched onto the pass before getting to the by-line and cutting the ball back into the middle, but the hand of Ryan kept it from reaching another Newcastle player before pouncing on the rebound ahead of the waiting Joselu. Team news Newcastle retained four players from their loss to Man City, with DeAndre Yedlin, Jamaal Lascelles, Paul Dummett and Joselu keeping their places. Brighton made five changes with Bruno, Gaetan Bong, Anthony Knockaert, Pascal Gross and Glenn Murray coming into the side. Karl Darlow also got a rare hold of the ball in the 27th minute as Brighton had a spell of pressure around the box. Pascal Gross sped away down the right-hand side before hitting a low cross into the box, but Matt Ritchie's attempted clearance could only fall to Anthony Knockaert at the top of the area. However, his strike was straight at the Newcastle stopper. Newcastle began the second half well, but were once again denied by some heroics from Ryan. Five minutes after the restart and a cleared corner fell to Hayden at the top of the box, with his scuffed shot taking a big deflection off the leg of Dunk to send it goalwards. Ryan then leapt into action to spare the blushes of his team-mate and push away the ball. Glenn Murray evades the challenge of Mikel Merino The Brighton goalkeeper was called into action again in the 59th minute as Atsu picked out Gayle in between the two Seagulls centre-backs. The forward glanced his delivery towards goal, but Ryan made another leaping save to deny him the opener. In a similar story to the first half, Brighton also tested Darlow 10 minutes later. Shane Duffy met a Gross corner at the back post, nodding it down for Dunk in the middle, but his own headed effort was palmed away by the Newcastle goalkeeper. Opta stats Newcastle have now won just one point in their last six Premier League home games at St James' Park (W0 D1 L5). This was the fourth time that Brighton have drawn 0-0 in the Premier League this season; a joint-league-high alongside WBA. In fact, this was the 11th time that Brighton have failed to score in 21 Premier League games this season; the most in the competition level with Crystal Palace and Swansea City. Newcastle made seven changes to their starting XI in this match (from their last game vs Man City) - this is the most that a side has made in a Premier League game this season. Joselu and Dale Stephens tussle in the middle of the park The managers Rafa Benitez: \"Obviously we are not happy because we wanted to win. We created a little bit, but not too much, and they were well organised, so it was difficult to break them down. \"I think in the second half, we had more chances and we were pushing harder so this is the positive thing. The reaction of the team is that if something is wrong then they don't give up and they continue, so that is a positive too.\" Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez says his side are not happy following their draw with Brighton but admitted the visitors managed the game well Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez says his side are not happy following their draw with Brighton but admitted the visitors managed the game well Chris Hughton: \"I thought we were good today. In regards to the result, I think on the balance of play, it was a fair result but on the day, I thought we were the better side of the two. \"In terms of chances, we needed Mat Ryan in particular to make one very good save and it got very edgy towards the end as it would do away at Newcastle. I thought we had some really good periods in the game.\" Brighton boss Chris Hughton says a draw at Newcastle was a fair result but believed his team were the better of the two on the day Brighton boss Chris Hughton says a draw at Newcastle was a fair result but believed his team were the better of the two on the day The pundit Phil Thompson: \"The performance was not of the level you would want [from Newcastle]. Particularly after making seven changes to the side. And they never really got going. \"They had two chances, Brighton had one chance. And Mat Ryan was up for the save. The first one was a bit of a fluke. Isaac Hayden took a shot and it takes a deflection, the goalkeeper has to change his position and he does really, really well to save it.\" Phil Thompson says both Newcastle and Brighton have very little attacking talent in their sides after what was a dull 0-0 draw Phil Thompson says both Newcastle and Brighton have very little attacking talent in their sides after what was a dull 0-0 draw Man of the match - Mat Ryan Another solid performance from Ryan - who could be the difference for the Seagulls this season - even if his team could not produce the goods at the other end. Although he was a spectator for much of the game as Newcastle often dragged shots well wide of his range, he pulled off some superb saves when called upon and was vital to securing a point for Brighton early in the second half. What's next? Both teams are back in action on New Year's Day, with Newcastle travelling to Stoke at 3pm and Brighton hosting Bournemouth in the early kick-off, live on Sky Sports Premier League from 12pm."},

Late goals get Carlos Carvalhal off to flyer and lift Swans off bottom 2:47 Watford 1-2 Swansea Watford 1-2 Swansea Goals from Jordan Ayew and Luciano Narsingh saw Swansea stage a dramatic late comeback to earn a 2-1 win at Watford and move off the bottom of the Premier League table. Carlos Carvalhal's first game in charge of the Swans had looked like it would be settled by Andre Carrillo's first goal for the Hornets, after the Peruvian headed home early on at Vicarage Road. But Ayew turned in an Oli McBurnie header from close range in the 86th minute to level for the visitors - the home players and fans thought the striker was offside, but the goal was rightly awarded. And in the final minute, Narsingh netted his first Premier League goal for the Welsh club when he was the first to react to Heurelho Gomes parrying a Nathan Dyer shot. Player ratings Watford: Gomes (6), Janmaat (6), Wague (6), Kabasele (6), Zengelaar (5), Cleverley (6), Doucoure (7), Watson (6), Carrillo (7), Richarlison (7), Okaka (6) Subs: Prodl (5), Gray (5), Pereyra (5).

Andre Carrilo of Watford celebrates with team-mates after scoring his side's first goal Richarlison looked dangerous throughout the game for Watford, showing his intent from the second minute when he beat Federico Fernandez to the ball, resulting in a caution for the Swansea man. Team news Carlos Carvalhal gave Renato Sanches his first start in over a month. The recall of his compatriot was one of three changes for Swansea. Watford made just one change with striker Stefano Okaka replacing Roberto Pereyra. The Brazilian made a more telling impact, as he raced onto a pass from Stefano Okaka before having shot parried into the path of Carrillo who calmly headed home in the 11th minute. Watford were dominant for 85 minutes and should have completed the victory without too much trouble, but let themselves down late on and should have won it when Andre Gray was sent through, but the striker panicked and struck the ball straight at Lukasz Fabianski. In the 86th minute McBurnie was given space to head a right-wing cross into the path of an unmarked Ayew who side-footed the ball home from six yards. There were plenty of protestations from those in yellow, but they were rightly ignored. Carlos Carvalhal celebrates his side's 2-1 victory over Watford Four minutes later, Watford failed to properly clear a free-kick, allowing Dyer to send a shot in, which Gomes could only send straight into a dangerous area where Narsingh was waiting to net the winner. The three points were crucial for Swansea, who looked short of confidence for much of the match, but now find themselves off the bottom, if only in 19th place. Swansea boss Carlos Carvalhal says he feels compensated for his hard work after he started his new job with a win at Watford. Swansea boss Carlos Carvalhal says he feels compensated for his hard work after he started his new job with a win at Watford. The managers Marco Silva: \"Of course all of us are disappointed, our fans as well, because until the moment their first goal is scored, we controlled the match. Until that moment, I cannot remember one chance they had in the match. At this level, when we have a chance we need to score. \"We had two clear chances to score. Some seconds before they scored the 1-1, we had a clear chance with Andre and the goalkeeper and in that moment we need to kill the match.\" Watford boss Marco Silva says his side needed to kill off the game after being beaten by Swansea in a match he believed his team controlled.

Carlos Carvalhal: \"We don't play the first 45 minutes as we wish because we had some problems, especially when the No 8 connects the game in the back of our midfield and we had some problems to control. In the last 15 minutes, we solved this. \"Second half we start taking risks, putting players in attack, all three players we put on affect the game. \"I will not say we deserved the win, as we played against a good opponent who had good chances. Luck is part of the game and they were lucky when we hit the back.\" Opta stats Five of Watford's Premier League games this season have seen a 90+ minute winning goal - two in their favour, three against. This was the fourth Premier League game this season that Watford have been winning with 20 minutes remaining and have ended up as the losing team. Watford have now lost 16 points from winning positions this season in the Premier League, more than any other team. Swansea scored a 90+ minute winning goal in a Premier League game for the fourth time and for the first time away from home April 2014 at Newcastle, when Wilfried Bony scored their winner that day. Swansea picked up their first Premier League away win since August 26th (2-0 at Crystal Palace) and ended an eight-game winless run on the road in the competition (W0 D1 L7). Man of the match - Lukasz Fabianksi In a game short on quality, it was the Swansea goalkeeper who kept his side in the match, especially when he prevented Gray moments before the equaliser.

Romelu Lukaku missed a good headed chance for the hosts early on before being taken off for a worrying head injury, while Saints had openings of their own at the other end as David de Gea saved well from James Ward-Prowse. De Gea turned over Shane Long's low drive after the break as Saints, having won just once in 12 Premier League games, threatened to stun the hosts. Lukaku headed over during the early stages at Old Trafford Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (7), Young (6), Jones (7), Lindelof (5), Shaw (5), Matic (4), Pogba (7), Mkhitaryan (5), Mata (5), Lingard (5), Lukaku (5) Subs: Rashford (5), Martial (5) Southampton: McCarthy (6), Stephens (7), Hoedt (8), Yoshida (7), McQueen (7), Ward-Prowse (7), Romeu (6), Hojbjerg (6), Tadic (6), Long (6), Boufal (7) Subs: Gabbiadini (NA), Lemina (NA), Redmond (NA) Man of the match: Wesley Hoedt United failed to create any clear chances late on, and the result means Jose Mourinho's side are down to third in the Premier League after Chelsea moved up to second, while Saints are in 13th, two points off the drop zone. There was a worry early on for United as Lukaku was taken off on a stretcher early on after a nasty clash of heads with Wesley Hoedt, just moments after the Belgian had headed unmarked six yards from goal. However, reports from the ground suggested that Lukaku was being treated at the ground rather than taken to hospital. Ward-Prowse had forced a superb low save out of De Gea from 15 yards during a frantic opening, while Hoedt also glanced wide unmarked inside the box from a corner. Team news Jose Mourinho made three changes from the 2-2 draw with Burnley; Lindelof was in for Rojo, Lingard for Rashford and Mkhitaryan for Ibrahimovic, who didn't make the bench. It was Henrikh Mkhitaryan's first start since the defeat by Chelsea in early November. There were four changes for Saints; goalkeeper Forster was dropped for McCarthy, McQueen replaced Targett, Tadic came in back for Redmond and Ward-Prowse replaced Lemina. Jesse Lingard under pressure from Sofiane Boufal Big chances fell to United in the first half; Juan Mata's low drive was saved by the feet of Alex McCarthy, sub Marcus Rashford couldn't get over the ball from point-blank range after Ashley Young's superb cross, and Jesse Lingard headed wide from Henrikh Mkhitaryan's delivery as the sides went in goalless. There was also a big penalty appeal as the ball struck Yoshida's hand in the box, but referee Craig Pawson deemed it accidental as he waved play on. United had most of the possession again, but rarely threatened in the second half, as De Gea had to be at his best once more to turn over Long's first-time effort with his feet. The hosts had the ball in the net late on through Paul Pogba after Nemanja Matic's effort was turned home by the Frenchman from close range, but he was rightly flagged for offside by linesman Richard West. Replays show that if Pogba had left the ball, it may have hit the inside of the post and gone into the net. Jeers rang around Old Trafford at full time, with Manchester City primed to open up a 17-point lead over their rivals if they win at Crystal Palace on New Year's Eve. An injured Romelu Lukaku of Manchester United is taken off on a stretcher Man of the match - Wesley Hoedt Although Saints' job was made a lot easier by Lukaku's unfortunate injury early on, their defence stood firm to get an unlikely draw and clean sheet at Old Trafford. At the heart of that defence was Dutchman Hoedt, who made 10 clearances as United peppered the visitors' box, more than any player on the pitch. Saints showed more belief in both attack and defence than you'd expect given recent form, and Hoedt was integral in earning a point in the hope of giving them momentum going into 2018. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"[Pawson is] a very good referee, one of the most promising young referees not just in England, but in Europe too, had a very bad decision that punished us. Then, the game was about us trying, missing some important chances, and always trying to create, always trying to play. I think we deserved to win the match.\" Jose Mourinho said Craig Pawson's decision not to award a penalty was a bad one Mauricio Pellegrino: \"For sure we are really pleased, not just for the point, we are happy because our performance was really good from the beginning to the end, especially in the way we approached the game. In the way we approached the game, good focus, attitude, personality. United were never comfortable on the pitch and were always uncomfortable on the pitch.\" Opta facts United are now winless in four competitive matches (W0 D3 L1) - their worst run since May 2017, when the fourth game in that run was also against Southampton. This match ended a 20-game scoring run for United at Old Trafford in all competitions, since last failing to score there on April 1 v WBA (also 0-0). Southampton have lost just one of their last five trips to Old Trafford to face Manchester United (W2 D2 L1). This was the 16th time in Southampton's last 33 competitive games (since April 1st) that they have failed to score (48 per cent). What's next? Man Utd go to Everton on New Year's Day at 5.30pm in the Premier League, before their FA Cup third-round clash with Derby at Old Trafford on Friday evening.

Arsenal ended Crystal Palace's eight-match unbeaten run with an entertaining 3-2 victory at Selhurst Park on Thursday. Shkodran Mustafi put the Gunners ahead midway through an impressive first-half showing in Arsene Wenger's record-equalling 810th Premier League game. Andros Townsend levelled shortly after half-time as Palace fought back, but Sanchez responded with two goals in four minutes, the second coolly finished from Jack Wilshere's pass over the top.

Roy Hodgson's side remain just a point above the relegation zone. Arsenal were largely in the ascendancy throughout the first half and, after Mesut Ozil failed to finish following a slick passing move, Mustafi fired in the opener as Julian Speroni could only parry out a cross to him. The visitors should have extended their lead before the break as Speroni made a sharp stop to deny Ozil and Alexandre Lacazette shot wide after quick footwork on the edge of the box. Shkodran Mustafi celebrates his 25th-minute opener Ozil passed up another chance and Hector Bellerin missed the target with a close-range volley, before Palace levelled with their first shot on target as Zaha skipped past Chambers on the left side and pulled back for Townsend to finish. The momentum looked to be with Palace after the equaliser, but a quickfire double from Sanchez put Arsenal back in front. Sanchez rifled in at the near post in the 62nd minute and then slipped a shot past Speroni after Wilshere's ball over the defence from halfway. Zaha seemed to have spurned Palace's best chance to score again when he headed wide at the back post, and they could not get back into the game even though Tomkins headed in from a corner in the 89th minute. Opta stats Arsenal have won more Premier League London derbies (120) than any other side. Roy Hodgson has won just one of his last 12 Premier League matches against Arsenal (D3 L8). Arsene Wenger took charge of his 810th game as a Premier League manager in this match (P810 W468 D197 L145); equalling Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League record. Jack Wilshere started in four consecutive Premier League games for Arsenal for the first time since March 2014. Crystal Palace have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 10 Premier League home games - their longest such run since May 2015 (15). The managers Roy Hodgson: \"The second goal was difficult having worked so hard in the first half to try to contain them. To get to 1-1 and then go down 2-1 you knew it was going to be an uphill task, but I have to give the players a lot of credit because we conceded a third and many teams would have capitulated and we certainly didn't do that. Roy Hodgson said he must give his players a lot of credit for the fight they showed Roy Hodgson said he must give his players a lot of credit for the fight they showed Arsene Wenger: \"It was convincing, the second half was more difficult than the first because we didn't take advantage of the chances we created.

Man of the match - Alexis Sanchez With his contract running down, Sanchez has been criticised for some of his performances this season, but he was key for Arsenal at Selhurst Park. His finish to make it 2-1 was precise - drilling a shot past Speroni at the near post - and his second was composed as he slipped the ball past the goalkeeper from Wilshere's pass.

clear at the top of the Premier League after a dominant 1-0 win over Newcastle on Wednesday. City were in complete control throughout at St James' Park and should have secured their 18th straight league win by a more convincing scoreline. Sergio Aguero hit the post twice and Kevin De Bruyne also struck the woodwork, but in the end Sterling's 31st-minute finish was enough for all three points. Newcastle had just 22 per cent possession and only threatened on a couple of occasions, with Rolando Aarons going closest when his chipped effort was headed off the line in the first half.

City created chances from the start as Aguero volleyed against the post from close range and De Bruyne fired over from the edge of the box. Vincent Kompany came off with an apparent injury after 11 minutes Such was City's dominance that Gabriel Jesus came on after 11 minutes to replace defender Vincent Kompany, who looked to have suffered another injury. Rob Elliot made a brilliant reaction save to tip over a header from Aguero, who shortly afterwards hit the post again with a strike from 25 yards. But Newcastle's resistance was eventually broken when Sterling finished from De Bruyne's excellent pass over the top. Newcastle almost snatched a surprise equaliser as Nicolas Otamendi headed off the line from Aarons' chipped shot, but City otherwise remained in control and Aguero and Sterling went close to a second goal. Team news Mbemba, Dummett, Murphy, Shelvey and Aarons started for the hosts, with Clark, Atsu, Saivet, Ritchie and Gayle making way. Man City made three changes as Danilo, Bernardo Silva and Gundogan replaced Delph, David Silva and Sane Aguero and De Bruyne missed good chances at the start of the second half and the latter then fired against the post in the 66th minute. City continued to dominate but were almost caught out in the final few minutes as substitute Gayle headed just past the post. Opta stats Manchester City have now won 11 consecutive away Premier League games - a joint top-flight record (also 11 wins in a row by Chelsea between April and December 2008). Newcastle United have lost five consecutive home league matches for the first time since October 1953. Nicolas Otamendi completed 122 passes for Man City in this match - seven more than all the outfield players of Newcastle managed combined (115). Rafael Benitez has now lost six of his last 10 home Premier League matches - he had lost six of his previous 110 before this run; 38 per cent of Benitez's total home Premier League defeats have come this season (six of 16). Since his Premier League debut for Manchester City, Kevin De Bruyne has 36 assists - four more than any other player. This was Pep Guardiola's 42nd Premier League victory for Manchester City but only his second 1-0 win (also 1-0 against Chelsea in September). Raheem Sterling says the title has not been won yet and they must keep winning matches, following Manchester City's win over Newcastle. Raheem Sterling says the title has not been won yet and they must keep winning matches, following Manchester City's win over Newcastle. Man of the match - Kevin De Bruyne Sterling might have got the winning goal, but De Bruyne was at the heart of everything City did in the final third. The Belgium international had four shots, including one which hit the post, and made five key passes, including a perfectly-weighted pass over the top for the goal. The managers Rafael Benitez: \"I think we knew it was a difficult game, and we needed to work really hard to get something. It was a pity we conceded and I thought we could have done better.

But every manager can decide whatever he wants. \"You have to find and search for a way to attack them when they defend with 11 players in the box, when a striker goes with our holding midfielder, and there are nine or ten players there waiting for a throw-in or free-kick or corner. \"I cannot judge them.

calendar year after netting his eighth hat-trick of 2017 in Tottenham's 5-2 win over Southampton. Shearer's record of 36 goals, set in 1995 while at Blackburn Rovers, was beaten when Kane headed in the simplest of finishes (22) at Wembley on Boxing Day. A second followed for Kane (39) before half-time, while the England international also netted Spurs' fifth of the afternoon with an exquisite finish to end the year with 39 Premier League goals. You’ve had a magnificent 2017 @HKane. You deserve to hold the record of most @premierleague goals in a calendar year. Well done and keep up the good work. 👏🏻🙋🏼‍♂️ — Alan Shearer (@alanshearer) December 26, 2017 Quick-fire strikes from Dele Alli (49) and Heung-Min Son (51) had put the game beyond Southampton before Sofiane Boufal reduced the deficit (54), while Dusan Tadic netted a consolation late on (82).

Spurs did have a scare moments later, but Hugo Lloris used the post to hep keep out Danny Rose's looping header back after it had looped over the goalkeeper. Kane put Spurs in control before half-time, rounding off an intricate team move after Alli had picked out Son, who then laid it on a plate for the striker. Team news Tottenham made two changes with Danny Rose and Mousa Dembele coming in for Ben Davies and Moussa Sissoko. Four Southampton changes saw Oriol Romeu, Sofiane Boufal, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Shane Long all start, while Virgil van Dijk remained out of the squad.

Tadic did manage to score a late consolation for Southampton after Lloris could only parry the lobbed effort into the net. Harry Kane scores his and Tottenham's second goal Man of the match - Harry Kane Where do you even start when summarising Kane's 2017? 39 Premier League goals in 36 games. Eight hat-tricks in all competitions. 56 goals in 52 games for club and country - more than Lionel Messi (54 in 64) and Cristiano Ronaldo (53 in 60). The list goes on... And it was a fitting farewell to the year for Kane at Wembley, finishing with aplomb for the third after two simple finishes. For Spurs, and England, it will simply be the case of hoping that form can continue into 2018. The Pundit - Jamie Redknapp \"Twenty goals now in the season, obviously Charlie Austin is out injured for a while with his hamstring. \"It worries me because what they have done is they were a team a few years ago that we applauded - it is great how they run their club, they manage to sell good players and keep getting better. \"But not now and that catches up with you. In the end, what we are seeing now is if you keep selling your best players and not buying better players, you are going to be in a mess. \"Now by the end of the day they could be a couple of points off the bottom three, a team lacking form and confidence.\" Managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"First of all I want to congratulate Harry Kane, a massive achievement for him, well deserved,\" \"And we are all so, so, so, so happy because it's an amazing thing to celebrate. For me, he's world class. \"I think today, (number) one striker in the world, specific position, who's better than him?\" Mauricio Pochettino praised Harry Kane’s achievement of becoming the highest scoring player in 2017 but admitted he is not surprised because of his determination and professionalism.

Mauricio Pellegrino: \"I decide that it's the best for the team. I know that around Virgil there will be a lot of speculation but this is my decision. \"It's tactical reasons. The manager decides which is the best for every single game; we win, we draw, we lost with and without Virgil and in this squad right now I have a lot of players who can play. \"Now he's part of our club and we know that Virgil is an important player for us, but we'll see what happens in the future. \"I cannot control the whispers and the news from outside.\" Mauricio Pellegrino felt his side showed character and personality in second half of their 5-2 defeat to Spurs but admitted that they made it too easy for Harry Kane in the first half.

James Collins (7) put West Ham ahead early on before Dan Gosling (30) levelled up for the hosts, although Bournemouth could have been down to 10 men not long after when Cheikhou Kouyate was caught in the face by the boot of Simon Francis. Just 12 minutes after the restart and Bournemouth took the lead through Nathan Ake (57) and looked to be heading for a much-needed win before two mistakes from Asmir Begovic allowed Marko Arnautovic (82, 89) to put West Ham back in front. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (5), Francis (5), S Cook (7), Ake (7), Gosling (6), Smith (6), L Cook (7), Fraser (8), King (6), Ibe (6), Wilson (6). Subs used: Afobe (4), Pugh (n/a). West Ham: Adrian (7), Cresswell (6), Collins (7), Ogbonna (6), Zabaleta (6), Kouyate (6), Lanzini (7), Obiang (6), Masuaku (7), Ayew (5), Arnautovic (6). Subs used: Carroll (5), Hernandez (6), Rice (4). Man of the match: Ryan Fraser. But there was more to come as Wilson scored in the 93rd minute to seal a point for Bournemouth, although it was only given after a discussion between referee Bobby Madley and his linesman, who had initially flagged the goal for offside. It was a fast start from West Ham, who took the lead inside seven minutes. Aaron Creswell whipped an inviting corner into the box, which Collins met at the near post with a great header after getting away from his marker Francis in the box. Both sides could have scored the next goal with chances coming thick and fast, but it was Bournemouth who found the net first as they got themselves on level terms. Ryan Fraser delivered a superb free-kick into the box and despite Collins initially getting a head to it, the rebound fell to Gosling who slotted home. Team news Bournemouth made three changes from Saturday with Simon Francis, Lewis Cook and Josh King coming back into the XI. West Ham also made two changes with Manuel Lanzini and James Collins returning. But Bournemouth could have gone down to 10 men in the 33rd minute after Francis caught Cheikhou Kouyate in the face with a high boot after attempting to go for the ball. After a ruckus between the two teams, the Cherries captain only received a yellow card while Kouyate had an extended spell with the medical team. The hosts started the second half well and took the lead in the 57th minute. After playing a short corner, the ball was worked to Lewis Cook near the top left corner and he whipped into the box, with the bobbling delivery landing at the feet of Ake who swept home. As in the first period, there were numerous chances for both sides, but it took until the 82nd minute for either to make the breakthrough, and it came courtesy of a horrible mistake from Begovic. He miss-kicked a seemingly simple back pass clearance, which landed to the waiting Arnautovic and he made no mistake in slotting home to put West Ham level. James Collins celebrates his opening goal Seven minutes later, and West Ham thought they had won the game after another poor bit of play from Begovic. He failed to properly clear a shot from Hernandez on the right of the box, with his two-footed saved seeing the ball again fall to Arnautovic, who poked home at the near post. But the controversy came in six minutes of added time as Bournemouth searched for the equaliser. Ake headed the ball across the face of goal, which met the head of Wilson at the near post and he nodded home, but the ball also appeared to hit his hand as it went in. However, the goal was initially ruled out by the linesman, who raised his flag for offside, but after a discussion with Madley, the referee signalled that the goal would stand despite the two incidents. Nathan Ake scores Bournemouth's second Opta stats Bournemouth are now without a victory in eight successive Premier League matches (D4 L4) - equalling their worst run in the competition (occurring three times previously). West Ham have picked up eight points in their last five Premier League games (W2 D2 L1), one more than they managed in their previous 11 in the competition. Dan Gosling scored and assisted in the same Premier League for the first time ever. Marko Arnautovic has netted five goals in his last five Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 38. Marko Arnautovic celebrates West Ham's second The managers Eddie Howe: \"I don't know where to start. A total mixture of emotions and I felt like the game was ours at 2-1, we had so many chances to make it three and put it to bed but we didn't take them. \"I've got no big opinion of it [Wilson's goal], but I was pleased to see it go in. I saw the flag and the longer the linesman and referee talked, I didn't think it would be given but I was delighted to see it. It was more than we deserved. I thought we were excellent and we should have won the game.\" Eddie Howe admits to mixed emotions as his Bournemouth side failed to capitalise on chances in their 3-3 draw with West Ham Eddie Howe admits to mixed emotions as his Bournemouth side failed to capitalise on chances in their 3-3 draw with West Ham David Moyes: \"I don't know how it was overruled. I don't know how or why he [Madley] would have to go to him if the linesman gives an offside. You rarely see that in any game where a linesman puts his flag up and it would be changed. \"The referee will see it himself. They get disappointed if they don't get it right. The last thing we want to do is blame referees, they do a great job in this country and I always think they try and referee each game as best they can.\" David Moyes says he believes Callum Wilson's equaliser was offside as his West Ham side's game against Bournemouth ended in a 3-3 draw David Moyes says he believes Callum Wilson's equaliser was offside as his West Ham side's game against Bournemouth ended in a 3-3 draw Man of the match - Ryan Fraser He may not have got onto the scoresheet, but Fraser was instrumental in Bournemouth's attacking play on Tuesday, with his fine free-kick delivery leading to the first half equaliser for the hosts. He was a constant menace for the hosts, picking up a number of free-kicks as West Ham looked to stop him in his tracks, and looks to be getting back to his best.

After failing to break down Everton on Saturday, Chelsea regained their killer-instinct with second-half goals from Alvaro Morata (46) and Marcos Alonso (59). The result keeps Chelsea in third, but they are still 13 points behind runaway league leaders Manchester City while Brighton sit 12th, four points above the drop. Player Ratings Chelsea: Courtois (7), Rudiger (7), Azpilicueta (7), Cahill (6), Moses (7), Alonso (8), Fabregas (8), Hazard (8), Kante (8), Bakayoko (6), Morata (7).

But the second half was only 53 seconds old when Chelsea increased their intensity and took the lead. The combination of Cesar Azpilicueta and Morata linked up for the sixth time this season as the defender whipped a sensational ball from deep for the striker to nod home his 12th goal of the season. Alonso forced a brilliant save from Mathew Ryan on 57 minutes from a 25-yard free-kick but beat him four minutes later when Fabregas curled in a corner that was met by Alonso with a glancing header. Team news Alvaro Morata returned for Chelsea in one of three changes made by Antonio Conte from their 0-0 draw at Everton. Chris Hughton freshened up his starting XI, making four changes. Ezequeil Schelotto, Shane Duffy, Jose Izquierdo and Beram Kayal came in. Eden Hazard dazzled in the pocket and nearly added a classic goal to his collection but his dazzling individual effort was cleared off the line by Lewis Dunk. With the game won, Chelsea eased up in the final stages which almost allowed Brighton to pull one back when Shane Duffy headed inches wide. Opta stats Chelsea are unbeaten in their last 13 Premier League games played on Boxing Day (W8 D5), since a 2-4 loss at Charlton in 2003. No team in Europe's big five leagues has seen more league goals scored by Spanish players this season than Chelsea (20, level with Real Sociedad). Morata has netted 12 headed goals in the big five European leagues since the start of last season, more than any other player. Since the start of last season, Azpilicueta has racked up 10 Premier League assists, more than any other defender. In terms of defender goals, Alonso leads the way in the Premier League since the start of last season, with 11. Man of the match: Eden Hazard Brighton managed to contain the Belgian for the opening 45 minutes, but he took over in the second half. His all-star display paved the way for Chelsea's two goals and he was unfortunate not to get himself on the scoresheet after a mesmeric individual run and finish which was cleared off the line. Pundit reaction: Tony Cottee \"Chelsea didn't have any answers in the first half, with ponderous build-up. Brighton just didn't switch on 51 seconds into the second half, with Morata's goal all about the cross. It was one of them games for Chelsea where they just had to get the three points, but it wasn't a vintage display. \"It's a striker's dream as it's whipped in at pace. All Morata had to do was get good contact with the ball.\" What's next?

cancelled out Tom Ince's early goal as Stoke held Huddersfield to a 1-1 draw at the John Smith's Stadium on Boxing Day. Sobhi, a first-half substitute for the injured Ryan Shawcross, slid home his second goal in as many games from Joe Allen's low cross on the hour-mark. Earlier, Ince had given Huddersfield the lead with his first goal for the club, thumping Collin Quaner's cut-back past Jack Butland in the 10th minute. Sobhi's leveller came against the run of play as Huddersfield dominated the second half, but David Wagner's side were unable to break down the stubborn visitors in the closing stages. Ramadan Sobhi celebrates his 60th minute equaliser It was a valuable point for Mark Hughes, who has been under pressure in recent weeks, but it looked like it might be a long afternoon for the Stoke manager when Ince scored with the first clear chance of the game. Stoke's best opportunities in the first half came in the space of a few seconds when Huddersfield somehow survived a frantic goalmouth scramble.

The ball was millimetres from crossing the line as it bounced back into Lossl's arms. Huddersfield's Rajiv van La Parra tested Jack Butland with a curling shot shortly before half-time, and the hosts continued on the front foot in the second half. Team news Huddersfield made four changes from their 1-1 draw with Southampton, with the in-form Laurent Depoitre surprisingly dropping to the bench. Stoke named an unchanged team from their 3-1 win over West Ham. But a few minutes after Van La Parra had forced another fine save from Butland, Stoke struck the leveller. Sobhi, who scored his first goal for Stoke in their 3-1 win over West Brom at the weekend, was booked after jubilantly celebrating with the travelling fans. Tom Ince celebrates his goal with team-mate Tommy Smith The closing stages were played at a frantic pace, with both sides seeing strong penalty appeals turned down. First, referee Anthony Taylor waved play on after Allen appeared to bring down Aaron Mooy, then Stoke were equally aggrieved when Christopher Schindler seemed to trip Mame Biram Diouf. Huddersfield were camped in Stoke's half as the home fans roared them on in the final 15 minutes, but they could not find a way through as the visitors put everyone behind the ball. Man of the match - Tom Ince Ince was in the right place at the right time to net his first Premier League goal since February 2014 and he went on to cause Stoke plenty of problems. In total he attempted six shots on goal, frequently taking up dangerous positions in and around the box and showing a willingness to run at defenders. The managers David Wagner: \"I have seen our situation in the video footage again. It is a clear penalty where the opponent didn't touch the ball, he only touched Aaron Mooy.\" Mark Hughes: \"We feel a little bit aggrieved if I'm honest. It was clearly a penalty on Mame Diouf in the middle of the box. He is shaping to protect the ball and his legs have been taken away from him, so it's a clear penalty.\" Mark Hughes believes his Stoke side were wrongly denied a penalty Mark Hughes believes his Stoke side were wrongly denied a penalty Opta stats Huddersfield are unbeaten in their last six league meetings with Stoke (W3 D3), in a run stretching back to 1997. Only Southampton (11) are on a current longer run without a Premier League clean sheet than Stoke (10, level with Newcastle). Ramadan Sobhi has scored in consecutive Premier League games, after failing to find the net in his first 29 appearances in the competition. Tom Ince scored his first Premier League goal for Huddersfield with what was his 45th shot in the competition for them. In fact, this was Ince's second ever goal in the competition. His first came with his first ever shot, for Crystal Palace back in February 2014, with his goal today ending a run of 59 shots without one. Huddersfield kept a clean sheet in their first three Premier League games this season, but have managed to keep a shutout in just three of the 17 since. What next?

came back from two goals down to earn a 2-2 draw against Burnley at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. Ashley Barnes turned home as United failed to clear a Johann Berg Gudmundsson's free-kick after three minutes, and Steven Defour made it 2-0 before half-time with a superb, curling free-kick from well outside the box. Half-time substitute Lingard missed a sitter from close range, before flicking home brilliantly to halve the deficit (53).

The result means United, without a win in three in all competitions, are 12 points behind leaders Manchester City, who play at Newcastle on Wednesday, while Burnley stay seventh. United boss Jose Mourinho said Burnley could seriously challenge for European spots this season, and they lived up to the claim in the first half, taking the lead through Barnes' close-range finish after pinball in the box from Gudmundsson's free-kick. Team news Zlatan Ibrahimovic started with Romelu Lukaku for the first time this season. Juan Mata also started, with Marcus Rashford, while Luke Shaw started for only the second time in the Premier League this season. Marcos Rojo replaced Victor Lindelof in defence. Burnley made one change; Chris Wood was out, so Ashley Barnes came in. Steven Defour celebrates after making it 2-0 with a fantastic free-kick Gudmundsson's fine delivery was then flicked onto the top of the crossbar by Scott Arfield, before Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope denied Luke Shaw from long range and then Paul Pogba's looping header from a corner. United lay siege on the Burnley goal with some sustained pressure in the first half, but Burnley got their second through Defour's wonderful free-kick, curled into the top left corner from 30 yards. Mourinho changed it up at half-time, bringing on Lingard and Henrikh Mkhitaryan for Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo, and it was Lingard who was heavily involved in the second period. First, the England midfielder missed a sitter from three yards, seeing his effort hit the face of Pope and then bobble along the crossbar, but he made amends minutes later. Ashley Barnes gives Burnley the lead at Old Trafford Receiving Ashley Young's low cross from the right, Lingard brilliantly flicked the ball between his legs and found the far corner. United pressed heavily in the final half an hour, but their next real chance came in the first minute of stoppage time as Lingard drilled a half-volley into the corner of the net from 15 yards, leaving Pope rooted, to save a point for the hosts. Opta stats This was the 20th time a Jose Mourinho-managed side had been two goals down in a Premier League game, but only the second time they hadn't lost (W0 D2 L18). Burnley became just the second different team to score twice against Jose Mourinho's Man Utd at Old Trafford, after Man City (twice, in September 2016 and earlier this month). Jesse Lingard has had a hand in 10 Premier League goals this season (six goals, four assists in 16 apps) - as many as in his previous three seasons combined (five goals, three assists in 51 games). Lingard also became the first Man Utd player to score a brace as a substitute since Chris Smalling in February 2015 - also against Burnley. Jesse Lingard misses a sitter from close range after the break The managers Jose Mourinho: \"My verdict? One team had one-and-a-half shots and scored two goals. Another team had the ball, played, createc chances, played with one defender for 45 minutes, had lots of dominance, and scored only two. So for me, that's the verdict. \"I don't want to take credit from them, not at all, that's their game. Not at all any critics for that, credit to them, but my team deserved to win. But the reality of football is that to win you have to score more than the opponent and we didn't.\" Jose Mourinho was unhappy with Burnley's style of play Jose Mourinho was unhappy with Burnley's style of play Sean Dyche: \"The achievement is only that we're looking to build on last season. Our only marker is that, and I think we're doing that. I think the play is improving. Are we moving forward as a club, and on the pitch? I think we are. \"We don't want to overthink these things, we'd accept a point here before this game, because it's so tough to come here.\" Sean Dyche was realistic about Burnley's draw at Old Trafford Sean Dyche was realistic about Burnley's draw at Old Trafford Man of the match - Johann Berg Gudmundsson Burnley's tactics for well over an hour at Old Trafford were perfect, and Iceland midfielder Gudmundsson was at the heart of everything Sean Dyche's side in United's half. His delivery for the opener after two minutes caused havoc in the United defence, and each of his five crosses in the first half caused problems for Phil Jones and Co. A special mention must go to Kevin Long and Phil Bardsley, both superb in the other box, but Gudmundsson's quality on the ball out wide was equally impressive in an attacking sense.

Leicester Watford picked up a first win in seven games after coming from behind to earn a 2-1 victory over Leicester at Vicarage Road on Boxing Day. Leicester took the lead through Riyad Mahrez after 37 minutes, before Molla Wague scored on his first Premier League start, against the club where he spent time on loan last season, to equalise on the stroke of half time. Watford built on the momentum generated from that equaliser after the break, and went ahead in the 65ht minute when Abdoulaye Doucoure's effort was diverted into his own net by Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. Heurelho Gomes had to be at his best to preserve the lead, but Watford held on to end a run of four successive defeats at the expense of a Leicester side who failed to build on their last-gasp draw against Manchester United last time out. Watford stay 10th, while Leicester remain in eighth despite the defeat. Player ratings Watford: Gomes (8), Janmaat (6), Kabasele (8), Wague (7), Watson (6), Cleverley (8), Doucoure (7), Zeegelaar (6), Carrillo (8), Pereyra (6), Richarlison (6).

Subs: Slimani (6), Ulloa (6), Gray (6). Man of the match: Tom Cleverley After a sluggish start to the game, the visitors upped the tempo, and Jamie Vardy really should have put the Foxes in front, but finished poorly when clean through on goal. However, the pressure told as Leicester did take the lead through Mahrez. Marc Albrighton worked space for a cross to the back post, where the Algeria international was on hand to head home. Richarlison should have equalised but could only find the side-netting after rounding Schmeichel, but the hosts did draw level shortly after. Team news Molla Wague came into the defence to make his first start for Watford, while, as expected, Marvin Zeegelaar and Abdoulaye Doucoure returned from suspension. Sebastian Prodl, Jose Holebas and Andre Gray were the men to make way. There were also three changes for Leicester. Aleksandar Dragovic made his Premier League debut with Danny Simpson injured, while Andy King and Shinji Okazaki were in for Vicente Iborra and Demarai Gray. The Leicester defence could not deal with Tom Cleverley's corner and while Richarlison was unable to steer the ball home, Wague was on hand to net his first goal in English football. Richarlison was then in thick of it once more immediately after the equaliser, and could have completed a dramatic turnaround, but his strike thundered out off the post after being picked out by an intricate Cleverley pass. Claude Puel says Leicester didn’t have a bad game despite losing 2-1 to Watford but was critical of his side’s defending at free kicks. Claude Puel says Leicester didn’t have a bad game despite losing 2-1 to Watford but was critical of his side’s defending at free kicks. After the break, Watford continued on the front foot, and took the lead 20 minutes into the second half. Cleverley's free-kick was deep and Doucoure steered the ball back across the goal line. Schmeichel tried to keep it out, but inadvertently nudged the ball over the line, with goal-line technology confirming it had crossed. Gomes then produced two stunning stops to ensure the hosts held on. First he bravely flung himself at Wes Morgan's strike to block, before diverting Leonardo Ulloa's header around the post.

Opta stats Leicester have lost two of their last three in the Premier League, the same total they had lost in the previous 13.

Kasper Schmeichel could not stop Abdoulaye Doucoure's effort creeping in Leicester have only won one of their 12 Premier League games played on Boxing Day (D2 L9), losing each of the last four in a row. Watford scored twice despite landing just one shot on target, with the winning goal coming courtesy of Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. The pundit - Phil Thompson \"Leicester didn't force Gomes into too many saves. You would've thought Leicester with a little bit more confidence and quality would've done better. Vardy's miss was the game changer, but I was really disappointed with Leicester. \"They get a stroke of luck with the winner, as when you look back Doucoure's shot from the angle might have come from a few inches out. Chris Kavanagh the referee was absolutely superb today, and his watch went to signal a goal. I think Schmeichel was a little unlucky, but both goalkeepers were not overworked in this game. Gomes cost Watford last week but he made a late save today to give them victory.\" Jamie Vardy (left) and Watford's Christian Kabasele battle for the ball The managers Marco Silva: \"Today, we showed very good personality, a big mentality to react like we did after it went 1-0. The last minute of the first half, we score, then we could have scored again through Richarlison. This is our normal mentality. Of course the last few results have put our players a little uncomfortable, but we were good this afternoon.\" Claude Puel: \"In the second half it was a little more difficult but they didn't create any chances. The result is a little harsh. It was not a bad game from us. We needed to win the second ball. It is a story of free-kicks. They got two goals from free-kicks, and we have to correct this.\" Man of the match - Tom Cleverley Watford have lacked fluidity of late and the writing looked to be on the wall once more after Leicester took the lead at Vicarage Road. But Cleverley's sheer persistence helped turn the match on its head and earn the home side a much-needed win. Richarlison fails to score past Schmeichel in first half No team-mate provided more key passes than the former Manchester United midfielder, while 10 crosses via the boot of Cleverley as he tried to wrestle the advantage from Leicester, shows just how hard he tried to influence the match.

League winless run stretched to 18 games with a turgid 0-0 draw with Everton at The Hawthorns on Boxing Day. The Baggies are now without a win in the Premier League since August 19 - one game shy of the all-time winless record - as Salomon Rondon and Craig Dawson spurned clear chances to end their alarming streak and hand Alan Pardew his first victory at the club at the sixth time of asking. Everton, bolstered by the return of Yannick Bolasie from a year-long injury absence, were toothless and disjointed going forward but extended their unbeaten start to life under Sam Allardyce to seven games. The result does little for West Brom who remain 19th in the Premier League, although they are three points from safety, while Everton stay in ninth. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (6), Dawson (6), Evans (6), Hegazi (6), Gibbs (7), Phillips (6), Livermore (6), Barry (6), Brunt (6), Rodriguez (6), Rondon (6). Subs: Krychowiak (5), McClean (n/a), Robson-Kanu (6). Everton: Pickford (7), Keane (7), Williams (7), Holgate (7), Kenny (7), Davies (6), Schneiderlin (6), Martina (6), Bolaise (6), Sigurdsson (6), Calvert-Lewin (5). Subs: Baningime (n/a), Lennon (5), Niasse (5). Man of the Match: Jordan Pickford. With the unwanted Premier League winless streak looming, West Brom nearly made the perfect start inside six minutes as Jay Rodriguez's cross fell perfectly for Rondon, but the Baggies striker failed to hit the target from close range. Rondon remained are the forefront of the hosts' attack but, having knocked Christ Brunt's 10th-minute delivery back across goal, no one was on hand to convert. Matt Phillips is closed down by Ashley Williams and Morgan Schneiderlin When a team-mate was in position, they failed to make it count as Dawson headed Matt Phillips' driven cross over the bar on 19 minutes. Throughout the first half Everton offered very little as their youthful, experimental frontline struggled to retain possession against the hosts - although both sides were at fault for the lack of quality. Team news Alan Padrew made three changes as Craig Dawson, Matt Phillips and Jay Rodriguez were recalled. Yannick Bolasie made his first Premier League appearance start since December 4, 2016, while Ashley Williams and Mason Holgate returned to the Everton line-up. Rondon injured his hamstring while slicing a shot horribly wide on 50 minutes, his subsequent substitution typifying both sides' troubles in front of goal. Rodriguez and Kieran Gibbs had brief glimpses of goal, as did Everton substitute Oumar Niasse, but there was to be no way through for either side - the Baggies host Arsenal next time out looking to avoid an unwanted record. Opta stats West Brom extended their winless run to 18 Premier League games (D9 L9) - the longest such run by a Premier League team since rivals Aston Villa endured a 19-match run ending in January 2016. In contrast, the Toffees are unbeaten in their last seven Premier League games, winning four and drawing three. Everton have kept four clean sheets in their six Premier League games under Sam Allardyce - the same number they'd kept in their previous 23 in the competition. Former Everton man, Gareth Barry has played in more Premier League games on Boxing Day (18) than any other player in the competition's history. Barry also picked up his 122nd yellow card in the Premier League, 22 more than any other player. Everton are unbeaten in their last six Boxing Day away games in the Premier League (W3 D3). The managers Alan Pardew: \"We were good all the way through and really should have won. it's difficult to understand why we haven't won that today but we go to the next game.

Sam Allardyce says Everton were resilient and brave in their goalless draw at West Brom. Man of the Match - Jordan Pickford West Brom's finishing was wayward at best as they missed the chance to bring their winless run to an end. When the Baggies were able to ask questions of Jordan Pickford, though, he had the answers, and some. He commanded his area against the aerial Albion threat with the authority of a goalkeeper further on his career, setting the tone from the back for an Everton side who were tame going forward.

But the hosts did not initially show the required intensity to build on the goal and Swansea stayed in the first half despite rarely threatening themselves. Trent Alexander-Arnold celebrates after making it 3-0 The Swans were also guilty of giving the ball away cheaply on several occasions, but were not punished as Oxlade-Chamberlain and Firmino fired off target and the latter then spurned an excellent one-on-one chance in injury-time. However, Liverpool soon put the result beyond doubt as they raised the tempo in the second half. Team news Alexander-Arnold, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Wijnaldum and Matip started for Liverpool in place of Lovren, Gomez, Henderson and Mane. Routledge, Fer and McBurnie came into the Swansea XI, with the latter making his first start of the season.

But Everton withstood the early pressure and largely managed to keep the visitors at bay, with Pickford not seriously called into action until the 35th minute to keep out a shot from Pedro. Everton's best moment of the half came in the final minute as Dominic Calvert-Lewin won possession from Andreas Christensen, but he failed to make the most of the chance, much to the frustration of Gylfi Sigurdsson - who was unmarked at the back post. Tiemoue Bakayoko goes down under a challenge from Michael Keane Williams and Sandro Ramirez were introduced at half-time by Everton and the former was soon called into action to clear a shot on the line after Pickford again saved from Pedro. Everton lost Idrissa Gueye to injury and Chelsea continued to threaten more, with Pickford forced into a sharp save in the 66th minute to push away a low shot from Eden Hazard. Team news Rooney missed out for Everton with illness while Keane and Jagielka replaced Williams and Holgate in defence. Bolasie returned to the squad for the first time in a year after recovering from a long-term knee injury. Chelsea made one change as Rudiger came in for Cahill, and Morata was suspended. Williams then deflected a cross from Moses on to the bar as Chelsea piled on the pressure in the final 20 minutes. They could not grab a winner, however, and Keane almost snatched the points for Everton when he headed over from a corner in injury-time. Opta stats Everton kept their first Premier League clean sheet in nine games against Chelsea, since a 1-0 win in September 2013. Everton have kept three clean sheets in their five Premier League games under Sam Allardyce - the same number they'd kept in their previous 18 in the competition. Chelsea have now had two goalless draws in the Premier League this season - they didn't have a single one in Antonio Conte's first season in charge. Chelsea's haul of 25 shots was the third highest shot tally by an away team in the Premier League this season, and the most by an away side without scoring. Meanwhile, Everton failed to have a single shot on target in a home Premier League game for the first time since December 4, 2011 vs Stoke; 2211 days ago. Man of the match - Michael Keane Making his first appearance since the start of the month, Keane was at the heart of a solid defensive display from Everton. Keane made eight interceptions, three more than any other Everton player, and could have won it late on when he headed over from a corner.

You could see the way the game was flowing. It was not a game for clever football, you almost had to score an ugly goal. And that is when they needed a finisher on the pitch. \"With no Morata and you still do not play him, what is he thinking? The manager does not fancy me one bit…. Even though his centre forward is injured (suspended), he still does not play him. \"And as a player, if you cannot get in the team when the centre forward is out, you may as well go somewhere else if you ask me.\" Antonio Conte should have introduced striker Michy Batshuayi earlier in Saturday’s goalless draw at Everton, says Jamie Redknapp Managers Sam Allardyce: \"In terms of effort, commitment and defensive organisation, and we have played against a hugely talented front five, and we had a little bit of luck here and there, especially with the one that came off the bar,\" he said. \"But when needed Jordan Pickford is in the right spot for us and we have really rolled up our sleeves today and dug it out. \"I changed the shape of the team at half-time and went two up top to try and put more pressure on Chelsea's back three, but we did not really deliver enough quality and that disappointed me. \"I felt that with just one up, we were getting nowhere in the first half. So I put two up to stop their centre halves coming out with the ball and also to get down the side of their centre halves.\" Sam Allardyce hailed Everton’s ‘hard-earned’ point in their 0-0 draw with Chelsea and says his team should be satisfied of how they performed. Sam Allardyce hailed Everton’s ‘hard-earned’ point in their 0-0 draw with Chelsea and says his team should be satisfied of how they performed. Antonio Conte: \"A lot of possession and a lot of shots, 26, but only eight on target,\" said Conte. \"We dominated the game and had lots of chances to score, I think this result is unfair. \"Everton deserve credit, but we deserved to win. If you watched the game you could see we played from the start to the end. We created many chances, hit the crossbar, and maybe [Jordan] Pickford was the best player. But I praised the effort of my players. \"It is a pity to drop two points. It is normal to drop points with a poor performance, but not today.

Pascal Gross broke the deadlock in the 64th minute with a long-range effort, but Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes will not be happy as he let the ball slip underneath him. Watford offered very little as an attacking threat, with Richarlison heading their best opportunity for an equaliser wide from a good position, as the home side held on for victory with ease. A first win in eight games for Brighton moves them up to 12th, five points clear of the relegation zone, while Watford stay in 10th, despite a fourth successive defeat. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Bruno (6), Dunk (6), Goldson (6), Suttner (6), Propper (6), Stephens (6), Knockaert (6), Gross (7), March (7), Hemed (5).

Subs: Subs: Capoue (6), Okaka (6). Man of the match: Pascal Gross The first half was a tepid affair, with two teams in poor form unable to really find their rhythm at the Amex. The only opening of note came in the 32nd minute, but Connor Goldson's tame header from a good position was easily saved by Gomes. After the break, the game did open up somewhat. Gross drilled for goal from distance early in the half, but it fizzed just wide. Team news Troy Deeney began his four-match ban, while Abdoulaye Doucoure was also suspended. Four changes in all for Watford with Ben Watson, Tom Cleverley, Roberto Pereyra and Andre Gray coming in. Three changes for Brighton, with Connor Goldson, Markus Sutter and Tomer Hemed all handed a starting berth. Glenn Murray took his place on the bench. Then, Gross went one better to relieve some of the tension around the stadium as Watford could not cope with the swift counter from the hosts. Tomer Hemed fed Gross, who shifted the ball onto his right foot, fired back across where he had come from, which seemed to wrong-foot Gomes, who could not get down quick enough to keep the ball out. Lewis Dunk then should have doubled Brighton's advantage, but he headed wide from just six yards after getting up highest to meet a corner, before Hemed drilled wide from inside the box. As the half wore on, Watford did create some chances, with Richarlison heading wide after being picked out by Holebas, and substitute Stefano Okaka went close as he tried to+ bundle the ball home at the far post after Mat Ryan had let a cross slip through his hands, but Brighton saw out a vital win having faced just one shot on target all match. Anthony Knockaert celebrates Brighton's winner Opta stats Brighton have lost just one of their last nine Premier League games on home soil, winning three and drawing five. Watford have lost four consecutive Premier League games, as many defeats as they suffered in the previous 10 in the competition (W4 D2). Watford have netted just one goal in their last three top-flight away games, this after scoring 2+ goals in each of their previous eight on the road in the competition. Marco Silva was disappointed with his side after their 1-0 defeat Marco Silva was disappointed with his side after their 1-0 defeat Tomer Hemed has had a hand in four goals in his last five Premier League appearances at the Amex, scoring two and assisting two. Man of the match - Pascal Gross In a game of little quality on the whole, Gross stood out at the Amex. Gross' six key passes was double the output of any other creator on Saturday. It was not his fault his team-mates weren't on the same wavelength. Gross has been directly involved in nine Premier League goals this season (four goals, five assists), four more than any other Brighton player - still very much one of the bargains of the season. Chris Hughton felt Brighton should have converted more of their chances Chris Hughton felt Brighton should have converted more of their chances The managers Chris Hughton: \"It felt like a big win that today. It was a very good performance, a performance that deserved a win, more than a 1-0 scoreline. Of course, that [second] goal goes in, you are applying that bit more pressure on yourselves, but I thought we were very good today.\" Marco Silva: \"It was a difficult game. We did not perform well. We started very badly, but then the last 25 minutes we were much better. The second half we started the same way, but neither team had chances to score, Then in one moment, we made a mistake and they punished us.\" Andre Carrilo shoots for goal at the Amex The pundit - Paul Merson \"Brighton had plenty of chances last week and couldn't score and today they're doing exactly the same thing. They play some good football but it was a massive three points. Massive. If you look at the table, they'd have been joint-third bottom. But they've got a lot of teams between them now. \"And then the goal came. Gomes who's usually very good for Watford, the ball goes under him and flies up into the middle of the net. \"I said before, if they don't win this game they'll get relegated. And now they've got every chance.\" What's next? Another London opponent for Brighton in their next festive fixture, with a trip to champions Chelsea up next on Boxing Day.

Premier League winning streak to 17 games with a 4-0 thrashing of Bournemouth. City’s record scorer was left unmarked to head in Fernandinho’s clipped cross on 27 minutes and nodded home their 100th goal of 2017 with 10 minutes to play, after Raheem Sterling had slotted in a second eight minutes into the second half. There was still time for substitute Danilo to drill in a fourth with five minutes remaining as City made their total dominance count and moved 14 points clear at the top of the Premier League table, ahead of Manchester United's Saturday night clash with Leicester, live on Sky Sports. It was a second 4-0 loss in a row for Bournemouth after their defeat at home to Liverpool last weekend and the Cherries, who have now shipped 13 goals in their three Premier League trips to Manchester City, slipped into the bottom three.

Subs:Pugh (6), Afobe (6), Mousset (6) Man of the match: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City The injury-hit visitors lost Junior Stanislas with a muscle problem just 12 minutes in, after the forward had fired wide, but were able to restrict a dominant City side to an Aguero shot over the bar and a high header from Fernandinho until Nicolas Otamendi finally had the hosts' first effort on target on 25 minutes. Raheem Sterling scores Manchester City's second goal Aguero broke the deadlock moments later, though, nodding in after Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic had handed City an early Christmas present with his mis-placed pass. While the hosts continued to probe, they were unable to add a second in the first half and Bournemouth finished the opening 45 strongly, with Callum Wilson and Jordon Ibe seeing shots blocked. Team news Man City made just the two changes from last week's 4-1 win over Tottenham, with Kompany and David Silva in the starting XI, while Mangala and Gundogan dropped to the bench. Bournemouth made six changes from the 4-0 defeat to Liverpool last time out in the Premier League. Steve Cook, Gosling, Stanislas, Wilson, Simpson and Fraser went in, while Francis, Daniels, King and Defoe weren't involved and Pugh and Lewis Cook dropped to the bench. But City reasserted their dominance after the break and when Aguero flicked David Silva's pass through the Bournemouth backline, Sterling raced through to apply the finish from close range for his 12th goal of the season. Danilo celebrates after scoring Manchester City's fourth goal against Bournemouth Aguero made it three on 79 minutes when he headed home an excellent cross from sub Bernardo Silva and Bournemouth - who had looked to be more adventurous in the final 15 minutes - were exposed again when Sterling, running at the retreating defence, fed Danilo in the left channel and the full-back fired in a low shot. Opta stats Manchester City become the first top-flight team to score 100 goals in a calendar year since Liverpool in 1982 (106) Bournemouth have failed to score in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since January 2016.

Man of the match: Sergio Aguero Manchester City ace Sergio Aguero is in good form, with his double here making it four goals in four games and 12 in the Premier League this season. But his well-taken headers highlighted his all-round ability in front of goal and brought up a special landmark for the Etihad Stadium hero: his 100th and 101st goals on the ground in all competitions. Sergio Aguero makes it 1-0 with a diving header Managers' verdict Pep Guardiola, Man City: \"It was so tough because they played five at the back and 10 players behind, with just [Callum] Wilson in front, marking Fernandinho, so the spaces were almost impossible to find. We were lucky to score the first goal and after the second we controlled, we played with more calm. And then in the last 20 minutes they played, they pushed up and after that we played really well again.\" Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola calls Sergio Aguero a special player and legend after he scored his 100th goal at the Etihad Stadium.

We were ok in the game until we conceded the first goal, which was our own doing, which is hugely frustrating with the game plan we had. From then on it is difficult.

"2:59 Southampton 1-1 Huddersfield Southampton 1-1 Huddersfield Laurent Depoitre's second-half header for Huddersfield extended Southampton's winless run to six matches in a 1-1 draw at St Mary's. Charlie Austin gave Southampton the lead from close range (24). However, he could have been sent off shortly afterwards for kicking the visitor's goalkeeper Jonas Lossl in the nose. Austin missed a wonderful chance to put the hosts 2-0 up on the hour-mark and was made to pay for it as Depoitre headed in Huddersfield's equaliser (64). The draw means Huddersfield go into 11th place and level on 22 points with Watford. Brighton's 1-0 victory means Southampton drop down to 13th. Player ratings Southampton: Forster (7), Yoshida (5), Stephens (6), Hoedt (7), Targett (7), Davis (6), Lemina (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Tadic (6), Redmond (6), Austin (6) Subs: Boufal (7), Gabbiadini (6), Hojbjerg (6) Huddersfield: Lossl (8), Malone (6), Zanka (6), Schindler (7), Hadergjonaj (7), Williams (6), Mooy (6), Ince (5), Van La Parra (6), Quaner, (7) Depoitre (7) Subs: Lolley (7), Mounie (5), Smith (6) Man of the match: Jonas Lossl Huddersfield started brightly and would have taken the lead in the 14th minute if not for Forster's heroics. Florent Hadergjonaj's threatening cross was met by Christopher Schindler, forcing Forster into tipping the ball over the bar. But even with the visitors pushing for the opener, Southampton took the lead through Austin. James Ward-Prowse's corner was nodded on by Wesley Hoedt into the path of the unmarked poacher, who tucked home from point-blank range. The scrappy contest took a controversial turn in the 32nd minute as Austin left a foot in on Jonas Lossl's nose when they both chased for a loose ball. However, five minutes later, the Danish goalkeeper continued the game and made a brave stop from close range to deny Tadic Southampton's second. Team news Virgil van Dijk was not included in Southampton’s squad. Targett took Ryan Bertrand's place while Austin came into the starting XI for Gabbiadini. Cedric and Hojbjerg made way for Mario Lemina and Dusan Tadic. Davis also returned to the starting lineup. Hogg (suspended), Kachunga (knee) and Lowe came out of the starting XI with Malone, Williams and Ince taking their places. The first great chance in the second half fell to Austin. On the counter-attack, Redmond squared the ball to the 28-year-old who, with just the goalkeeper to beat, dragged his shot wide of the post. And the former QPR striker was made to rue his chance as Huddersfield punished the Saints four minutes later. Substitute Tommy Smith burst down the right flank and crossed in for Depoitre, who positioned himself between Maya Yoshida and Jack Stephens, to nod in a deserved equaliser. 5 - Charlie Austin has scored five goals in his last five Premier League starts for Southampton. Stunner. pic.twitter.com/Ij1cpBlc4d — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 23, 2017 Austin's eventful day came to an end when he limped off with a hamstring injury following his dangerous strike on goal that Lossl parried away. Yoshida almost got the winner for Southampton in injury time, but his free header from Ward-Prowse's corner came off the post before bouncing out off Lossl to mark a frustrating afternoon for Mauricio Pellegrino's men. Opta stats Southampton have won just one of their last 10 Premier League games (D4 L5) and are winless in their last six (D3 L3). Huddersfield have picked up four points from their last two away games in the Premier League, as many as they collected in their first eight in the competition. Charlie Austin has had a hand in seven goals in eight previous league appearances against Huddersfield (five goals, two assists). Austin has scored five goals in his last five Premier League starts for Southampton. Laurent Depoitre has scored three goals in his last three Premier League games, more than in his previous 13 combined (2). Man of the Match - Jonas Lossl Jonas Lossl pulled off a string of fine saves for Huddersfield, as well as getting kicked in the face Lossl endured an eventful afternoon after being kicked in the nose by Austin, but he also produced a string of fine saves to keep Huddersfield in the game on many occasions. After bravely playing on following the collision with Austin, he denied Tadic and Yoshida from scoring two of the game's clear-cut opportunities. Manager's reaction Huddersfield manager David Wagner calls Charlie Austin’s clash with Jonas Lossl ugly but says his goalkeeper will be fit for their next match. Huddersfield manager David Wagner calls Charlie Austin’s clash with Jonas Lossl ugly but says his goalkeeper will be fit for their next match. David Wagner: The second half was good as well in my point of view. We created lots of good opportunities and scored a wonderful goal as well. It was very deserved point for us that we can take out of this game. As ugly as this incident [Lossl and Austin] was as ugly now he looks Merry Christmas to him. His wife will not be very happy when she meets him tonight but he looks good, he looks OK. He has to recover like the whole group and we will be ready for the Boxing Day game at home at the John Smith's Stadium. Mauricio Pellegrino wouldn't reveal whether Virgil van Dijk will be leaving Southampton after he missed their draw against Huddersfield. Mauricio Pellegrino wouldn't reveal whether Virgil van Dijk will be leaving Southampton after he missed their draw against Huddersfield. Mauricio Pellegrino: Today was a flat game. A lot of challenges and balls in the air. In this physical battle, Huddersfield is possibly a bit stronger than us. We had to put the ball on the floor but we couldn't too much. The big picture today is that we were really close to scoring the second and we couldn't.

Charlie Nicholas insists Charlie Austin should have been sent off for his challenge on Jonas Lossl in Southampton's 1-1 draw with Huddersfield. \"Austin proves he's clinical, lovely little stooped header. But he's a lucky lad that he stays on the pitch. The through-ball, he chases it, the 'keeper's come out. Austin's two yards away from the 'keeper, then he sticks out just the toe of his boot, and he's left the boot there. I think the lad's broken his nose. \"Austin scores the goal, then he's got a hamstring and it looks a bad one. He's going to be out for a while. And then defensively they're still vulnerable. And Southampton are in trouble, they're only three points off safety.\" What's next? Southampton travel to north London to face Tottenham, live on Sky Sports Premier League, on Boxing Day.

Allen put the hosts in front after 20 minutes when he prodded the ball home from Peter Crouch's volleyed cross before Choupo-Moting doubled the lead in first-half injury time after rounding Ben Foster. West Brom pulled one back shortly after the break through Salomon Rondon's third goal of the season but were undone on the counter-attack late on as Sobhi struck Stoke's third with virtually the last kick of the game. Stoke were just one place above the relegation zone before kick-off but that win along with results elsewhere mean they are up to 14th while West Brom remain in 19th and without a Premier League win since August.

Rondon carried West Brom's biggest goal threat throughout and he drew a wonderful sprawling stop from Jack Butland late on in the first half as his controlled half-volley was expertly tipped around the post by the England international when it had appeared destined to nestle in the bottom corner. 1 - Joe Allen has both scored and assisted a goal in the same Premier League game for the first time in his career. Catalyst. pic.twitter.com/9k3QmOgSPr — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 23, 2017 Allen turned from goalscorer to goal provider for Stoke's second as his through ball sent Choupo-Moting through on goal. The Cameroonian calmly dribbled the ball around Foster before squeezing a shot between covering defenders Allan Nyom and Ahmed Hegazi on the goal line. That goal came at the worst possible time for West Brom but they responded perfectly by scoring just six minutes after the break as Rondon raced onto Chris Brunt's brilliant ball over the top and slid his finish under the onrushing Butland. Team news Mark Hughes made three changes with Tom Edwards, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Kurt Zouma replaced Erik Pieters, Mame Biram Diouf and Ramadan Sobhi.Alan Pardew also made three changes as Gareth Barry, Chris Brunt and Hal Robson-Kanu came in for Claudio Yacob, Grzegorz Krychowiak and Oliver Burke. West Brom dominated for much of the second half and were agonisingly close to equalising in injury time when Oliver Burke's low cross was diverted onto his own post by Stoke's youngster Tom Edwards, before Butland punched the ball into the back of Rondon's head from the resulting corner with the loose ball ricocheting away from danger rather than into the back of the net. After pressing for the equaliser, West Brom found themselves stretched and were picked off on the counter-attack by Stoke as Choupo-Moting raced towards goal before unselfishly squaring the ball to Sobhi to pass into the empty net with Foster out of position. Man of the match - Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting A thorn in West Brom's side from the first minute until the last, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting was involved in all three of his side's goals in what was a hugely important victory for his team. For the first, his shot deflected into Crouch's path who turned the ball into Allen to score. He scored the second himself by calmly rounding Foster and finishing under pressure and he then registered an assist for Sobhi for the third. Ramadan Sobhi celebrates after scoring Stoke's third goal at home to West Brom It wasn't the perfect performance - he comically back-heeled the ball to no-one midway through the second half - but virtually everything else he tried came off. Opta stats West Brom are the first Premier League team to go 17+ games without a win since Aston Villa (19) in January 2016. Indeed, this is the Baggies' longest ever winless run in league competition (D8 L9). Stoke City bagged three goals in a Premier League game for the first time since beating Hull 3-1 in April. Joe Allen scored his first Premier League goal in 30 appearances, last netting against Crystal Palace in February. Allen scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time in his career. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting also both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time. Salomon Rondón has scored in all three of his Premier League away games against Stoke City. Chris Brunt provided his 45th assist in the Premier League for West Brom, 21 more than any other Baggies player in the competition. What's next? Stoke will be looking to build up some momentum over the festive period when they face Huddersfield away on Boxing Day before returning home on the 30th to play Chelsea.

Swansea in an enthralling encounter at the Liberty Stadium. After receiving the ball 25 yards out, Ayew feigned to shoot before skipping forwards and letting fly from 18 yards and leaving Julian Speroni with no chance. The goal was a bitter blow for the visitors, who had previously been untroubled by their toothless hosts and had taken the lead on 59 minutes through a Luka Milivojevic penalty following Federico Fernandez's trip on Ruben Loftus-Cheek. They might have led after just nine minutes, but after Lukasz Fabianski had saved Scott Dann's header, he then did brilliantly to claw away Andros Townsend's curled effort that looked destined for the top corner.

Palace, without the suspended Christian Benteke, struggled to build a platform, although they remained a threat on the break and Loftus-Cheek saw his attempted curled effort drop just wide of the far post. Wilfried Zaha then created an opening for himself on 34 minutes, but having put Fernandez on his backside, he then lost control of the ball himself at the crucial moment and the chance was gone. The pattern continued after the break and Palace finally made their greater threat count when Zaha fed Loftus-Cheek, who squared up Fernandez and then fell over an outstretched leg in the box. Team news Swansea caretaker boss Leon Britton made two changes to the side that lost to 3-1 to Everton last time out, with Leroy Fer and Wilfried Bony ruled out with injury - they were replaced by Sam Clucas and Tammy Abraham. Palace made one change, with the suspended Christian Benteke replaced by Luka Milivojevic. Milivojevic made no mistake from the spot, prompting the hosts to finally find some thrust to their game and Abraham should have levelled on 66 when his first touch allowed him a clear sight of goal, but Speroni saved well at his near post. Nathan Dyer's cross was then almost deflected past the Palace keeper before Ayew pulled some magic out of nowhere to finally bring Swansea level. Swansea might have won it as Ayew fizzed another cracker inches wide from distance before Abraham just failed to meet Dyer's cross at the near post as Palace held on to extend their unbeaten run to eight games, while Swansea will spend Christmas at the foot of the table. Opta stats Crystal Palace are now unbeaten in eight Premier League games - their longest run in the top-flight since October 1990 (a run of 12). Indeed, only Manchester City (27) and Liverpool (10) are currently on longer unbeaten runs in the Premier League than the Eagles. Jordan Ayew scored his first goal in 16 Premier League games, since netting Swansea's second in their 2-0 win at Crystal Palace in the reverse fixture in August. No player has scored more penalty goals in the Premier League this season than Luka Milivojevic (3, level with Sergio Aguero and Wayne Rooney). The managers A proud Leon Britton credits his Swansea side after they came back from a goal down to draw 1-1 against Crystal Palace. A proud Leon Britton credits his Swansea side after they came back from a goal down to draw 1-1 against Crystal Palace. Leon Britton: \"The fans have been great with me, as player or manager, you could hear them being very vocal which I appreciate, but in terms of the job, nothing has changed and I'm not looking for the job full time. \"They need to make the right decision, make sure it's clear what they want, whether that's before Liverpool, after Liverpool or in January. They have to make sure they take their time and get the right man.\" Roy Hodgson: \"It would be churlish to say I'm anything other than satisfied. To have no points after seven games and to have 18 now and be out of the relegation zone, I think you have to be pleased with that. \"The lads are working so hard. We would have liked more points, but we are chipping away. Man of the Match - Tom Carroll The midfielder was always available for the ball, always trying to find the right pass. His side has been struggling, but he doesn't hide. His delivery at set-pieces was outstanding and he kept Swansea moving throughout the game. The pundit Phil Thompson: \"Crystal Palace really had the upper hand in the first half. Townsend had an absolutely fantastic chance, coming in from the left-hand side onto his right foot. What a save from Fabianksi. I thought it was going right in the corner. \"The penalty woke up Swansea. All of a sudden Tammy Abraham has a shot from the inside right position which hits the side-netting. And then the goal. Ayew right on the edge of the box, drills it in, right to the far side.\" What's next? Swansea travel to Anfield to take on Liverpool in the tea-time kick-off on Boxing Day while Crystal Palace have two extra days off before they host Arsenal on December 28.

A loose pass from Henri Saivet gifted Marko Arnautovic (6) the opener for the hosts, though the Newcastle midfielder made amends just four minutes later from a free-kick. After the break, Mo Diame fired Newcastle ahead (53) against his former side before Andre Ayew saw a contentious penalty saved by Rob Elliot three minutes later. Christian Atsu then gave Newcastle some breathing space (61), and though Ayew hit back shortly after (69), the visitors held on to clinch a dramatic and much-needed victory at the London Stadium.

Marko Arnautovic celebrates after scoring West Ham's first goal West Ham's lead was short-lived however, with Saivet responding in perfect fashion as his free-kick squeezed past Adrian from 30 yards out. Newcastle were then denied by the woodwork, as Dwight Gayle hit the bar from six yards out before Matt Ritchie's curled effort from distance struck the outside of the post. Team news West Ham made three changes with Winston Reid, Cheikhou Kouyate and Andre Ayew coming into the side, while Ciaran Clark, Mohamed Diame, Matt Ritchie, Henri Saivet and Dwight Gayle were called into Newcastle’s starting XI. After half-time, Atsu nutmegged Pablo Zabaleta before picking out Diame, who fired into the top corner from close range against his former employers. Mohamed Diame celebrates with his team-mates after putting Newcastle ahead Lee Mason then pointed to the spot three minutes later, and though Clark's challenge on Michail Antonio appeared to occur outside the area, Ayew spurned the opportunity when Elliot dived the right way to keep out the penalty. Newcastle swiftly punished Ayew for the mistake, with Atsu scoring from a superb breakaway after playing a neat one-two with Joselu. Ayew pulled one back for the Hammers after pouncing on the rebound from Andy Carroll's header, but their three-game unbeaten run in the league came to an end as Newcastle battled to a vital victory. Opta stats Newcastle earned their first win in 10 Premier League games (W1 D1 L8), and first away league win since September (1-0 vs Swansea). West Ham have lost two successive home Premier League matches against newly promoted sides for the first time since 2006-07. This is the fourth time that Newcastle have won both Premier League games against West Ham in a season - on three of those occasions they've been a newly promoted side (1993-94, 2010-11 and 2017-18). Henri Saivet became the 16th player to score a direct free-kick goal in the Premier League for Newcastle - only Everton and West Ham (17 each) have had more. Man of the match - Christian Atsu Christian Atsu celebrates after scoring Newcastle's third One goal and one assist for the Newcastle winger, who posed problems for West Ham throughout - particularly on the break. Zabaleta was left with his tail between his legs when Atsu nutmegged him for Newcastle's second, while the Ghana international went on to score the all-important third from a devastating counter, showing great awareness to find Joselu out wide before calmly slotting the return ball past Adrian.

David Moyes: \"It was a game full of errors, I just keep looking at the goals we've conceded and the mistakes we've made. \"It was near enough right from the start. We got the goal - I think from a Newcastle mistake - but after we made two or three terrible mistakes which led to them scoring from a free-kick. \"All in all, it just seemed like that on the touchline. Mistake after mistake. We then missed a penalty at 2-1 which makes it even more difficult.\" Newcastle's Rafa Benitez was pleased by Henri Saivet’s performance after he scored on his first Premier League start of the season against West Ham.

Kane opened the scoring from the penalty spot on six minutes after Dele Alli, who was lucky to avoid a red card for a wild early challenge on Charlie Taylor, went down in the box. Spurs dominated from that moment on and should have been further ahead by the time Kane netted two second-half goals to take his tally of goals for club and country in 2017 to 53 goals. The 24-year-old's treble also sees him equal Alan Shearer's record of 36 Premier League goals in a calendar year. The result ends a run of five games without an away win for Spurs, who also move above Arsenal and to within one point of Liverpool in fourth.

Subs: Lamela (6), Llorente (6), Dembele (6) Man of the Match: Harry Kane Alli felt the wrath of the home fans in the fourth minute for a lunging tackle on Taylor and then sent them into a further frenzy two minutes later when he went down in the area under a challenge from Kevin Long. Kane stepped up and sent Nick Pope the wrong way to settle any early nerves for the visitors. Alli was booed by Clarets fans every time he touched the ball, but he kept his cool to send Moussa Sissoko through on goal but he was denied twice by Pope. Tottenham spurned another chance at the start of the second period as Heung-Min Son blazed over from 10 yards out. Team news There were four changes for Tottenham from their humbling defeat at Manchester City with Davison Sanchez returning from suspension and recalls for Serge Aurier, Ben Davies and Moussa Sissoko. Sean Dyche made just one switch and it was an enforced one with James Tarkowski unavailable through suspension – Kevin Long replaced him. The second goal was coming as Burnley offered little in terms of forward play and arrived when Sissoko's pass sent Kane through on goal and he finished with ease. The three points were sealed with 10 minutes to go when Alli set up Kane, who had started the move with a thumping tackle. Man of the match: Harry Kane Who else? As others around him were losing their heads in front of goal, Spurs' main man kept his with three cool finishes to take his tally for the Premier League season to 15 - level with Mohamed Salah at the top of the charts. The pick of his three strikes was his final effort which was triggered by a strong tackle and ended with a fine finish. Opta stats Burnley conceded as many goals in this game as they had in their previous nine at Turf Moor combined this season. Spurs are the first visiting team to score three or more in a Premier League game at Turf Moor since Crystal Palace in January 2015 (3-2). This was only Burnley's second Premier League home defeat in the month of December (P12 W6 D4 L2), with the other coming against Liverpool on Boxing Day in 2014. Kane has now scored 93 goals in the Premier League - second only to Teddy Sheringham (97) for goals in the competition for Spurs. What's next?

United deservedly restored parity 13 minutes later, as Juan Mata stroked the ball home after good work from Jesse Lingard, before the Spain international curled a delightful free-kick into the net on the hour mark to complete the turnaround. Leicester pressed for an equaliser, but substitute Daniel Amartey's needless red card after two quick-fire bookings didn't help their cause, as it seemed United would go on to extend their lead. However, after Jose Mourinho's men wasted a host of gilt-edged chances to seal victory, Maguire stole in at the back post to snatch the Foxes a point in the most dramatic fashion with the last kick of the game. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (5), Morgan (6), Maguire (7), Fuchs (6), Mahrez (7), Ndidi (6), Iborra (6), Abrighton (7), Gray (6), Vardy (7). Subs: Chilwell (N/A), Amartey (3), Okazaki (6). Manchester United: De Gea (5), Lindelof (7), Jones (6), Smalling (5), Young (7), Matic (7), Pogba (6), Mata (8), Lingard (7), Martial (7), Lukaku (8). Subs: Herrera (6), Mkhitaryan (6), Rashford (6). As a result, United are now 13 points behind leaders Manchester City, while Leicester stay eighth. United started on the front foot, and went close as early as the second minute, with Chris Smalling heading over after climbing to meet a Mata cross. Jesse Lingard then linked up well with Romelu Lukaku, thundered a strike towards goal which Kasper Schmeichel did well to palm over the bar, before Pogba also tested Schmeichel from distance, but again the Denmark international was equal to it. Team news Paul Pogba returned from his three-match Premier League suspension to captain Manchester United. The Frenchman was one of three players who retained their starting spot following Wednesday’s League Cup defeat at Bristol City, along with Victor Lindelof and Anthony Martial. Christian Fuchs replaced Ben Chilwell at left-back for Leicester in the only change from the side who were humiliated at home against Crystal Palace last week. Leicester grew into the game and, in typical Foxes fashion, they countered to stun United. Vardy laid the ball off for Wilfred Ndidi who launched it forward for Mahrez. The bounce did not help the Leicester forward, but he showed great composure to hold the ball up and wait for Vardy to continue his run before laying the ball into the England international's path, who finished into the bottom corner The goal did not affect the flow of the match, however, as United continued to press, and levelled things up through Mata five minutes before the break. Martial fizzed the ball into the feet of Lingard, who did well to lay it off for Mata, with the Spain international showing great composure to steer the ball into the bottom corner. After the break Christian Fuchs' goal-bound effort was cleared off the line by Victor Lindelof, before Anthony Martial blazed over from a good position after being picked out by a penetrating pass from Lukaku. Mata put United in front with a sublime free-kick, showing a delicate touch to clip the ball over the wall and beyond the despairing dive of Schemichel. Juan Mata celebrates after giving Manchester United a 2-1 lead at the King Power Stadium Lingard should have put the game to bed with 18 minutes left, but he hit the post after rounding Schmeichel, before substitute Amartey did make United's task that bit easier after receiving his marching orders. United had further chances to make their position more comfortable, with Marcus Rashford wasting the clearest of the lot, but he could not get around Schmeichel, before Maguire stole a point at the death. With United pressed into their own penalty area, Marc Albrighton whipped a crossed into the danger zone, David de Gea stayed rooted to his line, and when an injured Chris Smalling could not get across, Maguire was on hand to steer the ball home. Jamie Vardy celebrates scoring the opening goal with team-mates Opta stats Manchester City will be 13 points clear of Manchester United on Christmas Day - the biggest points gap between first and second place on Christmas Day in English top-flight history. This was the first time that Manchester United have conceded a 90th minute goal that has changed the result of a league game since Feburary 7th 2016 (1-1 v Chelsea - Diego Costa). Juan Mata celebrates after giving Manchester United a 2-1 lead at the King Power Stadium Manchester United have lost just one of their last 13 league visits to Leicester City (W7 D5 L1), a 3-5 defeat in September 2014. 42 per cent (21) of Jamie Vardy's 50 Premier League goals have come against 'big six opposition'. Man of the match - Romelu Lukaku Not renowned for his creativity, Lukaku was integral to United's flow at the King Power, though this time as a provider. His pass for Martial's second-half chance was sublime, as was his lay off for Lingard's guilt-edged opening. Both deserved to be finished off. His confidence in front of goal is still not quite right, but having provided four key passes - unsurpassed by anyone on the pitch at the King Power, the Belgium international can be pleased with his all-round contribution. What's next?

Liverpool Roberto Firmino's late equaliser earned Liverpool a point in a thrilling 3-3 draw against Arsenal, after the hosts had come from 2-0 down to lead 3-2 at the Emirates on Friday Night Football. The three points looked to be heading Liverpool's way with 52 minutes gone when Mohamed Salah doubled their lead - following Philippe Coutinho's opener - but Arsenal scored three goals in five crazy minutes during a spell where Liverpool's defence crumbled in spectacular fashion. Strikes from Alexis Sanchez (53), Granit Xhaka (56) and Mesut Ozil (58) in that frenetic period swung the game in their favour but Roberto Firmino (71) salvaged a point for Liverpool. The result means the gap between Liverpool, who remain in fourth, and Arsenal remains at just one point as Arsene Wenger is still without a win over Jurgen Klopp in a Premier League fixture. Player Ratings Arsenal: Cech (6), Bellerin (6), Koscielny (6), Monreal (6), Maitland-Niles (6), Xhaka (6), Wilshere (7), Iwobi (6), Ozil (7), Sanchez (7), Lacazette (7). Subs: Mustafi (6), Welbeck (6) Liverpool: Mignolet (5), Gomez (5), Lovren (6), Klavan (6), Robertson (6), Henderson (6), Can (7), Mane (7), Firmino (8), Coutinho (8), Salah (7). Subs: Milner (7), Wijnaldum (6), Oxlade Chamberlain (6) Man of the Match: Roberto Firmino Liverpool were forced into an early change when Jordan Henderson limped off, but his replacement James Milner slotted in perfectly, playing a part in the opening goal. Mesut Ozil celebrates after giving Arsenal the lead Firmino already had headed wide from close range when Milner's clever ball down the channel found Salah and his deflected cross was skilfully lobbed into the net via Coutinho's head. The 25-year-old Brazilian has now been involved in 15 goals in his last 10 away games in all competitions. The visitors remained positive with Firmino curling inches over on 32 minutes and Sadio Mane somehow spurning a glorious opportunity eight minutes later, volleying over from 12 yards with Petr Cech stranded. Arsenal left to a chorus of boos at half-time and the atmosphere descended further on 52 minutes when Salah doubled the lead. After leading a counter-attack from inside his own half, Salah played a neat one-two with Firmino and curled home from the edge of the box. With the way Liverpool were controlling things, Arsenal's quick-fire comeback was hard to fathom. Just five minutes later they had not only clawed back the deficit but found themselves in front. Team news Having made 11 changes in the midweek Carabao Cup victory over West Ham, Arsenal reverted back to their strongest XI – the same side which edged past Newcastle in the league last weekend. Alex Oxlade Chamberlain had to make do with a place on the bench on his first return to Arsenal as Jurgen Klopp made two changes to the Liverpool side which romped to victory at Bournemouth. Emre Can and Sadio Mane both started, meaning all members of the ‘fab four’ were in the starting line-up for the Reds. First, Joe Gomez was caught napping at the back post and Sanchez headed home. That triggered a change in momentum as Liverpool wilted. Two minutes later, Xhaka took aim from 30 yards and the ball found its way past a weak one-handed attempt by Simon Mignolet. Arsenal were not done there, though, as they took the lead two minutes later. Liverpool's defending could be questioned for the first two, but there was little they could do to stop Alexandre Lacazette's clever back-heel and Ozil's mesmeric chipped finish over Mignolet. That was not the end of the drama as Liverpool maintained their fluidity going forward and grabbed an equaliser on 71 minutes when Firmino's effort was too hot for Cech to handle. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was thrown on against his former employers, eyeing a Hollywood finish to a quite breathless game, but it ended all-square. Opta stats There have been 27 goals scored in the last five Premier League meetings between these teams (10 for Arsenal, 17 for Liverpool) at an average of 5.4 per game. Liverpool have scored 54 away goals in all competitions in 2017, their most in a calendar year since 1982 (66). Arsenal have conceded seven goals in two league games against Liverpool this season - in only one Premier League campaign have they conceded more against an opponent (10 against Man Utd in 2011/12). Since Jurgen Klopp's first Premier League match in charge in October 2015, Liverpool's games have seen 279 goals scored (174 for, 105 against), more than any other club. Man of the match: Roberto Firmino This award could have gone to five or six of the attacking players on show but the Brazilian gets the nod for his crucial equalising goal that got his team out of a sticky situation. Firmino has now been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Liverpool player since he joined at the start of the 2015/16 season, scoring 28 goals and proving 18 assists. His all-round game during a hectic match was of the highest quality. What's next? Arsenal have six days rest before travelling to south London to play Crystal Palace in front of the Sky Sports cameras while Liverpool play hosts to Swansea, also live on Sky Sports Premier League."},

The Swans opened the scoring at Goodison Park when Leroy Fer (34) tapped home at the back post but Everton levelled things up in the 46th minute with Dominic Calvert-Lewin lashing home the rebound from a saved Wayne Rooney penalty. Sigurdsson - who made a £45m move from Swansea in the summer - produced a moment of magic to put the hosts ahead in the 64th minute with a fine curling effort, before Rooney (74) scored with Everton's second penalty of the game.

The game did not begin well for Swansea, who had to make a change inside five minutes as Wilfried Bony pulled up with an injury after a challenge against Ashley Williams. As he trudged off the field, Chelsea loanee Tammy Abraham came on in his place. Team news Everton named an unchanged XI from their last Premier League game. Swansea made three changes with Federico Fernandez, Leroy Fer and Luciano Narsingh starting in place of Mike van der Hoorn, Sung-Yueng Ki and Jordan Ayew. The best chance of the first half for Everton came in the 27th minute as they capitalised on some neat build-up play. Aaron Lennon flicked the ball through the legs of Alfie Mawson before powering into the box, but his eventual shot went just wide of the post. Eight minutes later, Swansea scored the opener, their tenth Premier League goal of the season. As a corner was delivered, Everton defender Williams lost Fer, who surged into the six-yard box to tap home. Gylfi Sigurdsson was reluctant to celebrate against his former club after his wonderstrike But Everton equalised in the first minute of injury time after Roque Mesa fouled Lennon in the box. Rooney stepped up for the spot-kick, but saw his effort brilliantly tipped onto the post by Lukasz Fabianski, before Calvert-Lewin hammered home the rebound. It was quiet start to the second half with chances at a premium, but the lacklustre play was sparked to life by a stunning Sigurdsson strike. He cut in from left and let fly from just outside the box with a superb curled shot into the far corner and then gave a muted celebration against his former side. Wilfried Bony was substituted in the early minutes with an injury Ten minutes later, Everton added another with their second penalty of the evening after Martin Olsson was penalised for a foul on Jonjoe Kenny, although replays showed it was outside of the box. Rooney took for a second time, dispatching into the corner to take his tally to ten Premier League goals this season. Opta stats Dominic Calvert-Lewin equalised for Everton in the first half Everton have picked up 13 points from their last five Premier League games, one more than they managed in their previous 13 games this season (12). Swansea have now lost 19 Premier League away games since the start of last season; more than any other club. Wilfried Bony was forced off in the fifth minute of the game, to be replaced by Tammy Abraham, making it the earliest substitution in the Premier League this season.

Lukaku's superb header against his former employers sent United on their way (27) before a deflected Lingard strike (35) put them in control before half-time. Gareth Barry tapped in West Brom's first goal in more than six hours of football (77) to ensure a frantic finish at the Hawthorns, but United clung on for a sixth league win in seven games. United ultimately close the gap on leaders Manchester City back to 11 points, while Alan Pardew's search for a first victory as West Brom boss goes on, with the club now winless in 16 Premier League games. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (6), Nyom (7), Evans (7), Hegazi (6), Gibbs (6), Yacob (6), Livermore (6), Krychowiak (5), Burke (6), McClean (5), Rondon (5) Subs: Barry (7), Rodriguez (6), Brunt (6) Man Utd: De Gea (6), Valencia (6), Jones (7), Smalling (7), Young (6), Herrera (6), Matic (7), Mata (6), Lingard (7), Rashford (6), Lukaku (7) Subs: Rojo (6), Martial (n/a), McTominay (n/a) Man of the match: Nemanja Matic After a slow start, United took the lead with the first attempt on target as Lukaku found the top corner with a brilliant glancing header from Marcus Rashford's cross, though it was met with muted celebrations once more from the Belgian after his second goal in as many games. Manchester United's Jesse Lingard (left) celebrates after scoring his side's second goal It got better for United eight minutes later courtesy of Lingard's seventh goal of the season after his effort deflected off Ahmed Hegazi and beyond Ben Foster, who had looked set to make a routine save. The home side improved after the break and substitute Barry forced David de Gea to make a comfortable save before Marcus Rashford's first-time strike whistled past the far post down the other end. Team news One West Brom change saw Oliver Burke make his first Premier League start, with Hal Robson-Kanu dropping to the bench. For United, Ashley Young, Ander Herrera and Marcus Rashford were all recalled to the starting XI. Lingard almost had his second just before the hour-mark, but the 25-year-old shot straight at Foster after a swift counter-attack from the visitors. Gareth Barry's strike made for a nervy finish at the Hawthorns And as United started to sit back, West Brom handed themselves a lifeline in the 77th minute, with Barry poking home the first goal of the Pardew era after a scrappy passage of play from a corner. West Brom continued to push for an equaliser, but Jay Rodriguez could only head wide before De Gea eventually gathered the ball after another corner caused mayhem in the United defence. Opta stats Manchester United have won their last three away Premier League games, one more than they managed in their previous 10 on the road (2). West Brom are now winless in 16 consecutive league games - the longest run in their entire league history (D8 L8). Romelu Lukaku has been involved in eight goals in his last eight Premier League games against former club West Brom (five goals, three assists). Lukaku has scored 10 goals in his last 11 Premier League appearances at the Hawthorns, a run which spans games with West Brom, Everton and Man Utd. .@ManUtd’s Romelu Lukaku has now scored in successive apps for the first time since September. Has scored 5 goals in his 8 PL apps against @WBA. pic.twitter.com/q2ViBpn7LM — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) December 17, 2017 Man of the match - Nemanja Matic Matic was United's standout performer in an otherwise uninspiring display from the visitors. The Serbian made vital interceptions to prevent West Brom, while he also carried the ball forward with intent on numerous occasions. His ability to break beyond West Brom's midfield paid dividends for both of United's goals, while 105 touches in total - 32 more than any other player on the pitch (Ander Herrera, 73) - highlighted how integral he was to United's hard-fought victory. The managers Alan Pardew: \"In hindsight, the team I picked was not the right team. I should have put some fresh legs in there. \"They did so well at Liverpool, and as a new manager I wanted to show some faith in those players, but I should have maybe made two or three changes. \"We looked leggy, we looked not up to the ball. But in the second half we were a lot better and had a lot more conviction to our play - that was the problem.\" Alan Pardew says he made a few selection errors in West Brom’s defeat against Manchester United, but substitutions helped produce a better second half display. Alan Pardew says he made a few selection errors in West Brom’s defeat against Manchester United, but substitutions helped produce a better second half display. Jose Mourinho: [On Lukaku celebration] \"I didn't celebrate too. Nobody was happier than me, it's just a question of profile. \"I am happy, I'm happy with the victory. But 15 years ago I look at myself celebrating goals and now I feel a little ashamed with that, but with maturity you go into levels where you control your emotions better. Unless, I repeat, you score a winning goal in the last stage of a game. \"Also, I think Romelu had the fact that he was a happy kid at West Brom. He was a kid that was given all the conditions here to have the evolution he had. So probably in the back of his mind is that love for the club.\" Jose Mourinho says his side deserved their narrow victory over West Bro, and the United manager also defended Romelu Lukaku over his lack of celebration. Jose Mourinho says his side deserved their narrow victory over West Bro, and the United manager also defended Romelu Lukaku over his lack of celebration. The pundit - Graeme Souness \"That was a real, hard slog for United. If you're a United supporter, you expect them to be better than that against a team that are huffing and puffing. They made hard work of it, it wasn't a great watch by any means.\" What's next?

Bournemouth 4-0 on Super Sunday. In a blistering display of skill, pace and ruthless finishing, Liverpool raced into a 3-0 half-time lead with strikes from Philippe Coutinho (20), Dejan Lovren (26) and Mo Salah (44), who was notching his 14th Premier League goal of the season already. Roberto Firmino (66) added a fourth as there was to be no repeat of the Bournemouth comeback of last season in this fixture, where they won 4-3 after a rousing late rally. After back-to-back draws at Anfield with Everton and West Brom, Jurgen Klopp's men jumped above Burnley and Arsenal with their fourth away win in a row - a run that has seen them score 16 goals. It tees up a tasty Premier League encounter at Arsenal on Friday night, live on Sky Sports. The defeat was the Cherries' fifth home defeat this season and they are hovering above the relegation zone by just one point with an ominous trip to Manchester City next up in the Premier League. Player Ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (5), Ake (5), Daniels (5), Smith (5), Surman (4), Pugh (5), L.Cook (4), Ibe (4), King (5), Defoe (5). Subs: Fraser (6), Stanislas (6), S.Cook (6) Liverpool: Mignolet (6), Gomez (7), Klavan (6), Lovren (7), Robertson (8), Wijnaldum (7), Oxlade-Chamberlain (8), Henderson (7), Coutinho (8), Salah (8), Firmino (8) Subs: Lallana (7), Solanke (7), Ings (6) Man of the Match: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Liverpool were quickly into their stride. Coutinho already had fired a free-kick against the post when he dazzled the Vitality Stadium on 20 minutes with a sublime individual goal. Linking with Andrew Robertson on the left, Coutinho skipped inside, sold a dummy to Simon Francis before rolling a low effort into the bottom corner. Bournemouth had little answer to Liverpool's dominance and they fell two behind six minutes later. A corner which looked to be looping out for a goal kick was kept alive by Firmino and his poked cross was bravely headed home by Lovren - his first goal since October 2016. Team news Eddie Howe freshened up his midfield and attack, making five changes. There were recalls for Andrew Surman Lewis Cook, Jordon Ibe, Danny Pugh and Jermaine Defoe. Meanwhile, there were four changes for Jurgen Klopp. Back came Simon Mignolet, Joe Gomez, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jordan Henderson. Bournemouth thought they were back in it when Jermain Defoe skipped through one-on-one with Simon Mignolet but the usually deadly marksman struck the post. It was a crucial moment in the game as five minutes later, Liverpool were three up. Salah took Charlie Daniels down the line before twisting back inside and firing a low effort into the net. With the goal, the Premier League's top scorer became the first Liverpool player to score 20+ goals in a season (all competitions) since Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge both did so during the 2013/14 campaign. Mohamed Salah netting his 20th goal of the season There was no stopping the rampant Reds, who continued to swarm forward. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain struck the post after a fine tackle in midfield before Firmino did find the net on 66 minutes, flicking home Coutinho's wonderful cross. Bournemouth had no answers to Liverpool's brilliance. Opta stats Liverpool are the first team in top-flight history to have won four consecutive away games by a margin of at least three goals. Coutinho has been directly involved in 15 goals in his last 10 away games for Liverpool in all competitions (8 goals, 7 assists). Bournemouth conceded four goals in a Premier League home game for the first time since April 2016 (1-4 vs Chelsea). This was only the second time in the Premier League that all three players subbed off for Liverpool scored for them in the game - the other was against Newcastle in March 2008 (Jermaine Pennant, Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres). The managers Eddie Howe says his side were off the pace and never got their game going in Bournemouth’s 4-0 home defeat to Liverpool. Eddie Howe says his side were off the pace and never got their game going in Bournemouth’s 4-0 home defeat to Liverpool. Eddie Howe: We were in a relegation battle in our first season, our second season and it's the same this season,\" Howe said. \"That is the case for the majority of teams that aren't in the top six or seven places. The only thing that has changed is the perception and the expectation from everyone around us. Jurgen Klopp: \"I don't go home thinking 'Mo Salah - oh my god, how good is he' - that's not how it works. He's a very important player for us - like the others. But it's easier for him than others at the moment to finish, hopefully it stays like this.\" Jurgen Klopp was delighted with all aspects of his side’s performance in their 4-0 win over Bournemouth, but said his side need to be consistently good. Jurgen Klopp was delighted with all aspects of his side’s performance in their 4-0 win over Bournemouth, but said his side need to be consistently good. Man of the match - Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain The former Arsenal man is getting better week on week under Jurgen Klopp. While Coutinho and Salah continue to grab the headlines, Oxlade-Chamberlain is regaining his full fitness and becoming an integral part of Klopp's squad. No player provided more key passes at the Vitality on Sunday, and he remained combative, going in for more duels than any other player. He still needs to play more games, but in this form, he will be hard to leave out. What's next?

Leicester City on Saturday. Prior to this visit, Palace had failed to win and score in their last 10 Premier League away games either side of the summer but goals from Benteke (19), Wilfried Zaha (40) and Bakary Sako (90+4) saw off Leicester, who had Wilfred Ndidi sent-off for two bookings. It was a welcome return to form for Benteke, who had gone 13 games without a goal, including missing a last-minute penalty against Bournemouth last weekend. Palace have now taken 12 points from their last six games having taken just five points from their opening 12 games, while Leicester's run of four straight wins was emphatically ended. Player Ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (6), Chilwell (4), Maguire (5), Morgan (5), Iborra (6), Ndidi (6), Gray (6), Vardy (6), Albrighton (6), Mahrez (6) Subs: Okazaki (6), King (6), Ulloa (6) Crystal Palace: Speroni (7), Tomkins (8), Dann (8), Cabaye (7), Schlupp (7), Kelly (7), McArthur (7), Zaha (8), Townsend (7), Loftus-Cheek (6), Benteke (8). Subs: Riedewald (6) Man of the Match: Wilfried Zaha Benteke looked a man short of confidence in the early stages - but the weight of the world was lifted from his shoulders on 19 minutes when he ended his drought. Andros Townsend did brilliantly to beat Ben Chilwell and curl a sublime ball into the middle which met its intended target as Benteke powered a header into the net and wheeled away celebrating with his fingers in his ears. Team news Claude Puel made three changes from the side that beat Southampton 4-1 in midweek, with Vicente Iborra, Marc Albrighton and Demarai Gray returning. Crystal Palace handed starts to Martin Kelly and James McArthur. Leicester looked short of ideas as Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez struggled to find space. Meanwhile, Zaha kept popping up in good positions and doubled Palace's lead on 40 minutes when Benteke glided through the middle of the park before slipping in the winger, who finished in great style. The Foxes improved after the break and thought they levelled when Vincent Iborra headed home from a free-kick but referee Martin Atkinson ruled it out for a clear push. Seconds later, Leicester were down to 10-men when Ndidi was dismissed for a second yellow card for simulation. Kasper Schmeichel and Christian Benteke in action at the King Power Stadium The midfielder - on his 21st birthday - dribbled into the box but fell to the ground under no contact, which drew the second yellow from Atkinson's pocket. Despite showing a positive attitude with one man less, Leicester rarely troubled the Palace back-line and Palace had the final say when substitute Sako finished off a flowing counter attack in added time. Opta stats Crystal Palace ended a run of 934 minutes without a Premier League away goal, scoring for the first time since April 23rd 2017 versus Liverpool. It was their first away league win in 11 attempts. Since his Premier League debut in September 2012, Benteke has scored 24 headed goals - only Olivier Giroud (27) has netted more in the competition in this period. Since the start of last season, Zaha has been directly involved in 20 Premier League goals, more than any other Crystal Palace player (11 goals, 9 assists). Crystal Palace have gone seven games unbeaten in the English top-flight for the first time since October 1990 (12 games). The managers Claude Puel: \"It was not a good game for us and Crystal Palace deserved this result. They played with desire and quality and we didn't deserve a win today. I think our play was too slow against a good team with a strong defensive unit. We needed to have more quickness, more quality in the play and it was not possible today.\" Claude Puel says Leicester’s play was too slow and that they did not deserve anything from their 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace Claude Puel says Leicester’s play was too slow and that they did not deserve anything from their 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace Roy Hodgson: \"Before the game, I was asked about our away form and not scoring goals and I said in the last few performances, we've looked very, very dangerous. You think of the chances we've created, we've done that in all our away matches and we've been getting closer and closer. \"I'm delighted with the victory, but I'm not that surprised because we've been threatening to do that for quite a long time now.\" Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace’s recent form has been good enough that he was not surprised when they beat Leicester 3-0 away from home Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace’s recent form has been good enough that he was not surprised when they beat Leicester 3-0 away from home The pundit Clinton Morrison: \"I think it was a fantastic performance. Before the game, I think Crystal Palace would have taken a draw with the great run that Leicester have been on, but I thought they defended brilliantly and going forward with Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke, Ruben Loftus-Cheek too who had a good game, they were the difference. \"Some of the football they played today was quite breathtaking, it was Crystal Palace trying to pass and move the ball. That front three can cause any defence problems so I think they will go from strength to strength now.\" Man of the match - Wilfried Zaha Wilfried Zaha says he is happy for the squad today after Crystal Palace secured their first away win of the season as Christian Benteke scored his first of the season in their 3-0 victory over Leicester Wilfried Zaha says he is happy for the squad today after Crystal Palace secured their first away win of the season as Christian Benteke scored his first of the season in their 3-0 victory over Leicester Fresh from his match-winning double assist salvo against Watford, the Palace winger was a handful once again, driving his team forward at every opportunity. He made the finish for his goal look very easy, which is a sign of the confidence oozing through his veins. Clinton Morrison in the Sky Sports studio, said: \"He's showing consistency, playing intelligent passes and is becoming Palace's star man. The Palace fans love him, that's all they talk about. The young kids want to be him. He's delivering.\" What's next?

Arsenal 1-0 Newcastle highlights Arsenal 1-0 Newcastle highlights Mesut Ozil's stunning volley fired Arsenal up to fourth in the Premier League with an unconvincing 1-0 victory over struggling Newcastle. The Germany international's thunderous 23rd-minute effort proved enough for the Gunners who limped to their first league win in their last four outings. Arsenal's profligacy inspired a spirited Newcastle display, but it was not enough to halt their alarming winless run which extends to nine games. To make matters worse, the defeat sees Newcastle drop into the relegation zone while Arsenal leapfrog Burnley - who drew at Brighton - into the top four. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (6), Bellerin (6), Koscielny (6), Monreal (6), Maitland-Niles (6), Xhaka (6), Wilshere (6), Ozil (8), Iwobi (6), Sanchez (6), Lacazette (5). Subs: Giroud (5), Welbeck (5), Coquelin (n/a). Newcastle: Elliot (6), Yedlin (5), Lascelles (5), Lejeune (5), Manquillo (5), Murphy (5), Hayden (5), Merino (5), Atsu (4), Perez (5), Joselu (4). Subs: Gayle (5), Diame (5), Ritchie (6). Man of the Match: Mesut Ozil Restored to the starting line-up, Alexandre Lacazette tried to vindicate his inclusion with a quick-fire third-minute shot but Rob Elliot, who replaced Karl Darlow in the Newcastle goal after his error against Everton, saved well from the Frenchman. Jamaal Lascelles drew Petr Cech into action two minutes later but Arsenal remained on top as Hector Bellerin's goal-bound effort was blocked before Ainsley Maitland-Niles left three Newcastle players in his wake but fired into the side-netting. Mesut Ozil hits a left-footed volley to put Arsenal in front at the Emirates Stadium A frustrating first half looked to be unfolding in front of the Gunners until a volley of the highest quality from Ozil broke the deadlock, the Germany international firing a clearance beyond Elliot with interest from just inside the area. Bellerin and Granit Xhaka spurned chances to double Arsenal's tally before Florian Lejeune prevented Ozil from doubling his tally with a chipped finish as Newcastle reached the interval without falling further behind. Team news Alexandre Lacazette returned to replace Olivier Giroud in the Arsenal starting line-up. Newcastle made five changes as Rob Elliot, Isaac Hayden, Jacob Murphy, Ayoze Perez and Joselu were recalled by Rafa Benitez. Christian Atsu deflected the ball inches wide of his own goal within four minutes of the restart before the introduction of Matt Ritchie breathed life into Newcastle as Josh Murphy stung Cech's palms on 57 minutes. Lacazette should have put the game to bed on the hour only for his poor, chipped effort to let Newcastle off the hook, but the visitors were unable to punish the Gunners' wastefulness as Joselu's deflected effort and two presentable chances for Ayoze Perez went begging. Rafael Benitez on the touchline during the Premier League football match between Arsenal and Newcastle United at the Emirates Stadium Opta stats Newcastle are without a win in nine Premier League games (D1 L8), their longest winless run in league football since May 2015 (10). The Gunners have won each of their last 10 Premier League games against the Magpies, a run stretching back to March 2012. Rafa Benitez has never enjoyed a victory away to Arsenal in the Premier League in seven attempts, drawing two and losing five. Jack Wilshere started consecutive Premier League games for Arsenal for the first time since May 2015. Mesut Ozil has been directly involved in six goals in his last five Premier League games at the Emirates (2 goals, 4 assists). Petr Cech has now kept 199 Premier League clean sheets. Man of the Match - Mesut Ozil With Newcastle putting in an improved defensive display, it needed a moment of brilliance to unpick the Magpies - and boy did Mesut Ozil deliver that. Mesut Ozil celebrates scoring against Newcastle The German read the situation superbly to anticipate where the ball would drop and produced a similarly superb finish to fire the Gunners back to winning ways. On an afternoon where so many of his team-mates were ineffective, Ozil's contribution was telling. The managers Arsene Wenger: \"It was more uncomfortable than we would have liked. We created the chances for it to be comfortable and, in the last five minutes, we became a big edgy, but we didn't make a mistake at the back. Ozil's goal was a gem to watch. I'm happy for Mesut because that is what you want from him, that decisiveness. It was a fantastic goal.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger admitted it was edgy at the end of their win over Newcaslte but says the necessity to win was playing on their minds. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger admitted it was edgy at the end of their win over Newcaslte but says the necessity to win was playing on their minds. Rafa Benitez: \"It's frustrating to lose. We were pushing and working so hard, especially in the second half. It's a pity. Sometimes you need a little bit of luck, sometimes it's the final decision.

Burnley went closest to breaking the deadlock after the break, but Mat Ryan produced a stunning double save before Chris Wood was flagged for offside after tucking home the rebound.

Glenn Murray reacts after missing his first-half penalty at the Amex A dominant first half from Brighton saw Lewis Dunk's effort inadvertently blocked by team-mate Shane Duffy before Murray sent a header straight at Nick Pope. Johann Berg Gudmundsson then forced Ryan to make a smart save, while down the other end Anthony Knockaert hit the post and Dunk saw a header cleared off the line. Team news Brighton made four changes with Bruno, Pascal Gross, Solly March and Glenn Murray coming into the side. Burnley welcomed back captain Ben Mee, while Charlie Taylor made his first PL start. Brighton were controversially handed a penalty in the 35th minute as Murray went down after a coming together with Tarkowski - though the forward could only blaze the spot-kick wildly over. Murray missed his first-half penalty after lifting it over the crossbar An off-the-ball incident then went unnoticed by referee Chris Kavanagh, who could have easily shown red to Tarkowski and pointed to the spot once more after the Burnley defender appeared to elbow Murray in the ribs. Burnley grew into the game after the break, but Ryan was there to superbly deny Scott Arfield twice in quick succession before Wood was deemed to be in an offside position when slotting the rebound in. Wood then superbly held his run before being played through on goal, but after opting to lift his effort over Ryan, the Brighton 'keeper stood tall and ended up making the save with his face. Opta stats Brighton have picked up just three points in their last seven Premier League games (D3 L4), after accruing 11 in the seven before that (W3 D2 L2). Burnley's Premier League games this season have produced a divisional-low 28 goals this season (16 for, 12 against). The Seagulls have netted just one goal in their last six Premier League games, after scoring eight in the six before that. Burnley have lost just four games in the top-flight this season, as many defeats as they suffered in their last six games of the 2016/17 campaign. The pundit - Paul Merson \"Definitely a game of two halves. First half, Burnley were never in the game, but I didn't think it was a penalty, I thought it was a bit of tangled legs. Brighton were the much better team in the first half. \"They must gone into the dressing room and Sean Dyche must have said 'now go out and express yourselves.' And they were a completely different team, they played some great football, some great passing movements. Wood should have scored, he tried to dink the goalkeeper before they had one cleared off the line. It was sort of their plan, but it didn't quite come off.\" Man of the match - Mat Ryan The Brighton goalkeeper had little to do in the first half, but his contribution after the break ensured the hosts left with a deserved point. The Australia international improvised brilliantly to deny Arfield twice, while his decision not to go down with Wood approaching paid dividends when the Burnley striker looked to chip it over him.

highlights of Chelsea 1-0 Southampton Watch highlights of Chelsea 1-0 Southampton Marcos Alonso's long-range free-kick gave Chelsea a 1-0 win over Southampton at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. The Spaniard struck on the stroke of half-time, curling a stunning effort around the wall and beating Fraser Forster, who will feel he should have done better. Chelsea dominated the game for long periods but were unable to extend their lead, with Pedro hitting the post in the first half and Forster making a string of saves. Chelsea's wastefulness was almost punished as Southampton substitute Charlie Austin went close to equalising twice in the second half, but Antonio Conte's side held out to move level on points with second-placed Manchester United. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (7), Azpilicueta (7), Cahill (7), Christensen (7), Moses (6), Alonso (9), Bakayoko (7), Kante (7), Willian (8), Hazard (7), Pedro (7) Subs: Fabregas (7).

The visitors were forced to replace the injured Cedric Soares with Mario Lemina following a heavy tackle by Gary Cahill in the early stages, and they struggled to get out of their half after that. N'Golo Kante challenges Oriol Romeu for posession Forster made two saves from Alonso either side of a stop from N'Golo Kante, but Southampton needed the woodwork to rescue them when Pedro cut inside from the left flank two minutes before half-time. Just as it seemed Southampton might hold out until the break, however, Alonso took advantage of Maya Yoshida's foul on Eden Hazard 30 yards from goal to put the hosts in front. Team news Chelsea made one change from their 3-1 win over Huddersfield as Gary Cahill replaced Antonio Rudiger. Southampton, meanwhile, made six changes from their 4-1 defeat to Leicester, with Charlie Austin and Virgil van Dijk among those benched. Mauricio Pellegrino turned to Austin on the hour mark and the Englishman, who had scored four times in his previous five appearances, forced Courtois into a diving save with his first touch. Marcos Alonso's free-kick put Chelsea ahead It was a warning sign for Chelsea, and Austin threatened again in the 76th minute, when Courtois denied him in a one-on-one situation again. Forster made second-half saves from Alonso, substitute Alvaro Morata and Cesc Fabregas as Chelsea pushed for a second goal, but in the end they were happy to settle for a narrow victory. Opta stats Chelsea have won eight of their last 10 games in the Premier League (D1 L1), including each of the last five at Stamford Bridge. Southampton are winless in their last six Premier League away games, drawing two and losing four. Marcos Alonso has had a hand in 14 goals since his Chelsea debut (10 goals, four assists); more than any other Premier League defender. Only Alvaro Morata (49) has attempted more shots in the Premier League for Chelsea this season than Alonso (34). Chelsea have scored seven direct free-kicks under Antonio Conte in all competitions, more than any other Premier League side since the start of last season. Southampton have made 25 changes to their starting XI over their last five Premier League games - in their previous 13 games this season they made 21 changes. Man of the match - Marcos Alonso The Spaniard has been outstanding for Chelsea this season and this was another eye-catching performance from the left wing-back. His winner was his fourth goal of the season, making him the joint-top scoring defender in the Premier League. Marcos Alonso has scored four Premier League goals this season He could have had more, too. Alonso repeatedly got himself into dangerous positions and attempted six shots in total - twice as many as any other player on the pitch. He did not have too much to do defensively, but his attacking contribution was invaluable. The only downside was the yellow card which will keep him out of next weekend's meeting with Everton. The pundit - Charlie Nicholas \"Southampton did not set up too badly in the first 10 minutes. Bertrand got up and down the left hand side well. But then Cedric got injured. They didn't change the formation after Lamina came on but they're camped in again. They had all nine players just sitting in front of their box, the official parking of the bus, and they never really got going again. \"Alonso's free-kick is a good free-kick. In fact it's better than good because it's right into the post. But I think the goalkeeper expects Willian to take it with his right foot. Alonso looks like he's about to jog over it and he takes it by surprise, and that's enough to give it that distance into the corner.\" The managers Antonio Conte: It was a difficult game. I think when you don't score the second goal you have to suffer because you are afraid. A corner, a free kick, and your opponent can score. I think that we dominated the game. We shot 28 times but only eight on target and one onto the post. I think we have to score the second goal to be more relaxed.\" Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says his side need to be more clinical Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says his side need to be more clinical Mauricio Pellegrino: \"Obviously when you are playing with five defenders you don't have a lot of people in the middle and they managed more of the ball. When you win something on one side you always lose something on the other, but at the end we had a couple of chances and we were really close. The feeling wasn't bad because we were fighting until the end and we were close to equalising.\" Mauricio Pellegrino praises Southampton's spirit against Chelsea Mauricio Pellegrino praises Southampton's spirit against Chelsea What's next?

0-3 West Ham Marko Arnautovic was on target against his former club as West Ham moved out of the bottom three with a 3-0 win at Stoke. The match was delayed by an hour due to a power outage, but when we did finally get up and running under the lights, Mark Noble - on his 300th Premier League appearance - stroked West Ham into a 19th-minute lead from the spot after referee Graham Scott adjudged Erik Pieters to have felled Manuel Lanzini in the box. Stoke were incredulous, believing Lanzini to have gone down too easily. The returning Arnautovic, who was a real threat all afternoon, having mustered six shots at goal in the match, finally made one of his chances count in the 75th minute, after combining superbly with Lanzini, before substitute Diafra Sakho slid in a late third to make sure of the three points. Stoke's worst start to a Premier League season continues after a fifth defeat in their last six league games leaves them looking over their shoulder in 17th, while West Ham capped a fine week by climbing to 15th. Player ratings Stoke: Butland (6), Pieters (5), Wimmer (4), Cameron (5), Shawcross (4), Allen (5), Diouf (3), Sobhi (4), Fletcher (5), Crouch (5), Shaqiri (6).

Subs: Sakho (7), Chicharito (6), Rice (7). Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic The game burst to life in the 18th minute, as Ryan Shawcross got up highest to meet a free-kick, but his header came out off the post and West Ham countered immediately. Lanzini carried the ball into the box, dragged it away from the outstretched leg of Pieters, went down, and the referee pointed to the spot before Noble stepped up to take the penalty. Replays show Lanzini may have been going down before contact was made. Arnautovic, who was treated to a hostile reception on his first return to the bet365 Stadium, then almost made it two after capitalising on a missed header from Pieters, but Jack Butland spread himself well to make the block, before the Austria international then fired over as the half-time whistle approached. Team news For the fourth game running, Joe Hart had to make do with a place on the bench, with Adrian continuing in goal. Just one enforced change for West Ham from the draw with Arsenal, with James Collins coming in for the suspended Winston Reid.As expected Kurt Zouma missed out for Stoke, with Kevin Wimmer replacing him in the starting XI. After the break, Arnautovic again remained the danger, as he again went close. The excellent Arthur Masuaku fed him down the left flank, Arnautovic cut inside, fired for goal, but Kevin Wimmer made the block, with the ball skewing into the side-netting. Another effort at goal and another Arnautovic chance was next up, but this time the former Stoke forward was denied by the crossbar after brilliantly controlling and shooting for goal from the edge of the box. It seemed like it would only be a matter of time before the returning villain made his mark, and sure enough, 15 minutes from time, he found the net. The pass into Lanzini was perfect, but the flicked return from Lanzini exquisite, as he chipped the ball into the path of Arnautovic, who smashed the ball under Butland to make it two. A lively celebration, in front of the Stoke fans, ensued. West Ham have kept three consecutive clean sheets Eleven minutes later, it was three. Lanzini was at the heart of it again, as he fed Sakho, who passed the ball into the net to put the seal on another fine West Ham performance, intensifying the pressure on Mark Hughes' shoulders in the process. Opta stats This is the first time since March 2014 (at Manchester United) that a side managed by David Moyes has kept three consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League. Manuel Lanzini provided two assists and won the penalty in this match - it's only the second time that Lanzini has assisted two goals in a single PL game (also vs Middlesbrough in January 2017). Marko Arnautovic is the third player to score against Stoke in the Premier League having previously played for them in the competition (also Wilfried Bony and Seyi Olofinjana). Mark Noble celebrates putting West Ham ahead Stoke have kept just one clean sheet in their last 16 Premier League games. Man of the match - Marko Arnautovic His first touch was greeted by a cacophony on boos at the bet365 Stadium, but a superb performance certainly silenced those angry Stoke fans on Saturday afternoon. It did appear that the Austria international would endure a frustrating afternoon in front of goal having missed several chances, but finally got his goal late in the day to seal victory for the Hammers. A look at the average position shows Arnautovic playing much higher than any of his team-mates - he was a menace on his return to the Potters.

Mooy's hooked ball into the box fell at Quaner's feet, who was beyond the last defender, and his shot across goal deflected off Depoitre into the path of the offside Kachunga before being steered into the net. While Watford had every reason to feel aggrieved about the opener, they only had themselves to blame for Huddersfield's second as a lapse in concentration from Adrian Mariappa enabled Mooy to score his third goal of the season after another ball across from Quaner. Aaron Mooy scored twice as Huddersfield beat Watford at Vicarage Road Team news Etienne Capoue came in for the suspended Tom Clverley in one change from the Watford side that were beaten at Crystal Palace. For Huddersfield, David Wagner made four changes. Tommy Smith, Daniel Williams, Tom Ince and Steve Mounie dropped out from the side that were beaten at home to Chelsea with Florent Hadergjonaj, Collin Quaner, Rajiv van La Parra and Laurent Depoitre all starting. Silva had seen enough, promptly hooking Mariappa in favour of Roberto Pereyra, but his task was made increasingly difficult after a moment of madness from Deeney. The club captain was having a quiet game and showed his frustration by scything down the lively Quaner on the touchline after 33 minutes, leaving referee Michael Oliver in no doubt the challenge was worthy of a straight red card. Huddersfield emerged from the interval looking to put the game to bed and, having waited nearly 11 hours for an away goal, the Yorkshire club duly fired in a third of the afternoon after Quaner was too strong for Jose Holebas before the ball fell kindly for Depoitre to lash past Gomes. Watford had created very little, but they were handed a lifeline as Hogg picked up a second booking for hauling down Richarlison just after the hour mark, and seven minutes later there was renewed belief among the home fans as Doucoure rifled in a terrific half volley from the edge of the penalty area. But any hopes of an unlikely comeback were extinguished with a minute of normal time remaining as Doucoure brought down Depoitre inside the box, allowing Mooy to step up and stroke his spot-kick beyond Gomes. The managers Marco Silva: \"First I want to congratulate our opponent. They won the match and it was a tough afternoon for us. Until the first goal we didn't perform well, but the game is balanced. After that, everything changed. \"We showed in some moments in the second half we showed that our mentality is strong - even in the bad moments like we had today until half-time. \"We tried to react and our players showed hard work and a strong mentality but we made some mistakes that at this level you can't make. The other things I don't want to talk about. Watford boss Marco Silva says his side can get out of this poor run of form after losing 4-1 to Huddersfield in the Premier League. Watford boss Marco Silva says his side can get out of this poor run of form after losing 4-1 to Huddersfield in the Premier League. David Wagner: \"We've had the feeling that this has just been around the corner even if the results have not been there. We've stayed calmed and focused and we've made big steps to make improvements in the past couple of months. \"They [the fans] were never driven away because of results so credit to them. I'm proud and delighted for the players and the away support today was absolutely incredible. \"We are in the race, and for sure no one thought we'd be where we are but it's only near the middle of the season, nothing more. We need 12 wins to stay up and we now have six.\" Huddersfield boss David Wagner praised his side’s performance against a ‘top Watford team’ as Huddersfield romped to a 4-1 win. Huddersfield boss David Wagner praised his side’s performance against a ‘top Watford team’ as Huddersfield romped to a 4-1 win. Opta Stats This is the fourth consecutive meeting between these two sides at Vicarage Road that has seen the winning side score exactly four goals - the two Huddersfield wins in this run have both been 4-1. Watford have conceded more home goals than any other team in the Premier League this season (20). Watford now have exactly the same record after 18 games this season as they did under Walter Mazzarri last season (W6 D4 L8 - 22 points). Elias Kachunga's opening goal ended Huddersfield's run of 59 consecutive shots away from home in the Premier League without scoring. Watford have been given a red card in three successive Premier League games - the first team to do this since West Ham United in August 2015. Man of the match - Aaron Mooy Huddersfield were excellent value for their three points in Hertfordshire and Mooy was at the heart of a courageous and creative display from a side that had gone eight away games without a goal. The Australia international midfielder was involved in Kachunga's contentious opener before being in the right place to guide in his side's second midway through the first half, but it was his overall display which made him stand out. The travelling supporters sang his name at regular intervals throughout the match and he capped a fine individual performance by firing in his second from the penalty spot late on. What's next? Watford will look to pick themselves up from their latest setback when they face Brighton at the Amex Stadium next Saturday. Huddersfield travel to St Mary's full of confidence to take on Southampton on the same day."}, {"date": "16/12/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54214, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester

extend their historic winning run to 16 Premier League matches. Gundogan headed home the opener from a Leroy Sane corner on 14 minutes after the hosts had seen off early Spurs possession and begun to dominate the game. De Bruyne's fierce strike on the breakaway ended a Spurs resurgence after the interval and Sterling twice tapped home from close range after missing an open goal from Gabriel Jesus penalty that struck the post. Ilkay Gundogan (R) celebrates after opening the scoring at the Etihad Player ratings Man City: Ederson (7); Walker (8), Otamendi (7), Mangala (7), Delph (7); Fernandinho (7), Gundogan (8), De Bruyne (9) Sterling (8), Sane (8); Aguero (7) Subs: Jesus (5), Foden (NA), B Silva (NA) Tottenham: Loris (6), Tripper (4), Dier (5), Vertonghen (6), Rose (6); Dembele (6), Winks(5); Son (6), Alli (6), Eriksen (7); Kane (5) Subs: Lamela (5), Davies (NA), Sissoko (NA), Man of the match: Kevin De Bruyne Christian Eriksen found a late consolation for the visitors late on but the gap between them and the league leaders is now a massive 21 points. City have now beaten all of their title rivals this season and their march towards the Premier League trophy appears unstoppable. They scored the first with just their second chance, as Gundogan's run confused the visiting defenders and they conceded sloppily from a set-piece for the third time in four league games. Team news Man City made three changes from the side that beat Swansea 4-0 as Walker, Gundogan and Sane replaced Danilo, Bernardo Silva and the in-form David Silva, who didn't make the bench. Spurs made three changes; Trippier, Dembele and Alli came in for Aurier, Sissoko and Lamela. Raheem Sterling celebrates after scoring City's third A chilling fog descended on the Etihad but it did little to cloud City's dazzling movement and the away side needed goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to keep the score 1-0 at half-time, the France international getting down low to twice deny Gundogan a second. Harry Kane curled a shot just wide of the far post as Spurs struggled to threaten on the counter, and the England striker went closest to a leveller when he forced Ederson into a full-stretched save after the break. Spurs had upped their intensity but were left open to the counter-attack and the power and pace of De Bruyne saw him smash home the second through Lloris' outstretched palm on 70 minutes. Jan Vertonghen then felled De Bruyne in the box for a clear penalty, but substitute Jesus found the foot of the upright before Sterling skied the rebound way off target. Gundogan makes it 1-0 to Manchester City Sterling made up for the miss with the first of two easy tap-ins on 80 minutes, rounding off a superb passing move at the back post for his first, before capitalising on Eric Dier's poor error, nipping the ball through Lloris' legs and rolling into the empty net for the fourth. Spurs had been as bewildered as any side that has visited the Etihad this season, and Eriksen did not even celebrate when he slotted home a Spurs goal in stoppage time. The managers Pep Guardiola: \"What we believe now is that we trust each other. When I give some opinions they follow us, and that is the dream for the manager. \"What is the most important thing is that, what we believe is the best way to play, they don't have doubts. They know that the manager and the staff and everybody wants the best for them - that is the best present, when you believe the players follow you.\" Leroy Sane was given plenty of space by Spurs in the first half Mauricio Pochettino: \"We need to learn from this situation. Today was a very good example to see a team that believes, that has a lot of quality and strength, and is in very good form. \"They deserved the victory completely. We were poor but, not only that, the way that we conceded the first goal was a massive mistake for us. We need to improve. Man of the match - Kevin De Bruyne The Belgian dominated the game from all areas of the midfield and his goal was superb. Not only was it a near-total display of powerful, pacey attacking play but it was also timely, halting a Spurs resurgence in the second half. He is becoming a complete midfield player under Guardiola. Opta stats Manchester City extended their winning run in the league to 16, the longest-ever in the top-flight. However, Pep Guardiola is still three victories away from his best-ever winning streak in league football as a manager - 19 consecutive wins with Bayern Munich between October 2013 and March 2014. Since taking over at White Hart Lane in August 2014, Mauricio Pochettino has enjoyed one just victory in his 18 Premier League games away to the 'big six' (W1 D6 L11). Tottenham's first shot on target came in the 55th minute, the longest they have had to wait in a Premier League game this season.

The Magpies twice struck the woodwork in the first-half as Matt Ritchie and Mikel Merino both hit the post with long-range efforts.

It was the hosts who began the brighter of the two sides and they were very nearly rewarded as Ritchie cut inside from the left before seeing his fierce shot crash back off the woodwork with Jordan Pickford beaten. But just over a minute later, Everton were ahead as a fine interchange between Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Rooney led to the former crossing for Lennon to head towards goal and after Darlow failed to gather, Rooney was on hand to slide in the rebound. Jonjo Shelvey is shown a red card by referee by Martin Atkinson late on Team news Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez made four changes. Jamaal Lascelles returned in place of Ciaran Clark while Mohamed Diame replaced Isaac Hayden, Jonjo Shelvey was selected over Jacob Murphy and Joselu dropped out in place of Christian Atsu. Sam Allardyce made two changes to his Everton side as Aaron Lennon and Morgan Schneiderlin came in for Tom Davies and Oumar Niasse. It means that Rooney has now scored more Premier League goals against Newcastle (15) than against any other team. Newcastle were inches away from equalising in the 37th minute when Merino was afforded space 30 yards out but the Spaniard's shot cannoned off the inside of the post and went wide. Having weathered the storm in the first half, Everton were largely untroubled following the interval as Florian Lejeune's header towards the far post narrowly evaded the right boot of Mohamed Diame. The Toffees could have extended their lead as Ashley Williams rose to meet Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick only to be denied by the outstretched Darlow. And as Newcastle's frustration grew, Shelvey received his marching orders for scything down Gueye in the closing stages. Sam Allardyce renewed his battle with Rafa Benitez on the touchline The managers Rafa Benitez said: \"It's a bad result, but the performance of the team (was good). It's difficult to believe that we lost 1-0. \"We had so many chances and we had so much control in the second half. They were happy with the result and they were defending, trying to play counter-attack and waste time. \"We have to manage these situations in another way after losing another game having tried so many different ways to win.

Newcastle's Rafa Benitez says it's difficult to believe they lost to Everton following their first half display. Sam Allardyce said: \"I'm pleased for the main, but there's obviously room for improvement.

After a bit of an iffy start, we played our way into the game and played well, using the ball a lot better. I would have to say the goal was a terrific move. \"The defence have done a fantastic job and that has been the bedrock to our upturn in fortunes.

Sam Allardyce reacts to Everton's 1-0 away win at Newcastle. Opta Stats Newcastle have picked up just one point in their last eight Premier League games (W0 D1 L7). Everton have collected 10 points in their last four Premier League games - one more than they managed in their previous 12 combined (9). Everton ended a run of 16 Premier League away games without a win (D8 L8), claiming their first victory since winning 1-0 at Sam Allardyce's Crystal Palace in January. Newcastle United have lost four consecutive home league games at St. James' Park for the first time since April 2015 under John Carver. Wayne Rooney has been involved in 23 Premier League goals against Newcastle (15 goals, 8 assists) - more than any player has against an opponent in Premier League history. Rooney has nine away Premier League goals at Newcastle - only Alan Shearer (who scored 10 away at Leeds United) has scored more away goals versus a single opponent in Premier League history. Man of the match - Ashley Williams Williams stood out with another commanding display to add to his improved performances since Everton's change in management. His confidence looked brittle during the autumn but in Mason Holgate, the Welshman has found an unlikely partner and the relationship is blossoming following a third clean sheet in four league games. Whatever Newcastle threw into the box in a desperate attempt to draw level, Williams was on hand to clear and it was very much a joint effort alongside the excellent Holgate which will likely keep Michael Keane out of the side. What's next? Newcastle now face two trips to London before Christmas, starting with the visit to the Emirates Stadium to play Arsenal on Saturday before facing West Ham back in the capital the following week.

Okazaki goals helped Leicester City ease to a 4-1 victory over a hapless Southampton at St Mary's. Leicester took time to grow into the game but they were unstoppable once they got going as Riyad Mahrez scored a great individual opener after 11 minutes. Southampton could not cope with their opponents and allowed Okazaki and Andy King to score from close range to make it 3-0 before the break. Saints pulled a goal back through Maya Yoshida but the game was all over when Okazaki turned in his second on 69 minutes to complete the scoring and secure Leicester's fourth straight league win. Algerian Mahrez picked up the ball 40 yards from goal in the 11th minute and was allowed to run at the Saints defence until he got 20 yards from goal, where he fired a shot across Fraser Forster into the bottom corner. Shinji Okazaki was in fine form It was all Leicester from that moment onwards and the lead was doubled in the 32nd minute when a corner was volleyed at goal by Christian Fuchs but it was blocked on the line, only to fall to Okazaki who poked home from close range. Saints looked incapable of defending and it was soon 3-0 as Harry Maguire was allowed to chest down a free-kick, turn and get to the byline from where he sent the ball across the goalmouth to the back post for King to tap in the third. Team news Hojberg, Ward-Prowse, Redmond and Stephens dropped out for Southampton, replaced by Davis, Lemina, Soares and Boufal, as Pellegrino made four changes.There were three changes for Leicester as Puel left out Albrighton, Gray and Iborra, who were replaced by Fuchs, Okazaki and King. Southampton were better after the break and pulled one back when Yoshida headed a corner across the box, through a number of bodies and into the net beyond Kasper Schmeichel. Charlie Austin should have made it 3-2 when Ryan Bertrand sent in a perfect cross for the striker to tap in from six yards but Schmeichel spread himself and stopped the shot superbly. Player ratings Southampton: Forster (6), Soares (6), Yoshida (5), Van Dijk (6), Bertrand (6), Tadic (4), Davis (5), Lemina (5), Romeu (5), Boufal (4), Austin (5) Subs: Ward-Prowse (5), Gabbiadini (5), Redmond (5) Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Simpson (7), Morgan (7), Maguire (8), Fuchs (7), Chilwell (8), Mahrez (9), King (8), Ndidi (7), Vardy (8), Okazaki (9) Subs: Gray (6), Albrighton (6), Ulloa (6). Man of the match: Shinji Okazaki Leicester finished the scoring when Cedric Soares misplaced a pass, allowing Jamie Vardy to break down the right and cross into the box for Okazaki to steer into the net. Opta stats Since Claude Puel took charge of Leicester City for the first time on October 29, only Manchester City (21) and Burnley (18) have won more points in the Premier League than the Foxes (17). Leicester City scored four goals in an away Premier League game for the first time since drawing 4-4 with Spurs in February 2004. Five of Riyad Mahrez's last eight Premier League goals have been from outside the box - prior to this, his previous 21 were all scored from inside the box. Mahrez has been directly involved in nine Premier League goals this season (five goals, four assists) in 17 appearances, as many as he was involved in during the entirety of 2016/17 (9). Shinji Okazaki scored and assisted in a Premier League game for the first time. This match was the first in Premier League history to see two different Asian goalscorers (Okazaki for Leicester and Yoshida for Southampton). The managers Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It was a really bad game from the beginning to the end. After we conceded the first goal, as we started the first 10 minutes well, but after this goal they were getting better and little by little our confidence was down and we gave the ball away all the time. \"For me it's a little bit concentration, don't be 100 per cent focused and at this level, you cannot be on the pitch, giving this advantage and sometimes you get an awful day like today and this is the reality. \"In the Premier League there are a group of teams that the difference between the bottom and the middle is three, four, five six points like at the end of last season, it's more or less the same. It's really tight, we need to fight for every point. \"Obviously we got the same feeling as the supporters because when we play like this we are a little bit surprised as three days before we played a really good game. But in football, in three days, everything changed.\" Claude Puel: \"My team is the most important thing. I approve of my players because we gave a fantastic game, very good first half for example. It was important to maintain the result in the second half. \"I think it's a good team with very good players and they deserve all the results against City or against Arsenal and just all the team ready to play a strong game against this team. It's a very good result for us. \"All is not perfect. We need to correct some things, we need to continue to improve and always progress. \"It was nice to see familiar faces when I came back here, I have a lot of friends. I appreciated all the players, all the staff and it was a good moment to see them. It's one result and I am sure they will come back for the next games.\" Man of the match - Shinji Okazaki The striker was a constant threat to Southampton as he chased endlessly and got himself into great positions to score. The only dampener for him was he was unable to complete his hat-trick as he completed a rare 90 minutes. What next? Southampton travel to Stamford Bridge to play Premier League champions Chelsea on Saturday at 3pm.

the longest ever run in the league - as they beat Swansea 4-0 on Wednesday. Pep Guardiola's side had matched Arsenal's previous record of 14 wins in a row after their Manchester derby triumph, but surpassed the tally with their victory at the Liberty Stadium. David Silva (27) opened the scoring just before the half-hour mark, with Kevin De Bruyne (34) curling home a free-kick to double the lead. The Man City captain (52) then scored his second of the game just after the break before Sergio Aguero (85) rounded off the scoring late on.

Man City remain 11 points clear of Manchester United - who beat Bournemouth on Wednesday evening - while Swansea remain rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table. It was a busy opening 10 minutes at both ends. Aguero had the first shot of the game but his effort on a tight angle could only find the side of the netting before Lukasz Fabianski made a superb save from a powerful Danilo volley. Man City goalkeeper Ederson was also called into action, as Jordan Ayew tried his luck from the top of the box but the Brazilian made a solid low save. Team news Swansea made one change with Jordan Ayew coming in for Wayne Routledge. Man City made four changes with Sergio Aguero, Danilo, Eliaquim Mangala and Bernardo Silva coming into the XI. Man City then found the breakthrough in the 27th minute, although Swansea will be disappointed with conceding such a goal. The two Man City Silvas linked up for the opener, with Bernardo Silva's cross from the right flank being knocked home by David Silva with the outside of his foot. Just after the goal, Man City were thwarted once again by Fabianski as Aguero danced through the middle of three Swansea defenders before striking, but the goalkeeper kept him at bay before pouncing on the rebound, taking a foot to the face from David Silva for his troubles. David Silva scores his second and Manchester City's third at the Liberty Stadium The visitors doubled their lead in the 34th minute thanks to a superb free-kick from De Bruyne. After Raheem Sterling was fouled by Kyle Naughton on the left-hand side of the box, the Belgian curled a brilliant set-piece into the bottom corner, beating the leaping Fabianski. Man City began the second half well, with David Silva and Aguero both going close, and the former added a third goal seven minutes after the restart. After slipping the ball to Sterling down the left flank, the ball was delivered back into the box for the Man City captain at the near post, who chipped over Fabianski to net his second of the evening. Sergio Aguero makes it 4-0 at the Liberty Stadium Swansea did have a short spell of pressure in the middle of the half, but were denied a goal after some brilliant feet from Ederson. After Man City cleared a corner, the ball fell to Roque Mesa at the top corner who lashed a thunderous effort towards goal, but after switching directions on the goal line, Ederson got down low to keep the ball out. Man City rounded off the performance in the 85th minute, with Aguero adding his name to the scoresheet. Yaya Toure picked out the striker in the middle of the park, and he strode forward, heading down the right-hand side of the box. He then flashed the ball across the face of goal and saw it nestle into the far corner to cap off the 15th Premier League win in a row for Man City. Opta stats David Silva is challenged by Wilfried Bony Manchester City have won the same number of games in this current winning run (15) as Swansea City have in their 55 Premier League matches since the start of last season (15/55). Tonight will be the 49th night that Swansea City have spent at the bottom of the Premier League - 34 of those have been since the start of last season (69%). David Silva has been involved in 13 Premier League goals in 17 games this season (five goals, eight assists) - already more than in the whole of 2016-17 (11 goal involvements in 34 games). Sergio Agüero scored his 10th Premier League goal of the season - he's now reached double figures in all seven of his seasons as a Premier League player.

Dominic Solanke had a late goal disallowed for handball Player ratings Liverpool: Karius (6), Alexander-Arnold (6), Lovren (6), Klavan (7), Robertson (6), Wijnaldum (5), Can (5), Mane (5), Coutinho (5), Salah (6), Firmino (5) Subs: Solanke (6), Oxlade-Chamberlain (5), Gomez (NA) West Brom: Foster (6), Nyom (7), Evans (7), Hegazi (7), Gibbs (7), Yacob (7), Krychowiak (6), Livermore (7), McClean (6), Robson-Kanu (7), Rondon (8) Subs: Rodriguez (6), Brunt (NA) Man of the match: Salomon Rondon Liverpool had 71 per cent of the ball overall in the game, but couldn't convert their possession domination into goals. Roberto Firmino poked the ball just wide from Mo Salah's superb delivery across the face of goal, while at the other end Robson-Kanu struck the top of the bar from 25 yards with a fine effort. West Brom had a flurry of chances after the break; first Krychowiak's deep cross from a free-kick caught the wind and tested Karius, and from the resulting corner, the goalkeeper did well to tip over Yacob's powerful header. Team news Jurgen Klopp made six changes from the side which drew 1-1 with Everton on Sunday; the ‘fab four’ all played as Coutinho and Firmino returned to start alongside Salah and Mane. Karius replaced Mignolet, while Can, Wijnaldum and Alexander-Arnold also came in. For West Brom Krychowiak and McClean came in for Field and Rodriguez. Rondon looks to keep two Liverpool players off the ball Sadio Mane struck just wide from Firmino's centre from 12 yards before the hour mark, before Salah glanced a header wide when in space from six yards. But the big talking point came with eight minutes remaining as Solanke looked to have bundled home a winner with a slight touch off his hand from close range after Joe Gomez's cross. He wheeled away in celebration with his Liverpool team-mates, and though referee Paul Tierney had initially given the goal, he was overruled by his assistant, who deemed Solanke to have handled intentionally. Sub Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain was denied at his feet by Ben Foster shortly after, and Solanke's rebound was cleared off the line by Ahmed Hegazi, as Liverpool failed to force a winner. Philippe Coutinho started after being on the bench for the Merseyside derby Man of the match - Salomon Rondon Just as he did at Wembley in the draw with Spurs late in November, Rondon held the ball up brilliantly at Anfield, and Liverpool's defence will be delighted to see the back of him. He competed in 27 duels, 10 more than any other West Brom player, and won a team-high four fouls. In games where Alan Pardew will be setting up not to lose, the Venezuelan is vitally important. The managers Jurgen Klopp on disallowed goal: \"If the arm is then involved, I don't know but there were two deflections. If this was in the other box a penalty, there would still be discussions because it is twice deflected, and for sure not on purpose. Jurgen Klopp accepted the result after the game Jurgen Klopp accepted the result after the game \"It was not on purpose. So if there was a handball it just happened, and so obviously the linesman or whoever thought he saw it 100 per cent. And look, there will be a lot of points on the one side saying it was the right decision, and some on the other side, and we will not get it back, so for sure we cannot change it.\" Alan Pardew: \"[Liverpool] had all the big hitters out there, it wasn't like we came up against a Liverpool side who had left a few out, it was a real force. We kept them quiet and I think the players can be very proud of their performance.\" West Brom boss Alan Pardew praised his side's showing at Anfield West Brom boss Alan Pardew praised his side's showing at Anfield Opta stats This was just the fifth time Liverpool have failed to score in a Premier League home game under Jurgen Klopp - they had scored at least once in 38 of their previous 42. West Brom have not won any of their last 16 games in all competitions (D8 L8); their longest winless run in the club's history. Similarly, Albion are winless in 15 games in the Premier League - their only longer such run in the competition came between February 2006 and August 2008 (16 games).

Man Utd 1-0 Bournemouth Man Utd 1-0 Bournemouth Manchester United got back to winning ways at Old Trafford after the derby tussle with a workmanlike 1-0 victory over Bournemouth on Wednesday. Romelu Lukaku (25) silenced his critics with the winning strike midway through the first-half, his first goal in five Premier League games although he refused to celebrate. Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford went close in the second period but it was Bournemouth who created more chances, registering seven shots on target but they found David de Gea once again in defiant mood. The victory leaves United 11 points behind leaders Manchester City, who won 4-0 at Swansea. Player Ratings Manchester United: De Gea (8), Jones (8), Smalling (7), Shaw (7), Valencia (7), McTominay (6), Matic (6), Lingard (5), Mata (7), Martial (5), Lukaku (7). Subs: Rashford (7), Young (6), Herrera (6) Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (6), Ake (6), Gosling (6), Daniels (6), Smith (6), Fraser (6), Stanislas (7), Arter (7), King (7), Wilson (7) Subs: Defoe (7), Afobe (6), Cook (6) Man of the Match: David de Gea Lukaku, who faced criticism for his part in United's damaging loss to rivals Manchester City at the weekend, showed great determination to head his team in front. Juan Mata hung a ball up to the back post and the striker rose above Charlie Daniels and Nathan Ake to power a header into the top corner. At the other end, De Gea was kept busy by the visitors who tested him with five efforts on targets in the first half, the pick of which came from a stinging Daniels strike from 25 yards. Team news Jose Mourinho made four changes from the derby defeat with Luke Shaw and Scott McTominay handed rare starts. Meanwhile, Dan Gosling, Adam Smith, Harry Arter and Callum Wilson returned for Bournemouth. United settled better after the break and should have doubled their lead but Martial fired over from five yards after Lukaku was denied from close range. Substitute Marcus Rashford then rattled the underside of the crossbar on 72 minutes but that was the last of United's attacking intent as they sank deeper to protect their lead. Despite good territory, the Cherries could not find the killer opportunity although Jermain Defoe was denied by a well-positioned De Gea on 83 minutes. Bournemouth did have one final chance from a 25-yard free-kick in injury time but Ryan Fraser's powerful effort was held by De Gea, who recorded his 10th clean sheet of the Premier League season. Opta stats Manchester United have won nine of their last 10 Premier League games at Old Trafford (L1), keeping a clean sheet in eight of these victories. Since earning promotion in 2015, Bournemouth have taken just 13 points from a possible 87 against the \"top six\" teams in the Premier League (29 games). Since the start of 2016-17, Lukaku has scored 30 goals in 38 Premier League appearances versus \"non-big six\" sides. Mata (18) has made more assists than any other Manchester United player in the Premier League since his debut in January 2014. Bournemouth had five more shots on target than the home side in this game - the last opposition side to have more in a Premier League game at Old Trafford was Liverpool in March 2014 (six more than Manchester United). Manager reaction Jose Mourinho: \"When you lose a match it's important you don't lose two in a row. Every team that loses a match tries not to lose the next one. That's the magic of football. We tried and we managed it. We are happy.\" Eddie Howe: \"They have an outstanding goalkeeper who made a number of good saves and maybe we could have done better in and around their box, but when you consider the opposition and where were playing, I was very pleased with players\" Pundit reaction Alan McInally: \"Eddie Howe will be gutted they haven't scored, gutted they haven't come away with something from the game, because I think they contained Manchester United. I never saw United really controlling huge parts of the game and really pressing them back. With 10 minutes to go, United had had two shots on target.\" Man of the match: David de Gea This was not quite the brilliance of his Arsenal performance two weeks ago as Bournemouth's finishing lacked the required quality to severely test him, yet he was still outstanding. The Spaniard dealt with every single shot Bournemouth threw at him, where his positioning came to the fore. De Gea has kept the most Premier League clean sheets (10) and has made the most saves in the league of any goalkeeper. World-class. What's next?

Tottenham dominated the first half but the goal that gave them the lead was a lucky one, as Serge Aurier's cross evaded everyone and found the net in the 40th minute - his first goal in English football. Brighton improved in the second half and could have levelled through Tomer Hemed, but he fired straight at Hugo Lloris, and that miss proved costly, as Heung-Min Son flicked home in the 87th minute via a deflection to make sure of the win. And with Liverpool drawing 0-0 with West Brom, the three points take Spurs back into the top four on goal difference. Brighton stay 13th. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (6), Rose (5), Vertonghen (6), Aurier (5), Dier (6), Sissoko (6), Son (7), Winks (6), Eriksen (6), Lamela (6), Kane (6). Subs: Dembele (6), Alli (6), Davies (N/A) Brighton: Ryan (6), Dunk (7), Bong (6), Stephens (6), Duffy (6), Kayal (6), Izquierdo (6), Schelotto (6), Knockaert (6), Propper (6), Hemed (6). Subs: : Gross (6), Murray (6), March (6). Man of the match: Heung-Min Son Spurs started the match on the front foot, and were almost in front after the lively Son darted past his man, fired for goal, but was denied by a brave block from Shane Duffy. It was one-way traffic for the majority of the first half, with Brighton blocking everything that Spurs threw at them. Duffy was a particular thorn in Spurs' side, with his best block reserved from a drilled Kane strike from the angle. Son fired over from close range before, just after the half-hour mark, Erik Lamela, making his first start in 14 months after a troublesome hip injury, turned sharply in the box, but could not keep his shot down. Serge Aurier celebrates with Harry Kane and and Moussa Sissoko However, as the groans of frustration were becoming more audible around the ground, Spurs did take the lead in the most fortuitous circumstances. Aurier had time to line up the cross, but overhit it, Kane could not get near the high ball, but neither could Mat Ryan in the Brighton goal, as the ball looped over his hand and into the net. After the break, Spurs continued to press, but couldn't find that vital second to calm their nerves. Ryan denied Kane with his legs, but otherwise was not tested as often as he would have been expecting. Brighton's big moment came in the 69th minute, as Hemed swivelled and shot for goal from a good position, but fired straight at Lloris. Jan Vertonghen puts pressure on Anthony Knockaert Then, moments after Kane had hit the post from a free-kick, Son calmed the nerves around Wembley, flicking Eriksen's free-kick into the net, via the leg of Brighton's Davy Propper. It was not overly convincing, but is that the end of Spurs' Wembley hoodoo once and for all? The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"It's not easy when the opponent [Brighton] only plays to defend,\" Pochettino said. \"But I think the team created a lot of chances. I am very pleased for the victory and the effort of the players. Mauricio Pochettino says his side deserved their lucky first goal and praised their ‘fantastic’ performance in the 2-0 win over Brighton in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino says his side deserved their lucky first goal and praised their ‘fantastic’ performance in the 2-0 win over Brighton in the Premier League. \"Anyone can play in a way they want.

The second one we didn't need to give a free-kick away in the first place, and the first was an incredibly fortuitous one. \"We had good periods of the game, especially in the second half, with the chance that feel to [Tomer] Hemed. You are not going to get many good chances here, and that was as good as any that they did have.\" Chris Hughton says Brighton conceded two poor goals in their defeat at Wembley to Tottenham. Chris Hughton says Brighton conceded two poor goals in their defeat at Wembley to Tottenham. The pundit - Phil Thompson \"What a fluke. Serge Aurier out on the right wing, and as he goes past the defender, the referee could have actually blown for a free-kick. As Izquierdo makes the challenge he knocks him into the ball and it's an awful cross. But it sails and sails and it goes over Matt Ryan's head and right into the far corner. I don't think he's got any chance because of the trajectory of the ball.\" \"It was probably quite laboured. Spurs hit the post twice. And there were a couple of chances for Brighton.\" Opta stats After failing to win any of their first three Premier League home games this season, Spurs have won five of their last six at Wembley (D1). Heung-Min Son has scored in three consecutive Premier League games for only the second time, following a run of four back in April. Serge Aurier became the first Ivorian to score a Premier League goal for Spurs - they've now had players from nine different African nations score for them, the joint-most in the competition (level with Sunderland). Indeed, Spurs have now had players of 41 different nationalities score in the Premier League for them - a joint-high with Manchester City. Man of the match - Heung-Min Son In a match where Spurs were below par on the whole, Son's movement and constant threat really troubled Brighton at Wembley. His form is the main reason Dele Alli was left on the bench, as Mauricio Pochettino just could not leave Son out, due to his recent form. His goal was fortunate in the way it found the net, but the desire to get there brought about the match clincher.

and Jack Wilshere could not inspire Arsenal to victory in their first Premier League starts of the season as West Ham held them to a goalless draw at the London Stadium. It very nearly turned into defeat for Arsenal, but substitute Javier Hernandez saw his effort hit the bar before bouncing on the goal-line in the final minute of normal time. West Ham ultimately reduced Arsenal to just three shots on target all match, despite the visitors enjoying 70% of possession. The draw leaves Arsenal in seventh - one point behind Tottenham, Liverpool and Burnley - while West Ham remain 19th, but move level with West Brom and Crystal Palace on 14 points.

Alexis Sanchez then saw his deflected effort sail narrowly over before Alex Iwobi's strike from a narrow angle cannoned off the near post and away to safety. West Ham had a penalty appeal turned down after a coming together between Granit Xhaka and Manuel Lanzini, while Giroud's overhead-kick attempt was blocked by Aaron Cresswell's hands - though the West Ham defender opted to feign injury as though the effort had hit him in the face. Team news West Ham named an unchanged XI from the side that beat Chelsea 1-0 on Saturday, while Arsenal brought in Jack Wilshere, Olivier Giroud, Alex Iwobi and Ashley Maitland-Niles, who was making his first start for the Gunners. After the break, Arnautovic snatched at an effort following Mark Noble's delightful pass, with the West Ham captain using the pace of the ball to chest a pass over Nacho Monreal. Jack Wilshere spurned an opportunity in the second half, in what was his first PL start for Arsenal in 19 months Arsenal then spurned two great opportunities, but Mesut Ozil could only stab an attempt wide before Wilshere fired over from 10 yards out. And while Arsene Wenger turned to Alexandre Lacazette in the hope of finding a late winner, David Moyes brought on Hernandez with 10 minutes to go, and it was the Mexican who came within a whisker of scoring a winner after some calamitous Arsenal defending.

Eight different clubs have won more points away from home in the Premier League than Arsenal (9) this season - Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester Utd, Liverpool, Burnley, Watford, Leicester & Spurs. West Ham failed to have a single shot on target in a Premier League home match for the first time since August 2013, in a 0-1 defeat against Stoke. The Gunners are now winless in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April. Marko Arnautovic and Laurent Koscielny in action at the London Stadium Man of the match - Angelo Ogbonna Moyes will be delighted with his side's defensive display at the London Stadium, and it was Ogbonna who put in a rock-solid performance to keep Arsenal at bay. Time and again, Ogbonna was there prevent this visitors from scoring, making three blocks and 11 clearances - the highest of any player in both categories. The managers David Moyes: \"We could have [nicked it]. It was a really good performance by the players and certainly a disciplined and organised performance again which we have needed in the three games. \"Sometimes if you do that, you hang in and you stick with it then you get yourself some opportunities and I thought we'd done that at the end. \"I would say for the majority of the game we would have to praise the boys for how disciplined they were as defenders and how well they stuck to their task against a good team that caused us problems.\" Arsene Wenger watched his side's winless league run extend to three games Arsene Wenger: \"There are some draws that are frustrating. It is one of them. It was 10 against 10 in the final third. \"They defended very well and are in a highly defensive phase at the moment and it works for them at the moment. They did that against [Manchester] City, they did that against Chelsea and they did that tonight.\" The pundit - Iain Dowie \"West Ham defended great tonight. They were disciplined, they were organised. If there's anyone you want the ball to fall to it's Hernandez, and he hits the bar. He should score and then the game's over. Iain Dowie says Arsenal did not do enough to win against West Ham but was very impressed with Jack Wilshere, who started for Arsenal for the first time in the league this season.

There wasn't enough dynamism. Ozil and Sanchez were good in their combination play, but they didn't show enough desire or enough drive, Arsenal. Their passing wasn't good. The one plus, and it was a huge plus, was Jack Wilshere who was very, very good. For me he does more in the team than Ramsey does.\" What's next?

The game looked to be heading towards a stalemate with neither side producing many chances of quality at a wet and windy Turf Moor, but Barnes clinched the victory for the Clarets with his strike in the 89th minute. The three points lifts Sean Dyche's side into the final Champions League spot for at least 24 hours ahead of Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham, who all play on Wednesday evening.

Subs used: Wimmer (6), Choupo-Moting (n/a) Man of the match: Ashley Barnes Stoke, meanwhile, remain in 15th with 16 points and have now lost four of their last five Premier League matches. The Potters began the game well after their 5-1 defeat by Tottenham on Saturday and could have had a goal inside five minutes, but Peter Crouch was unable to latch onto a wayward James Tarkowski clearance at the back post as Burnley 'keeper Nick Pope pushed the ball clear. Pope had his hands on the ball again moments later, this time to collect a strong shot from Kurt Zouma after a Xherdan Shaqiri corner. Team news Burnley named an unchanged XI for the side that beat Watford at the weekend, while Stoke made three changes with Geoff Cameron, Peter Crouch and Ramadan Sobhi coming into the side. The best chance of the first half came in the 28th minute when Shaqiri slipped in Mame Biram Diouf down the right-hand side of the box. The forward got onto the ball, but was closely marked by Tarkowski as his eventual effort skimmed the corner of the crossbar. Burnley grew into the game and ended the first half strongly with a flurry of efforts in the 39th minute. Following a cleared corner, Scott Arfield saw an effort blocked by a melee of bodies in the box before the rebound fell to Johann Berg Gudmundsson, whose curling effort went wide of the goal. It took until the 69th minute for the first real chance of the second half to arrive, with Steven Defour latching onto a poor Kevin Wimmer clearance and taking a touch before unleashing a powerful volley, but it was straight at Stoke 'keeper Butland and he was able to comfortably collect. Jeff Hendrick and Joe Allen battle for the ball in the middle of the park Crouch had the best chance of the half for Stoke in the 87th minute when Diouf's knockdown picked out the striker on the left of the box, but as he went to shoot, Crouch slipped on the slick surface and his effort went just over the crossbar. But it was Barnes who finally found the back of the net two minutes later. Jack Cork played the ball forward to the striker at the top of the box, and he played a one-two with Arfield before powering home past Butland and sending Burnley into fourth spot. Barnes lashes home the Clarets' winner Opta stats Excluding the first two days of this season when not all the teams had played, Burnley last found themselves in the top-flight top-four back on March 21st 1975 (3rd). This is Stoke's worst-ever Premier League campaign after 17 games, with just 16 points accrued. Premier League games at Turf Moor this season have produced just 10 goals in total (in nine games), five fewer than any other ground. Only Manchester United (9) have kept more Premier League clean sheets than the Clarets this season (8). The managers Sean Dyche: \"I've said many times recently, of course it feels good [to be doing well], it feels good for the town and the supporters, but for us it's business that we have to get on with in the next game - they are coming around quickly this week. Sean Dyche says it was an ugly game but was delighted his side kept going - snatching a late winner against Stoke Sean Dyche says it was an ugly game but was delighted his side kept going - snatching a late winner against Stoke \"We stay focused on the task and the next game is the most important one but I'm very pleased with tonight. When you're not playing as well as you can, and the other team are, it's important to find a way to get a result and that's what we've done tonight.\" Mark Hughes: \"Clearly it wasn't the result we wanted and it wasn't the result we deserved in all honesty. We restricted them to very few opportunities, I think their goal was the one clear shot we let them have the whole game.

Of course, a late winner also helps his case and he took it in his stride. He certainly staked a claim for a bigger role in upcoming matches.

Hornets as Palace move out of bottom three 3:01 Crystal Palace 2-1 Watford Crystal Palace 2-1 Watford Crystal Palace moved off the bottom and out of the Premier League relegation zone with a sensational late rally to see off 10-man Watford 2-1 at Selhurst Park. Daryl Janmaat's third-minute goal for the Hornets looked as though it would be decisive, but Tom Cleverley's sending off three minutes from time switched the momentum and Palace substitutes Bakary Sako (89) and James McArthur (90+1) struck to complete the turnaround. Both goals were provided by the dogged Wilfried Zaha, who dazzled once again in front of his home fans in a game where Palace failed to register a shot on target for the first 88 minutes. The victory means Roy Hodgson's side have taken 12 points from their last six home games. Player Ratings Crystal Palace: Speroni (7), Fosu-Mensah (5), Schlupp (6), Milivojevic (6), Tomkins (6), Dann (6), Cabaye (6), Loftus-Cheek (6), Townsend (6), Zaha (9), Benteke (5) Subs: McArthur (7), Sako (7), Van Aanholt (6) Watford: Gomes (6), Janmaat (7), Holebas (6), Kabasele (6), Mariappa (7), Prodl (6), Doucoure (7), Carrillo (7), Cleverley (5), Deeney (6), Richarlison (8) Subs: Pereyra (6), Gray (6), Man of the Match: Wilfried Zaha With the home crowd a bit edgy after the Eagles squandered victory against Bournemouth at the weekend, Watford sensed an opportunity to press high and took the lead inside four minutes. The dangerous Richarlison teased his marker down the left before whipping a lovely ball to the back post where Janmaat was waiting to bullet a header home. Scott Dann guided a header just wide from a Yohan Cabaye corner on 29 minutes but it was Watford, especially through Richarlison, that carried the greater threat. Troy Deeney should have doubled the lead on 31 minutes but shanked the Brazilian's perfect cross wide from just three yards out with the goal gaping. Richarlison on the attack for Watford at Selhurst Park Richarlison found space at the back post on 63 minutes but Julian Speroni - on his 400th appearance for Palace - blocked away his near post effort. Palace were struggling for rhythm and a fightback looked unlikely, although Zaha curled a 20-yard effort inches over with seven minutes to go. Team news Roy Hodgson resisted the urge to drop the out of form Christian Benteke despite his late penalty miss. The only change was Mamadou Sakho because of a calf injury - Scott Dann replaced him. Marvin Zeegelaar missed the game through suspension for Watford - Jose Holebas replaced him while Roberto Pereyra was dropped for Sebastian Prodl. Cleverley, who had already been booked for stopping a Palace counter, then gifted his opponents a boost when hauling down Sako inside his own half to pick up a second yellow. Four minutes later, Watford were - unbelievably - behind as Zaha sparked the fightback. His shot on 89 minutes was parried by Hornets 'keeper Heurelho Gomes, who could only block Sako's rebound back off the player and into the net. Zaha was now a man possessed and, with time ticking down, he picked up the ball down the left, took on two defenders before squaring the ball perfectly for McArthur to roll home from close range. James McArthur with Scott Dann after making it 2-1 It was a winning goal that was only worth three points, but it felt more than that. Man of the match: Wilfried Zaha For 80 minutes the Palace winger cut a frustrated figure on the left wing as he seemed to be trying too hard against a backdrop of boos from the travelling faithful. However, he kept his head when it mattered to completely turn the game in Palace's favour - his assist for the second was world-class, selling Janmaat four step-overs before finding McArthur with a perfect cross. What a hero. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"It wasn't one of our better performances in terms of the quality of our play, but there have been so many games where it's been good and not brought us the three points, so like most football managers I'd rather have the three points irrespective of the performance.\" Roy Hodgson says his side grew in confidence as the game went on Roy Hodgson says his side grew in confidence as the game went on Marco Silva: \"The red card gave them belief but it was clear though they should be playing with 10 players for the foul on Pereyra.

Huddersfield 1-3 Chelsea Huddersfield 1-3 Chelsea Chelsea returned to winning ways with a comfortable 3-1 victory over Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium on Tuesday. Chelsea dominated the first half, and went into the break 2-0 up after Tiemoue Bakayoko's neat finish (23) and Willian's back-post header (43). Pedro made it 3-0 with an effort from 15 yards (50) after the break, and Huddersfield got a consolation in injury time through sub Laurent Depoitre's superb header past Thibaut Courtois (90+2). Willian celebrates his goal with Chelsea team-mates Team news Chelsea went without a recognised striker, with Pedro replacing the injured Morata. Cahill, Zappacosta and Fabregas also made way for Rudiger, Willian and Moses. For Huddersfield, Williams came in to replace Quaner. The result means Chelsea are 11 points behind leaders Man City, who play at Swansea on Wednesday evening. Huddersfield are 12th, five clear of the drop zone. Chelsea, coming off the back of a shock 1-0 defeat at West Ham, had all of the ball in the first half, and were ahead midway through as man-of-the-match Eden Hazard's delightful flick found Willian, who fed Bakayoko to lift over Jonas Lossl. It was 2-0 two minutes before the break through Willian, who headed home at the far post from Marcos Alonso's deep cross after Huddersfield defender Chris Lowe got caught under the ball. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (5), Smith (5), Zanka (5), Schindler (5), Lowe (4), Mooy (5), Hogg (4), Kachunga (5), Williams (5), Ince (5), Mounie (5) Subs: Whitehead (5), Hadergjonaj (5), Depoitre (6) Chelsea: Courtois (7), Moses (6), Azpilicueta (7), Rudiger (6), Christensen (6), Alonso (7), Bakayoko (7), Kante (7), Willian (8), Hazard (9), Pedro (7) Subs: Batshuayi (6), Drinkwater (6), Ampadu (NA) Man of the match: Eden Hazard Antonio Conte's side responded with a win after their weekend defeat at West Ham It should have been 3-0 on the brink of half time, but Lossl did well to deny Pedro, who had been released through on goal by Hazard. But Chelsea did get their third after the break, with Pedro directing the ball into the top corner from 12 yards after Willian had battled to win the ball from a cross. Chelsea goalkeeper Courtois had little to do, but did get the slightest touch on Tom Ince's effort inside the box, before Pedro dragged wide from just inside the box after the impressive Hazard had laid the ball off. Courtois lost his clean sheet with the final meaningful touch of the game, seeing sub Depoitre's superb header fly past him and into the corner of the net from Florent Hadergjonaj's cross. Tiemoue Bakayoko celebrates after giving Chelsea the lead Opta stats Chelsea's win at the John Smith's Stadium means the Blues have won at 50 different stadiums in the Premier League; only Liverpool have won at more stadiums in the competition (53). Huddersfield have lost five of their last six Premier League games (W1), conceding two or more in all five of those losses. Chelsea have scored 10 headed goals in the Premier League this season (a league high) - they only scored eight in the entirety of last season. Marcos Alonso has had a hand in 13 goals since his Chelsea debut (nine goals, four assists); two more than any other Premier League defender. Elias Kachunga handles the ball under pressure from Marcos Alonso The managers David Wagner: \"They didn't need to invest much into the first goal, it was a goal that we gave away, and the same with the second, we gave two easy goals away. \"They were good, no doubt about it, the bigger problem is we haven't over-performed. I think we performed on an average level, we didn't under-perform, but we didn't over-perform.\" Antonio Conte: \"When you have a competitor like City and every game they are winning, it is very difficult to think you can fight for the title. \"We must be realistic and tell the truth. I prefer to tell the truth than a good lie. I am like this and sometimes I can be too honest but I like to speak very honestly with my players and with our fans also.\" Man of the match - Eden Hazard This was Hazard at his very best, but more notably, at his unselfish best. So unselfish in fact, that he insisted Willian took his man of the match award after the game. Willian celebrates with Eden Hazard after scoring Fantasy Football players would be forgiven for suspecting Hazard had captained his team-mate Willian this game week, such was the frequency in which the Belgian found his team-mate in the final third. Hazard's flick opened up space for the opening goal for Bakayoko, and he continued the trick throughout the game, with Huddersfield struggling to cope with his turn of pace. Willian ended up with a goal and two assists, but Hazard was the star of the show off paper, also winning eight of his 10 tackles, more than any other Chelsea player.

Charlie Austin's fourth goal in four games gave the hosts an early lead (3) after Per Mertesacker's loose pass gifted Southampton possession. Petr Cech prevented Austin from scoring a quick-fire second, before Fraser Forster kept Arsenal at bay down the other end with a superb stop from Aaron Ramsey. Southampton were then punished for a number of missed opportunities after the break when substitute Giroud headed in from Alexis Sanchez's cross in the 88th minute. The point leaves Arsenal trailing behind Liverpool in fifth and one point above Tottenham, while Southampton move up to 10th in the Premier League table.

Nacho Monreal, Laurent Koscielny and Charlie Austin all look towards the linesman after Southampton's opener Austin could have had a second two minutes later, but his low strike across goal was kept out by Cech. An end-to-end affair then saw Alexandre Lacazette force Forster to make a decent save before the Southampton 'keeper superbly kept out Ramsey's effort. Team news Southampton brought Maya Yoshida, Jack Stephens, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Nathan Redmond into the side, while Arsenal's only change was Per Mertesacker in for the injured Shkodran Mustafi. Just before the break, Hector Bellerin picked out Lacazette in the middle, but the Frenchman could only fire over before being wiped out by Maya Yoshida - though the incident went unpunished by referee Bobby Madley. Ryan Bertrand misses a chance to make it 2-0 to Southampton And while Arsenal dominated play in the second half, it was Oriol Romeu whose long-distance strike clipped the bar for Southampton before Ryan Bertrand agonisingly chipped a ball beyond Cech but wide of the mark. Arsene Wenger then called on Giroud - who is yet to start a Premier League game this season - to save Arsenal, and the Frenchman duly answered the call when glancing a header into the far corner, in what was his 17th league goal as an Arsenal substitute. Olivier Giroud celebrates his late equaliser Opta stats Southampton have only lost one of their last seven home Premier League games against Arsenal (W2 D4). Charlie Austin has scored eight goals in his last 11 Premier League starts for Southampton, including four in his last three. Since the start of 2014-15, only five Englishmen have scored more Premier League goals than Charlie Austin (30). No player has scored more substitute goals for a single Premier League team than Olivier Giroud - level with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Man Utd (17). Indeed, only Jermain Defoe (23) has scored more substitute goals overall in the competition than Giroud (17). 10 - No team has gained more points from losing positions in the Premier League this season than Arsenal (10 - level with Man City).

The Dane had more touches than any other Southampton player, while eight clearances - the most of anyone on the pitch - and a joint-high three interceptions helped the Saints' cause, which fell just short in the dying minutes. The managers Manuel Pellegrino: \"At the beginning the feeling is that we have conceded at the end again, as it was more or less the same against City but it is different because we played a good game, showed intelligence and we got a point. \"Against this team you have to play close to excellent, because they don't need too many actions to create problems but in both aspects, attacking and defending, we were intelligent and focused from beginning until the end. \"It's a good reference for the future and in three days we have another opportunity. Hopefully we can continue in this way.\" Arsene Wenger was also left frustrated with Southampton's perceived time-wasting in the second half Arsene Wenger: \"[Giroud] is important - why should we lose an important player? It is up to us [and not him]. \"He will start more games. I believe as well it's always the same when you have many good players, some of them cannot play. \"The question you get is always why does the guy who is good not play?

Receiving the ball on the right, Salah outmuscled Cuco Martina and then evaded Idrissa Gueye, before curling a beauty past Jordan Pickford from 15 yards with his left foot. Team news Jurgen Klopp surprised many by making five changes; Solanke started up front, while Coutinho was on the bench. Oxlade-Chamberlain, Klavan, Mane and Gomez also came in for Firmino, Can, Alexander-Arnold and Wijnaldum. For Everton, Niasse replaced Lennon. Liverpool players congratulate Mohamed Salah after he makes it 1-0 It should have been 2-0 before the break as Sadio Mane broke with Liverpool four on two, but he sliced wide instead of squaring to one of his three team-mates in space. Salah nearly scored his second after the break, heading James Milner's centre back across goal and inches wide of the far post, before Joe Gomez headed just over from a corner. But with a rare attack, the visitors were level. Rooney's superb diagonal over Lovren and into the path of Calvert-Lewin saw the Liverpool man connect with the forward in the box, and though Calvert-Lewin went down easily, Craig Pawson pointed to the spot. Rooney stepped up, and struck straight down the middle to save an unlikely point for Everton. Liverpool piled on the pressure for the last 15 minutes, but will be kicking themselves at two points dropped as Everton held firm. Mohamed Salah (not pictured) curls his effort beyond Jordan Pickford to make it 1-0 to Liverpool The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"I cannot, cannot believe that in a game like this, where only one team is trying over 95 minutes to do everything to win it, and the other team… was not even in our box, I'm not sure if they even had a shot on target, except from the penalty. And you open the door for them like this, it's in my understanding not OK. \"I saw only one team playing today, but the ref thought we have to make it a little bit more… I can't believe this situation, with all the challenges, we were completely clean. We don't make any fouls.\" Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp gave a furious interview to Sky Sports after the game Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp gave a furious interview to Sky Sports after the game Sam Allardyce: \"I have looked at it, and he [Dejan Lovren] has pushed him, but we have seen ones like that before where it has been difficult for the referee to give it. He [Pawson] did give it, and Wayne Rooney has put it away. \"At the end of the day, some you get and some you don't. I have had a look at it and I think it is a penalty. \"There is no such thing as a soft penalty. If you ask [referee's chief] Mike Riley there is no such thing. He [Lovren] has either impeded or stopped our player in the box from trying to score.\" Everton boss Sam Allardyce praised his side's defensive performance and said referee Craig Pawson 'was brave' Everton boss Sam Allardyce praised his side's defensive performance and said referee Craig Pawson 'was brave' Man of the match - Jonjoe Kenny In a game where Liverpool camped in Everton's half, young Kenny had a job on his hands dealing with the hosts' full-backs and wingers. He did an admirable job, and though Liverpool did routinely get in-behind Cuco Martina, Kenny was often on hand to clear in the area alongside Ashley Williams and Mason Holgate. The Liverpool-born 20-year-old also made nine clearances and gained possession a joint-high seven times. Opta stats Liverpool have equalled their longest-ever unbeaten run against Everton in all competitions, 15 games, set between March 1972 and April 1978. Everton have lost just one of their last six Premier League games (W3 D2), after losing six of the eight before that (W1 D1). The Toffees posted a 21 per cent possession figure in the game, their lowest-ever in a Premier League match since 2003/04 (when Opta started recording possession). Wayne Rooney has scored five goals in his last six Premier League starts against Liverpool. What's next Liverpool now host West Brom on Wednesday night in the Premier League, before a trip to Bournemouth on Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League from 4.15pm. Everton go to Newcastle on Wednesday, and then host Swansea next Monday Night Football, again live on Sky Sports Premier League."}, {"date": "10/12/2018", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74847,

1-2 Man City Manchester City clinched a record 14th consecutive top-flight victory in the sweetest possible manner with a 2-1 win over rivals Manchester United at Old Trafford. David Silva and Nicolas Otamendi scored the goals as Pep Guardiola's men opened up an ominous 11-point lead at the top of the Premier League with victory in the 175th Manchester derby. Marcus Rashford had punished a defensive lapse from Otamendi and Fabian Delph in first-half stoppage-time, but United were unable to find a second as a stunning double save from Ederson denied Romelu Lukaku and Juan Mata from snatching a point. United's third defeat of the season brings their 40-match unbeaten home run to an end while strengthening City's grip on the title after just 16 matches. Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (7), Rojo (5), Smalling (5), Valencia (5), Young (5), Herrera (5), Matic (5), Lingard (6), Rashford (6), Martial (5), Lukaku (4). Subs: Lindelof (4), Mata (4), Ibrahimovic (4). Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Kompany (6), Otamendi (6), Delph (5), Fernandinho (6), Silva (8), Sterling (6), De Bruyne (8), Jesus (6), Sane (6). Subs: Mangala (6), B.Silva (5), Gundogan (5). Man of the Match: Kevin de Bruyne. With an eight-point gap to bridge ahead of kick-off, the emphasis was on United to go after their neighbours, but the hosts spent the majority of the first half chasing a slick City side on the trail of a record 14th consecutive top-flight victory. Tame efforts from Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus and a deflected Silva effort drew David de Gea into comfortable saves, but City remained dominant against an anxious United outfit who rarely ventured out of their own half. De Gea had to be alert to tip Leroy Sane's near-post drive over on 42 minutes but, from the resulting corner, his defences were breached as Silva hooked the ball home from six yards after Lukaku failed to clear Kevin De Bruyne's delivery. Man City have won their last 14 league games in a row – the most by a team in a single English top-flight season Man City have won their last 14 league games in a row – the most by a team in a single English top-flight season Anthony Martial registered their first attempt on goal a minute later before a defensive lapse from Otamendi and Delph allowed Rashford to undo City's hard work with a welcomed equaliser for the hosts. United returned after the interval buoyant as their front four grew into the game, but City restored their lead within nine minutes as Lukaku's poor clearance struck Chris Smalling and fell for Otamendi, who found the net for the second game running. Team news Ander Herrera came in for the suspended Paul Pogba while Victor Lindelof dropped out as United switched to a back four to accommodate Marcus Rashford in attack. Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho returned after City’s late victory over West Ham, while Gabriel Jesus was preferred to Sergio Aguero. Jesse Lingard threaded Lukaku through on goal on 66 minutes but the Belgian failed to atone for his error as he fired over. His compatriot, De Bruyne, meanwhile did find the target two minutes later, but De Gea produced a fine save low to his right. Zlatan Ibrahimovic entered the fray on 79 minutes and United pushed for an equaliser, but two point-blank saves from City stopper Ederson clinched a potentially defining victory in the race for the title. Opta stats Man City have won their last 14 league games in a row - the most by a team in a single English top-flight season. This was just the second time a team has scored more than one goal in the Premier League at Old Trafford against Jose Mourinho's Manchester United. Jose Mourinho has lost nine matches in all competitions against Pep Guardiola, more than against any other manager. Manchester United posted a 35% possession figure, their lowest at Old Trafford in the Premier League since 2003/04. Nicolas Otamendi has netted four goals in 15 Premier League games this season, after scoring just two in his 60 games in the competition across the previous two campaigns. Romelu Lukaku has scored just five goals in his last 40 Premier League appearances against the 'big six'. Man of the Match - Kevin De Bruyne Manchester City are now 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League On a record-breaking outing for Manchester City, their Belgian midfielder's influence was telling. City dominated possession from the get-go and chief to their superiority was the relentless pressing from De Bruyne, who ensured United could not get back into the game. When called upon, his final ball was typically flawless, leading to Lukaku's errors in the build-up to Silva's opener. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"The referee made a mistake - it can happen. I feel sorry for Michael Oliver… Clear penalty. I am sorry for us, sorry for Michael [Oliver], I think he had a good performance, but it's a clear penalty. I think they are a very good team, I think they are lucky, I think [they] have all the decisions in their favour, probably yes.\" Jose Mourinho felt his United side should have been awarded a penalty for a foul on Ander Herrera Jose Mourinho felt his United side should have been awarded a penalty for a foul on Ander Herrera Pep Guardiola: \"The personality to play here is what I want. We can play this way in England. People said we couldn't play the way we did in Barcelona in England but it is possible and we did it. I'm happy to go to Stamford Bridge and Old Trafford and to beat them in this way. This win means a lot in the way we played for our confidence. In December it's impossible to be champions but it's good for us.\" Pep Guardiola was delighted with his City side's performance and says he always knew his team could play how he wanted in English football Pep Guardiola was delighted with his City side's performance and says he always knew his team could play how he wanted in English football The pundit Gary Neville: \"I thought City were a different level to United. The goals were scruffy, and Jose won't believe they've conceded two goals from set pieces, but not many teams have come here in the last 25 or 30 years and dominated like that. You are talking about Barcelona or Real Madrid. Not many teams come here and do that. \"I even saw some United fans at the end clapping off the City manager and players. Seventy thousand United fans have walked out of there today thinking the best team have won. You can't have too many complaints. It could have been three or four in the end.\" What's next? United will look to get back to winning ways when they host Bournemouth at Old Trafford on Wednesday, while City go in search of a 15th straight top-flight victory when they travel to Swansea on the same evening."}, {"date": "09/12/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56953, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals":

"2:59 West Ham 1-0 Chelsea West Ham 1-0 Chelsea Antonio Conte's dismal London derby form continued as West Ham beat Chelsea 1-0 to hand David Moyes his first victory as Hammers boss. Moyes' landmark victory was sealed by Marko Arnautovic, who fired his first goal for the club with just six minutes on the clock at the London Stadium. Alvaro Morata and Eden Hazard spurned chances to rescue a point but the hosts clung on as Conte suffered his ninth league defeat at Chelsea - five of which have now come at the hands of London rivals. Arnautovic makes it 1-0 to West Ham West Ham remain in the relegation zone but a first win in nine gives them a timely boost ahead of the busy festive period. Just as they did in last week's encouraging defeat at Manchester City, West Ham took the lead as Arnautovic played a one-two with Manuel Lanzini and slotted his first Hammers goal beyond Thibaut Courtois on six minutes. Player ratings West Ham: Adrian (8), Zabaleta (7), Reid (8), Ogbonna (7), Cresswell (7), Lanzini (8), Noble (7), Obiang (7), Masuaku (8), Arnautovic (8), Antonio (8). Subs: Sakho (5), Ayew (5). Chelsea: Courtois (6), Azpilicueta (6), Cahill (5), Christensen (5), Zappacosta (5), Kante (6), Fabregas (5), Bakayoko (5), Alonso (5), Hazard (5), Morata (5). Subs: Moses (5), Willian (5), Pedro (5). Man of the Match: Marko Arnautovic. Chelsea went on to dominate possession but had to wait until 29 minutes to register their first substantial attempts on goal as N'Golo Kante and Davide Zappacosta drew saves in quick succession from Adrian. Conte wasted no time in changing his misfiring attack as Pedro, Victor Moses and Willian came on within 19 minutes of the restart. Adrian celebrates after Arnautovic gave West Ham a 1-0 lead But it was West Ham came close to finding the net as Arnautovic and the relentless Michail Antonio posed the greater threat on the counter. A fatigued Hammers side dropped deeper and deeper as the game wore on, inviting pressure as Chelsea pushed for an equaliser. Team news David Moyes made four changes, bringing in goalkeeper Adrian, Winston Reid, Mark Noble and Marko Arnautovic. Antonio Conte, meanwhile, made three as Gary Cahill, Davide Zappacosta and Tiemoue Bakayoko returned. But, having been played in by Kante, Morata fired a glorious chance wide on 84 minutes before Hazard shot over a minute later as the Blues failed to keep pace with the two Manchester clubs. Opta stats Chelsea have already dropped 16 points in their 16 Premier League games this season - they only dropped 21 in the whole of 2016/17 season. This was David Moyes' first Premier League home victory as a manager in just under a year (December 17, 2016; Sunderland 1-0 Watford) and ended a run of 11 successive league home games without a win (W0 D5 L6). Five of Antonio Conte’s nine Premier League defeats at Chelsea have been in London derbies (Crystal Palace x2, Arsenal, Tottenham & West Ham) Marko Arnautovic became the 140th different player to score a Premier League goal (excl. own goals) for West Ham; only Spurs (142) have seen a higher number of players score for them in the competition. Arnautovic also became the 43rd different player to both score for and against West Ham in the Premier League; a higher tally than any other club in the competition. This was the 100th Premier League win that Mark Noble has played in for West Ham; the first player to reach this landmark for the club. Reaction from Arnautovic after he scored the only goal of the game against Chelsea Reaction from Arnautovic after he scored the only goal of the game against Chelsea The managers David Moyes: \"The win was the biggest thing. To get a win in the Premier League is really hard especially against the champions.

In my previous experience, when you lose four games in a season, it's impossible to stay and fight for the title. \"In 16 games and to lose four, it means that a target must be another. If you want to stay in the race for the title in the first part of the season you can only lose once or twice.\" Antonio Conte bemoaned his side's missed opportunities as they fell to defeat at West Ham in the Premier League Antonio Conte bemoaned his side's missed opportunities as they fell to defeat at West Ham in the Premier League The pundit Jamie Redknapp: \"They [West Ham] should be playing like this week in, week out.

Zeegelaar was dismissed in the 39th minute at a snowy Turf Moor for a two-footed tackle on Steven Defour. Scott Arfield's cool finish put Burnley ahead on the stroke of half-time and Watford could not get back into the game despite a spirited second-half showing. The win sees Burnley stay seventh in the table, but they now have a six-point lead over eighth-placed Watford, whose head coach Marco Silva was involved in lengthy discussions with referee Lee Probert at half-time and full-time.

Burnley eventually settled and Johann Gudmundsson saw a free-kick well saved by Heurelho Gomes. Abdoulaye Doucoure was denied by Nick Pope at the other end, but the main talking point of the first half came in the 39th minute as Zeegelaar was sent off for a two-footed tackle on Defour. Troy Deeney is challenged by James Tarkowski Arfield, starting for the first time since October 21 because of Robbie Brady's injury, soon made the numerical advantage count with a composed finish from Gudmundsson's pass across the box. But the visitors produced a determined performance in the second half, with Doucoure and Tom Cleverley both missing the target with shots from the edge of the box after the restart. Team news Both sides made two changes. Mee and Brady missed out with injury for Burnley so Long and Arfield started. Janmaat and Carrillo came in for Femenia and Prodl for Watford. Burnley twice had the ball in the net but both Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes were flagged for offside, the latter a decision that was upheld by the referee after a discussion with his assistant. Silva remained an animated figure on the sideline as the Hornets two saw penalty appeals turned away, and he also vented his frustration after a foul on Richarlison, before another discussion with the referee after the final whistle. Opta stats This was Burnley's 34th Premier League win and the 25th of those to have been won by a single goal margin (74%). There have only been nine goals scored in eight Premier League games at Turf Moor this season (six for Burnley, three for their opponents) - fewer than at any other ground. Three of the eight red cards to have been given before half-time this season in the Premier League have come against Burnley. Watford have now been given seven red cards in the Premier League since the start of 2016-17; no side have more (level with West Ham United). The only Canadians to have scored more Premier League goals than Scott Arfield (5) are Tomasz Radzinski (35) and Junior Hoilett (13). The managers Sean Dyche: \"It's a very good win in the end. We had two goals chalked off, which were big decisions, and we didn't get the rub of the green on them, but it was a deserved victory.\" Sean Dyche was extremely happy with Burnley's win Sean Dyche was extremely happy with Burnley's win Marco Silva: \"After one decision the referee made a big difference in the match, a big influence, and it was a harsh decision for me. It's not a red, that changed everything, and after two or three minutes they scored.The referee never had control of the match and he lost it with the moment when he made the mistake. I understand I can make mistakes and so can our players, and the referee can too, but he made a big mistake and that had a big influence.\" Marco Silva said the wrong decisions were made Marco Silva said the wrong decisions were made Man of the match - Johann Gudmundsson In a game of few clear chances for Burnley, it was Gudmundsson who looked their biggest threat. Not only did he set up the goal with a pass across the box, but he went close to scoring himself with a free-kick that was well saved by Gomes and a shot that was pushed away in the second half. He also put in 10 crosses - five more than any other Burnley player - and continued to provide a good outlet for the Clarets. .@BurnleyOfficial's Johann Berg Gudmundsson has now contributed 5 PL assists this season.

were held to a dramatic 2-2 draw by Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday. Benteke had the chance to win it for relegation-threatened Palace in injury time, but saw his spot-kick saved by Asmir Begovic as his 12-game goal drought continued. There were four goals during an entertaining first half as Jermain Defoe gave Bournemouth the lead from a well-worked corner (10) for his 200th career league goal, before Luka Milivojevic levelled from the penalty spot (41). Jermain Defoe celebrates after scoring the opening goal Player ratings Crystal Palace: Speroni (5), Fosu-Mensah (5), Tomkins (5), Sakho (NA), Schlupp (5), Loftus-Cheek (6), Cabaye (6), Townsend (5), Milivojevic (6), Zaha (7), Benteke (5) Subs: Dann (6), McArthur (5), Sako (NA) Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Francis (6), Steve Cook (6), Ake (6), Daniels (6), Stanislas (6), Lewis Cook (6), Surman (7), Fraser (7), King (6), Defoe (8) Subs: Ibe (6), Wilson (NA), Afobe (NA) Man of the match: Jermain Defoe Palace were ahead moments later through sub Scott Dann's close-range finish (44), but Defoe equalised on the stroke of half-time with a stunning half-volley from an acute angle (45+3). Palace handed Benteke the spot-kick, despite Milivojevic still being on the pitch, and his miss means Palace drop to bottom of the Premier League, two points from safety, while Bournemouth are 14th, three above the drop zone. Both sides attacked freely in the first half, but it was Bournemouth who went ahead against the run of play through Defoe's tidy finish from 12 yards after Andrew Surman's well-worked short corner, though Palace felt Jeffrey Schlupp was pulled back by Josh King in the build-up. Team news Following the 0-0 draw with West Brom, Palace made three changes; Ward, Kelly and McArthur made way, Fosu-Mensah, Tomkins and Cabaye are in.There was just the one change for visitors, as Steve Cook replaced the suspended Smith. Wilfried Zaha look dejected after a missed chance for Palace Benteke saw a shot well saved by Begovic shortly after, before Mamadou Sakho failed to bundle the ball home from close range, but it was 1-1 on 41 minutes as Milivojevic superbly tucked away a spot-kick after Wilfried Zaha was brought down by Begovic. Sub Dann finished off at the far post from Yohan Cabaye's centre three minutes later to make it 2-1, but Defoe equalised shortly after with a stunning looped half-volley from an acute angle after Lewis Cook's long ball. Defoe miscued in the box near the hour mark as he searched for a hat-trick, while at the other end Dann missed a clear chance for his second, poking over the bar from close range after Benteke's flick. Begovic tipped away Ruben Loftus-Cheek's long-range effort, and Milivojevic poked wide in space from 10 yards, but Palace were handed three points on a plate when Charlie Daniels brought down Zaha in the box, though replays showed the Bournemouth man got something on the ball. Benteke stepped up instead of Milivojevic, and went too close to Begovic, who beat away his poor penalty. Benteke hasn't scored in 12 games for Palace Opta stats Crystal Palace have drawn three consecutive games in the Premier League for the first time since May 2005, while managed by Iain Dowie. Bournemouth have dropped 10 points from winning positions in the Premier League this term; a joint high alongside Watford and West Brom (also 10). Christian Benteke has missed three of his five penalties for Crystal Palace in the Premier League, including each of the last two. Scott Dann is the first central defender to score in four consecutive Premier League games against the same opponent. Josh King moves away from Yohan Cabaye on Saturday The managers Roy Hodgson: \"I am frustrated, especially when you see a penalty missed in the last minutes of the game, by someone who has not been designated as a penalty taker, but has decided at the last minute that he is the man to take the penalty. \"I think if you do that you've really got to score it, or you risk the wrath of a lot of people, not least of all your manager, coaches and team-mates.\" Roy Hodgson says he is extremely frustrated with Benteke's decision to take the penalty Roy Hodgson says he is extremely frustrated with Benteke's decision to take the penalty Eddie Howe: \"The second goal is just incredible. Lewis Cook's ball is brilliantly weighted, and Jermain still had a lot to do. His finish was of the highest quality. Great run, and unbelievable technique to get the ball over Speroni from that distance, and that angle, top class.\" Eddie Howe praised Defoe for his fine second goal Eddie Howe praised Defoe for his fine second goal Man of the match - Jermain Defoe In case there was ever any doubt, Defoe has still got it. He was at his best at Selhurst Park, scoring his 200th league goal in trademark fashion, his first real sniff of the game. But his 201st was simply stunning; receiving the ball on the bounce from a seemingly impossible angle, he put it in the only place he could, looping over Julian Speroni. He hasn't been given too much playing time this season, but the 35-year-old proved he is far from losing that Midas touch in front of goal. What's next?

Brighton failed to test Jonas Lossl in the first half, and they found themselves two-down just before the break when Mounie's header squeezed past Mat Ryan. Steve Mounie celebrates his second for Huddersfield Tom Ince searched in vain for his first goal of the season, as he scuffed one attempt before Ryan produced a brilliant stop from point-blank range to deny the winger. Team news Chris Lowe, Jonathan Hogg and Steve Mounie came in for Huddersfield, with Danny Williams and Laurent Depoitre dropping to the bench and Scott Malone not in the squad. Markus Suttner and Ezequiel Schelotto both started for Brighton, while there was no place in the matchday squad for Anthony Knockaert or Gaetan Bong. Mounie then snatched at an effort in search of his hat-trick, before Tommy Smith bent an effort narrowly wide of the far post. Ince fired over as Huddersfield continued to press, while Brighton's first attempt on goal came after 79 minutes when substitute Jose Izquierdo fired a speculative effort straight at Jonas Lossl. Glenn Murray then handed Lossl another comfortable save one minute later, and there was still time for Ince to be denied by Ryan once more, with the Australia international parrying away his powerful drive. Opta stats Huddersfield have won three of their last four home games in the Premier League, with the only defeat in this run coming against first-placed Manchester City. This was the first clash between Huddersfield and Brighton in the top-flight, while Huddersfield have won both debut meetings in the first (2-0) and second division (3-2). The 2-0 win for Terriers was their first Premier League home victory by more than a one-goal margin. Brighton have conceded seven goals in their last two Premier League games, as many they had in their previous nine games in the competition beforehand. Man of the match - Steve Mounie Having battled for a place in Huddersfield's XI since returning from a heel injury, Mounie took his opportunity in some style when handed just his second start in eight matches. Steve Mounie scored his first goals since the opening day of the Premier League season The striker knew little about the first, while his header was then fortunate to squeeze past Ryan for his second, but it will be a timely boost of confidence for the 23-year-old ahead of the festive period. The managers David Wagner: \"I'm very happy and proud. The mood is different than it has been in the last few weeks. I'm delighted because the players played independent from the circumstance we were in. \"We said we have to be focused on ourselves, on our game plan, on the players' talent, and this is what they have shown today. David Wagner says Huddersfield's 2-0 win against Brighton was the right result and he is very proud of the way his side performed. David Wagner says Huddersfield's 2-0 win against Brighton was the right result and he is very proud of the way his side performed. \"We were on the front foot from the first second. We created a lot of good opportunities and it was a deserved result.\" Chris Hughton: \"Wherever you play in this division, if you give them the leg-up of two goals, it's difficult to come back from that. \"It was better in the second half, where we showed we could be a threat, but we have to stop conceding the type of goals we have done. \"The first goal from a corner was one we know that they do, and once it goes in it gives them the left they need and gets the crowd going. We hadn't done ourselves any favours.\" Chris Hughton says he is disappointed Brighton conceded poor goals and didn't play to their usual level, following his side's 2-0 defeat at Huddersfield. Chris Hughton says he is disappointed Brighton conceded poor goals and didn't play to their usual level, following his side's 2-0 defeat at Huddersfield. What's next?

from Wilfried Bony secured a 1-0 win for Swansea against fellow relegation candidates West Brom at the Liberty Stadium to lift them off the foot of the Premier League table. In a game lacking quality in the final third, the winner nine minutes from time was a scrappy one as Bony rifled home a shot from close-range following a goalmouth scramble. Substitute Tammy Abraham should have wrapped up the win for his side when he chipped the ball wide when clean through on goal, but his miss did not prove to be costly in the end. Swansea's first Premier League win since October sees them leapfrog Crystal Palace into 19th place while West Brom are now just one point above them in 17th.

Swansea had the only real opening before the break when Jake Livermore glanced a header onto the foot of his own post from Tom Carroll's free-kick, before Alfie Mawson nodded over the top from Wayne Routledge's cross moments later. With both sides in need of three points, the game opened up slightly in the second half and while West Brom shaded possession, Swansea had the better chances, with Jordan Ayew going close 15 minutes from time with a shot that brought a sprawling save from Ben Foster. Team news Paul Clement made four changes to his Swansea side with Roque Mesa, Tom Carroll, Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge, coming into the side in place of Leroy Fer, Tammy Abraham, Jordan Ayew and Sam Clucas. Alan Pardew made just one alteration to his West Brom team with the injured Gareth Barry making way for Claudio Yacob in midfield. The hosts piled on the pressure late on in search of a goal and eventually got it on 81 minutes. Ki Sung-yueng's inviting corner from the left was met by Abraham whose header was blocked by Allan Nyom on the line but the ball bounced kindly to Bony who lashed his shot into the roof of the net. 2 - Wilfried Bony has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since December 2014 (also for Swansea City). Wild. pic.twitter.com/yZrxwBvh4Z — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 9, 2017 Bony's goal led to Clement dashing from his technical area and down the touchline in celebration but the Swansea manager would have been relieved that his side didn't concede almost straightaway as Salomon Rondon inexplicably headed over from James McClean's cross just a minute later. Swansea should have made sure of the points in stoppage time as Abraham raced through on goal but he dinked his effort over Foster and wide of the post with Luciano Narsingh screaming for a pass across goal that would have left him with a tap-in but it didn't matter as they held on for a vital win. Opta Stats The Swans ended a run of seven Premier League games without a win (D1 L6). The Baggies are now winless in their last 14 Premier League matches (D7 L7), their longest run in the top flight since a 16 game streak between February 2006 and August 2008. Wilfried Bony has scored two goals in his last two Premier League games - as many as he had in his previous 28 in the competition. Swansea had three shots on target in this match - only twice have they managed more in a Premier League game this season (4 vs Newcastle and Leicester). After having the first shot on target in the 22nd minute of this match, the Baggies didn't register another one in the entire match. The managers Paul Clement: \"The most important thing today was that we got the result. We really needed those three points and fortunately we were able to get them. Swansea boss Paul Clement says his side need to kick on after their win over West Brom in the Premier League Swansea boss Paul Clement says his side need to kick on after their win over West Brom in the Premier League \"We've had a lot of games where we've been on the wrong end of a one goal deficit and fortunately today it went in our favour.\" Alan Pardew: \"We struggled to create clear-cut chances but we had three or four great opportunities on the break but we didn't take them and we lacked a bit of conviction. West Brom boss Alan Pardew says he can't fault the commitment of his players but that the team is lacking quality after defeat at Swansea West Brom boss Alan Pardew says he can't fault the commitment of his players but that the team is lacking quality after defeat at Swansea \"The team is looking for a spark from an offensive player, a little bit of something special, the organisation of the team and the commitment of the players was good but we can't say that every week, we need to score goals.\" Man of the match - Wilfried Bony The Swansea skipper barely had a touch in the first half, but when it mattered most he delivered, smashing a shot emphatically into the roof of the net to hand his side a crucial three points. It was Bony's second goal in as many games and if he can carry on his goalscoring form in the coming weeks, Swansea might just be able to clamber up the table and away from danger. What's next? Swansea have a tricky game coming up as they host league leaders Manchester City at the Liberty on Wednesday before travelling to Merseyside to take on Everton in Monday Night Football on December 18th. West Brom, meanwhile, face Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday and then Manchester United at the Hawthorns on Super Sunday on December 17th."}, {"date": "09/12/2018", "arena": "Wembley Stadium",

Stoke at Wembley Harry Kane scored twice as Tottenham thrashed Stoke 5-1 at Wembley to move above Arsenal into fifth. Ryan Shawcross' own goal (21) put Spurs ahead midway through the first half and Heung-Min Son doubled the lead soon after the break (53) before Kane added two more (54, 65) and Christian Eriksen made it five (74). Shawcross did manage to grab a consolation at the other end with 10 minutes remaining but, remarkably, this was still the fourth time in a row that Stoke have lost to Tottenham by four clear goals. The result moves Spurs above rivals Arsenal and into fifth on goal difference, while Stoke drop to 15th. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (5); Trippier (7), Dier (6), Vertonghen (6), Davies (7); Winks (7), Dembele (7); Eriksen (7), Alli (7), Son (9); Kane (8).

Subs: Crouch (6), Cameron (6), Afellay (6). Man of the Match: Heung-Min Son The gulf between the sides was not obvious in the early stages but when Son sent in a cross after 21 minutes, Shawcross could only divert it beyond Jack Butland. Kane spurned a glorious chance to double the lead soon after, missing the target when clean through, but Stoke fell apart early in the second half and were completely blown away. Ryan Shawcross put the ball into his own net at Wembley to open the scoring Son finished emphatically after latching onto Dele Alli's poked pass behind the Stoke defence and Butland's sloppiness from the restart almost gifted Kane a goal straight after when he narrowly avoided being dispossessed. Kane did not have to wait long, heading in from Ben Davies' cross and the striker put his side four up when he slotted home left-footed for his 12th Premier League goal of the season. Team news Tottenham made one change from the draw at Watford as Harry Winks came in for the suspended Davinson Sanchez. Stoke made two changes from the team that beat Swansea with Kevin Wimmer replacing the injured Bruno Martins Indi and teenage full-back Tom Edwards coming in for veteran striker Peter Crouch. Stoke continued to look vulnerable and the brilliant Son punished them on the counter-attack by feeding Eriksen to make it five as Spurs threatened to really embarrass the visitors. Instead, it was Hugo Lloris who erred, missing his punch to allow Shawcross a consolation, but this was still yet another miserable day for Stoke against their least favourite opponents. Opta stats Tottenham have become the first team in top-flight history to win four consecutive games against the same opponent by four or more goals. Harry Kane has scored eight Premier League goals against Stoke, only against Leicester City has he scored more in the competition (9). Kane scored his 90th Premier League goal in just his 131st game - only Alan Shearer (113 games) did so quicker. This was the first time a Stoke player had ever scored at both ends in a Premier League game. The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"Today I think we were clinical in front of goal. I think we created a lot of chances and everyone was very good. Mauricio Pochettino says his side were clinical in seeing off Stoke Mauricio Pochettino says his side were clinical in seeing off Stoke \"I am happy because the most important thing today was the victory and the three points after a few games where we didn't get the result that we deserved. But today the team played well and it was a great victory that was important for the next few games.\" Mark Hughes: \"The talk at half-time was all about making sure we stayed in the game and at some point we felt we'd get the opportunity to get back on level terms. Mark Hughes lamented Stoke's second-half collapse at Wembley Mark Hughes lamented Stoke's second-half collapse at Wembley \"Obviously that mind-set went out the window when we conceded very, very poorly and too easily on two occasions very early on in the second half. And from that point onwards, it was always going to be a difficult afternoon.\" Man of the match - Heung-Min Son Son was the brightest player from the outset, troubling teenage full-back Tom Edwards who was making only his second Premier League appearance. The South Korea international was the architect of the first goal and the scorer of the second in a superb display. Late on in the game he led the counter-attack to set up Eriksen for Tottenham's fifth goal and when he left the pitch soon after to a standing ovation, it was fully deserved. What's next? Stoke are on the road again as soon as Tuesday as they head north to face Burnley, while Tottenham have another home fixture at Wembley as they play host to Brighton for the first time in the Premier

Park on Saturday evening. Joselu, brought back into the starting line-up by Rafa Benitez, only needed four minutes to justify his selection, as he stroked the ball home to give Newcastle a fourth minute lead, before Riyad Mahrez fired home from 25 yards to level 16 minutes later. After the break, Leicester continued in the ascendancy, and took the lead for the first time in the match on the hour mark after Demarai Gray's strike was deflected home - Gray's third goal in seven under Claude Puel. Dwight Gayle levelled things up, with the aid of another deflection in the 73rd minute, but Newcastle were carved open once more late on, with Perez's 86th minute own goal, as he tried to prevent Shinji Okazaki scoring, ensuring Newcastle slipped to a sixth defeat in seven, which leaves them just two points above the relegation zone in 16th, while Leicester's improvement under Puel continued as they climbed to eighth in the Premier League table with victory. Player ratings Newcastle: Darlow (5), Clarke (5), Yedlin (5), Manquillo (5), Lejeune (6), Hayden (6), Merino (6), Ritchie (6), Murphy (5), Gayle (6), Joselu (6). Subs: Perez (4) , Atsu (5), Mitrovic (N/A). Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (6), Chilwell (6), Morgan (6), Maguire (7), Ndidi (7), Gray (8), Albrighton (7), Iborra (7), Mahrez (7), Vardy (6). Subs: Okazaki (6), Ulloa (N/A), Fuchs (N/A). Man of the match: Demarai Gray The game started at a ferocious pace, with the hosts in front inside four minutes. An Isaac Hayden pass found Gayle down the channel. The Newcastle forward raced to the byline, before fooling the Leicester backline with a clever pull back for Joselu, who had the simple task of sweeping his side into the lead. Gayle then nearly netted a quick-fire second after great work from Mikel Merino to win the ball back, but he fired just wide from a good position. Leicester soon found their rhythm and started to cause problems. Firstly, Gray curled a brilliant effort just past the post, before Mahrez levelled with a fine strike from distance. The Algeria international moved the ball quickly onto his left, powered a strike goalwards, which beat the despairing dive from Karl Darlow in the home goal, to find the net. The Newcastle stopper may feel a little disappointed he didn't keep that out, though, as he got his hands to it. Team news Three changes to the Newcastle side that were beaten at Chelsea last time out. There was no place for Chancel Mbemba in the matchday squad, DeAndre Yedlin came in . Joselu was given a starting spot, as was Isaac Hayden. The Foxes were unsurprisingly unchanged from their win over Burnley last weekend. Darlow then saved well from Marc Albrighton, before Leicester had a strong case for a penalty turned down, with DeAndre Yedlin adjudged to have got the ball when challenging Jamie Vardy, but the hosts survived to remain level at the break. In the second half, Leicester continued to control proceedings, and were in front on the hour mark as Newcastle's soft centre was again exposed. Mahrez's long ball was brilliantly cushioned into the path of Gray, whose strike was deflected past Darlow. Darlow then had to be alert to save from Mahrez as Leicester continued to dominate, but, out of the blue, Newcastle found an equaliser, as Gayle's drilled effort took a huge defection off Harry Maguire, leaving Kasper Schmeichel with no chance as the ball found the bottom corner. Demarai Gray celebrates scoring Leicester's second goal The tide seemed to have turned, as Gayle then went close to another, but a swift counter saw the visitors snatch all three points. A long ball over the top sent Vardy in the clear, he was forced wide, but managed to twist and square the ball for the onrushing Okazaki, who looked certain to score, before Perez finished it for him on the slide. An unfortunate way to lose, but the result was fair as Newcastle again were well below the required standard. Opta stats Claude Puel has won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time as a manager - the Frenchman last won three league matches in a row as Nice manager in March 2016. Newcastle have dropped 11 points from winning positions in the Premier League this term; the most of any team in the competition. Joselu was on target for Newcastle Rafa Benitez's side are winless in seven Premier League games (W0 D1 L6) and have conceded 15 goals across their last five matches in the competition (an average of three per game). Dwight Gayle has scored over a quarter of Newcastle United's 101 league goals since the start of 2016-17 (26/101). Man of the match - Demarai Gray Had double the shots of any teammate. Looks like a different player under Puel. Exudes confidence every time he is on the attack, and is not afraid to have a strike from anywhere. Very unlucky with a first-half effort. What's next Another home match for Newcastle comes next on Wednesday, and it is another team who have improved a great deal recently in the form of Everton, while Leicester travel south to take on

Southampton Bournemouth 1-1 Southampton Charlie Austin continued his fine goalscoring form as he salvaged a 1-1 draw for Southampton at south-coast rivals Bournemouth. The Saints frontman swept home his third goal in two starts on 61 minutes, cancelling out Ryan Fraser's 42nd-minute opener for the Cherries, who felt aggrieved not to win a penalty after Sofiane Boufal's challenge on Adam Smith. Austin spurned a glorious chance to win the game 10 minutes from time, as too did Bournemouth defender Nathan Ake, but there was to be no winner as both sides had to settle for a point. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Smith (7), Francis (6), Ake (7), Daniels (6), L. Cook (6), Surman (6), Stanislas (5), Fraser (7), King (6), Defoe (5). Subs: Afobe (5), Wilson (5), Ibe (5). Southampton: Forster (8), Pied (6), Hoedt (6), Van Dijk (7), Bertrand (9), Davis (6), Romeu (6), Ward-Prowse (5), Tadic (6), Boufal (6), Austin (8). Subs: Lemina (5), Gabbiadini (5), Redmond (6). Man of the Match: Ryan Bertrand. Virgil van Dijk nearly capped Southampton's bright start with the opener on 12 minutes, but his header curled agonisingly wide. Bournemouth awoke from their slumber on 20 minutes as Lewis Cook's fierce drive deflected off Jermain Defoe and drew a stunning point-blank save from Fraser Forster, who was on hand to thwart Ake's header a minute later. Charlie Austin celebrates after equalising for Saints Bournemouth had strong appeals for a penalty turned away on the half-hour mark when Boufal lunged in on Smith, but referee Jon Moss booked Smith for simulation and Defoe for his protests. In an almost retaliatory move, Charlie Daniels took matters into his own hands, unleashing a fierce drive which came within inches of taking the lead on 39 minutes. Ryan Fraser puts Bournemouth ahead against Southampton The breakthrough finally came three minutes later as Josh King caught Wesley Hoedt in possession, shipped the ball out to Fraser, and he stroked the ball beyond Forster. After Boufal spurned a glorious chance to haul Saints level before the break, the visitors took control in the second period and finally equalised as Austin fired substitute Nathan Redmond's low cross home at the near post. Team news Adam Smith, Lewis Cook, Ryan Fraser, Junior Stanislas and Jermain Defoe returned as Eddie Howe made five changes after Bournemouth’s midweek defeat to Burnley. Jeremy Pied made his first appearance of the season as Mauricio Pellegrino made six changes following Southampton's defeat at Man City. Southampton overturned a deficit to win at the Vitality Stadium last season but there was to be no winner this time around as Austin and Ake headed presentable chances over the target in the closing stages. Opta stats Bournemouth have recorded just one win in their last 10 league meetings with Southampton (W1 D3 L6), winning 2-0 in this exact fixture in March 2016. Only West Brom (6) have dropped more points from winning positions in home games than Bournemouth (5) in the Premier League this term. Southampton are now winless in their last five Premier League away games (D2 L3), and have only won once on the road in the competition this term (1-0 at Crystal Palace). Saints have only won one of their last 51 games in the Premier League when trailing at half time (3-2 v Liverpool in March 2016), drawing 11 and losing 39. Charlie Austin has netted seven goals in his last 10 Premier League starts for Southampton, including three in his last two. Man of the Match - Ryan Bertrand The driving force behind Southampton's revival, Bertrand registered game-high figures of six crosses and three chances created. His defensive qualities are well known but it's his strength going in the opposite direction which sets him apart. Had Austin have been more ruthless in front of goal, Bertrand's attack prowess would have yielded a victory. The managers Eddie Howe: \"For me it's a stonewall penalty. As soon as Adam Smith got his toe to the ball before the defender I knew he was in trouble and that Adam was going to go over the leg because he had nowhere to go. I'm amazed it wasn't given. It was disappointing once we'd taken the lead not to win, but we have to acknowledge that Southampton did do very well at times, second half.\" Eddie Howe was disappointed not to come away with victory against Southampton and was disappointed with the referee. Eddie Howe was disappointed not to come away with victory against Southampton and was disappointed with the referee. Mauricio Pellegrino: \"I was encouraged with our good reaction.

Mauricio Pellegrino felt his side reacted well to going behind and were much improved in the second half of their draw with Bournemouth. What's next?

Manchester City produced another late show to equal the top flight record of 13 successive wins in a season with a 2-1 win over West Ham on Super Sunday. City were met by a spirited Hammers performance that belied their lowly league position as Angelo Ogbonna headed the visitors deservedly ahead (44). However, City stepped it up in the second period and peppered Adrian's goal, drawing level through Nicholas Otamendi (57) before finding the winner seven minutes from time through David Silva. Pep Guardiola's men are eight points ahead of Manchester United in the title race, with the pair set to meet on Super Sunday next weekend while West Ham remain in the relegation zone after their worst start to a Premier League season. There was an air of arrogance about City's build-up play in the early stages but without the intensity. West Ham - well organised without the ball - sensed the lack of spark in City's demeanour and created the better chances. Angelo Ogbonna gave West Ham a shock lead at the Etihad On nine minutes, Cheikhou Kouyate glanced Aaron Cresswell's in-swinging corner which found Michail Antonio unmarked at the back post but could only divert the ball over the bar. City continued to struggle and just before the break Cresswell's delivery from the same flank was guided home by Ogbonna, who beat Otamendi to the first ball and celebrated his first Premier League goal. Team news Pep Guardiola shuffled his pack by making four changes with Eliaquim Mangala, Leroy Sane, David Silva and Danilo returning while David Moyes gave starts to Declan Rice, Michail Antonio, Gelson Fernandes and Adrian, who replaced the ineligible Joe Hart. A response was required after the restart and Guardiola got it, sparked by the introduction of Gabriel Jesus. His decisive work down the right flank opened up the watertight West Ham back five and his cross was turned home by Otamendi from three yards out. City then set up camp in West Ham's half with Leroy Sane and Kevin De Bruyne testing Adrian with some stinging efforts from range. Raheem Sterling missed his kick from four yards out with the goal gaping, but there was a feeling of inevitability about City's winning goal as the Hammers started to tire.

He made a tough finish look easy. Jamie Carragher thinks the City midfielder is the club's greatest ever player and Thierry Henry lavished similar praise on him. Henry said: \"He's the best creative midfielder we've seen in this league. I didn't see everyone play, but David Silva wants the ball and plays the same way against every team. He puts his foot in and doesn't shy away from the ball. He's brave off the ball and on the ball.

Manager reaction: Pep Guardiola \"I would prefer we had the game won before the last moments, but the Premier League is the Premier League. \"I heard about the 'Fergie time'; I wasn't here in that period but of course you have seen what we've shown in past games: we don't give up.\" David Moyes \"They are a really good group of boys, they are trying to get away from trouble, they are working really hard to do so and they did that today. But when you play the top teams you're going to have to do it for 90 minutes, not 60 or 70 but 90 and we've got some other big teams coming up.\" Opta stats West Ham's total of 10 points from 15 games is their lowest ever in the Premier League, and lowest in the top-flight since 1976-77 (nine, converted to three for a win). Man City have won 10 points from losing positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. Since his debut for Man City in September 2015, Kevin de Bruyne has provided 35 league assists - more than any other in the big five European leagues.

Hazard then made sure of the points in the 74th minute when he chipped in a penalty after Victor Moses was fouled by Matt Ritchie.

Chelsea continued to threaten and Morata headed in from Moses' cross just after the half-hour mark to put the hosts in front. Newcastle struggled to mount a comeback and Chelsea's pressure eventually told as Ritchie fouled Moses in the box and Hazard calmly chipped the penalty in as Darlow dived the other way. Darlow denied Hazard his hat-trick when he stood tall to keep out another chipped effort, while Danny Drinkwater also went close as Chelsea closed out a comfortable win.

Again playing in a No 10 role, the Belgium international had six shots on target, a league-high in the Premier League this season, and linked up well with Morata, Cesc Fabregas and Drinkwater. As well as his two goals, the 26-year-old was a constant threat on the ball as Newcastle found it tough to get close. \"When you think of the two top men around today - Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo - when they go who are the next ones to take the mantle? Neymar? Hazard comes into that category, he is that good,\" said Graeme Souness on Sky Sports afterwards.

The Brazilian hit his first goal just 79 seconds after Emre Can's header had put Liverpool in front in the first half, before adding his second shortly after the break moments after Simon Mignolet had made a point-blank save from Glenn Murray. The Brighton striker pulled a goal back from the penalty spot when Jordan Henderson was adjudged to have pushed Shane Duffy a few minutes later, but Liverpool added some gloss to the result with two late goals. Philippe Coutinho scored their fourth when he sent a clever free-kick under the Brighton wall and into the bottom corner, and two minutes later his curling shot was deflected into his own net by Lewis Dunk.

The first chances of the afternoon fell to Firmino, who headed over from Coutinho's corner in the fifth minute and failed to connect properly with an inviting cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold moments later. Jordan Henderson of Liverpool celebrates after Philippe Coutinho's goal Brighton struggled both in and out of possession in the first half but they did have a chance to go in front in the 17th minute, when a low cross from Chelsea loanee Izzy Brown found its way to Murray in the Liverpool box. The striker looked well-placed to take advantage but sliced his effort wide. Liverpool punished Murray's wastefulness with Can's towering header and Firmino's breakaway second before the break, and they extended their lead with another outstanding counter-attacking goal after Mignolet's superb save from Murray. Team news Liverpool made six changes from their 3-0 win over Stoke, with Andrew Robertson, James Milner, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson coming in. Brighton made two changes, with Izzy Brown and Gaetan Bong starting. The Brighton striker pulled the hosts back into it from the penalty spot, but Liverpool held firm before Coutinho's late flourish extended their lead further. It was Liverpool's fifth win in their last six Premier League games and lifted them back into the top four. Brighton, meanwhile, were left to reflect on only their second home defeat of the season. Roberto Firmino took his tally for the season to 11 in all competitions Man of the match - Philippe Coutinho Coutinho was outstanding having been rested for the 3-0 win over Stoke in midweek. The Brazilian set up the opening goal with perfectly-weighted low cross for Firmino, and he sealed the win in style in the closing stages. The free-kick for his goal was cleverly taken and perfectly executed, and he claimed an assist for Dunk's own goal. The stats underlined his influence. Coutinho had more shots, created more chances and completed more dribbles than any of his team-mates. It was another another reminder of just how important he is to Klopp's side. Opta stats Brighton have gone five home leagues games without a win (D4 L1) for the first time since April 2015.

Everton lacked the fluency in their play seen in the 4-0 win over West Ham on Wednesday night, as the same starting line-up failed to create any clear-cut openings in front of their new manager - Jonas Lossl's comfortable save from Cuco Martina's instinctive shot was the closest the hosts came to troubling the scoring in the first half after 25 minutes. Laurent Depoitre had a physical battle all afternoon with Ashley Williams Team news Sam Allardyce's first team selection as Everton manager was unchanged from the win over West Ham. David Wagner made five changes to the Huddersfield side drubbed by Arsenal. Tommy Smith, Scott Malone, Danny Williams, Tom Ince and Laurent Depoitre came in for Martin Cranie, Jonathan Hogg, Steve Mounie, Florent Hadergjonaj and Chris Lowe. Two minutes after the restart, Aaron Lennon cut inside to find Calvert-Lewin, and the 20-year-old showed brilliant awareness to hook the ball into the path of the onrushing Sigurdsson who stroked his first-time shot beyond the committed Lossl. The Icelandic midfielder is slowly adapting to life on Merseyside with his latest goal involvement meaning he has scored two and assisted two in his last four games, having contributed none in his opening 10 outings. Huddersfield boss David Wagner brought Steve Mounie on for Scott Malone as his side went in search of a first away goal since the opening-day victory over Crystal Palace, but Everton put the game to bed with a swift counter-attack. Idrissa Gueye won the ball in midfield and immediately sought Wayne Rooney, with Everton's captain for the day producing a perfectly-weighted through ball for Calvert-Lewin to finish albeit with a slice of good fortune. The forward's left-footed strike clipped off the shins of Jorgensen and looped over Lossl into the net to cap a fine individual performance as Everton saw out the remainder of the match with ease. Gylfi Sigurdsson strokes in the opener after 47 minutes Opta stats Sam Allardyce has won five of his seven first Premier League matches in charge of his seven previous clubs (D1 L1). Huddersfield have lost four consecutive league games for the first time since November 2000. Gylfi Sigurdsson has been directly involved in four goals in his last four PL games for Everton (two goals, two assists), after none in his first 10 for the club. Dominic Calvert-Lewin has had a hand in 10 goals in all competitions this season for Everton (6 goals, 4 assists) a joint-club high alongside Wayne Rooney. Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored and assisted in a game for the Toffees for the first time in any competition. Rooney has scored five and assisted one in his last six top-flight games, after just two goal involvements in his previous seven this season. Man of the match - Dominic Calvert-Lewin Calvert-Lewin was forced to feed off scraps in an uneventful opening 45 minutes as the young Englishman was too often crowded out by Christopher Schindler and Mathias Jorgensen but he earned his luck in the second period. The forward's brilliant flick from Aaron Lennon's pass for Sigurdsson to break the deadlock was the game's one real moment of quality and Calvert-Lewin had only one thing on his mind when Idrissa Gueye snapped into a challenge. The 20-year-old freed himself enough from Jorgensen to get his shot away from Wayne Rooney's pass with the ball ballooning off the defender into the net for his sixth goal of the season. With four assists also to his name, no player has been involved in more goals this season for Everton in all competitions. Wayne Rooney shakes hands with Sam Allardyce after being withdrawn The managers Everton boss Sam Allardyce: \"Nice weekend for the start. If I look back at my time at Crystal Palace, we drew at Watford where we should've won it but missed a penalty to go 2-0 up. It took me six games to win my first match. \"With Wednesday under our belts in David [Unsworth]'s last game [a 4-0 win over West Ham], I watched that and the lads have come in and done the job today. It wasn't as pleasing on the eye as that game, but I think the lads were a bit fatigued. The quality shone through.\" Everton boss Sam Allardyce says he is very, very happy with his first win as Everton manager and he though his side’s quality shone through in the end after they beat Huddersfield 2-0 in the Premier League. Everton boss Sam Allardyce says he is very, very happy with his first win as Everton manager and he though his side’s quality shone through in the end after they beat Huddersfield 2-0 in the Premier League. Huddersfield manager David Wagner: \"This was a very disappointing afternoon from our point of view. There wasn't a lot in this game; both teams showed good fighting attitude but both showed a lack of creativity and quality in the final third. \"Today we were not able to show the talent that this group has, especially in the final third, and this is what we have to get back in order to have trust and believe in ourselves in the Premier League. We have shown it in the past and we will work hard to show it again next weekend.\" Huddersfield boss David Wagner says he was very disappointed with their 2-0 loss to Everton as he felt there wasn’t much between the teams. Huddersfield boss David Wagner says he was very disappointed with their 2-0 loss to Everton as he felt there wasn’t much between the teams. Pundit reaction Charlie Nicholas: \"Holgate was decent today, but Huddersfield didn't have a great threat. Sam will be happy with the overall result but it was as poor an opening 45 minutes as I've ever seen. \"They had an extraordinary start to the second half but they had a big slice of luck for the second goal, with a big deflection over the keeper. \"Sam's positives will be the defensive structure and I think Sigurdsson was the star turn. Lennon was decent today, linking up for the first goal, and the fans appreciated his performance.\" What's next?

Leicester took the lead as early as the sixth minute as Gray, on his return to the side, bundled the ball home at the far post. Burnley responded well, but couldn't create enough clear-cut chances of their own, with Johann Berg Gudmundsson wasting their best chance to score in the second half, denied by the legs of Kapser Schmeichel in the home goal. Jamie Vardy, looking to become the first Leicester player to reach 50 Premier League goals, remains stuck on 49 after a fruitless afternoon where he posed very little threat. Leicester stay ninth despite victory, while Burnley drop to seventh. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (6), Chilwell (6), Morgan (7), Maguire (7), Iborra (6), Ndidi (6), Gray (7), Albrighton (6), Mahrez (8), Vardy (5). Subs: Okazaki (N/A).

Man of the match: Riyad Mahrez Leicester started brightly, and were soon in front, after great work from the newly-blonde Mahrez. The Algeria international drifted wide, cut back onto his left, curled a delightful cross in the middle, which evaded everyone. However, Burnley stopper Nick Pope could only parry the ball onto the thigh of Gray, who steered the ball home from a tight angle. Demarai Gray lies injured after scoring his side's winning goal Burnley responded really well, and bombarded the Leicester box with cross after cross. Schmeichel had to be alert to smother at the feet of Wood as the visitors pressed. Robbie Brady, who was excellent for the first 30 minutes, then had to be withdrawn through injury, which seemed to disrupt Burnley's flow somewhat as Leicester cruised to the interval without being troubled any further. Team news Claude Puel made one change from the team that started the win against Tottenham, as Shinji Okazaki dropped to the bench, replaced in the starting line-up by Damarai Gray. Steven Defour passed a fitness test to start for Burnley. After the break, Leicester stepped up a gear, and would have been in front but for two pieces of superb defending from Phil Bardsley, firstly to block Gray's goalbound effort, before clearing off the line after Morgan had prodded for goal. Burnley still posed a threat on the break, and went really close on the hour mark, with Gudmundsson thwarted by Schmeichel after a swift Burnley counter attack. Mahrez came close to making the victory more comfortable for Leicester with a long-range effort late on, which Pope beat away, but Leicester saw out the victory that continued Puel's Foxes improvement. Leicester manager Claude Puel says it has been a good week for the club but insists the hard work must continue. Leicester manager Claude Puel says it has been a good week for the club but insists the hard work must continue. Man of the match - Riyad Mahrez In a game when the quality in front of goal was conspicuous by its absence, Mahrez showed glimpses of his very best fleet-footed flamboyance, only to be denied by poor finishing, or lack of options ahead of him. Some of his passing was right out of the top drawer. The managers Claude Puel: \"It has been a good week, but what was most important was that we continued our hard work. It was a difficult game against this team who were sixth in the table. \"I am very happy with our second half, for example. We had a lot of chances, but perhaps we needed to be more clinical.\" Sean Dyche says he was happy with his side's performance particularly in the first half after their 1-0 defeat Sean Dyche says he was happy with his side's performance particularly in the first half after their 1-0 defeat Sean Dyche: \"I thought we were excellent in the first half, but we conceded a very sloppy goal, which is very unlike us. Then, after that, we dominated the first half. From set pieces, we had some very good chances. \"In the second half, it became more of a ding-dong, which suited them really. Mixed bag really, but in our third game in a week, I was really pleased with the physicality of the players.\" Robbie Brady (left) and Wes Morgan battle for the ball Opta stats Leicester have lost just one of their last 10 games in all competitions (W5 D4 L1), losing 0-2 against Manchester City. This is just the second time in their last 11 Premier League away games that Burnley have failed to score, also drawing a blank at Man City in October. After three successive PL wins and clean sheets, the Clarets have conceded a goal in each of their last three, losing twice (W1). Demarai Gray has found the net twice in 14 PL appearances this season, double the total the youngster had in 30 appearances last season (1).

It breaks a run of four winless league games for Stoke, who jump up to 13th spot, while Swansea stretch their streak to seven Premier League matches without a victory and slip to the bottom of the table after Crystal Palace's 0-0 draw with West Brom. Swansea took the lead with just three minutes on the clock as Bony came back to haunt his former loan side. Martin Olsson was set away by the striker down the left flank before clipping a cross into the box. Despite pressure from Ryan Shawcross, Bony got a foot to the ball to slot it home past the returning Jack Butland. Team news Jack Butland return for Stoke in goal as Mark Hughes made one change from midweek. Swansea made three changes with Tammy Abraham, Sam Clucas and Leroy Fer coming into the XI. There had been few clear-cut chances, with Peter Crouch's attempt to catch Fabianski off his line the best effort in the 34th minute, but Stoke did equalise two minutes later. Joe Allen latched onto a loose ball after Leroy Fer was dispossessed, before sliding in Shaqiri who toe poked the ball into the back of the net. Four minutes later and Stoke had completed their turnaround. Shawcross floated a ball forward that Crouch into the path of Diouf in the middle of the box. He took one touch to round the oncoming Kyle Naughton before sweeping home. Wilfried Bony opened the scoring in the third minute The second half did not start well for Stoke as Bruno Martins Indi picked up a groin injury just minutes after the restart. The Netherlands international required five minutes of treatment before being stretchered off and replaced by Kevin Wimmer. Stoke could have added a third in the 67th minute, but Shaqiri's cross was headed past the face of goal by Diouf before, at the other end, Sam Clucas failed to turn home a fizzing Tammy Abraham delivery. 6 - Wilfried Bony has scored six goals in his five apps in Premier League games between Stoke and Swansea - scoring twice for Stoke and four goals for Swansea. Cool. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 2, 2017 But Swansea's best chance for an equaliser came in the 79th minute, although not from their own player. Carroll delivered a free-kick into the box, which Shawcross got a head to in the six-yard box and it required a superb fingertip save from Butland to push it over the crossbar. Opta stats Stoke have scored in all seven of their home Premier League games against the Swans - against no other club do they have a 100 per cent record at the bet365 Stadium (7/7). Swansea bagged their first Premier League goal after 431 minutes thanks to Wilfried Bony. Wilfried Bony's goal (on 2 mins 19 secs) was the earliest the Swans had scored in a Premier League games since August 2014, via a Nathan Dyer strike against West Brom after one minute and 27 seconds. Two of Xherdan Shaqiri's last three PL goals have come inside the box, this after his previous six in a row had arrived from outside the area. The managers Mark Hughes: \"We needed those three points. I said in recent weeks that our performances have been OK and we haven't got the results we deserve but it was a different type of performance today and we just had to get the job done.

Xherdan Shaqiri celebrates scoring the equaliser for Stoke He was involved in most of the Potters' attacking play down the right wing, and should arguably also have had an assist to his name for his play but it was not to be.

point at Watford after coming from behind and then having Davinson Sanchez sent off in a feisty 1-1 draw at Vicarage Road. Spurs are now without a win in four Premier League games and suffered another slow start on Saturday as Christian Kabasele's header from Richarlison's corner on 13 minutes gave the Hornets the lead. The hosts might have then increased their lead had Ben Davies' block on Richarlison in the box been deemed a foul by referee Martin Atkinson, but with their protests still ringing around the ground, Spurs broke down the right and Christian Eriksen's pinpoint cross was met by Heung-Min Son (24) at the far post. Christian Kabasele celebrates after scoring Watford's goal But Spurs' hopes were dealt a huge blow when Sanchez was deemed to have raised his elbow into Richarlison's face on 52 minutes and although the visitors continued to venture forward in search of a much-needed win, neither side could find the quality to earn the win, with Spurs' Eric Dier perhaps lucky to survive a handball shout in the final seconds. Player Ratings Watford: Gomes (7), Prodl (7), Mariappa (7), Cleverley (7), Deeney (7), Richarlison (7), Doucoure (8), Femenia (6), Zeegelaar (6), Kabasele (7), Pereyra (6) Subs: Karnezis, Janmaat, Wague, Gray, Watson, Carrillo, Capoue Tottenham: Lloris (7), Trippier (6), Vertonghen (7), Sanchez (5), Davies (6), Dier (7), Dembele (7), Dele (6), Eriksen (7), Son (7), Kane (7) Subs: Lamela (6), Sissoko (6), Winks (6) Man of the match: Abdoulaye Doucouré Spurs, guilty of conceding early in recent Premier League games, started well and might have opened the scoring on five minutes when Kieran Trippier's first-time cross somehow evaded Harry Kane's stretch and rolled to safety. But they fell behind to Watford's first attack of the game. Dier thought he was fouled on the edge of the Watford box, but as Atkinson waved play on, Watford broke and won a corner, from which Kabasele rose highest amid a static Spurs defence to head home Richarlison's cross. Spurs continued to press and Kane's clipped pass over the top almost found a stretching Dele Alli, before Eriksen did find his man - Son left with a simple finish for his fifth goal of the season. That goal seemed to rock Watford, who began to give the ball away needlessly, but Spurs could not capitalise and their bid for a first Premier League win since November 5 suffered a huge blow when Sanchez was shown a straight red card for raising his arm into the face of Richarlison as he tried to break. Team news Watford made two changes for Spurs' visit, with Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney coming in for Will Hughes, who was out with a hamstring injury, while Andre Gray dropped to the bench. Spurs arrived having made three changes to the team that lost to Leicester, with the full-backs swapping out allowing Kieran Trippier and Ben Davies to return, while Moussa Sissoko dropped down to the bench as Heung-Min Son started. That sparked a frantic period, with Abdoulaye Doucouré curling a brilliant first-time effort against the inside of Hugo Lloris' post from 25 yards while Spurs remained a threat on the break - Moussa Sissoko seeing his powerful run and shot deflected wide. But it was Watford who looked more likely late on and they were furious that Dier was not punished for what looked handball in the box in the dying seconds as Spurs held on. Opta stats Heung-Min Son has scored four goals and assisted two more in his last seven starts in all competitions for Tottenham. Christian Kabasele has scored two goals in 14 Premier League games this season, equalling his tally from last season in 16 appearances. All four of his goals in the competition have come from corner situations. Spurs have kept just one clean sheet in their last seven PL games, after registering four shut-outs in the five games before that. Tottenham have been shown two red cards in their last 10 Premier League games, as many as in their previous 111 in the competition. Man of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure So solid in that Watford midfield and did well to deny Spurs' playmakers any space. Very unlucky not to score with a wonderful effort from range that cannoned back off the inside of Hugo Lloris' post. The managers Marco Silva: \"The last-minute decision is a clear penalty, but it was a tough day for both teams and for the referee as well. \"It was a good attitude from both teams. We had a game against Brighton here and we had 10 players for almost 70 minutes and we didn't lose. We tried to win the game, we had chances, like Tottenham had as well. We did everything to try to win. \"It is most important we keep working hard to improve our team and to improve as players. We started well this season but we have a lot of work to do and we have to keep going.\" Mauricio Pochettino: \"It's a difficult feeling to play more than 40 minutes with 10 men. \"We did well because we did not concede chances. We were brave and we tried to go forward. The performance was very good under the circumstances. \"We dominated the first half, we were much much better and then we conceded a goal with their first chance. But the team was always fighting and trying to win. I am happy with the performance. We wanted to win but under the circumstances I am happy.\" What's next?

Both sides struggled to create any meaningful openings, with the closest either coming to breaking the deadlock arriving after a controversial first-half incident. However, referee Michael Oliver decided that West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster had not upended Palace forward Wilfried Zaha in the box and the two teams had to settle for a point apiece.

In a first half largely devoid of action, there was one major talking point after 18 minutes following a back pass from West Brom right-back Allan Nyom. West Brom striker Hal Robson-Kanu (left) is tackled by of Crystal Palace's Jeffrey Schlupp There appeared little danger, that is until Foster miscontrolled the ball, allowing the always alert Zaha to steal in and gain possession, only for the Baggies No 1 to then bring the forward down. The man in the middle, though, waved play on, much to Zaha's and Palace's disbelief. New West Brom boss Alan Pardew, (right) shakes hands with his Crystal Palace counterpart and Roy Hodgson ahead of kick-off at The Hawthorns Other than that, the visitors - still looking to score their first away goal of the season in the league - tried to largely catch their opponents on the break, and they nearly did four minutes before the break. However, after Christian Benteke had somehow dribbled his way through a posse of West Brom defenders on the edge of the area, Foster raced off his line to make an excellent smothering stop. Team news West Brom had left-back Kieran Gibbs available, but midfielder Matt Phillips missed out with injury. Palace were without both Yohan Cabaye and Scott Dann, although Luka Milivojevic and Jeffrey Schlupp had recovered from injuries to start. The home side, meanwhile, stepped up the pace in the second period, only for Julian Speroni - in for Wayne Hennessey after the Wales international was injured in the warm-up - to deny Jay Rodriguez with a smart block. Opta stats Pardew became the fifth manager to take charge of at least five different Premier League clubs. Indeed, Pardew has won three and drawn two of his opening games with his five sides Palace are the first Premier League team to fail to score in 10 consecutive away games (D2 L8) The Eagles are the first English top-flight team to go 10 away games in a row without a goal since Man City in 1950 (12 games) West Brom attempted 20 shots versus Crystal Palace, their highest tally in a Premier League game since December 2015 versus Newcastle (22) Palace have kept consecutive away Premier League clean sheets for the first time since January 2015 The Baggies have picked up just 32 points from their 34 Premier League games in 2017 (W7 D11 L16), the fewest total of any PL side to appear in the last two seasons Crystal Palace defender Joel Ward (right) wins a header under pressure from West Brom striker Salomon Rondon Man of the match - Mamadou Sakho The Palace captain was once again a rock at the heart of the visitors' defence, shepherding his team through to a second clean sheet on the road in the space of just four days. The imposing France international was there in the right place at the right time to make a succession of important blocks and clearances, while his distribution from the back was also impressive. The managers Alan Pardew: I just think that everything was there in terms of application and attitude and maybe just a little bit of composure, which is understandable given the run of games we have had. But I was genuinely pleased with the drive of the team. We had a lot of quality missing today in terms of injured players and we lost Gareth Barry early, which was a blow. But the response I had from the guys was great and if we go forward like that, we will have nothing to worry about. Alan Pardew felt that 'everything was there' in his West Brom side's performance as they settle for a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace. Alan Pardew felt that 'everything was there' in his West Brom side's performance as they settle for a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace. Roy Hodgson: Overnight we lose Scott Dann to a problem he had with a virus infection. And then in the warm-up we lose Wayne Hennessey. But probably the worst thing to happen to us was leaving Euston Station in the sunshine and congratulating ourselves on going by train with only an hour and quarter's journey in front of us. And we eventually took five and a half hours. And three and a half of that was spent in a cold black situation on the train with no electricity, lights, toilet facilities, nothing at all.

Antonio Valencia celebrates after scoring his sides first goal Shkodran Mustafi was at fault for United's second, with the Arsenal defender dithering on the goal before being intercepted by Lingard, who latched onto Anthony Martial's delightful flick to steer his effort in off the post. Team news Both sides were unchanged following victories in midweek. Alexandre Lacazette and Nemanja Matic recovered from injuries to start. Arsenal continued to threaten, but Lacazette saw his shot ricochet off De Gea and hit the bar, with Granit Xhaka then skimming the post with the rebound. A frantic end to the first half saw Bellerin and Kolasinac denied by De Gea, who then produced a stunning stop to prevent Romelu Lukaku from turning the ball into his own net. Arsenal got one back through Lacazette just four minutes into the second half, with the Frenchman firing home after Aaron Ramsey beat the offside trap to set him up. Jesse Lingard celebrates after scoring Manchester United's second against Arsenal Lingard then saw his effort deflect off Cech and hit the post before a sensational De Gea double save prevented both Lacazette and Sanchez from scoring. United then had their third just after the hour-mark, with Pogba holding off Laurent Koscielny before playing it over for Lingard to tap in. Pogba's night was over though just 11 minutes later, with the midfielder leaving his studs in the back of Bellerin's leg - though Arsenal could not capitalise as United secured their 10th league win of the season. Paul Pogba is shown a red card by referee Andre Marriner for a dangerous tackle on Hector Bellerin Opta stats Arsenal suffered their first home league defeat in 15 games, since losing 2-1 to Watford in January. Manchester United have won more Premier League away games at Arsenal than any other side (8). David de Gea made 14 saves in the game, the joint-most in a Premier League game since 2003/04, when Opta started collecting this data (also 14 for Mannone for Sunderland v Chelsea in April 2014 and Tim Krul for Newcastle v Tottenham in November 2013). Jose Mourinho won away to one of the 'big six' in the Premier League for the first time in 12 attempts (D5 L6). Man of the match - David de Gea A staggering 14 saves tells you all you need to know. Time and again, the Spaniard produced world-class stops to deny Arsenal, who will have left the Emirates wondering how they have not taken at least a point. The double save to prevent Lacazette (again) and Sanchez was arguably the standout moment for De Gea, who created a showreel worthy of the season's best saves all in one night. The managers Arsene Wenger: \"At the back we didn't start well at all. We put ourselves in a very difficult position. Despite that, we had enough chances to come back. \"When you have 33 shots on goal in a game of that stature, it means our dominance was top class. Our spirit was outstanding, the quality of our performance was outstanding. \"But I'm angry and disappointed because at the end we have nothing to show for it. In games like that you have to be efficient.\" Jose Mourinho could not resist making a dig at Arsenal after Alexandre Lacazette played the full 90 minutes despite being ruled out for the game earlier in the week.

Mesut Ozil put in a starring performance as a blistering second-half display from Arsenal saw them enjoy a 5-0 win over Huddersfield at the Emirates. Alexandre Lacazette handed Arsenal an early lead (3) but the hosts failed to add to their lead before the break. Huddersfield had chances to level, but three goals in five minutes put the game beyond the visitors, with Olivier Giroud (68) and Alexis Sanchez (69) scoring from Ozil assists before the German added a fourth himself (72). Giroud then wrapped it up with a fifth late on (87) to ensure Arsenal's perfect start at home this season continued, while Huddersfield slip to a third-straight defeat. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (6), Bellerin (6), Koscielny (7), Mustafi (7), Monreal (6), Kolasinac (7), Ramsey (6), Xhaka (7), Ozil (9), Sanchez (8), Lacazette (7) Subs: Giroud (8), Wilshere (6), Welbeck (6) Huddersfield: Lossl (5), Hadergjonaj (5), Zanka (5), Schindler (5), Lowe (6), Hogg (5), Mooy (5), Cranie (6), Quaner (6), Mounie (6), Kachunga (6) Subs: Williams (6), Whitehead (6), Depoitre (6) Man of the match: Mesut Ozil It was the perfect start from Arsenal as Lacazette latched onto a delightful flick from Aaron Ramsey before sliding the ball past Jonas Lossl at the near post. Alexandre Lacazette put Arsenal into an early lead against Huddersfield However, Arsenal took their foot off the gas, and did not come close again until just after the half-hour mark, with Lacazette seeing his smart chip from an acute angle cleared off the line by Martin Cranie before Sead Kolasinac skied the rebound. Huddersfield then saw claims for a penalty waved away after Steve Mounie collided with Shkodran Mustafi, while the striker then took too long to get an attempt away, allowing Laurent Koscielny to come back and make the block. Team news Arsenal welcome Mesut Ozil back to the starting XI, with Alex Iwobi dropping to the bench as a result. Huddersfield made six changes to the side that lost 2-1 to Manchester City on the weekend. Alexis Sanchez scored Arsenal's third after latching onto Mesut Ozil's cross After the break, Petr Cech got down well to prevent Collin Quaner from levelling, though the Arsenal goalkeeper did endure a hairy moment when palming a high ball onto his own bar. Olivier Giroud came on for Lacazette at half-time, and though he hit the post after rounding Jonas Lossl, he scored Arsenal's second when finishing off a fine team move. One minute later, it was Sanchez's turn to be set up by Ozil, and the Chilean made no mistake from 10 yards out when slamming the ball into the middle of the goal. Mesut Ozil scored Arsenal's fourth goal against Huddersfield Ozil got in on the act himself moments later, delightfully lifting the ball over Lossl, while Giroud netted his second late on when cheekily stealing in ahead of team-mate Kolasinac. Opta stats Arsenal have now won their last 12 home league games in a row, last enjoying a longer run between February and November 2005 at Highbury (13). Huddersfield have failed to score in seven consecutive away games in all competitions - their longest-ever such run. Alexandre Lacazette scored his fifth home Premier League goal of the season - no other player has more on their own turf (level with Rooney, Sane, Salah, Lukaku and Jesus). There have been seven goals scored in the opening three minutes of Premier League games this season, with Lacazette scoring two of those (29%). 2 goals for Olivier Giroud tonight means he overtakes Eric Cantona and becomes the 4th highest-scoring Frenchman in @premierleague history: Thierry Henry - 175 goals Nicolas Anelka - 125 Louis Saha - 85 OLIVIER GIROUD - 72 Eric Cantona - 70 pic.twitter.com/xkBHJVk7kT — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) November 29, 2017 Man of the match - Mesut Ozil Ozil is carrying on the fine form that helped Arsenal beat rivals Tottenham a couple of weeks ago, and two assists and a goal against Huddersfield once more stressed his importance to the side, having missed the Burnley 1-0 win with injury. If the German does want to leave the Emirates, he's certainly not showing it on the pitch. He was their talisman on Wednesday night, even with Sanchez by his side, and as we edge towards the January transfer window, the furious speculation will only continue, unless he signs on the dotted line soon. The managers Arsene Wenger: \"In the last 20 minutes we looked comfortable, but Huddersfield fought very well. We lost urgency after the 1-0, we lacked focus in our passing. In the second half it could have been 1-1. But when we scored the second, it changed completely and they took a blow mentally. We finished in an outstanding way.

moved up to sixth in the Premier League thanks to goals from Chris Wood and Robbie Brady in a 2-1 win over Bournemouth. Joshua King pulled one back for Bournemouth with 11 minutes left on the clock but they could not find an equaliser in the closing stages. Prior to the opener, Burnley were repeatedly dangerous from crosses with Wood hitting the crossbar early when his header from a Brady corner looped onto the top of the goal frame. The New Zealander came close again when Phil Bardsley cross from the right found him in the centre of the box from where he headed the ball into the ground forcing Asmir Begovic to react quickly and tip it over. Josh King pulled a goal back for Bournemouth Wood eventually found the back of the net at the third time of asking in the 36th minute when good work from Jack Cork resulted in Brady picking up the ball on the left and sending a cross in which deflected into the path of the Kiwi who calmly slotted into an empty net from six yards. Chris Wood celebrates his first-half goal for Burnley Brady got his reward for constant endeavour after the break as Johann Berg Gudmundsson broke down the right to the edge of the area where he laid it off to the Irishman, allowing him to set it onto his right foot and curl a shot beyond Begovic via a slight deflection. Team news Phil Bardsley started at right-back for the Clarets with the former Manchester United defender replacing Matt Lowton. Chris Wood came in for Ashley Barnes, too, as Sean Dyche made two changes from the team which lost to Arsenal.There was a change for Bournemouth at right-back too as Simon Francis returned from suspension, with Adam Smith making way, which was the only change for the hosts. It looked like Bournemouth were out of the game but King pulled one back with 11 minutes to go when Simon Francis crossed one in from the right onto Callum Wilson's chest into the path of Jermain Defoe, whose miss-hit cross landed at the Norwegian's feet at the back post as he turned the ball home from a few yards, but it would be the host's final chance. Burnley were resolute throughout with the goal conceded one of only two shots Bournemouth managed to get on target.

Subs: Vokes (6), Barnes (6), Westwood (6) Man of the match: Chris Wood Ben Mee and James Tarkowski could easily have been man of the match as both were superb throughout, keeping Wilson, King and Defoe quiet for the majority of the 90 minutes.The victory sends Burnley into sixth place into the league, one place above Spurs in the table, as Bournemouth slip down to 15th, making it an unhappy 40th birthday for manager Eddie Howe. Opta Stats This was Burnley's fourth away win of the season - their highest tally in a Premier League season. Indeed, this was only the second time Burnley have won consecutive away games in the competition, last doing so in May 2015. Bournemouth have lost four of their seven home league games this season - just two fewer than they lost in the whole of 2016-17. Since the start of last season, Chris Wood has scored in 28 different English league games - only Billy Sharp (29) has scored in more (excluding play-offs). Robbie Brady scored his first Premier League goal since February, ending a run of 25 games in the competition without one. Eddie Howe became the 25th different manager to lose a Premier League game on his birthday. Managers Eddie Howe: \"We were off it. They strangled us; we never got our passing game going and that's credit to them, that's how they play - and I think they were better than us. \"I don't think they do surprise, they're very good at what they do. \"From our perspective we use the ball better, get more tempo in our game. We were just flat and barely got going.\" 25 – Eddie Howe is the 25th manager to lose a Premier League game on his birthday. Pooper. pic.twitter.com/IpCQEH76q9 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 29, 2017 Sean Dyche: \"I was very pleased with that, we wanted to come down and be on the front foot. There was no hangover from Sunday. \"I thought first half in particular we were very dominant, we hit the bar, we made the 'keeper work. We scored a fine goal we kept our 'keeper very quiet. \"To be fair to Woodsy, he didn't deserve to come out of the team but he was fatigued. It's a squad game, I've just mentioned to the lads the respect I have for them. \"Bardo [Phil Bardsley] has come in today and not put a foot wrong. He's been waiting for his chance and that's important - the squad mentality, to keep themselves right - and when they're needed to deliver and they delivered tonight.\" Man of the match - Chris Wood Burnley's style is based around keeping things tight, meaning a composed striker in front of goal is key for Sean Dyche's side. The New Zealander's movement in the box ensured he had two good chances before his goal and he did the most important thing by opening the scoring for his team and setting them on the way to a win.

"Chelsea 1-0 Swansea: Antonio Rudiger's goal enough as Antonio Conte sent to the stands 2:45 Chelsea 1-0 Swansea Chelsea 1-0 Swansea Chelsea secured a workmanlike 1-0 win over lowly Swansea in the Premier League on Wednesday thanks to Antonio Rudiger's second-half goal at Stamford Bridge. Rudiger nodded home his first Premier League goal early in the second half after N'Golo Kante's speculative shot deflected into his path off the head of Wilfried Bony. The scoreline did not truly reflect Chelsea's dominance as Antonio Conte, who was sent to the stands in the first half, took the opportunity to rest Eden Hazard and Cesar Azpilicueta. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (6), Cahill (7), Rudiger (8), Alonso (7), Christensen (7), Zappacosta (7), Fabregas (7), Kante (7), Pedro (7), Willian (7), Morata (7). Subs used: Moses (5), Hazard (5), Drinkwater (5). Swansea: Fabianski (7), Van Der Hoorn (7), Mawson (7), Naughton (6), Olsson (6), Ki (7), Carroll (6), Mesa (5), Sanches (3), Ayew (5), Bony (5). Subs used: Fer (6), McBurnie (6), Routledge (n/a). Man of the match: Antonio Rudiger. The win keeps Chelsea in third while Swansea stay one off the bottom having never really looked likely to claim the three points that would have moved them out of the relegation zone. Chelsea paid tribute to former coach Dermot Drummy before kick-off, following his passing at the age of 56 earlier in the week, and they were soon into their stride. Lukasz Fabianski was forced into six first-half saves while the away team failed to muster even an effort on goal. Team news Chelsea made four changes, with Cesar Azpilicueta and Eden Harzard starting on the bench alongside Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater. Antonio Rudiger, Cesc Fabregas, Pedro and Willian came into the XI. Swansea named an unchanged XI. The best of the Poland international's stops came from Alvaro Morata midway through the half when he the goalkeeper tipped over the striker's improvised volley. That resulted in a Chelsea corner but it was the failure to award the home side another such decision just before the interval that saw Conte sent to the stands for his complaints. Antonio Conte remonstrates with referee Neil Swarbrick before being sent to the stands He was celebrating soon after when Rudiger gave Chelsea the lead and the only surprise was that the Blues were unable to add to it with Morata spurning a number of chances. The Spanish striker has scored eight Premier League goals to Swansea's seven so far this season and it was he who went closer to adding to his tally on Wednesday. Renato Sanches and Cesc Fabregas in action at Stamford Bridge His wastefulness made for some nervy moments late on as Paul Clement's side searched for an equaliser but they could fashion no clear openings and Chelsea secured a deserved win. Opta stats Cesar Azpilicueta didn't start a Premier League game for Chelsea for the first time since December 2015, having played 90 minutes in each of their last 74 top-flight matches. Chelsea have scored eight headed goals in the Premier League this season; more than any other side. Swansea failed to score in any of their four Premier League games in November, the only team not to do so in the competition this month. Only three clubs have scored fewer goals after 14 games of a Premier League season than Swansea City (7) this season: Derby (5 in 2007-08), Bradford (5 in 2000-01) and Man City (6 in 1995-96). The managers Antonio Conte was pleased with his side’s positive performance and explained why he was sent to the stands Antonio Conte was pleased with his side’s positive performance and explained why he was sent to the stands Antonio Conte: \"I saw that the opponent was wasting time and that is the reason I spoke a few times with the fourth official. I didn't see that the situation hadn't changed and I was frustrated with the fourth official. For this reason, I have to apologise to him and the referee. In that moment, I was angry but I know that is it right to apologise to them.\" 0:45 Antonio Conte is sent to the stands Antonio Conte is sent to the stands Paul Clement: \"I thought for long periods we defended very well. We were obviously under a lot of pressure and Chelsea had a lot of near misses. We're frustrated and disappointed with the nature of the goal when we have been defending well over recent games. At the season we conceded a couple of set plays but we put things right.\" \"After that though, we didn't collapse, we kept defending well and we were just waiting for that opportunity because, at 1-0, you're still in the game. We tried to create some opportunities but they were few and far between but the players put in a big effort.\" Paul Clement says he was disappointed to concede off a set-play after his side lost 1-0 to Chelsea in the Premier League Paul Clement says he was disappointed to concede off a set-play after his side lost 1-0 to Chelsea in the Premier League The pundit Iain Dowie: \"For 70 minutes it was very one sided but they never really tested Fabianski. Van der Hoorn and Alfie Mawson were making clearance after clearance and putting their bodies across the line, but then they went to sleep and it was a poor goal when Paul Clement looks at it.\" Iain Dowie reflects on Chelsea's 1-0 win over Swansea, saying the Blues were in control but didn't test Swansea as much as he expected.

Man of the match - Antonio Rudiger It was not a night for sparkling play from the Premier League champions but nobody did more to contribute to the win than Antonio Rudiger. The German defender, one of four players introduced to the team as Conte rotated his squad, did his job defensively and popped up with his first Premier League goal to make the breakthrough. Antonio Rudiger was a solid replacement for the rested Cesar Azpiliceuta Chelsea supporters are not used to watching Premier League games and not seeing Cesar Azpilicueta on the pitch - he had played every minute of the last 74 in the competition prior to Wednesday night. But Rudiger's efforts in that position on the right side of the defence ensured that his absence did not cost the home side any points. What's next?

4-0 West Ham A hat-trick from Wayne Rooney, including one sensational strike from inside his own half, helped Everton earn a 4-0 win over West Ham at Goodison Park, with Sam Allardyce looking on from the stands. Allardyce is due to be confirmed as the new Everton boss imminently, and he only had to wait 18 minutes to see Everton take the lead, as Rooney headed home after his penalty had been saved by Joe Hart. Then, 10 minutes later, it was two, as Rooney stroked the ball home after Tom Davies' cross had rolled into his path. West Ham upped their game in the second half, and could have got themselves back in it, but Manuel Lanzini saw his penalty kick saved by Jordan Pickford, before Rooney completed his hat-trick in incredible fashion, drilling a strike into the net from inside his own half, over a stranded Hart, to send Goodison into raptures in awe of their local hero. Ashley Williams headed home a fourth as Everton secured three points that sees them climb to 13th, as David Unsworth was treated to victory in what was almost certainly his final match in charge. West Ham's woes continue, as they stay in the bottom three after a defeat that means David Moyes has suffered five successive defeats back at Goodison as an opposition manager, 12-0 on aggregate. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (8), Williams (7), Martina (6), Kenny (8), Holgate (7), Gueye (6), Davies (7), Sigurdsson (7), Lennon (7), Rooney (9), Calvert-Lewin (8). Subs: Vlasic (6), Lookman (6), Baningime (N/A) West Ham: Hart (4), Reid (5), Cresswell (5), Zabaleta (4), Obiang (4), Masuaku (6), Ogbonna (4), Kouyate (4), Arnautovic (3), Lanzini (3), Ayew (3). Subs: Sakho (6), Antonio (5), Rice (N/A) Man of the match: Wayne Rooney Both sides came into the match in such poor form, meaning the opening stages were fraught with wayward passing and little creativity. However, a simple ball over the top opened up West Ham, Dominic Calvert-Lewin broke clear, knocked the ball around the onrushing Hart, who upended the young striker. Captain Rooney stepped up to take the penalty in Leighton Baines' absence. Hart saved to his right, but could only look on as the rebound bounced up for Rooney to easily head into the empty net. Team news Rooney returned to the Everton starting line up as one of five changes by Unsworth in his final game in charge. Michael Keane and Leighton Baines missed out through injury. Just one change for the visitors as Andre Ayew came in for Andy Carroll. The goal seemed to relax a tense Goodison, and soon enough it was two. Jonjoe Kenny broke forward well, fed Davies, who dragged a cross into the middle, which rolled into Rooney's path, allowing the skipper time to sweep the ball past Hart. The introduction of Diafra Sakho injected some life into the Hammers after the break, as Aaron Cresswell rattled the crossbar, before Sakho earned his side a penalty after being hauled down by Ashley Williams, only for Lanzini to see his spot-kick saved by Pickford. Then, with Everton on the back foot, Rooney stole the show. Hart had done well to race from his goal to tackle Calvert-Lewin, but he could only divert the ball into the path of Rooney, 58 yards from goal. And the England goalkeeper could do nothing as Rooney fired the ball over everyone and into the net. Sam Allardyce is seen arriving at the stadium prior to the match Ashley Williams arrowed a brilliant header into the net to cap a fine Everton performance late on. Allardyce has plenty to work with at Goodison, with his captain back to his very best. Man of the match - Wayne Rooney It couldn't be anyone else really, could it? His first was slightly fortune, his second well taken, his third? Out of this world. The trajectory on the strike was unreal. An all-round performance to show Rooney is anything but on the wane. The managers David Unsworth: \"Well, Sam has my full backing. The board have made their decision and like any manager, he needs to be afforded time, patience. He needs to be given the chance and the backing from the whole football club and he certainly has my backing.\" Paul Merson says Everton won’t be in a relegation battle under Sam Allardyce but Merse fears for West Ham, who have a tough run coming up. Paul Merson says Everton won’t be in a relegation battle under Sam Allardyce but Merse fears for West Ham, who have a tough run coming up. David Moyes: \" I didn't want to put my name to the first half, that was for sure. We made changes at half time, it made us better and look, tonight we weren't good in the first half, so we didn't deserve anything, but I thought when we needed small things to go for us, they didn't. I mean, Wayne's penalty was saved by Joe Hart, but it came back to him. Tonight, Lanzini's was saved and didn't, so from that point of view small things like that didn't go for us. The pundit - Paul Merson \"It was a walk in the park then second half it was all West Ham. They get a penalty and Lanzini misses it, if that had gone in it would have been a game changer. Rooney netted his first hat-trick in five years \"Then you see one of the goals of the season from Rooney. He drills it like he hit it with a seven iron. \"But West Ham. Wow.\" Opta stats Rooney's hat-trick tonight came 2272 days since his last (10th September 2011) - the longest gap between two hat-tricks by a player in Premier League history. Rooney's hat-trick goal was from 58 yards out - the furthest out that a Premier League goal has been scored since April 4th 2015 (Charlie Adam for Stoke at Chelsea). This was only the second time that David Unsworth managed to win of his eight competitive games in caretaker charge of Everton following the sacking of Ronald Koeman in October (W2 D1 L5). West Ham didn't attempt a single shot in this game until the 52nd minute of the match - the third longest wait by a team in a Premier League game this season. Wayne Rooney scored his first hat-trick for Everton and bagged the third in spectacular fashion. After Joe Hart's clearance Rooney scored with a first time strike from inside his own half.

Southampton Manchester City 2-1 Southampton Raheem Sterling scored a dramatic late winner to help Manchester City beat Southampton 2-1 at the Etihad on Wednesday night and set a new club record of 12 Premier League wins in a row. City opened the scoring thanks to Kevin De Bruyne's driven free-kick which somehow made its way into the back of the net 77 seconds after half-time. However, Southampton midfielder Oriol Romeu's composed finish levelled matters 15 minutes from time, only for the home side to snatch all three points with the last kick of the game when Sterling curled home an exquisite winner. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Kompany (6), Otamendi (6), Delph (6), Gundogan (6), De Bruyne (7), Fernandinho (7), Sterling (8), Aguero (6), Jesus (6) Subs: Bernardo Silva (6), David Silva (6) Southamoton: Forster (9), Soares (8), Yoshida (8), Hoedt (7), Van Dijk (7), Bertrand (7), Romeu (7), Hojbjerg (7), Lemina (7), Redmond (6), Long (6) Subs: Austin (6), Boufal (8), McQueen (6) Man of the match: Fraser Forster As a result, Pep Guardiola's side remain eight points clear of Manchester United at the top of the table, while the Saints are still in 11th place. City started the contest at their usual frenetic pace, although it was actually the visitors who created the first real opening of the half just before the quarter-hour mark. Nathan Redmond's right-wing corner was flicked on at the near post by captain Maya Yoshida, only for his central-defensive partner Wesley Hoedt to head against the bar from a few yards out. City then immediately broke upfield and worked the ball to Sterling on the left and after the winger had cut inside and tested Fraser Forster with a low effort, the goalkeeper did well to get up and keep out Gabriel Jesus' shot from the rebound. Manchester City players celebrate after taking the lead However, it was the Saints who went in disappointed at the break after spurning another presentable opening 10 minutes before half-time, and again it was a corner that caused City's back line problems. Virgil van Dijk rose highest to head the ball on, but Yoshida volleyed wastefully over the bar when it seemed easier to score. And the visitors were made to pay for that miss within seconds of the second period when De Bruyne's free kick from near the left-hand touchline was deflected past Forster by Van Dijk. Southampton would not lie down, though, and after riding their luck on several occasions, drew level after some lovely skill in the area by substitute Sofiane Boufal, whose pull back was swept home from close range by the unmarked Romeu. Team news City made two changes from Sunday's win at Huddersfield, with Jesus and Gundogan replacing David Silva and Sane, with the latter ill and not among the substitutes. Southampton made five alterations from the team that beat Everton, with Yoshida, Romeu, Lemina, Redmond and Long coming in for Davis, Austin, Tadic, Boufal and Ward-Prowse. But as the game entered its sixth minute of injury time, Sterling and De Bruyne played a one-two on the edge of the area, before the England forward beat Forster with a brilliant effort into the top right-hand corner of the goal to spark jubilant scenes, his second late winner in the space of three days. Opta stats City's haul of 40 points from their first 14 Premier League games this season is the joint-best tally ever at this stage of a top-flight campaign (also Tottenham in 1960/61 - based on three points for a win). Southampton have picked up just one point from their last seven Premier League visits to the Etihad Since his Premier League debut for City in September 2015, De Bruyne has had a hand in 51 goals in the competition (17 goals, 34 assists), more than any other midfielder in that time. Romeu netted his first goals in his last 19 Premier League appearances, since netting against Chelsea in April Sterling has been directly involved in 12 goals in his last 13 competitive appearances for Manchester City (10 goals, two assists) David Silva and Pep Guardiola celebrate Raheem Sterling's winner Man of the Match - Fraser Forster As expected, the giant goalkeeper was a busy man at the Etihad, although sadly for the Saints his heroics in goal were not enough to earn his side a point. The England international had to be on his toes to deny City in the first half, with his best stop one to keep out Raheem Sterling's drive. And it was more of the same after the break as the shot-stopper defied the likes of Gabriel Jesus, Kevin De Bruyne and finally Fernandinho with a succession of impressive saves. And on that kind of form, England boss Gareth Southgate could very well take Forster on the plane to Russia 2018… Oriol Romeu celebrates his equaliser Managers Pep Guardiola: \"We have to be fair, the first half they had chances in the set pieces always, the first goal came from a throw-in. But we controlled the counterattack, we created chances enough to win the game. And by far we deserved to win the game. \"We celebrated with all the staff and players because we have to celebrate these kind of emotions and we are here for that. Of course, we will not lift the title as all the contenders won, but it is not enough. So when you live these kind of experiences, you have to do it, tomorrow rest and then we will prepare for West Ham on Sunday.\" Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says his players and staff celebrated their last gasp win over Southampton together in the dressing room but admitted their opponents were difficult to play against. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says his players and staff celebrated their last gasp win over Southampton together in the dressing room but admitted their opponents were difficult to play against. Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It is difficult to digest when you play 99.9 per cent of the game more or less in the way we planned before. But they have a lot of quality, they do not need too much to score. \"They scored an amazing goal and we have to congratulate the opponent. And we have to be proud in the way we competed against a really, really good side, and maybe at this moment one of the best team in the world. But at the same time we have to use this game as were really competitive and thinking about the future we can play against stronger teams, and we can be really, really difficult for them.\" Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino says their pre-match plan almost worked after they lost to Manchester City in stoppage time.

Liverpool Stoke 0-3 Liverpool Substitute Mohamed Salah scored twice as Liverpool comfortably beat Stoke 3-0 at the bet365 Stadium in the Premier League on Wednesday. Sadio Mane gave Liverpool the lead (17) with a neat finish from Dominic Solanke's set-up, but later in the first half Stoke felt Simon Mignolet should have been sent off rather than booked for taking out Mame Biram Diouf on the edge of the box. Stoke had two clear chances to equalise through former Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen in the second half, but Liverpool rounded off the win through substitute Salah's fine volley (77) and neat finish (83) after coming on in the 67th minute. Sadio Mane lifts the ball over Lee Grant to open the scoring at the bet365 Stadium Player ratings Stoke City: Grant (5), Martins Indi (5), Zouma (5), Shawcross (5), Pieters (4), Fletcher (5), Allen (5), Shaqiri (5), Diouf (4), Crouch (5), Choupo-Moting (5) Subs: Jese (5), Adam (NA) Liverpool: Mignolet (6), Gomez (7), Lovren (6), Matip (6), Moreno (6), Can (6), Wijnaldum (7), Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Firmino (6), Mane (7), Solanke (7) Subs: Salah (8), Milner (6), Henderson (NA) Man of the match: Mo Salah The result means Liverpool are up to fifth in the Premier League, while Stoke go down to 16th, three points clear of the drop zone. Liverpool scored with the first real chance of the game as Joe Gomez's centre at the byline fell to Solanke, who played in Mane to apply the finish over Lee Grant from six yards. Stoke felt the ball from Gomez had gone out of play, but replays show the whole ball was not over the line. Solanke missed a chance to make it 2-0, forcing a save out of Grant from just inside the box in space, before a controversial moment late in the half. Team news Dominic Solanke started his first Premier League game for Liverpool, while Philippe Coutinho and Mo Salah dropped to the bench. There were six changes in total for Jurgen Klopp's side, with Dejan Lovren, Emre Can, Gini Wijnaldum, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino coming in.For Stoke, Bruno Martins Indi and Peter Crouch replaced Kevin Wimmer and Ramadan Sobhi. Sadio Mane celebrates his goal with team-mates After rushing out of his box for a 50/50 with Diouf, Mignolet caught the Stoke man without playing the ball on the edge, but referee Martin Atkinson showed a booking rather than a red, despite the fact Diouf was denied a clear goalscoring opportunity. Mane came close to a second moments later, hitting the post after beating the Stoke offside trap, before Allen missed two fine chances to equalise after the break from inside the box. Premier League top scorer Salah came on with 23 minutes remaining and made an instant impact, volleying home from 12 yards after Mane's fine work on the right byline. Salah got his second moments later, capitalising on Erik Pieters' mistake to slot under Grant, his 17th goals in all competitions this season and extending Liverpool's unbeaten run to seven. Roberto Firmino takes the ball away from Joe Allen Man of the match - Mohamed Salah After resting some star names against Chelsea on Saturday, Jurgen Klopp made more changes as Salah was named on the bench, but that didn't stop the Egyptian adding to his tally for the season. Full of energy, Salah made an instant impact with his fine, controlled volley for 2-0, and there was absolutely no doubt where the ball was heading when he went through on goal late on for the third. Salah has arguably been the signing of the season in the Premier League, and he'll be key as Liverpool look for domestic and European success. Mohamed Salah celebrates his second and Liverpool's third goal The managers Mark Hughes: \"Diouf has nicked the ball and the keeper has wiped him out and should have been sent off clearly. At that point if we had got that, even if we had scored and they had remained at 11, we still would have been back in the game. That was a huge moment for us. Mark Hughes says Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet should have seen red Mark Hughes says Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet should have seen red \"The least we should have had was a clear run on goal and in my view the keeper should have been sent off and they should have been down to 10 men. Given the way we were playing at the point I think we would have gone on to make it really difficult for them. As it was we were constantly chasing the game. Jurgen Klopp: \"I don't think [Mignolet should have been sent off]. I was pretty sure in that moment that it was a yellow card, it was outside of the 18-yard box, and I saw two players in our shirt in a better position than the goalscorer, that's how it looked for me. I don't think that it looked like that for any of the Stoke fans.\" Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was delighted with his side's victory Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp was delighted with his side's victory Opta stats Liverpool have lost just one of their last 10 Premier League games, winning five and drawing four. Liverpool have now made 48 changes to their starting XI this season in the Premier League, 11 more than any other side (Everton next on 37). Sadio Mane scored for the first time in six Premier League games for Liverpool, ending his longest top-flight goal-drought with the Reds (five games).

Brighton had goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to thank for keeping the game goalless in the 14th minute when Christian Benteke flicked the ball into Wilfried Zaha, who laid it back to the Belgian and the striker's toe poke was parried by the Australian into the path of the winger but Ryan reacted well to get up and stop his shot. Lewis Dunk should have done better when he leapt highest to get on the end of an Anthony Knockaert corner but his header went straight at Wayne Hennessey, who gladly held onto the ball. The only other notable chance of the opening half was when Jose Izquierdo received the ball inside the box and curled an effort on goal but Hennessey palmed the shot away for Dale Stephens to fire well wide. Ruben Loftus-Cheek chases a loose ball under pressure from Davy Propper Glenn Murray came closest after the break when he battled with Joel Ward in the box to get on the end of a Knockhaert corner but his header was blocked. Set-pieces looked the most like route for a Brighton goal, as the hosts earned 10 corners during the match with Dunk and Shane Duffy missing chances after the break from set-pieces as the hosts struggled to create chances from open play. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (8), Bruno (6), Dunk (7), Duffy (6), Suttner (7), Knockaert (7), Stephens (6), Propper (6), Izquierdo (7), Gross (6), Murray (6) Subs: Hemed (6), March (6), Brown (6) Palace: Hennessey (7), Ward (6), Tomkins (6), Sakho (7), Schlupp (6), Townsend (6), Loftus-Cheek (6), Milivojevc (7), Cabaye (6), Zaha (7), Benteke (6) Subs: McArthur (6) Man of the match: Mathew Ryan The match was punctuated by a number of pyrotechnics going off in the away end as the Palace supporters made their own entertainment to make up for the lack of interest on the pitch. Palace boss Roy Hodgson will be pleased the returning Benteke was able to get through 90 minutes in his first game since the manager's arrival at Selhurst Park, even though the Belgian failed to influence the game. Team news Roy Hodgson called upon a central striker from the start for the first time in a while as Christian Benteke made the starting XI. He replaced McArthur in the team in Palace's only change.There were two changes for Brighton as Suttner and Izquierdo came into the team for Bong and March. Brighton fans thought they should have had a penalty in injury time when Dunk seemed to be pulled down by Mamadou Sakho but Andre Marriner waved away the appeals, ensuring the game finished goalless. It was a hard-fought encounter The result was Palace's first away point of the season but they remain bottom of the table, equal on nine points with Swansea, whereas Brighton drop down to 10th place. Opta stats Brighton have never lost a top-flight match against Crystal Palace, conceding just three goals in the five meetings at this level (W3 D2). Crystal Palace have failed to find the net in nine consecutive away Premier League games, although this was the first game in that run in which they have avoided defeat (D1 L8). However, this was the Eagles' first Premier League clean sheet this season; they are last of the 20 sides in the division to achieve a shut-out. Roy Hodgson's side have now failed to score in each of their opening seven away league games of the season; only Derby County (eight games in 2007/08) have had a longer wait for an away goal at the start of a Premier League campaign. Indeed, this is Crystal Palace's worst points tally after the opening 14 games of a league season (nine) since 2000/01 in the second-tier (eight points). Christian Benteke has now gone 10 Premier League games without a goal; he has only gone longer without scoring in the competition once before (11 games ending in January 2014 for Aston Villa). A number of fireworks were set off The managers Chris Hughton: \"Did we do enough to win the game? Probably not. Certainly they didn't play well enough to win it either, so on reflection it's a decent result. \"He [Ryan] has been very good for us, especially in recent games, when he hasn't had much to do but the way he's made very good saves. I also thought we had some very good opportunities from Izquierdo and Pascal Gross on the cutback. \"The longer the game went it seemed like it was going to be a stalemate. It was going to either be a mistake or a set piece which put it into someone's favour. \"It was almost a bit of a nervous type of game. I don't think either side played to the levels they're capable of, so it didn't really go with the type of flow these games do.\" Roy Hodgson: \"To be fair they're flying, aren't they Brighton? It's a derby game so a clean sheet is good as we've not been blessed with those and it's the first one since I've come to the club at least. \"I think a draw is a fair result at the end of the day and I am pleased we've come through it and particular that we've kept a clean sheet which is a bigger bonus than a 1-1 or 2-2 would have been. \"There was plenty of tension in the game and both teams certainly wanted to win the game but we had to settle for a 0-0. \"It looked as though we were going to score - Christian Benteke got to the ball quickly and then when it fell to Wilf we were hoping he'd beat the 'keeper but he made a good save.\" Man of the match - Mathew Ryan The Brighton goalkeeper was responsible for the moment for real quality in the game when he made his double save early in the match, repelling both Benteke and Zaha. The Australia No 1 also dealt with the Palace half-chances without fuss and his distribution was faultless throughout, nor was he distracted by the fireworks behind his goal. What next? Brighton will host Liverpool on Saturday at 3pm, while Palace will visit fellow strugglers West Brom at the same time."}, {"date": "28/11/2018", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31950,

stunning goals from Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez helped Leicester battle to a 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Tuesday. Vardy opened the scoring (13) with a sumptuous first-time volley before Mahrez added a second just before the break (45+1) with an inch-perfect curler from the edge of the box. Christian Eriksen was guilty of missing a sitter before Harry Kane pulled one back (79) following an assist from Erik Lamela, who came on to make his first appearance for Spurs in 13 months. Fernando Llorente then volleyed over from six yards out as Leicester held on to pick up their fourth league win of the season and inflict a fourth defeat on Spurs, who remain 13 points behind leaders Manchester City. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (8), Simpson (7), Morgan (7), Maguire (8), Chilwell (7), Albrighton (7), Ndidi (7), Iborra (8), Mahrez (7), Vardy (8), Okazaki (6) Subs: Gray (6), Choudhury (6), Slimani (N/A) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Aurier (6), Vertonghen (5), Sanchez (6), Rose (6), Dier (5), Dembele (5), Sissoko (5), Alli (5), Eriksen (5), Kane (6) Subs: Son (6), Llorente (5), Lamela (6) Man of the match: Vicente Iborra Leicester took the lead thanks to a fine finish from Vardy, who allowed the ball to drop over his shoulder from Marc Albrighton's cross before looping it over Hugo Lloris from barely 10 yards out. Spurs almost hit back immediately, but Kasper Schmeichel took the sting out of Moussa Sissoko's attempt before Vicente Iborra rushed back to make a goal-line clearance. It was then Dele Alli's turn to be denied by Schmeichel, with the Dane getting down low to keep out the midfielder's effort. Team news For Leicester, Ben Chilwell came in for Christian Fuchs, who was out on parental leave, while Shinji Okazaki replaced Demarai Gray. Spurs made four changes, with Serge Aurier, Danny Rose, Mousa Dembele and Moussa Sissoko all handed starts. The hosts were punished for those missed opportunities just before half-time when Mahrez burst down the wing before cutting onto his left and curling a beauty past Lloris. The second half saw Spurs throw everything at Leicester, but Eriksen could not reduce the deficit when shanking an effort with his right foot when he should have gone with his left. Erik Lamela assisted Harry Kane two minutes after coming on to make his first appearance since October 2016 Three minutes later, Kane pulled one back for Spurs after firing into the top corner from Lamela's threaded ball through for the striker. A nervy finish then saw Llorente send a volley over at the back post before Danny Rose's claims for a penalty were correctly waved away by referee Anthony Taylor. Opta stats Leicester recorded their first home Premier League victory over Spurs since beating them on the final day of the 2001/02 season at Filbert Street.

The Spaniard made a vital goal-line clearance in the first half, while his 11 clearances - four more than any other player - were vital on what was ultimately a frustrating night for Spurs, who came up against a dogged Leicester side. Vicente Iborra put in a commanding performance as Leicester frustrated Spurs at the King Power The pundit - Matt Murray \"It was an outstanding game from start to finish, but the quality of the goals was simply lovely. Mauricio Pochettino will be concerned about losing a game again and they could be 16 points behind Manchester City going into the weekend's game against Watford. From a Leicester point of view they were fantastic.\" The managers Claude Puel: \"It was a big win with quality. It was a fantastic game for us. In the first 30 minutes we tried to play on the floor as well as play on the counter-attack. Leicester City boss Claude Puel says it was a big win for his side full of quality after beating Tottenham.

It was a very good game and it's important to continue this hard work on the pitch in the training sessions. It's just one game but it's promising.\" Mauricio Pochettino: \"The second half we were more aggressive and started to play the game. We were critical of ourselves at half-time and it's difficult to start the way we did and win games. \"We were so poor in our performance.

Man Utd Ashley Young scored two superb goals before Manchester United held off a second-half Watford fightback to win 4-2 at Vicarage Road in the Premier League. Young gave United the lead against the run of play with a fine half volley from 20 yards (19), before the former Watford midfielder struck again, this time a superb 25-yard free-kick into the top left corner (25). It was 3-0 minutes later through Anthony Martial's stroked finish, but United stepped off the gas in the second half, allowing Troy Deeney to pull one back from the penalty spot (77). Young is congratulated on scoring his second goal of the game by Paul Pogba Player ratings Watford: Gomes (7), Kiko Femenia (6), Prodl (5), Mariappa (5), Kabasele (5), Zeegelaar (6), Cleverley (5), Doucoure (6), Hughes (5), Gray (5), Richarlison (6) Subs: Pereyra (6), Carrillo (6), Deeney (6) Man Utd: De Gea (6), Valencia (6), Lindelof (7), Rojo (6), Smalling (6), Young (8), Pogba (6), Matic (5), Lingard (7), Lukaku (5), Martial (6) Subs: Herrera (5), Rashford (5), Ibrahimovic (NA) Man of the match: Ashley Young Abdoulaye Doucoure poked home (84) to seemingly make for a nervy ending, but Jesse Lingard's solo strike (86), a contender for goal of the season so far, made sure of the three points. The result means United have closed the gap to leaders Man City to five points before their clash with Southampton on Wednesday. Watford stay eighth, two points off the top six. Young opened the scoring with a fierce snapshot on the half volley from the edge of the box from Lingard's pass, the ball flying into the bottom corner past Heurelho Gomes. Team news Jose Mourinho made two changes from the side that beat Brighton on Saturday; Lingard came in for Rashford, and United opted for an extra defender as Rojo replaced Mata. There was just the one change for the hosts as Prodl replaced Britos in defence. Young scores his second goal from a free-kick Young, who played at Vicarage Road between 2003 and 2007, then struck an outstanding 25-yard free-kick into the top left corner to give United what earlier seemed an unlikely two-goal lead. Martial made it 3-0, latching onto Romelu Lukaku's through ball and stroking low past Gomes from inside the box, and it should have been four before the break but for Gomes' world class double save, first from Lukaku's long-range effort, and then more impressively from Lingard's close-range follow up. Richarlison's header hit the bar on the stroke of half-time, while Lukaku fluffed a clear chance in the second half from point-blank range, and then struck just wide from an acute angle. Anthony Martial celebrates with team-mates after extending Man Utd's lead at Vicarage Road Watford were given a route back into the game as Marcos Rojo upended Roberto Pereyra near the byline, allowing sub Deeney to score from the spot, and it looked as though we were in for a nervy finish as Doucoure directed a first-time effort past David de Gea from 15 yards with six minutes remaining. But Lingard sealed the win two minutes later, picking the ball up inside his own half and brilliantly skipping past three Watford challenges before slotting low past Gomes. Opta stats Manchester United have won eight of their nine Premier League games against Watford (L1), scoring at least two goals on seven occasions. United have scored 32 goals and conceded just eight in the Premier League this term - their goal difference of +24 is their best at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 2000/01 when they won the title (+26). Ashley Young scored his first Premier League double at Vicarage Road since October 2006, while playing for Watford as a 21-year-old (v Fulham). Anthony Martial has scored eight goals in all competitions for Manchester United this term (20th appearance); already equalling his tally from the whole of last season (eight in 42). Abdoulaye Doucoure brought Watford back to within a goal of United in the final moments The managers Marco Silva: \"We scored the first goal from a penalty and for me in that moment it was a second yellow card for Marcos Rojo, with 11 against 10 it would be really difficult for them. \"We made it difficult for them because we scored the second goal. Imagine if it was 11 v 10 at that moment. We started to create more problems for them, but then one counter attack from them and we should do different in that moment.\" Jose Mourinho: \"I prefer to forget the five minutes where we conceded the goals and lost concentration, I prefer to focus on all the good things we did. We were in control and really dangerous in attacking situations. To play away from home and score four goals is really good. \"It's a good lesson [for the players], and it's good to have lessons without losing points. Maybe next time we are winning 2-0 or 3-0 the players will remember.\" WATFORD, ENGLAND - NOVEMBER 28: Marcos Rojo of Manchester United in discussion with referee Jonathan Moss during the Premier League match between Watford Man of the match - Ashley Young The Hertfordshire-born Young has enjoyed something of a second coming under Jose Mourinho, but his role at left wing-back is not just restricted to repeatedly running the line. His first goal came out of nowhere, a snapshot from 20 yards which caught Gomes off guard, and his second was a pinpoint free-kick from range. He did his defensive work too, something Mourinho has repeatedly praised the 32-year-old for, and Young has proven in recent weeks that he has plenty to give as United chase the title. The pundit - Kevin Nolan on Soccer Special \"In the first 20 to 25 minutes Watford looked the more likely side, but there were three moments of magic from Manchester United. At 3-0 down, Marco Silva was sitting on the bench stunned. In the second half, United never found the quality and Romelu Lukaku seems to be lacking confidence around the goal area.\" What's next Manchester United now travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal on Saturday at 5.30pm, before hosting CSKA Moscow in their final Champions League group clash on Tuesday.

"2:51 West Brom 2-2 Newcastle West Brom 2-2 Newcastle Newcastle fought back from 2-0 down to snatch a point against West Brom at The Hawthorns to end a run of four straight Premier League defeats on Tuesday night West Brom opened the scoring in first-half injury time when Hal Robson-Kanu headed in Kieran Gibbs' left-wing centre, before doubling their lead when Sam Field volleyed home 11 minutes after half-time. However, if caretaker West Brom manager Gary Megson - who is expected to give way to Alan Pardew on Wednesday - thought his side were set for their first league win since August, he was mistaken as the visitors responded immediately through Ciaran Clark's header. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (8), Nyom (6), Gibbs (7), Evans (8), Hegazi (7), Livermore (6), Phillips (9), Barry (7), Field (8), Robson-Kanu (8), Rondon (7) Subs: Yacob (7), McClean (7), Krychowiak (6) Newcastle: Darlow (7), Clark (6), Mbemba (6), Lejeune (6), Yedlin (6), Murphy (6), Ritchie (8), Hayden (6), Merino (6), Perez (6), Joselu (5) Subs: Shelvey (8), Aarons (7), Mitrovic (7) Man of the match: Matt Phillips And Newcastle completed their unlikely comeback when with seven minutes to go Jonny Evans deflected Matt Ritchie's free-kick past a helpless Ben Foster at his near post. As a result, Rafa Benitez's team have moved up to 12th in the table, while the Baggies are now two points from safety in 16th. Both teams went into the game horribly out of form and in desperate need of a win, and that was reflected in what was a disjointed and largely uneventful first half. Ciaran Clark pulled a goal back for Newcastle before Evans' own goal completed the comeback Salomon Rondon came closest to breaking the deadlock after letting fly from distance, but the Venezuela international's effort beat Karl Darlow, making his first Premier League start of the season, only to clip the top of the bar. However, with the first period entering stoppage time, West Brom took the lead following the best move of the half as Evans' gorgeous cross-field pass picked out Gibbs' run down the left touchline. The left-back then strode forward to the byline, before crossing accurately for Robson-Kanu - in for Jay Rodriguez up front - to head past Darlow from six yards out. Team news Gary Megson made one change from the draw at Spurs, with Hal Robson-Kanu replacing Jay Rodriguez. Newcastle made five alterations from their 3-0 loss to Watford, with Karl Darlow, Chancel Mbemba, Ayoze Perez, Isaac Hayden and Mikel Merino all recalled. And West Brom soon found themselves in dreamland as from Matt Phillips's inch-perfect cross from the right, Field, 19, connected at the far post for his first-ever senior goal. But within three minutes Newcastle had reduced the deficit as Clark headed home Ritchie's right-wing corner, before completing a remarkable turnaround when Evans inadvertently diverted the Newcastle midfielder's driven free-kick past his own goalkeeper. Opta stats West Brom have won two of their last three home league games against Newcastle, as many as in their previous 12 matches combined Newcastle won their last Premier League meeting with the Baggies back in February 2016 - they last won consecutive PL games against them in October 2012 under Alan Pardew West Brom have scored just seven goals in their last nine Premier League games against Newcastle and have never scored more than once in a match in this run Newcastle have secured just one win and six points in their last 17 Premier League games away from home (W1 D3 L13) Hal Robson-Kanu opens the scoring at The Hawthorns Managers Gary Megson: \"The disappointing thing was the manner of their goals - we have scored two good, well-worked goals, and we supposed to be a big side that is good at crosses. And we conceded from that and they were awful goals for us to give away. \"And you can imagine the level of disappointment that is now in there, but we have to pick ourselves up and go again on Thursday morning when they come back in. \"The huge disappointment for me and everybody is that is eight points we have now given away from winning positions and not when we were handing on, games we should win. And we would now be sitting on 20 points, rather than the 12 we have got.\" West Brom caretaker boss Gary Megson says tiredness played a part as they were pegged back by Newcastle in a 2-2 draw.

You have to make sure you are more focused in the last minute of the half. \"The reaction of the team was good, but then another cross and we had another lack of concentration, but still I could see the team fighting.\" Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez says his players gave everything to comeback from 2-0 down to draw with West Brom. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez says his players gave everything to comeback from 2-0 down to draw with West Brom. Man of the Match - Matt Phillips The West Brom midfielder was a bundle of energy throughout with his buccaneering runs down the right flank, causing the Magpies no end of problems. And the Scotland international's best moment came 11 minutes into the second half when he wrapped his right foot around a cross from the touchline to create a chance that Sam Field gratefully accepted at the far post. West Brom's Ahmed Hegazy challenges Newcastle's Joselu The pundit - Tony Cottee \"Alan Pardew would be pleased with West Brom going forward while the goals they conceded, one from a corner and one from a free kick, you can work on things like that. It was a poor first half and it didn't look like either team was capable of scoring a goal until the stroke of half-time. Towards the end, Newcastle looked like the only side who were going to win the game.\" What's next? West Brom host Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon, while Newcastle travel to champions Chelsea earlier in the day in a match you can see live on Sky Sports Premier League."}, {"date": "26/11/2018",

Everton Southampton 4-1 Everton Southampton heaped more misery on Everton with an emphatic 4-1 victory at St Mary's in the Premier League on Super Sunday. Charlie Austin scored two second-half headers (52, 58) after Gylfi Sigurdsson's brilliant effort (45) had earlier cancelled out Dusan Tadic's 18th-minute opener for the home side - before Steven Davis curled in a late fourth with a fine finish three minutes from time. Everton have now won only one of their last 12 matches in all competitions and remain 16th in the Premier League, two points above the relegation zone, while Southampton climb to 10th. Player ratings Southampton: Forster (7), Soares (8), Hoedt (6), Van Dijk (6), Bertrand (7), Davis (6), Hojbjerg (6), Tadic (8), Boufal (8), Ward-Prowse (7), Austin (8). Subs: Lemina (6), Long (6), Yoshida (6) Everton: Pickford (6), Kenny (6), Keane (6), Jagielka (6), Baines (6), Gueye (5), Schneiderlin (6), Lennon (6), Sigurdsson (7), Mirallas (6), Calvert-Lewin (5). Subs: Williams (6), Lookman (7), Vlasic (6) Man of the match: Charlie Austin Austin, starting a Premier League game for the first time this season, would have a hat-trick to his name if he'd converted one of two good chances in the opening 12 minutes. Firstly, he scuffed a presentable chance over the bar following a corner, before striking the post from seven yards as he attempted to steer home a Cedric Soares cut-back. But the opener arrived on 18 minutes when Tadic received Ryan Bertrand's through-ball and took one touch to fend off Leighton Baines before deftly slipping the ball past Jordan Pickford with his left foot. Dusan Tadic opened the scoring for Southampton Southampton dominated the first 45 minutes, but Sigurdsson conjured up a sensational Everton equaliser just before the break, curling home from 20 yards with the ball dramatically striking the bar, the post and the bar again before crossing the line. Team news Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg made only his second Southampton appearance of the season in place of the suspended Oriol Romeu with James Ward-Prowse and Charlie Austin also coming into the side. Dominic Calvert-Lewin started up front for Everton following Oumar Niasse’s retrospective ban for diving. However, the game was ultimately settled by two simple headed goals shortly after half-time. Austin restored Southampton's lead within seven minutes of the restart, steering a close-range header across Pickford from Bertrand's left-wing cross. And things got even worse for Everton when Idrissa Gueye lost possession six minutes later, affording Tadic time and space on the left to cross for Austin to head in his second and Southampton's third. Southampton's Charlie Austin (2nd left) celebrates scoring his side's second goal with his team-mates The fourth arrived in the 87th minute when Davis curled past Pickford from the edge of the area after excellent work from James Ward-Prowse and Soares in the build-up. Wayne Rooney remained a frustrated observer from the substitutes' bench as Southampton cruised to victory and with David Unsworth picking up just four points from his four league games in charge, Everton's need to appoint a new full-time manager now seems more urgent than ever. Man of the Match - Charlie Austin On his first Premier League start of the season, Charlie Austin was man of the match. On his first Premier League start of the season, Charlie Austin was man of the match. Austin's eight previous Premier League appearances this season had all come from the bench and the striker evidently had a point to prove after being awarded a rare start by Mauricio Pellegrino. He made that point in style and despite spurning two early chances, he settled this match with two textbook headers shortly after the break. Sky Sports' commentator Alan Smith picked him out as the shining light in a Southampton team full of impressive performers, saying: \"There have been plenty of candidates; Bertrand, Boufal and Tadic have all done really well, but Austin was the matchwinner with the second and third goals to take the match away from Everton. They were superb goals.\" David Unsworth says Everton fans will rightly be furious after their 4-1 defeat. David Unsworth says Everton fans will rightly be furious after their 4-1 defeat. The managers Mauricio Pellegrino (Southampton): \"Austin has trained much, much better in the last few weeks and I think he deserved his chance. You have to be ready because you never know when the manager will need you to be ready.\" David Unsworth (Everton): \"I can't stand here and defend the players today. It was a totally unacceptable performance, especially in the second half, and the Everton fans are quite rightly going to be furious with that but so am I. It's not good enough for our football club.\" The pundit - Andy Hinchcliffe \"With Everton, there's no defensive urgency. There's no urgency to get blocks in and stop the opposition doing what they want to do. There's no game plan either going forward or defensively and I'm struggling to work out what Everton are looking to do with the team they put out. \"They are talking about getting another manager in but the problem is the personnel they've got. What XI can you put out to maybe grind out a 0-0 draw, maybe to outplay the opposition? Like I said, Everton have no game plan and they can't seem to do anything well so you can get Marco Silva in, you could even get Pep Guardiola in but what on earth would he do with that bunch of players?\" Mauricio Pellegrino says Southampton’s win over a beleaguered Everton will be good for confidence.

"2:56 Burnley 0-1 Arsenal Burnley 0-1 Arsenal Alexis Sanchez kept his cool to convert a penalty in second-half stoppage time to hand Arsenal a 1-0 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor. Arsenal won both their league games against Burnley last season thanks to injury-time winners and they did so again after James Tarkowski was penalised for a push on Aaron Ramsey. Burnley rattled the post through Johann Gudmundsson while Jack Wilshere's deflected effort ten minutes from time was the closest Arsenal came until Sanchez sealed the win with virtually the last kick of the game. The result means that Arsenal have leapfrogged local rivals Tottenham into fourth place while Burnley remain seventh. Player ratings Burnley: Pope (6), Lowton (6), Tarkowski (6), Mee (7), Ward (6), Gudmundsson (7), Hendrick (6), Cork (7), Defour (6), Brady (7), Barnes (6) Subs: Wood (N/A) Arsenal: Cech (7), Mustafi (6), Koscielny (6), Monreal (6), Bellerin (6), Ramsey (7), Xhaka (6), Kolasinac (7), Iwobi (5), Sanchez (7), Lacazette (6) Subs: Wilshere (7), Welbeck (N/A) Man of the match: Ben Mee Gudmundsson had the first meaningful chance of the afternoon, skipping beyond Nacho Monreal inside the area before lashing a shot onto the post with his weaker right foot. Replays showed that Petr Cech managed to get fingertips on the effort and it was an outstanding save. Arsenal were unable to muster a single shot on target in the first half but Ramsey certainly should have tested Nick Pope in goal when he side-footed over the bar from inside the box after good work from Alexandre Lacazette down the left wing. Robbie Brady capped his Burnley debut with a wonderful free-kick goal against Chelsea in February and from virtually the same position he drew another good save from Cech with the veteran 'keeper sprawling to divert the ball away from the top corner. Team news Sean Dyche elected to name the same side that beat Swansea 2-0 last weekend which meant that Ashley Barnes continued up front in place of Chris Wood.Arsene Wenger made just one solitary change to the team that beat Spurs 2-0 with Alex Iwobi replacing Mesut Ozil who missed out due to illness. Gudmundsson was lively throughout and he tested Cech with another effort from distance as he cut in from the right and shot powerfully, although the Arsenal keeper read his intentions and made the save look relatively comfortable. Chances were at a premium in the second half but the introduction of Wilshere for the ineffective Alex Iwobi at least gave Arsenal fresh impetus in midfield and the substitute went close to breaking the deadlock late on as his shot cannoned off Tarkowski and spiralled just wide. .@premierleague most points won in last 10 mins this season: 6 - Watford 5 - Arsenal 4 - Burnley 4 - Everton 4 - Southampton pic.twitter.com/r4jj4GGi4l — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) November 26, 2017 It looked as though the two teams would have to settle for a share of the spoils before Arsenal were awarded a penalty in the final minute of stoppage time after Ramsey was upended by Tarkowski and Sanchez fired his penalty beyond the reach of Pope into the corner to hand Arsenal the win. OPTA Stats Arsenal extended their unbeaten run to 10 top-flight matches against Burnley (W7 D3). Burnley have now lost their last three home Premier League games against Arsenal by a 1-0 scoreline. The last three Premier League meetings between Burnley and Arsenal have seen the Gunners win with the winning goal scored in the 90th minute - on each of the last two occasions, the winning goal has been an Alexis Sanchez penalty. Arsenal will end the day inside the top four of the Premier League outside the month of August for the first time since March this year. Alexis Sanchez has scored four goals in his last five Premier League appearances against Burnley - he's only scored more against Sunderland (6) and Hull (7). Three of Arsenal's last four 1-0 away wins in the Premier League have come at Turf Moor. The managers Sean Dyche: \"To be honest it was highly unlikely it was not going to get given on a day like today. \"I take pride in the play. They are a fine side. We know they are a very technical side, to limit them to a few chances is very pleasing. \"So many parts of our performance were pleasing, it's hard to define sometimes how you don't get something from a game but we didn't today.\" Arsene Wenger: \"In the second half we upped the tempo and dominated much more, we created more chances and it was a question of finding the final ball, being patient and not making a mistake at the back. \"From the outside it looked 100 percent a penalty, I don't know why he pushed him with two hands in his back but it looked like a penalty. \"When you see how difficult it is to score against them it's a big result, you'd think that many clubs will drop points here.\" Man of the match - Ben Mee Burnley defended their penalty box doggedly throughout and nobody epitomised their effort more than Ben Mee who didn't put a foot wrong in the game. Mee made four blocks in total to deny Arsenal shots from close range and marked Lacazette imperiously throughout the game, alongside his partner James Tarkowski who was unfortunate to concede the penalty. He was mightily unlucky to be on the losing side. What's next? Burnley will be looking to bounce back from this defeat on Wednesday when they face in-form Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium while Arsenal are in action against Huddersfield at the Emirates on the

record-equalling winning streak with a 2-1 victory over Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium. Huddersfield had looked on course to repeat their famous victory over Manchester United when Christopher Schindler's header deflected in off Nicolas Otamendi in first-half stoppage-time. But Raheem Sterling's second-half cameo proved decisive as he won a penalty which Sergio Aguero converted on 47 minutes before the England international bundled home the winner with six minutes remaining. Aaron Mooy's late free-kick nearly snatched a point for Huddersfield - who had Rajiv van La Parra sent off at full-time following an altercation with Leroy Sane - but Pep Guardiola's men held on for an 11th consecutive Premier League victory to restore their eight-point lead at the top of the table. Team news David Wagner made three changes as Christopher Schindler returned from suspension alongside the recalled Jonathan Hogg and Tommy Smith. Nicolas Otamendi replaced the injured John Stones at the heart of the Manchester City defence, while Pep Guardiola’s other change saw Sergio Aguero get the nod up front ahead of Gabriel Jesus. On a bitterly cold afternoon in Yorkshire, City dominated the ball from the get-go and nearly made the perfect start, but Vincent Kompany headed wide from a corner on seven minutes before Aguero had an effort ruled out for offside six minutes later. Huddersfield went on to withstand a City onslaught and the pressure almost told on 34 minutes as Kevin De Bruyne released Aguero, but Schindler's last-gasp block kept the visitors at bay. City mounted a late charge before the interval as Otamendi fired over from the edge of the area as, while Jonas Lossl was on hand to deny Aguero, parrying his shot into the path of Raheem Sterling who pulled the rebound wide. For all of City's dominance, though, it was Huddersfield who took the lead. After Mathias Jorgensen headed wide, and Kompany came within inches of turning the ball into his own net, Schindler's near-post flick cannoned off Otamendi to send the raucous home support into raptures. However, Huddersfield's hopes of adding City to their list of high-profile Premier League scalps lasted just 117 seconds into the second half as Aguero converted a penalty after Scott Malone was penalised for a foul on Sterling. Sane rattled the Huddersfield crossbar with a free-kick on 57 minutes as City laid siege to the Huddersfield goal, and the pressure finally told as Lossl's save from Gabriel Jesus' effort rebounded off Sterling to complete the turnaround. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Smith (7), Malone (6), Schindler (8), Zanka (7), Hogg (7), Mooy (6), Van La Parra (7), Williams (6), Ince (6), Depoitre (6).

Man of the Match: Raheem Sterling Opta stats Manchester City have won their last 11 away matches in all competitions - a record for a top-flight club in English football history. City's 37-point tally after 13 games is the best return in the history of the Premier League - only one other side in top-flight history won as many as 37 (Liverpool in 1990/91, also 37). Man City recovered from a half-time deficit to win in an away Premier League game for the first time since April 1995 against Blackburn Rovers (3-2). Huddersfield have now lost five of their last seven Premier League games (W2), after losing just one of their first six. Sergio Aguero has scored against 31 of the 32 opponents he has faced in the Premier League, only failing to do so in one match against Bolton. Huddersfield were the first Premier League side since Crystal Palace against Watford in March to register a goal without having a shot on target in the match. Man of the Match - Raheem Sterling Sterling's impact was decisive. He salvaged thee points when City's unbeaten record was in real danger of coming up short against a resilient Huddersfield side. He won the penalty for Aguero's equaliser was in the right place to convert the winner, reward for a determined performance. What's next?

injury-time to give Crystal Palace a 2-1 win over Stoke. The Palace captain tapped home in the 92nd minute from two yards after a Yohan Cabaye shot had struck the base of the post to send Selhurst Park into raptures. Xherdan Shaqiri had given Stoke the lead when he collected the ball on the halfway line and ran straight at the Palace defence who didn't close the Stoke man down, allowing him to get to the edge of the area and curl a shot into the bottom corner from 18 yards out after 53 minutes. Team news Wayne Hennessey replaced Julian Speroni in goal following his issues in the draw with Everton last weekend. Stoke stuck with the same team that drew at Brighton, with Lee Grant continuing to deputise for the absent Jack Butland. Crystal Palace reacted well and were on level terms within three minutes when Andros Townsend sent in a cross which went beyond everyone until reaching Ruben Loftus-Cheek at the back post who calmly slotted home from close range. Ryan Shawcross should have won it late on for Stoke when he got on the end of a Shaqiri cross but the defender instead essentially cleared the ball rather than putting it into the back of the net from a yard, with his miss being compounded by Sakho's late winner. Christian Benteke had an impact off the bench The opening half was one devoid of quality in the final third with many attacks breaking down before anything of note could happen. Shaqiri had the best opportunity when Darren Fletcher found him with a pass over the top but the Swiss international got the ball stuck under his feet and could then only hit his shot from 10 yards straight at Wayne Hennessey. Player ratings Palace: Hennessey (7), Ward (7), Tomkins (7), Sakho (8), Schlupp (6), Milivojevic (7), Cabaye (7), McArthur (6), Loftus-Cheek (7), Townsend (7), Zaha (7).

The introduction of Christian Benteke at the break was key for Palace who finally had a focal point going forward, allowing Zaha to have far more freedom going forward too. Despite just their second victory of the season, Palace remain bottom of the table, one point behind Swansea. Opta stats Crystal Palace are unbeaten in their five Premier League home games against Stoke, winning four and drawing one. Mamadou Sakho's goal was the first 90th minute winner Crystal Palace have scored at home in the Premier League since Clinton Morrison's strike against Sheffield Wednesday in May 1998. This was Sakho's third goal in the Premier League and his first since April 2016. Shaqiri netted his 10th goal in the Premier League and the seventh from outside the box (70 per cent) - only five players have scored a higher percentage of their goals in the competition from outside the area (min. 10 goals). Ruben Loftus-Cheek scored his first Premier League goal for Crystal Palace in what was his ninth appearance for them. Roy Hodgson has won his last two Premier League matches versus Stoke as a manager, after winning just one of his first seven (W1 D2 L4). The managers Roy Hodgson: \"Today is the day fortune smiles on us and we get that last-minute winner and it really is worth its weight in gold, that goal, as the extra points lift you that little bit further up the table, that little bit closer to some sort of safety. It gives us something to build on as we've been bemoaning our fate that we've not had an awful lot of luck in these last four or five games but we can't do that today as luck was definitely with us today.\" Mark Hughes: \"We didn't deserve to lose, but we didn't defend correctly on two occasions and you're going to get punished and that's the story of the game, really. It should have should have been about a fantastic individual goal from Xherdan Shaqiri who put us in a winning position once again but unfortunately we weren't able to keep the lead for long enough. \"The frustrating thing is we could have avoided the two goals just by clearing our lines.\" Mamadou Sakho (C) celebrates with Crystal Palace team-mates after scoring their late winning goal against Stoke Man of the match - Mamadou Sakho The defender had the captain's armband on and certainly led his side to victory. He was calm at the back, keeping Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting quiet and then ensured Peter Crouch didn't have the impact his manager desired. His injury-time goal was the icing on the cake and it was thanks to his instincts that he was in the right place to net the winner. What next?

credited as a Lewis Dunk own goal - as they scraped past Brighton 1-0 at Old Trafford on Saturday. The slice of luck came on 66 minutes when Ashley Young's strike from the edge of the box spun off Dunk's boot, which wrong-footed Mathew Ryan and looped into the top corner. United may have taken maximum points but it was a pretty uninspiring showing against a spirited Brighton outfit, who were tough to break down. The victory maintains their 100 per cent home record in the Premier League this season and moves them to within five points of Manchester City at the top.

United's build-up play lacked tempo as Romelu Lukaku was made to feed off scraps played into the box. Romelu Lukaku in action during the Premier League match between Man Utd and Brighton He did get on the end of a piece of quality from Marcus Rashford just before the break, but the Belgian and Paul Pogba were denied by a fantastic double save from Ryan. The second half continued in the same theme, with Brighton holding firm and restricting United to pot shots from range. Team news Jose Mourinho kept the same Man Utd team that steamrolled Newcastle last weekend, meaning Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Romelu Lukaku all started. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was on the bench. Meanwhile, Chris Hughton made just one change from Brighton's clash with Stoke, with Solly March replacing Jose Izquierdo. Jose Mourinho called for Zlatan Ibrahimovic midway through the half and the extra body up front started to pin the visitors back. The goal came four minutes after the striker's introduction - but it was more by luck than judgement. A corner, which was controversially awarded to United, was cleared out to Young, who struck an effort with his left-foot that was heading off target before taking a wicked deflection off Dunk and flying into the opposite corner. Ryan had no chance. United have only conceded once at home in the Premier League this season and they rarely looked in danger of relinquishing their lead once in front. Shane Duffy headed a half-chance wide late on for Brighton, while Ibrahimovic came close to opening his account for the season after good link-up with Lukaku. Man of the match: Ashley Young A tough choice with no real standout performers, but Young's attacking play on the left troubled Brighton throughout. Clearly in confident mood, the full-back's decision to take the shot on inevitably lead to United's opening goal. Surely he and Dunk will be pushing for Young to be credited with the goal, which would be his first since May 2016. Pundit reaction: Paul Merson \"United did find a way, and fair play to them. Brighton players getting back on that coach will be thinking 'how did we not get something from this?' They were just unlucky. So many times the ball just fizzed across the box and nobody was there to get on the end of it. They took the game to United. \"Ibrahimovic comes on and United are a different team. Brighton players just showed him a bit more respect. If United want to win the Premier League, they need seven points from the three big games coming up [away to Watford and Arsenal, and home to Man City]. From what I have seen today, I would be surprised if United won any, even against Watford.\" Opta stats The Red Devils have lost just once in their last 48 Premier League home games against newly-promoted teams (W41 D6 L1) - with that defeat coming against Norwich City in December 2015. Brighton have never won away against Manchester United in any competition (D2 L7). Man Utd have conceded just six goals so far this season, their lowest total after the first 13 league games of the season since 2007-08 (6). Mourinho's side have recorded a clean sheet in 26 of their 51 Premier League matches since the start of last season; more than any other side. Dunk is the first player in Premier League history to score an own goal versus both Man Utd and Man City in the same season. Pogba attempted more passes versus Brighton (110) than in any other Premier League match in his career. What's next? Both teams are back in action on Tuesday when United visit Watford, while Brighton take on rivals Crystal Palace in what will be the first-ever Premier League meeting between the two."}, {"date":

Newcastle 0-3 Watford Watch highlights of Newcastle 0-3 Watford Watford swept aside an out-of-form Newcastle with a 3-0 victory at St James' Park in the Premier League on Saturday. Rafa Benitez's side have now lost their last four top-flight games - scoring just once - as the Hornets continued to impress under Marco Silva. Will Hughes (19) was on the scoresheet for a second successive Premier League game and opened the scoring for Watford, before Magpies defender DeAndre Yedlin (46) poked the ball into the back of his own net on the stroke of half-time. Player ratings Newcastle: Elliot (6), Yedlin (5), Lejeune (6), Clark (6), Manquillo (7), Murphy (7), Shelvey (7), Diame (6), Ritchie (6), Gayle (6), Joselu (5). Subs used: Mitrovic (6), Merino (5), Perez (5). Watford: Gomes (7), Britos (6), Kabasele (8), Mariappa (7), Femenia (7), Cleverley (7), Zeegelaar (8), Doucoure (7), Hughes (7), Richarlison (6), Gray (6). Subs used: Prodl (6), Pereyra (5), Carrillo (n/a). Man of the match: Marvin Zeegelaar. Andre Gray (62) rounded off proceedings as he slotted home from a Richarlison cross to move Watford on to 21 points while Newcastle slip down one place to 13th and remain on 14 points. Newcastle began the game well and could twice have taken the lead. A cross from Jacob Murphy in the fourth minute fell to Joselu, but he could not sort his feet properly as his shanked effort went wide. Matt Ritchie then tried his luck from the top of the box eight minutes later but it flashed just past the post. Team news Newcastle made one change with Mo Diame coming in for Isaac Hayden. Watford named an unchanged XI from last weekend's win again West Ham. But it was Watford who opened the scoring in the 19th minute as Hughes once again found the back of the net. Marvin Zeegelaar was played in down the left flank by a superb diagonal ball by Kabasele, and pulled the ball back for Hughes just inside the box. He then hit low and hard through the area to see the ball drive into the goal. The visitors could have added an instant second as Zeegelaar once again picked out the run of Kabasele, who made a run unmarked through the box, but his attempt to poke home at the back post could only be directed behind. Newcastle United fans hold up a rainbow flag at St James' Park in support of the Rainbow Laces campaign With mere seconds of the first half to play, Watford produced a late sucker punch. Richarlison slid in Zeegelaar down the left flank and he, in turn, produced a cross into the box. Yedlin was waiting to turn it behind but his diversion instead headed goalwards and beat Rob Elliot at the near post to hand Watford a two-goal lead. Newcastle again had half chances at the start of the second period, with Dwight Gayle's inviting cross just evading the head of Ritchie after the restart, before Murphy nodded a Gayle cross just wide of the post in the 56th minute. Andre Gray scores Watford's third goal of the game However, Gray added another for Watford just after the hour mark. It was a great break from the visitors with Richarlison set away down the left flank before whipping a superb ball across the face of goal that met the sliding foot of Gray at the back post, who slotted home past Elliot. Neither side really had a clear-cut chance to score the next goal as Watford comfortably saw out the game to take all three points. Opta stats Watford have won 13 points from their seven away league games this season (W4 D1 L2), more than they did in their 19 Premier League away games in 2016-17 (W3 D3 L13). This is only the second time that Rafael Benitez has suffered back-to-back home defeats in the Premier League as manager, with the other occasion coming with Liverpool in January 2005 (vs Chelsea and Manchester United). 2 - Will Hughes has scored in back-to-back league games for the first time in his career. Bloom. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 25, 2017 Watford have won three consecutive league games against Newcastle for the very first time. Newcastle have failed to win any of the 68 Premier League games in which they've been losing by two or more goals at half-time, drawing three and losing 65. The managers Rafa Benitez: \"It was a classic game of the Premier League. You make mistakes and you pay for that. We can work harder, work better and that's it. We have to realise that this is the Premier League and you have to be strong as a unit... We have to stick together like we did in a lot of games and improve that.\" Watford boss Marco Silva says his side got things right at both ends of the pitch in their 3-0 win over Newcastle Watford boss Marco Silva says his side got things right at both ends of the pitch in their 3-0 win over Newcastle Marco Silva: \"I am happy because we won this match. We performed really well again, to have a clean sheet is really important for us as a team as well. I'm happy in this moment but my job is to prepare the team for the next match, prepare well for the next session. I don't usually change a lot when we win or don't win.\" Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez says his side must stick together and work harder after a 3-0 defeat to Watford Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez says his side must stick together and work harder after a 3-0 defeat to Watford The pundit Charlie Nicholas: Watford are a very good team. Very athletic, very strong and great enthusiasm. Zeegelaar, it is the first time I have seen him, is just a big unit up and down the left flank. All compliments to Watford's style. The balance of the physical side and the footballing side is superb. This could have been 8-0 today. Will Hughes celebrates after giving Watford the lead at St James' Park \"This game was over by half time for Newcastle. Rafa had to change something, but changed nothing. This is a man that normally reacts, but he did nothing. They are a mess at the back. If Rafa watches this game back, he has to watch it more than once.\" Man of the match - Marvin Zeegelaar It was a brilliant performance from Zeegelaar on just his second appearance for Watford and his second start in the Premier League. He set up the opening two goals and continued to provide for the Hornets down that left flank, shining when Richarlison had a quieter afternoon. . @WatfordFC maintain their record of scoring 2 goals in all of their away PL matches this season pic.twitter.com/HaoPZWaNNN — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) November 25, 2017 But it wasn't just in attack where he had a hand, he contributed with the defensive work, where Kabasele deserves a special mention, and looked comfortable in a big ground like St James' Park.

defeats but they could only manage a battling point as they drew 0-0 at home to Bournemouth on Saturday. Paul Clement's side were denied a winner at the Liberty Stadium after referee Stuart Attwell controversially disallowed Wilfried Bony's strike after a foul by Jordan Ayew on Nathan Ake in first-half stoppage time. Ki Sung-yueng was fortunate not to be sent off after appearing to push the referee following an altercation between Jordon Ibe and Martin Olsson, but the South Korean midfielder was only shown a yellow card. Substitute Leroy Fer missed a glorious chance to win it late on but he was first denied by Asmir Begovic before his rebound was fired wide from close range as the Cherries recorded a third straight clean sheet for the first time in the Premier League. Harry Arter controls the ball under presseure form Tom Carroll Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (6), Naughton (6), Olsson (6), Van der Hoorn (7), Mawson (8), Carroll (6), Sanches (6), Mesa (6), Ki (5), Ayew (7), Bony (6).

Cook (n/a), Gosling (6), Afobe (6) Man of the match: Alfie Mawson Clement, who denied he felt under pressure to get a win over Eddie Howe's men after seeing his side lose five of their first six home league games, made five changes to his team from the defeat by Burnley as Tammy Abraham was only fit enough to be named on the bench. It was Bournemouth who made the brighter start as Josh King picked out Marc Pugh in the area after just two minutes, but the midfielder's shot was tame and straight at Lukasz Fabianski. Andrew Surman was next to test Fabianski with a fierce shot before King should have taken advantage of ball-watching from the returning Roque Mesa, but the forward could only fire straight at the Polish shot-stopper. Team news Swansea made five changes as Mike van der Hoorn, Tom Carroll, Roque Mesa, Ki Sung-yeung and Wilfried Bony came in for Federico Fernandez, Sam Clucas, Leroy Fer, Nathan Dyer and Tammy Abraham. Bournemouth made the one change as Adam Smith came in for Simon Francis. Swansea appeared happy to go into the break with the scoreline at 0-0, but they were then denied what would have been the breakthrough on the stroke of half-time when Ayew barged into Ake and the ball fell for Bony to fire past Begovic. Attwell immediately blew for a free-kick but that did not stop the officials being booed off at the interval by the irate home supporters. Swansea enjoyed the better of the second period but they could easily have been reduced to 10 men with 15 minutes remaining. Martin Olsson tangled with Ibe and as both confronted one another, Ki barged into the back of Attwell as he looked to push the Bournemouth winger. The midfielder was cautioned, along with the two instigators of the flashpoint, and Clement's men nearly snatched the victory as Fer dribbled free of Adam Smith to see his low shot saved by Begovic, and the Dutchman's rebound was blazed into the side-netting with the goal at his mercy. Leroy Fer missed a glorious chance to seal all three points but he blazed wide The managers Paul Clement: \"It was a goal, and I stand by that having looked at it again. What I see is Nathan Ake and Jordan Ayew both fighting for that position, that the ball was coming into, and I saw our striker being stronger than their defender, and their defender just falling flat on the ground. \"I think that it's a really soft decision. The overall performance of the referee was very poor.\" Swansea boss Paul Clement says the performance of the referee was ‘very poor’ Swansea boss Paul Clement says the performance of the referee was ‘very poor’ Eddie Howe: \"It was a game of few chances. It was scrappy, and certainly wasn't one for the purist. We're just pleased that we came through it unscathed. \"We kept another clean sheet and we're becoming harder to beat but it wasn't a great game. Last season we were scoring goals for fun, but conceding at a rate so it was important we did something about that. Three clean sheets in a row is a fine achievement.\" Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe admits their 0-0 draw against Swansea wasn't a game for the purists Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe admits their 0-0 draw against Swansea wasn't a game for the purists Pundit reaction Phil Thompson: \"Swansea got better in the second half, I can say that, and they had the best chance through Leroy Fer. Still, they are not having a great time of it. \"How Ki hasn't got a red card is beyond me. As he is pushing Jordon Ibe, Stuart Atwell kind of just gets in the way, but Ki pushes him from the back. It is amazing. He brandishes the yellow card to two players, takes some advice from his assistant, and you think 'here comes the red', but he then gives him a yellow card.\" Phil Thompson says Swansea’s Ki Sung-Yueng was lucky to avoid a red card for his push on referee Stuart Attwell in a match of few chances. Phil Thompson says Swansea’s Ki Sung-Yueng was lucky to avoid a red card for his push on referee Stuart Attwell in a match of few chances. Man of the match - Alfie Mawson Bournemouth came into the game full of confidence having smashed four past Huddersfield without reply and many had fancied the Cherries to enjoy a fruitful afternoon in south Wales but the Swansea defence held firm, expertly marshalled by Mawson. The young defender was without his usual partner in Federico Fernandez after the Argentine returned to his homeland on Friday night following the death of his father, but Mawson stepped up to deliver another mature performance alongside the impressive Mike van der Hoorn. Marc Pugh and Charlie Daniels frequently combined well down the left but it was Mawson who time and again made vital interceptions at the crucial moment to keep the home side's clean sheet intact for the first time in five games. Opta stats The Swans stopped a run of four consecutive losses in the league, however, they are without a win in their last five (D1 L4), their longest winless run since April 2017 (six). The Cherries have kept three successive Premier League clean sheets for the first time. In fact, it was the first time Bournemouth had kept three consecutive shutouts in the league since October 2014. Swansea have failed to score in three successive Premier League games for the first time since May 2013. The Swans recorded just one shot on target against Bournemouth, with the Swans having just 24 shots on target in the Premier League this season; 10 fewer than any other side. Wilfried Bony has now gone nine Premier League games in a row without a goal. The Ivorian striker has only netted in one of his last 27 Premier League games (2 goals). What's next?

Salomon Rondon gave West Brom a shock early lead (4), finding the bottom left corner from 10 yards after a swift break.

Spurs were slow off the mark as West Brom took an early lead through Rondon in soft fashion. Dele Alli was shoved off the ball by Jake Livermore on halfway, before Rondon shrugged away pressure from Davinson Sanchez to trickle the ball past Hugo Lloris into the bottom left corner. Half chances fell to Kane and Heung-Min Son late on in the first half, but West Brom stood firm to go in at half-time ahead as Spurs' midweek Champions League trip to Dortmund seemed to be taking its toll. Team news Both sides made two changes each after defeats last weekend. Spurs brought in Son and Winks for Sissoko and Dembele, while Albion replaced Krychowiak and McAuley with Field and Nyom. Jake Livermore is put under pressure from Dele Alli Matt Phillips struck just wide after break, but the visitors' defence was finally breached with 16 minutes remaining as Kane snuck it at the near post to prod the ball through Ben Foster's legs from Alli's right-wing cross. Tottenham had most of the ball but failed to create a clear-cut chance after the equaliser, and instead the best opportunity fell to Gary Megson's side. The pundit - Matt Le Tissier After the goal, West Brom parked the bus, had a flat back five, and Spurs really struggled. It was only when they started to get the ball out wide and get crosses in that they caused any problems, and that is how the goal came about. To try and claw back 11 points, to overtake a side of Manchester City's standard is a big ask. I would say they are playing for a top-four place, and should really focus on the Champions League. Kane has now scored nine in nine Premier League games Opta stats Four of the last five Premier League games between these two sides has been drawn. Spurs have dropped as many points in their first seven Premier League games at Wembley this season than in their previous 23 PL games at White Hart Lane (nine points dropped). West Brom have kept just two clean sheets in their last 25 Premier League away games, failing to keep a shutout in each of their last six. Harry Kane has been directly involved in 100 goals in 128 Premier League games (87 goals, 13 assists); the ninth quickest player to reach that total. The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"Of course we are disappointed. In the way we concede the first goal, and then they had the belief. For us it was difficult, it was a massive impact for us, and difficult to come back to the game. \"In the second half I think we created enough chances to score and win the game, but were unlucky because we didn't have enough time to score the second goal.\" Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says he felt his side deserved more than a point Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says he felt his side deserved more than a point Gary Megson: \"It's a strange thing to say but it's something for the club to build on, even from this stage. \"I've spoken to Tony [Pulis] a lot of times. I spoke to him today at 2.20pm just to see what he was doing, but in terms of input, if that was the case, Tony could have just stayed and kept the job and carried on!\" West Brom’s caretaker manager Gary Megson was delighted with his side's performance West Brom’s caretaker manager Gary Megson was delighted with his side's performance Man of the match - Salomon Rondon This was only Rondon's second goal of the Premier League campaign, but the Venezuelan showed he can be Albion's key man away from home against top-six opposition. His goal looked messy, but look closer and you'll see everything you want from a striker; strength to shove Davinson Sanchez off the ball, awareness of Hugo Lloris' position, and a slow, trickling, inch-perfect finish into the bottom-left corner. But the goal aside, Rondon held the ball up well, won fouls as Spurs piled pressure on the visitors, and bullied Sanchez, the defender Mauricio Pochettino said could be one of the world's best defenders in years to come. What's next Spurs now go to Leicester on Tuesday night before another away trip to Watford on Saturday. West Brom host Newcastle on Tuesday, before a home game with fellow strugglers Crystal Palace on Saturday at The Hawthorns."}, {"date": "25/11/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53225,

between Liverpool and Chelsea Willian's fortunate late equaliser earned Chelsea a 1-1 draw at Liverpool, after Mo Salah had opened the scoring against his former club. The Brazilian substitute needed just 144 seconds on the field to make the impact boss Antonio Conte was looking for, with his attempted cross sailing over the head of Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and into the far corner on 85 minutes. Salah, who tops the Premier League scoring charts, continued his fine form by coolly slotting his 10th goal of the campaign past Chelsea 'keeper Thibaut Courtois on 65 minutes. And he was almost the hero with a last-gasp strike from the edge of the box which was brilliantly parried away by Courtois. Player ratings Liverpool: Mignolet (6), Milner (6), Coutinho (6), Salah (8), Gomez (7), Henderson (7), Sturridge (6), Klavan (6), Moreno (6), Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Matip (6). Subs: Wijnaldum (6), Mane (6), Lallana (6) Chelsea: Courtois (7), Alonso (6), Drinkwater (6), Kante (7), Morata (6), Hazard (7), Bakayoko (6), Zappacosta (7), Cahill (6), Christensen (6), Azpilicueta (7) Subs: Fabregas (7) , Willian (8), Pedro (6). Man of the match: Salah (Liverpool) But Liverpool will be left to rue a missed opportunity to move level on points with the third-placed Londoners and remain in fifth after being pegged back. The visitors had the best of the first half, with Mignolet sharp to parry powerful drives from Eden Hazard and Davide Zappacosta either side of a brave dive at the feet of Danny Drinkwater, and Liverpool were fortunate to survive a goalmouth scramble on 24 minutes, when Gary Cahill missed his kick from six yards out. Team news Daniel Sturridge and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain both started with Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino dropping to the bench, while Alberto Moreno maintained his place despite his midweek struggles against Sevilla. For Chelsea, Danny Drinkwater replaced Cesc Fabregas in the starting line-up, while Andreas Christensen and Gary Cahill came in in for David Luiz and Antonio Rudiger. Salah provided Liverpool's prime threat in the opening 45, twice shooting off target from the edge of the box, but he had his say shortly after the hour mark, when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain deflected Philippe Coutinho's pass into his path. That looked like it would be the winner, with Alvaro Morata and Alonso spurning good openings, but while Liverpool fans cheered the return of Adam Lallana from injury, it was another substitute, Willian, who made the difference in the closing minutes. Man of the match - Mo Salah Mohamed Salah with a reserved celebration after giving Liverpool the lead Mo Salah was Liverpool's most dangerous player all evening and kept up his superb scoring streak with a neat finish. He came close twice from the edge of the box in the first-half and could have added a second on the break late in the second. With 10 Premier League goals already this season, he's looking like the signing of the summer - and once again showed Chelsea what they let go. The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a good game, very intense game. Very difficult for us against a very strong Chelsea team with quite a different approach. Deep defending and then giving the ball to Eden Hazard...Everything was good until Willian crossed the ball, still most parts of the game were good but it doesn't feel as good.\" Antonio Conte: \"I think we were unlucky, if you see the dynamic of their goal. But at the same time I'm very happy to see a good reaction of my players. A great desire, a great will to fight, a great desire to not accept the result against Liverpool. We tried to win the game. We must be pleased despite the draw.\" Opta stats Liverpool have conceded just two goals in their last nine Premier League games at Anfield, but these goals have cost them a total of four points (1-1 vs Burnley, 1-1 vs Chelsea). Of the 19 sides Antonio Conte has faced in the Premier League as a manager, Liverpool are the only side he has not beaten in the competition. Salah also became the 20th different player to score a Premier League goal against Chelsea having previously appeared for the Blues in the competition. What's next? Liverpool travel to Stoke on Wednesday and are away to Brighton on Saturday. Chelsea, meanwhile, host Swansea on Wednesday before entertaining Newcastle live on Sky Sports Premier League on Saturday lunchtime."}, {"date": "24/11/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance":

winless run to six games as they were held to a 1-1 draw with Leicester City on Friday Night Football. In David Moyes first home game in charge, West Ham fell behind inside eight minutes when Marc Albrighton took advantage of some sloppy Hammers defending. That early goal could have triggered a toxic atmosphere inside The London Stadium but - as Moyes had called for all week - the club and fans stuck together and got a deserved equaliser through Cheikhou Kouyate right on half-time. A point was not enough to lift West Ham out of the drop zone, who have put together their worst start to a season since 2010 when they were relegated under Avram Grant. Player ratings West Ham: Hart (6), Zabaleta (6), Reid (6), Ogbonna (5), Cresswell (6), Kouyate (7), Obiang (6), Arnautovic (7), Lanzini (6), Masuaku (7), Carroll (5). Subs: Ayew (6), Sakho (6) Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson, (6) Morgan (6), Maguire (6), Fuchs (6), Mahrez (6), Ndidi (7), Albrighton (7), Iborra (6), Gray (6), Vardy (7) Subs: Chilwell (6), Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic Moyes would have been hoping to build on the positive signs on show in the defeat at Watford, but his team wilted inside eight minutes. Jamie Vardy was allowed to run free down the left and his cross was missed completely by Angelo Ogbonna, which allowed Albrighton the opportunity to poke home from close range. Marc Albrighton celebrates his opening goal with Jamie Vardy The Hammers was quite lucky to get away with a penalty appeal on 22 minutes when Albrighton was bundled into by Arthur Masuaku and Vardy curled inches wide seven minutes later. However, West Ham always looked a threat from set-pieces and they forced home the equaliser just before the break when Kouyate bundled in a left-wing corner. Team news David Moyes dropped Mark Noble for winger Arthur Masuaku in the only change from the 2-0 defeat at Watford. Claude Puel named the same players that started the 2-0 home defeat against Manchester City last Saturday. Despite the best efforts of the home fans, who tried to roar their team forward, West Ham failed to really lay siege to the Leicester goal in a disjointed second period that was lacking in quality. Cheikhou Kouyate celebrates his equaliser The stop-start nature to proceedings resulted in six minutes of injury time and substitute Andre Ayew nearly nicked it with an acrobatic attempt following a goalmouth scramble but his effort flew inches over. Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic It looked at times as though West Ham had signed a new right winger. The home fans had yet to see their big money signing really produce a high level of work-rate but he produced the goods here in a solid all-round display. The pick of his key moments came midway through the first-half where he sprinted back 50 yards to make a vital last-ditch tackle on Jamie Vardy. Moyes commented: \"He was very good - people told me on Sunday that was one of his better games. He showed the other side to his game that he knows he has to do.\" Opta stats Moyes has failed to win any of his 11 Premier League home games in 2017 (D4 L7), equalling the record set by Mick McCarthy in 2005 (P11 W0 D3 L8). Kouyate has been involved in more goals against Leicester (3, two goals and one assist) than any other opponent in the Premier League. No side has conceded more goals from corners in the Premier League this season than Leicester (6, level with Watford). West Ham are yet to win a Premier League match at the London Stadium in which they conceded first (D3 L10). Manager reaction: David Moyes \"The second half was much more like us, it was more like the crowd, it was more like Upton Park. There was 10 minutes when the crowd was right behind the team - they need it, we need it.\" David Moyes was encouraged by West Ham’s performance in their 1-1 draw with Leicester at the London Stadium and felt the display merited more. David Moyes was encouraged by West Ham’s performance in their 1-1 draw with Leicester at the London Stadium and felt the display merited more.

Subs: Crouch (6) Man of the match: Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting The result means Brighton remain in ninth position while Stoke stay in 15th position having missed out on the chance to rise into the top half of the table. Brighton, who had not lost at home since the opening day of the season against Manchester City, came close to breaking the deadlock after just four minutes, but the in-form Glenn Murray produced failed to convert from Izquierdo's inviting cross. Stoke responded as defender Ryan Shawcross lost Lewis Dunk at Darren Fletcher's corner, but his header was tipped over by Matt Ryan. Davy Propper then released Izquierdo, but the Colombian winger bent his right-footed shot a yard wide of the far post before Stoke stunned the Amex Stadium by taking the lead. Team news Brighton named the same team for the fourth successive Premier League game. Stoke made one change to the side that drew 2-2 with Leicester in their last outing as Lee Grant came in for the injured Jack Butland. Darren Fletcher became the Scotsman with the most Premier League appearances (326), overtaking Gary McAllister. Choupo-Moting, starting up front despite not scoring in his last seven games, caught Dunk ball-watching as he expertly took down Shaqiri's lofted pass and stroked the ball low to the left of Ryan. Brighton fans felt aggrieved seven minutes before the interval after Murray went down in the box under a challenge from Shawcross. The centre-back failed to make contact with the ball, but referee Lee Mason indicated a corner before awarding a goal-kick having spoken to his assistant. Murray was booked soon after the incident for a late challenge on Kevin Wimmer, but the hosts fought their way back into the game before the interval. Reaction from the two protagonists in one of the key moments during Brighton’s 2-2 draw with Stoke, Ryan Shawcross and Glenn Murray Reaction from the two protagonists in one of the key moments during Brighton’s 2-2 draw with Stoke, Ryan Shawcross and Glenn Murray Propper dribbled past four Stoke players before crossing for Gross to slam the ball between the legs of Grant for his third goal of the campaign, but the Seagulls were level for only a minute. Zouma ensured Stoke went into the break ahead as Fletcher's dangerous corner was flicked in his direction by Choupo-Moting off the back of Bruno for the defender on loan from Chelsea to head the ball home from three yards. Stoke nearly extended their lead four minutes into the second period after a mistake from Propper allowed Ramadan Sobhi to play a one-two with Joe Allen before having his shot saved by Ryan, and the visitors would rue the missed opportunity as Brighton levelled on the hour-mark. Kurt Zouma heads Stoke back in front on the stroke of half-time Izquierdo was due to be replaced by Solly March, but the £13.5million club-record signing timed his biggest contribution to perfection, receiving Murray's disguised pass before scoring at the second attempt after Kevin Wimmer blocked his initial cross. Shaqiri flashed a fierce left-footed shot a yard wide of Ryan's far post, but neither side over-committed in the final third of the match with both managers happy to settle for a point as Brighton extended their unbeaten run to five games. The managers Chris Hughton: \"I was fairly close (to taking off Izquierdo). Sometimes that happens, hence we left him on for another 10 minutes after. We've shown great character to come back from that, but we weren't at our best tonight. \"I didn't think we probed enough and were a little sloppy at times with our passing. What we have to be is realistic, we're now playing in a different division against better teams with better players. The supporters saw a lot of exciting football tonight.\" Chris Hughton was pleased with his side’s display against Stoke but says his side was denied a penalty following Ryan Shawcross’s tackle on Glenn Murray. Chris Hughton was pleased with his side’s display against Stoke but says his side was denied a penalty following Ryan Shawcross’s tackle on Glenn Murray. Mark Hughes: \"It's an away point in the Premier League, so you've got to be happy with that. I don't think they created too much of note, but we're disappointed with the goals we conceded. \"We missed a couple of tackles on the edge of the box for the first goal, but as an away performance we have to be happy with that. We're more resilient away from home, that's two away games in recent weeks where we've not been beaten so that augers well for us.\" Stoke boss Mark Hughes was pleased with his side's performance in their 2-2 draw away at Brighton Stoke boss Mark Hughes was pleased with his side's performance in their 2-2 draw away at Brighton Opta stats Brighton ended a run of eight straight defeats against Stoke in all competitions, getting their first result against them since a 1-0 win in September 2001 in the third tier. Peter Crouch's substitute appearance was his 143rd in the Premier League - more than any other player in the competition. Pascal Gross has been directly involved in 62 per cent of Brighton's 13 Premier League goals this season (three goals, five assists), the second highest ratio in the division after Tammy Abraham at Swansea (71 per cent). Xherdan Shaqiri has been involved in more Premier League goals in 11 games this season (2 goals, 5 assists) than he was in 21 appearances in the competition last season (4 goals, 2 assists). Kurt Zouma's goal was Stoke's sixth from a corner situation this season - more than any other Premier League side. Darren Fletcher made his 326th appearance in the Premier League - more than any other Scottish player in the competition. Fletcher was also playing in his 103rd consecutive match in the competition - the outright 5th longest such run for an outfield player. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting celebrates scoring Stoke's opener at the Amex Stadium Man of the match - Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting The Cameroonian forward was preferred to Peter Crouch up front and he provided the one moment of class in the game as he took down Shaqiri's long ball before sitting Ryan with a composed finish into the bottom corner. With his third strike of the season, Choupo-Moting has now scored as many goals for Stoke as he achieved in 30 appearances for Schalke last season. The 28-year-old, who signed on a free transfer, has enjoyed a fine start to life in the Potteries with his header back across goal assisting Kurt Zouma for Stoke's second before the break. He has now been involved in seven of Stoke's 14 goals so far this season (three goals, four assists). What's next? Brighton will look to continue their unbeaten run with a tough trip to face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday while Stoke travel to face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on the same day."},

"report": "2:59 Watford 2 -0 West Ham Watford 2 -0 West Ham The appointment of David Moyes at West Ham failed to deliver an instant reaction as they slipped to a 2-0 defeat at Watford on Super Sunday. On his Hammers bow, Moyes' team were seen off by goals from Will Hughes (11) and Richarlison (64) as Watford boss Marco Silva - heavily linked with the Everton job - further enhanced his reputation. There was cause for hope for Moyes as his team had six shots on target, but a mixture of wayward finishing and two brilliant stops from Heurelho Gomes blunted their progress. Cries of \"you're not fit to wear the shirt\" were sung from a disgruntled away end, who have seen their team lose their last four games and remain in the relegation zone. Player ratings Watford: Gomes (8), Femenia (7), Mariappa (6), Britos (6), Kabasele (6), Zeegelaar (7), Cleverley (6), Doucoure (6), Hughes (8), Richarlison (8), Gray (7) Subs: Pereya (6), Holebas (6) West Ham: Hart (6), Zabaleta (5), Reid (5), Ogbonna (6), Cresswell (5), Obiang (6), Noble (6), Kouyate (5), Lanzini (5), Arnautovic (6), Carroll (6) Subs: Sakho (6), Masuaku (6) Man of the match: Will Hughes Moyes' men were behind inside 11 minutes and could have been a man down inside 90 seconds had referee Andre Marriner deemed Andy Carroll's challenge on Marvin Zeegelaar worthy of violent conduct. The Watford debutant felt the full force of Premier League football and was left with a bloodied nose. The goal came when Richarlison sprung too easily past Pablo Zabaleta and delivered a cross which was poorly dealt with by Angelo Ogbonna. Hughes finished with a fine half-volley after Andre Gray's effort had been blocked. Watford's Will Hughes celebrates his first-half strike Watford continued to press as Richarlison tested Joe Hart with a curling effort on 32 minutes before the rebound was lashed wide by Kiko Femenia. Team news Watford handed a debut to left back Marvin Zeegelaar. He replaced Jose Holebas in the side while Marco Silva's only other change saw Adrian Mariappa come in for Andre Carrillo. David Moyes made three changes to the West Ham side beaten 4-1 by Liverpool with Pablo Zabaleta, Andy Carroll and Marko Arnautovic starting. Despite their control of the match, Watford were indebted to Gomes, who showed superb reactions to deny Cheikhou Kouyate and then Marko Arnautovic just before the break. Heurelho Gomes denies Marko Arnautovic Kouyate missed another gilt-edged chance on 52 minutes when he spooned an effort from 12 yards over the bar. From there, Watford took over. Abdoulaye Doucoure fired a strike inches wide before Hart denied Adrian Mariappa with a fine one-handed save. Richarlison scores Watford's second goal Watford did not have to wait long to double their lead as the dangerous Richarlison sprinted clear down the left on 64 minutes and finished powerfully into the far corner. Manuel Lanzini had an effort cleared off the line for West Ham, whose fans stayed until the end but turned on some of their own players and the club's hierarchy as the clock ticked down. On his 500th game as a Premier League manager, Moyes saw first-hand the huge job on his hands. Man of the match: Will Hughes Alan Smith on co-commentary duty said: \"He's looked really comfortable today. He scored the first, created the second and his general play has been top class. It's a day to be proud of.\" Opta stats Watford ended a run of three consecutive Premier League defeats and kept a clean sheet for the first time in their last eight top-flight games. Only in 2010/11, had West Ham accrued fewer points (8) after their first 12 games of a Premier League campaign than this season (9). Indeed, the Hammers have shipped 25 goals in their first 12 league games this season, their joint-most at this stage of a Premier League campaign (level with 2001/02). Hughes scored with his first-ever shot in Premier League football, in his third game in the competition. Richarlison has been directly involved in seven Premier League goals this season (5 goals, 2 assists), three more than any other Watford player. However, his strike against West Ham was the first to come at Vicarage Road. What's next? Watford are back in action next Saturday lunchtime against Newcastle.

2-0 victory over neighbours Tottenham at The Emirates Stadium on Saturday. There was talk pre-match of a power shift in this area of London after Spurs finished above the Gunners last season but goals from Shkodran Mustafi (36) and Alexis Sanchez (41) ended Arsenal's longest ever winless run against their fiercest rivals (six games). Both goals seemed to irk the Tottenham coaching staff, who could be seen remonstrating with the officials at half-time over some debatable calls from referee Mike Dean and his officials but Arsenal were worthy winners. The defeat was Mauricio Pochettino's first north London derby reverse in the Premier League as Spurs continued to struggle away from home against the other top six teams, having now claimed just three wins from 32 away days against the 'big six'. Meanwhile, Arsenal - who showed steel as well as style when it mattered - have won their opening six Premier League home games for the first time since 2007. Player Ratings Arsenal: Cech (7), Koscielny (7), Mustafi (8), Monreal (7), Bellerin (7), Xhaka (7), Ramsey (7), Kolasinac (7), Sanchez (7), Ozil (8), Lacazette (8) Subs: Coquelin (6), Iwobi (6) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Trippier (6), Dier (5), Sanchez (6), Vertonghen (5), Davies (6), Dembele (7), Sissoko (6), Eriksen (6), Dele (5), Kane (5) Subs: Winks (6), Llorente (6), Son (6) Man of the match: Mesut Ozil The Gunners showed positive intent early as Spurs played a waiting, counter-attack based game. There was a heart-in-mouth moment for Jan Vertonghen on seven minutes as Mesut Ozil barged in behind him but referee Dean spotted a foul. Alexandre Lacazette was then inches away from connecting with a Hector Bellerin centre on 19 minutes but Spurs just did enough to survive. Team news Arsenal handed a start to Alexandre Lacazette in one of two changes – the other being Shkodran Mustafi replacing Francis Coquelin. Spurs welcomed back Hugo Lloris, Kieran Trippier, Ben Davies, Dele Alli and Moussa Dembele as Mauricio Pochettino made five changes to the team that beat Crystal Palace. Harry Kane passed a fitness test to start. Christen Eriksen clipped a post with a 20-yard effort but it was slim pickings for Spurs, who fell behind on 36 minutes. After a debatable foul was awarded down the left flank, Ozil whipped in an accurate ball that was wonderfully headed home by Mustafi, who was making his first start since recovering from a thigh injury. Arsenal's pace in behind always seemed to worry Vertonghen and Eric Dier, therefore it was not a surprise when the Gunners made it 2-0 via that method on 41 minutes. Lacazette - who looked borderline offside - sprinted to the byline and cut the ball back for Sanchez. He took a touch before firing home from a tight angle. Spurs look stunned. Harry Kane surges forward for Tottenham There was a brief rally after the break from the visitors as Harry Kane appealed for a penalty under pressure from Granit Xhaka before he picked himself up and had a low effort blocked away by the impressive Mustafi. Moments of pressure like that were all too rare though from Pochettino's men, who looked short on confidence despite winning more away Premier League games in 2017 than any other team. Pochettino summed up their struggles by removing Kane and Dele Alli for Fernando Llorente and Heung-Min Son with 15 minutes left. It had little effect on proceedings as despite a flying save from Petr Cech to deny Dier, Arsenal seemed in full control and saw the game out. \"If I was Arsene Wenger I'd be delighted with the performance, because you saw the two Arsenals. In the first half they were on the front foot creating chances and then when the game turned he didn't even have to come on the touchline to give instruction. They were solid and less adventurous. \"Next time out Arsenal travel to Burnley. Which Arsenal is going to turn up there? Will it be the same team that are motivated, bang at it and win all the challenges that matter? Manager reaction: Arsene Wenger Arsene Wenger looks on from his technical area \"The quality of our concentration was very high. We never had a minute where we could feel we dropped a little bit our focus. \"Overall it was a very intense game. When you look at the performance of the two teams, it is absolutely through the roof. The players produced an immense performance on both sides. \"We have 22 points today. We are a few points short, but if you analyse our game, I can show you why.\" Mauricio Pochettino \"I'm very disappointed in the performance and the way we conceded the goals, he said. \"It's difficult to explain when you lose in this way. Small details which are big details - that can change everything in football. Maybe Xhaka should be sent-off before? \"The foul wasn't a foul. The goal was offside. But we lose. We have to go home and keep going.\" Man of the match: Mesut Ozil This was the Mesut Ozil we all want to see. Creating havoc with the ball and mucking in when the going got tough. He looked in the mood from the off, threading balls into Alexis Sanchez and Alexandre Lacazette, which caused a huge problem for the Spurs back four. Thierry Henry said: \"The desire of the Arsenal squad is second to none today. But Ozil has been amazing. \"I'm not talking about when he has been on the ball but off the ball. What he has been doing, helping the back three at one point and then five seconds after nearly being on a one vs one situation with Hugo Lloris.\" Mesut Ozil Opta stats The Gunners have won 11 home Premier League games in a row, their best run since winning 13 consecutively at Highbury between February and November 2005. Spurs have lost three of their opening 12 Premier League games, only one fewer than they lost in the entirety of last season. Since his Premier League debut in September 2013, Ozil has provided 45 assists, more than any other player in the competition and 21 more than any other Arsenal player in that time. Lacazette has been involved in five goals in his first six Premier League games at the Emirates (four goals, one assist). Hugo Lloris has never kept an away Premier League clean sheet against the 'big six', conceding 56 goals in 24 games at an average of 2.3 per game. Arsenal have never finished lower than 4th at the end of every Premier League season in which they've beaten Spurs at home. What's next? Arsenal face Cologne in the Europa League on Thursday before a Super Sunday trip to Burnley in nine days.

10-men Bournemouth on their way to an emphatic 4-0 victory over Huddersfield at the Vitality Stadium. Wilson struck twice in five minutes (25, 31) to hand the hosts a seemingly comfortable two-goal cushion, before Simon Francis gave Huddersfield renewed hope after being sent off for two bookings in first-half stoppage time. But a well-taken Harry Arter goal 20 minutes from time put the game beyond the visitors before Wilson sealed his hat-trick late on (84) following good play from Josh King. Bournemouth have now won back-to-back Premier League matches for the first time this season and move to 13th in the table, while Huddersfield remain in 10th. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (4), S. Cook (6), Ake (9), Daniels (7), Ibe (6), Surman (7), Arter (8), Pugh (6), King (7), Wilson (9) Subs: A. Smith (6), Gosling (N/A), L. Cook (N/A) Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Hadergjonaj (5), Cranie (5), Zanka (5), Malone (5), Van La Parra (6), Mooy (6), Williams (4), Ince (5), Kachunga (5), Depoitre (4) Subs: Mounie (5), Quaner (5), Sabiri (5) Man of the match: Callum Wilson The hosts opened the scoring in controversial fashion, with Huddersfield feeling aggrieved at not being awarded a free-kick after Charlie Daniels caught Florent Hadergjonaj with a studs-up challenge. Bournemouth played on amid the protests and with Hadergjonaj off the field receiving treatment, Jordon Ibe's floated in-swinging corner was met emphatically by Wilson's header on 26 minutes. That goal was Wilson's first in the Premier League this season and he only had to wait five minutes to register his second. Again it came from a set-piece, this time from Andrew Surman, whose out-swinging free-kick bypassed the entire Huddersfield defence to find Wilson at the far post and he rifled a volley confidently beyond Jonas Lossl. Replays showed he was marginally offside. Callum Wilson scores his and Bournemouth's second goal But with Bournemouth looking on course for a comprehensive victory, they were reduced to 10 men in first-half stoppage as Francis was sent off for a second yellow card after catching Rajiv Van La Parra on the halfway line, having been booked for a foul on the same opponent just ten minutes before. Team news Eddie Howe named the same starting XI that beat Newcastle United 1-0 prior to the international break as Josh King passed a late fitness test to partner Callum Wilson in attack.David Wagner was forced into making two changes, though, with Martin Cranie and Danny Williams replacing the suspended Christoper Schindler and Jonathan Hogg, whose partner had a baby boy on Friday night. With the one-man advantage, Huddersfield dominated the second half with over 75 percent possession, but they played a part in their own subsequent downfall on 70 minutes. Scott Malone was robbed on the edge of the penalty area by Arter after dribbling out of his box and the Republic of Ireland midfielder punished him ruthlessly by cutting inside and firing low into the bottom corner for Bournemouth's third. That became 4-0 on 82 minutes on the clock as Wilson completed his hat-trick with a fine finish after King held off three defenders before laying the ball perfectly into his path. .@afcbournemouth’s Callum Wilson is the 1st Englishman to score a hat-trick in the PL this season and the 3rd player overall to score a treble after Aguero & Morata #PL pic.twitter.com/RufJ43huFr — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) November 18, 2017 Wilson, whose career has stalled over the past couple of seasons due to two serious knee injuries, deservedly walked away with the match ball, although Nathan Ake was also a strong contender for the man of the match award for a colossal second-half defensive display. Man of the match - Callum Wilson Following two injury-plagued seasons, it was impossible to not feel happy for Callum Wilson as he struck a brilliant hat-trick to fire Bournemouth to a second consecutive Premier League win. It was a clinical display of finishing from the Cherries' frontman too as he scored with all three of his shots on target and each finish was supremely well-taken. Given how hard he has worked to overcome two serious knee injuries, Wilson thoroughly deserved his match ball. although Nathan Ake also warrants praise for an outstanding defensive performance, particularly when Bournemouth were under significant pressure in the second half.

Bournemouth will be looking to maintain their winning run when they travel to Swansea City next Saturday, while Huddersfield will be looking to bounce back against Manchester City on Super Sunday,

Burnley 2-0 Swansea Burnley 2-0 Swansea Sean Dyche saw his Burnley side's stock rise once again after a confident 2-0 Premier League win over Swansea at Turf Moor. Following a relatively open start, it was this season's over-achievers who drew first blood when former Swansea midfielder Jack Cork finished off a move he had initiated by nodding home Robbie Brady's cross (29). Dyche's men had a second in the net five minutes before the break when Ashley Barnes intercepted Jeff Hendrick's intuitive cross-field pass before striking a venomous drive past Lukasz Fabianski (40). Jack Cork heads Burnley in front against Swansea The result leaves Swansea languishing in the relegation zone with just eight points from 12 games, while the Clarets have now passed halfway in their quest for the 40-point survival milestone and sit just three points off second spot. Swansea came into the game off the back of three straight defeats and although they held their own, it was Burnley who had the first chance when Barnes' header was saved under pressure from Kyle Naughton. Player ratings Burnley: Pope (7), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (7), Mee (7), Ward (6), Gudmundsson (7), Defour (6), Cork (7), Brady (7), Hendrick (6), Barnes (8) Subs: Vokes (5) Swansea: Fabianski (6), Naughton (6), Fernandez (4), Mawson (6), Clucas (4), Fer (5), Olsson (5), Sanches (4), Dyer (6), Abraham (4), Ayew (5) Subs: Bony (6), Ki (4), Narsingh (N/A) Man of the match: Ashley Barnes Cork was the architect of a wonderfully-worked opener just before the half-hour, feeding Barnes before the unmarked England new-boy nodded Brady's precise cross past Fabianski. The Swans picked themselves up following the goal, but their failure to utilise Tammy Abraham was telling and when a tamely-delivered Renato Sanches corner was cleared, it was obvious it was going to be a tough afternoon. Team news Sean Dyche made just a solitary change from the side that beat Southampton prior to the international break, as Ashley Barnes replaced Chris Wood. Meanwhile, Ki Sung-yeung and Tom Carroll dropped to the Swansea bench – Renato Sanches and Martin Olsson their replacements – as Paul Clement looked for his side to break out of their slump. With 40 minutes on the clock, the Clarets doubled their lead when Hendrick capitalised on a lapse in concentration to pick out Barnes, who lashed home his first goal since April with venom. Swansea City's Tammy Abraham was stretchered off late on Paul Clement's introduction of Wilfried Bony at half-time affected the potency of the Swans' attack, but the Ivorian was guilty of missing multiple chances as the half wore on. James Tarkowski had the ball in the net again for Burnley with five minutes remaining, but although referee Martin Atkinson ruled the effort out, the visitors' misery was compounded in the closing stages when Abraham was stretchered off with a back injury. The managers Sean Dyche says Burnley's 2-0 win against Swansea showcased a lot of positives and relfected what his team are about. Sean Dyche says Burnley's 2-0 win against Swansea showcased a lot of positives and relfected what his team are about. Burnley boss Sean Dyche: \"Today just told us that we are working hard to find different ways to win. Last time out at Southampton, we had to defend very well, we had to break well when we could and maximise the limited chances that we had. \"Today we played some pockets of fantastic football - the first goal was from our keeper, passed all the way through the pitch to score. The second one's a great press and a counter, and then we managed the game. So, a lot of good signs about what we are about.\" Paul Clement says despite a positive start, Burnley's first goal affected Swansea's confidence following their 2-0 defeat. Paul Clement says despite a positive start, Burnley's first goal affected Swansea's confidence following their 2-0 defeat. Swansea boss Paul Clement: \"We did have a bright start to the game but I think when the goal went in, it affected our confidence. We're in this spiral of downward results at the moment and confidence is clearly affected, but we've got to find a way to break it. \"We're not playing well enough. I think, individually, our players are capable of giving more and as a team we are capable of giving more. We're playing under our potential and I've got to find a way to break this cycle.\" Man of the match - Ashley Barnes Ashley Barnes celebrates scoring Burnley's second goal against Swansea Stepping in for the injured Chris Wood, Ashley Barnes couldn't have done much better in proving to Sean Dyche that he has the ability to step in for - or even replace - the New Zealand frontman. His presence at the spearhead of the attack was vital in the creation of Jack Cork's opener as he laid off the ball to Robbie Brady and his own goal 11 minutes later was excellently taken. But it was the basics that Barnes got so right, using his broad stature to bully defenders, win lost causes and generally having a successful day in front of goal. Opta stats Burnley have won three consecutive top-flight games for the first time since January 1975. Swansea have now lost six of their last seven games in the Premier League (W1) and failed to score in seven of their last 11 away games in the Premier League. Jack Cork, who scored today versus his former side, ended a run of 43 Premier League appearances without a goal. Ashley Barnes scored his first Premier League goal at Turf Moor since New Year's Eve 2016, ending a run of 13 PL games without a goal on home soil. Jeff Hendrick has had a hand in three goals in nine Premier League games this season (two goals, one assist) - the same total he registered in 32 apps in 2016-17. What's next? Sean Dyche's Burnley welcome Arsenal on Super Sunday at 2pm next weekend, while Swansea will play host to Eddie Howe's AFC Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon."}, {"date": "18/11/2018", "arena":

Palace 2-2 Everton Everton twice came from behind to earn a 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace which leaves the hosts still rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table. Palace took the lead after just 51 seconds - their second fastest goal in Premier League history - as Ruben Loftus-Cheek's shot was palmed by Jordan Pickford straight to James McArthur, who made no mistake from close range. But Everton levelled contentiously from the penalty spot just five minutes later as Leighton Baines converted after Scott Dann was penalised for a foul on Oumar Niasse.

But David Unsworth, in the dugout once more as caretaker, will have been delighted by his team's response as Niasse controlled Baines' pass before being brushed off the ball by Dann inside the box. The Senegal striker appeared to throw himself to the ground as he looked to take the ball past the defender, but referee Anthony Taylor was well placed to award the spot-kick, much to the captain's incredulity.

Baines stepped up to make no mistake, blasting his penalty left-footed to Speroni's right to bring the visitors level with his third goal of the season. But it was Palace who dominated possession for the remainder of the first half with Everton happy to sit deep and they paid the price for a lack of ambition as Palace regained the lead in fine fashion. Andros Townsend combined well with Joel Ward down the right, and the full-back's inviting low cross managed to evade the outstretched Pickford for Zaha to slide in with a simple finish. Just when it appeared Palace would see out the half in front, Speroni opted to play the ball short to Dann, allowing Idrissa Gueye to execute a fine tackle and Gylfi Sigurdsson played the first-time ball into Niasse's path for the striker to level with a cool finish. Both sides had chances to win the game in the second period with Dominic Calvert-Lewin coming close and substitute Christian Benteke - on his return to the Palace side following six games out - dragging wide but both teams had to settle for a point. Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace feel hard done by but praised his side's performance in their 2-2 draw with Everton. Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace feel hard done by but praised his side's performance in their 2-2 draw with Everton. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"We feel hard done by. I don't think we could've played a lot better. The two goals [conceded] were of course unfortunate. You think the first one is actually a dive, and the second one was of our own making. \"If I take those two moments out of it, then I've got to be very satisfied by what the players did. I thought we bossed the game and played some excellent football but they couldn't score more than the two goals so as a result we've dropped two more points.\" David Unsworth: \"Palace are a good team. They caused us problems and they have great individual players. In the period that I've been a footballer, this has always been a tough place to come. \"To be down twice in the game, we've shown some great resilience. It was a really hard-fought point.\" David Unsworth says he is very happy with a hard-earned point against Crystal Palace following their 2-2 draw. David Unsworth says he is very happy with a hard-earned point against Crystal Palace following their 2-2 draw. Man of the match - Ruben Loftus-Cheek There were doubts over the newly capped Loftus-Cheek's inclusion at Selhurst Park, but the on-loan midfielder brushed off a minor knock to produce another fine individual display. The England international played a crucial role in Palace's first after 51 seconds after his run and shot forced Pickford to palm the ball straight to McArthur and the 21-year-old frequently found space in between Everton's defence and midfield to cause problems. With the return of Christian Benteke and form of Wilfried Zaha, Palace have an attacking front three that should haul them clear of danger and Loftus-Cheek looks ready to shoulder the burden of responsibility as the Eagles continue to scrap for their lives. Opta stats Palace have collected five points from their opening 12 Premier League games - only one team has ever survived relegation having won five points or fewer at this stage (Everton, four points in 1994/95). After failing to score in five of six home Premier League games between April and September, Palace have scored two or more goals in three consecutive top-flight home games for the first time since August 1991. Everton have conceded inside the opening minute of 10 different Premier League games - more than any other side in the competition's history. Oumar Niasse has scored more Premier League goals this season (five in seven games) than he managed in his previous two seasons combined (four in 22). David Unsworth (22) is the only defender to score more Premier League penalties than Leighton Baines (20). Baines scored in back to back Premier League games for the first time. Three of the last five occasions of both teams scoring twice in the first half of Premier League matches have involved either Palace or Everton (also Crystal Palace v Liverpool in October 2016 and Everton v Leicester in April 2017). What's next? Crystal Palace have another home game next weekend as they entertain Stoke City in the Premier League on November 25.

it 10 consecutive Premier League wins as they expertly dismissed Leicester 2-0 at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. Pep Guardiola's side continued their superb run in the English top flight, although they were arguably lucky to end the game with a full complement of players after a second-minute tackle from Vincent Kompany on Jamie Vardy saw him escape with just a yellow card. Both of the goals came either side of half-time, with Gabriel Jesus (45) tapping home from a David Silva cross in the first half before a stunning strike from Kevin De Bruyne (49) sealed another three points for the visitors. Man City are now eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table - ahead of Manchester United in second place - while Claude Puel suffered his first defeat as manager of Leicester, who stay in 12th place. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Simpson (7), Morgan (6), Maguire (6), Fuchs (6), Ndidi (6), Iborra (6), Gray (6), Albrighton (6), Mahrez (6), Vardy (6). Subs used: Iheanacho (4), Slimani (n/a), Okazaki (n/a). Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Stones (5), Kompany (6), Delph (6), De Bruyne (8), Fernandinho (7), Silva (7), Sterling (7), Jesus (7), Sane (8). Subs used: Mangala (6), B Silva (n/a), Gundogan (n/a) Man of the match: Leroy Sane. Kompany made his first Premier League start for City since the end of August but he could have been sent off just minutes into the game. As Vardy raced through on goal, the Belgian produced a crunching tackle to send the striker flying, with the home crowd instantly calling for a red card. Referee Graham Scott only produced a yellow as Kompany got away with a moment of rustiness but the captain atoned for his mistake in the 16th minute. Riyad Mahrez was set away down the right flank by Marc Albrighton, before playing a fizzing ball into the box, but Kompany was waiting at the near post to produce a strong block and send the ball behind the goal. The visitors started to find their attacking feet as the half wore on, with Kasper Schmeichel making a great fingertip save in the 21st minute to deny Silva, before an inviting cross through the box from Leroy Sane just evaded the foot of Raheem Sterling at the back post not long after. Team news Leicester made one change with Marc Albrighton coming in for Shinji Okazaki. Man City made two changes as Vincent Kompany and Gabriel Jesus replaced Nicolas Otamendi and Sergio Aguero. They did eventually make the breakthrough on the stroke of half-time with a superbly worked goal. After a one-two with De Bruyne, Sterling slotted the ball to Silva down the left of the box, who in turn squared it to Jesus at the back post. The striker, who was unmarked, made no mistake in slotting home. The second half started at a pace, with Leicester having two great chances just a minute after the restart. Vardy's effort was punched away by Ederson before Harry Maguire's shot could only find the post, but the rebound allowed Man City to break. It was one that paid off for them too as they burst down the field, with Fernandinho setting off De Bruyne, who in turn picked out Sane down the left-hand side. He then called for the ball back having made his way to the top of the box - which the Germany international obliged - and allowed De Bruyne to curl home an exquisite shot which powered into the top corner. Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne celebrates scoring his side's second goal of the game against Leicester After chances from Jesus and Silva were saved, Leicester gave City a scare in the 67th minute as Vardy chipped the ball over the on-rushing Ederson but a gut-busting run from Kyle Walker saw him clear it off the line, although the offside flag was already raised. The rest of the half passed without much incident as City continued to assert their authority at the top. Opta stats Man City are only the second team to win their first six away games to a Premier League campaign, after Chelsea in 2008-09 (won their first eight). The Foxes failed to land a single shot on target in a Premier League game for the first time since October 2016 versus Chelsea. 50 - Kevin De Bruyne has now had a hand in 50 @premierleague goals (16 goals, 34 assists).

The managers Claude Puel: \"The result is hard of course, it is not good to lose a game but I think there were different events in this game. Yes of course [the game was defined by small margins] because there are so many events in this game. The first move for us and the foul from Vincent Kompany, I think it's a red.

It was three points more and we keep going with our 18 unbeaten in a row in all competitions and a clean sheet. We could have scored more goals. \"The way we played, we continued in much the same way and it's three more points so now, we rest, we start thinking about Feyenoord and Huddersfield and go game by game.\" Pep Guardiola was pleased following Manchester City’s 2-0 win at Leicester but insists they could have scored more Pep Guardiola was pleased following Manchester City’s 2-0 win at Leicester but insists they could have scored more Man of the match - Leroy Sane After winning the Premier League Player of the Month for October award this week, Sane followed it up with another superb performance at the King Power Stadium. He was stuck to the left flank like glue and caused plenty of problems for Leicester, especially in the first half when the game was there for the taking. Most of City's attacking play went through him at one point or another, and he came away with an assist for De Bruyne's stunning goal, who certainly runs Sane very close for the man-of-the-match plaudits.

Liverpool 3-0 Southampton Liverpool turned on the style against Southampton as Mohamed Salah and Philippe Coutinho steered the hosts to a 3-0 win at Anfield. Salah broke the deadlock with a delightful curled effort (31) before latching onto Coutinho’s majestic assist to score his second 10 minutes later, which sees the Egypt international top the Premier League goalscoring charts with nine. Coutinho got the goal his performance deserved after the break, pouncing on the rebound to seal a comfortable victory for the hosts. The result sees Liverpool maintain their unbeaten start to the season at home, while the Saints slip further down the table, having won just one of their last seven games.

Most goals in first 12 PL apps for @LFC 9 – Mohamed Salah 8 – Robbie Fowler#PL #LFC pic.twitter.com/KawQtzikx7 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) November 18, 2017 Salah's ninth league goal of the season - which saw him eclipse Robbie Fowler's record of eight in his first 12 Premier League games for the club - came 10 minutes later, as he beat the offside trap to slot the ball past Forster following Coutinho's incisive pass with the outside of his foot. Team news Jurgen Klopp made four changes, starting Trent Alexander-Arnold ahead of Joe Gomez. Dejan Lovren came in for Joel Matip, while Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson replaced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Emre Can. For Southampton, Wesley Hoedt and Shane Long started in place of Maya Yoshida and Manolo Gabbiadini. After the break, Liverpool continued to dominate, with Firmino seeing his attempt saved before Coutinho sent an effort whistling past the post. The Brazil international was not, to be denied however, and got himself on the scoresheet after Firmino's effort cannoned off the chest of Forster and fell perfectly for the midfielder to latch on to. Firmino came close once again, but Liverpool took their foot off the gas against a hapless Southampton side, who failed to test Simon Mignolet all afternoon. Opta stats Liverpool have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time in 2017, having last done so in December 2016 (a run of four wins). This was Jurgen Klopp's first victory over Southampton in the Premier League (W1 D3 L1), meaning he has now won against 21 of the 23 teams he has faced in the competition - only against Manchester United (4) and Newcastle United (3) has he failed to win. Mohamed Salah has scored 14 goals in all competitions for Liverpool in 2017/18; the most of any Premier League player. Salah has netted nine goals in the Premier League this term; the most by any Liverpool player in their first 12 appearances in the competition. Man of the match - Mohamed Salah Liverpool failed to score against Southampton in four games last season, twice in the Premier League, and on another two occasions in the League Cup. However, the Reds did not have Salah at their disposal. The Egyptian continues to flourish at Anfield, and his 14 goals in all competitions is more than any other Premier League player this season. We will start to run out of superlatives if he continues in this vein, but it was quite simply a sensational performance from Salah which put Southampton to the sword. The mangers Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a difficult game. We had more chances but it was an open game. It was clear we needed to be patient in a lively way. The first goal, I had nothing to do with, and the second - a fantastic pass. \"That's Mo's biggest strength, to run into these areas without being offside, I don't know how it's possible. But the runs are fantastic. We forced the third goal and could have had more. It was the perfect day for us.\" Jurgen Klopp says he got everything he wanted from his players following their 3-0 win over Southampton.

struggling West Brom at the Hawthorns to add to the pressure on beleaguered boss Tony Pulis. Eden Hazard was the star of the show, his good work setting up Alvara Morata for the opener after 17 minutes, before scoring twice himself either side of half-time in a convincing win for Antonio Conte's team. Prior to Hazard's second, Marcos Alonso had already added his side's third before the break to end West Brom's hopes in front of an increasingly agitated Hawthorns crowd. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (5); McAuley (5), Hegazi (5), Evans (5); Phillips (6), Krychowiak (5), Barry (4), Livermore (5), Gibbs (5); Rondon (5), Rodriguez (5). Subs: Yacob (5), McClean (5), Burke (5) Chelsea: Courtois (6); Christensen (8), Cahill (7), Azpilicueta (7); Zappacosta (7), Kante (7), Fabregas (8), Bakayoko (8), Alonso (7); Hazard (9), Morata (8). Subs: Drinkwater (6), Pedro (6), Willian (6). Man of the match: Eden Hazard The result took defending champions Chelsea up to second in the Premier League table prior to Manchester United's game against Newcastle, but extends Albion's winless streak to 10. Pulis' team showed some signs of containing Chelsea early on and had a goal disallowed when Salomon Rondon's header squeezed beyond Thibaut Courtois only for him to be adjudged offside. But any confidence ebbed away once Hazard wriggled free of Gareth Barry and fired off a left-footed shot that Ben Foster could only parry into the path of Morata. It was the Spaniard's eighth goal of the season and his fourth assist came soon after as he flicked on Cesc Fabregas' through-ball into the path of Hazard, who rounded Foster and slotted home. Marcos Alonso scored Chelsea's third before the break at the Hawthorns The third came after Ahmed Hegazi needlessly brought down Morata on the edge of the penalty box and Fabregas' subsequent free-kick was calmly volleyed into the net by the unmarked Alonso. The game was played at a relatively sedate pace after the interval with the result decided but Hazard added his second just after the hour mark, converting brilliantly from Fabregas' lofted pass. Team news West Brom made two changes from the team that lost to Huddersfield with Salomon Rondon replacing Hal Robson-Kanu in the starting line-up and Matty Phillips coming in for Allan Nyom. Chelsea kept faith with the side that saw off Manchester United at Stamford Bridge, although David Luiz did return to the bench where 17-year-old Ethan Ampadu was among the substitutes. Conte had the luxury of removing both men soon after as Chelsea coasted to their fourth consecutive Premier League win of the season. But for Pulis, with owner Guochuan Lai in attendance for the first time since the opening weekend win over Bournemouth, the pressure is building. Match stats The last two occasions of West Brom conceding three first half goals have both been against Chelsea - they also conceded three in the first half in their 3-2 defeat in August 2015. This was the joint-heaviest home Premier League defeat for Tony Pulis, matching his 4-0 defeats to Man City (October 2016) and Chelsea (January 2013 as Stoke boss). Alvaro Morata has had a hand in 12 goals in his first 11 Premier League games for Chelsea (eight goals, four assists), more than any other Blues player in the competition's history. Since the start of last season, Marcos Alonso has scored more Premier League goals (9) than any other defender. The managers Tony Pulis: \"The big thing is, this is not about me, the chairman, the owners or anything like that, it's about what is the right decision. This club will be here well past when you've gone, I've gone, it's about doing the right thing for the football club.\" Tony Pulis says the West Brom owners have to decide if he should stay Tony Pulis says the West Brom owners have to decide if he should stay Antonio Conte: \"We must be pleased because the performance was positive, it was very good. From the start of the game we showed great focus and great concentration. Do not forget that [although] this game that became easy, last season we struggled a lot in both games against West Bromwich. I have watched a lot of games of West Bromwich this season and I think they deserved more points, but today I think we outplayed West Bromwich.\" Antonio Conte says he was pleased with Chelsea's positive performance Antonio Conte says he was pleased with Chelsea's positive performance Man of the match - Eden Hazard Hazard really seems to be enjoying playing in a more central role and did brilliantly for Morata's opener before adding two himself. He was clearly the outstanding player on the pitch and in this form the prospect of Hazard firing Chelsea right back into the title race cannot be ruled out. What's next? West Brom travel to Wembley to face Tottenham next weekend, while Chelsea have a midweek trip to Azerbaijan to take on Qarabag in the Champions League on Wednesday before facing Liverpool at Anfield

The visitors took the lead early on through Dwight Gayle's tidy finish from inside the box after fine work by DeAndre Yedlin, but Anthony Martial levelled with a header from man-of-the-match Pogba's cross. Ashley Young then found the head of Chris Smalling for the hosts' second, before Pogba capped his comeback with a close-range finish from Marcus Rashford's clever header across goal.

The result means United stay eight points behind leaders Manchester City after 12 games, while Newcastle are 11th, five off the drop zone. Paul Pogba celebrates during Man Utd's 4-1 win over Newcastle Newcastle started the brighter, and were ahead on 14 minutes. Yedlin's cut back from a fine run down the right flank fell into the path of Gayle after Victor Lindelof's costly slip, and the striker steered the ball in off the far post from 12 yards. Jacob Murphy struck just wide from an angle minutes later as Newcastle found gaps in the hosts' defence, but Martial got Man Utd back on terms with a far-post header from Pogba's fine lifted cross from the right. Team news Paul Pogba started on his return from long-term injury, while Zlatan Ibrahimovic was named on the bench after he was re-signed. Victor Lindelof and Juan Mata came in, while Ander Herrera was named on the bench. For Newcastle, Ciaran Clark and Jacob Murphy were back in the starting XI. It was 2-1 on the stroke of half-time through Smalling, who headed home from close range at the far post after Young's superb ball from a short corner. Isaac Hayden then struck straight at David De Gea after going one-on-one inside the box, but it was 3-1 after the break as Pogba cleaned up from a few yards out after Marcus Rashford's deft, unselfish header across goal from Lukaku's cross. Matt Ritchie takes on Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba De Gea then did well to tip away Murphy's long-range effort, but Man Utd gained a three-goal cushion through Lukaku, the striker smashing into the roof of the goal from 12 yards after a one-two with Juan Mata. The Old Trafford crowd gave Ibrahimovic a huge ovation as he came on with 13 minutes remaining, and he nearly ended the night with a goal, only to see his scissor-kick beaten away by Rob Elliot. Opta stats Man Utd have now won seven consecutive Premier League games at Old Trafford; their longest run since March 2013, when they won 12 in succession under Sir Alex Ferguson. Jose Mourinho's side also extended their unbeaten run at Old Trafford in the Premier League to 23 games (W13 D10); their longest streak since October 2011 (a run of 25). Newcastle have now lost against Man Utd on 26 occasions in the Premier League; more than against any other opponent in the competition. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"[Pogba] was top. It looked like he had not been out. He came back with a really great performance. He was a great influence in the game. He affects our football. We all know, myself and the fellow players, that certain players influence the levels of the team. With him we have much more creation. I am so happy.\" Rafa Benitez: \"You see the difference in terms of money spent but it is not something we didn't know. We knew that was a massive difference between both teams. But I am really pleased with our performance in the first 30 minutes.\" Man Utd manager Jose Mourinho was full of praise for Pogba Man of the match - Paul Pogba The Frenchman showed everyone what United have been missing over the last two months with a trademark dominant display in midfield, scoring one and setting up another. His assist for Martial's header was most impressive, patiently twisting and turning his marker until he found a yard to sit up a nightmare ball for defenders. He made more passes in the opposition half than any other player (46) and also took part in more duels (18).

Palace 1-0 at Wembley as Mauricio Pochettino's side stayed in touch with Man City at the top of the Premier League. The South Korea forward scored the winner midway through the second period with a well-struck shot from the edge of the area. However, Palace will feel aggrieved to have left the home of football pointless after spurning a number of presentable chances, while third-choice Tottenham goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga was also called upon to make several impressive saves.

In a cagey and closely contested first period, it was actually the visitors who had the best opening of the half when, nine minutes before the interval, Scott Dann rose highest to meet Yohan Cabaye's right-wing corner. However, Gazzaniga - only playing after injuries to both Hugo Lloris and Michel Vorm - reacted brilliantly to keep the defender's header out as the teams went in level at the break. Crystal Palace defender Mamadou Sakho (left) challenges for the ball with Spurs 'keeper Paulo Gazzaniga It was more of the same in the second half as the Argentine first turned Andros Townsend's goalbound effort behind, before then reacting brilliantly to keep out Luka Milivojevic's close-range header. The visitors only had themselves to blame though for not opening the scoring just before the hour-mark after another lightning break involving Townsend, who released Zaha on goal. However, after rounding the advancing Gazzaniga, the playmaker missed the target with the goal gaping, and Roy Hodgson's men soon paid for their profligacy as Spurs took the lead. Team news Spurs made five changes from their midweek win over Real, with Gazzaniga, Aurier, Rose - making his first league start since January - Son and Sissoko starting, but Lloris, Alli and Alderweireld were injured. Palace made two alterations from last weekend's 2-2 draw with West Ham as Sakho and Fosu-Mensah replaced Tomkins and the injured Van Aanholt. The home side's 64th-minute winner was a little fortunate, coming as it did after Palace failed to clear their lines, although Son still had a lot to do to beat Julian Speroni with a delightful left-footed curler. Match stats After failing to win in their first three Premier League games at Wembley, Spurs have now won their last three in a row Indeed, Palace are only the second team to fail to score in their first six away games of a Premier League season, after Derby in 2007-08 (8) Son's goal was his 20th in the Premier League, making him the top-scoring Asian in the competition, surpassing Park Ji-Sung's record of 19 Gazzaniga is the 15th goalkeeper to play for Spurs in the Premier League, but only the fourth not to concede a goal on his debut (Ian Walker, Hugo Lloris and Michel Vorm) Four points from their opening 11 games marks Crystal Palace's joint-worst start to a top-flight campaign, though they finished in 11th the other time it happened in 2013-14 20 - Son Heung-Min is now the all-time highest Asian goalscorer in @premierleague history, with 20 goals.

We hope he's going well in the next few weeks and will be available.\" Spurs midfielder Harry Winks receives treatment for an ankle injury Roy Hodgson: \"We need points and I'd have settled for playing much worse and having a bit of good fortune, such as a ball deflecting past a goalkeeper or the referee awarding a penalty which isn't. \"When we look at the table we're still on four points and we're getting further away from the teams that are just outside of the relegation zone, and our task gets harder with every defeat. \"It would be nice by the end of the season to have one person who is a centre forward and goal scorer. They have Kane, Son and Llorente, and all we have if we want to change something is Bakary Sako, a left winger trying his best as a centre forward.\" Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson looks on at Wembley Man of the Match - Paulo Gazzaniga Gazzaniga got the call following knocks to Hugo Lloris and Michel Vorm and Spurs were grateful to him for keeping them in the contest.

Kevin De Bruyne netted the opener (19) with a low, left-footed effort from 16 yards into the bottom right corner, and Sergio Aguero made it 2-0 from the penalty spot (50) after Raheem Sterling was shoved in the box by Nacho Monreal. Sub Alexandre Lacazette halved the deficit with a low drive (65) through Ederson's legs, but City regained their two-goal lead through their own sub Gabriel Jesus (74), netting from close range despite David Silva being in an offside position before crossing.

Arsenal have not beaten one of their big five rivals on the road since they won at the Etihad nearly three years ago, and their struggles went on as City attacked in numbers. Aguero - who was given a pre-match guard of honour after becoming City's record goalscorer in midweek - blazed over from an angle early on, while Leroy Sane's ball across the face of goal was inches from being converted by Sterling. Team news Alex Iwobi started for Arsenal in place of Alexandre Lacazette, while Francis Coquelin came in for Per Mertesacker, who was out with illness. Sergio Aguero started for the hosts, with Gabriel Jesus on the bench, and Raheem Sterling started in place of Bernardo Silva. Aguero (L) celebrates with Leroy Sane City took the lead on 19 minutes through De Bruyne, who found the bottom right corner from the left of the box following a nice one-two with Fernandinho, just 30 seconds after Petr Cech had superbly denied the Belgian from a snapshot from 20 yards. The hosts continued to pile on the pressure as Sterling miscued a square ball for Sane to convert before Laurent Koscielny nearly diverted the ball into his own net, but City goalkeeper Ederson was forced into action in first-half stoppage time, saving well down low from Aaron Ramsey's drive. It was 2-0 just five minutes after the break as Sterling got goal-side of Monreal from Fernandinho's fine lofted ball, forcing the Spaniard to push him over. Aguero stepped up and sent Cech the wrong way, in off the post. Lacazette was on the pitch just nine minutes before netting, striking low past Ederson after Ramsey's through ball, and Cech kept Arsenal in it at the other end, blocking Jesus' close-range effort at the far post from a corner. But Jesus gave City breathing space 16 minutes from time, finishing off from six yards from Silva's low centre, but the midfielder was in an offside position from Fernandinho's initial through ball to the right of the box. Aguero looks to shake off the challenge of Francis Coquelin Man of the match - David Silva De Bruyne was firmly in the running, but Silva's typically classy show did not go unnoticed. The Spaniard was faultless on the ball, and even kept his position with discipline to allow City's quicker players in Sane, De Bruyne and Sterling to bomb forward. He has a game-high 64 touches in the opposition half, more than double Arsenal's highest of 31 from Mesut Ozil, and kept his calm to set up Jesus for City's vital third goal.

Arsene Wenger says referee Michael Oliver got two crucial decisions wrong Arsene Wenger says referee Michael Oliver got two crucial decisions wrong \"But we are used to it when coming here, last year they had two offside goals, and once again, I feel they don't work enough, because the level drops every season at the moment.

At 2-1 we are in the game, and he gives a clear offside goal, and of course that kills the game for us.\" Pep Guardiola: \"The penalty was a penalty, the offside was offside but we won because we were better.\" Pep Guardiola says his side fully deserved their victory Pep Guardiola says his side fully deserved their victory Opta stats Manchester City's 31 points and a +31 goal difference is the best-ever start to a Premier League season after 11 games.

Chelsea 1-0 Manchester Utd Chelsea 1-0 Manchester Utd Alvaro Morata's 55th-minute header sealed a 1-0 win for Chelsea over Manchester United, who fell eight points behind league leaders Manchester City. Morata, who revealed he had an offer to join United before signing for Chelsea this summer, headed home Cesar Azpilicueta's cross to ease the pressure on Antonio Conte. With Manchester City beating Arsenal 3-1 earlier on Super Sunday, the title race has already taken a big swing to the blue side of Manchester but Chelsea closed to within nine points with this deserved victory. The result means Jose Mourinho has not won any of his last 11 Premier League away games at the 'big six' with his teams failing to score in nine of the last 10 matches. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (7), Azpilicueta (8), Christensen (6), Cahill (7), Zappacosta (6), Bakayoko (6), Fabregas (8), Alonso (6), Kante (7), Morata (8), Hazard (7) Subs: Willian (6), Drinkwater (6), Rudiger (6) Manchester United: De Gea (7), Bailly (6), Valencia (6), Jones (6), Smalling (6), Young (6), Herrera (6), Matic (6), Mkhitaryan (6), Lukaku (6), Rashford (6). Subs: Fellaini (6), Martial (6) Man of the match: Cesc Fabregas Mourinho's team unexpectedly pressed high early on, with their full-backs playing like wingers at times. This resulted in an end-to-end game played at a good tempo. Phil Jones thumped a left-wing cross into his own net but was deemed to have been fouled by Morata while Marcus Rashford looped a header over the crossbar when well placed. Cesar Azpilicueta and Marcus Rashford battle for possession Tiemoue Bakayoko then sliced wide with the goal gaping and Andreas Christensen headed over from seven yards out following a wonderful Cesc Fabregas corner. Their next headed chance would not be wasted. With 55 minutes gone, Azpilicueta found space down the right and planted a sensational ball into Morata, who thumped a header into the top corner. It was the fifth time this season Azpilicueta had supplied an assist for the Chelsea striker. Team news Antonio Conte made three changes with the headline being N’Golo Kante returning from injury. There was no David Luiz in the squad – a decision Conte confirmed as \"tactical\". United kept the same line-up that saw off Tottenham 1-0. Chelsea looked the more likely to grab the second goal with Bakayoko firing wide when clean through on goal before Eden Hazard forced a smart save from David de Gea. With the clock running down, the withdrawal of Fabregas seemed to inspire United and substitute Marouane Fellaini was denied by a flying Thibaut Courtois save. That proved to be the last chance as Manchester City head into the international break firmly in control of the Premier League. Antonio Conte appeared to snub Jose Mourinho's offer of a handshake following Chelsea's victory over Manchester United on Super Sunday. Antonio Conte appeared to snub Jose Mourinho's offer of a handshake following Chelsea's victory over Manchester United on Super Sunday. Man of the match - Cesc Fabregas Fabregas was allowed plenty of space by the opposition midfield and he revelled in it, creating six goalscoring opportunities in the match - no other Chelsea player provided more than one. His link-up play with Hazard and Morata, especially in the second-half, provided a platform for Chelsea to pin United back. When he was taken off with 12 minutes to go, United breathed a huge sigh of relief. Opta stats The Blues have lost just one of their last 16 Premier League home matches against Man Utd, winning 10 and drawing five. Morata has had a hand in 10 goals in his opening 10 Premier League games for Chelsea (7 goals, 3 assists) - only Diego Costa was involved in more in his first 10 for the club (11). Morata has scored 10 headed goals in league competition since the start of last season - no player in the big five European leagues has scored more (level with Andrea Bellotti). After recording 20 shots on target and scoring seven goals in their first three away league games this season, the Red Devils have managed just six in their last three, scoring once. There are now eight points separating Man Utd in second and Man City in first - the biggest ever such gap after both the top two have played 11 games in Premier League history. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"The game was controlled by us and the game was controlled by them. We had chances and they had chances. We had a go, we tried to change the direction of our game. We created chances to equalise but we couldn't. There is still a lot of play. I hope, feel, think and wish that in the busy festive period and new year we are going to be at maximum strength with Paul Pogba, Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo back.\" Jose Mourinho responds to Manchester Utd's 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Watford Watch highlights from Everton's dramatic comeback against Watford Goals from Oumar Niasse, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Leighton Baines saw Everton come back from two goals down to beat Watford 3-2 in a dramatic contest at Goodison Park. Richarlison and Christian Kabasele gave Watford a commanding 2-0 lead early in the second half, but goals from Niasse, Calvert-Lewin and Baines' spot-kick in stoppage-time ensured an incredible fightback. There might have been further drama as Tom Cleverley had the opportunity to convert a penalty for the visitors in the 11th minute of injury time after Richarlison was brought down by Jordan Pickford - but the former Everton midfielder fired wide as the hosts held on for a crucial victory. The win means Everton move up to 15th in the Premier League table, while Marco Silva's Watford remain in ninth. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Kenny (6), Keane (6), Jagielka (6), Baines (8), Gueye (6), Davies (6), Sigurdsson (6), Baningime (6), Rooney (6), Niasse (7) Subs: Lookman (7), Calvert-Lewin (8), Baningime (6) Watford: Gomes (8), Femenia (7), Kabasele (7), Britos (6), Holebas (5), Doucoure (6), Cleverley (5), Hughes (6), Carrillo (6), Richarlison (7), Gray (7) Subs: Karnezis (4), Mariappa (7), Okaka (5) Man of the match: Leighton Baines Both sides struggled to get into any real rhythm in a scrappy but entertaining first half. Everton were almost made to pay for not breaking the deadlock in the 39th minute as Andre Gray slipped Richarlison through Everton's high line but though the 20-year-old Brazilian rounded Pickford, he fired his strike into the side-netting. Richarlison put Watford in front shortly after half-time Two minutes later, Abdoulaye Doucoure unleashed a clean strike from distance which Pickford blocked in a half that Silva's side edged. Watford carried their momentum straight into the second half as Richarlison atoned for his earlier miss. A rapid counter-attack saw Gray unselfishly lay the ball off to the winger, who skipped by Pickford and poked his shot in off the post (46). Team news Everton made six changes. Michael Keane, Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines, Tom Davies, Oumar Niasse and Wayne Rooney all came in for Cuco Martina, Ashley Williams, Morgan Schneiderlin, Aaron Lennon and Ademola Lookman. Will Hughes made his first Premier League start in place of Etienne Capoue. Suspended Troy Deeney was replaced by Andre Gray. But Everton replied quickly. Gomes pulled off a fine double save to deny Niasse and Rooney yet, unfortunately for the Brazilian goalkeeper, he was forced off injured after colliding with the Senegalese forward's knee when he landed - prompting the ample added time. Christian Kabasele doubled Watford's lead after heading in Jose Holebas' corner but, moments later, the visitors gifted Everton a route back into the match. Holebas' scuffed clearance led to a mix-up with substitute goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis, allowing Niasse to slot home the ball (67) Calvert-Lewin then came off the bench to head home Baines' corner (74) and a comeback to remember for the strugglers was sealed when Holebas slipped into Aaron Lennon, resulting in an Everton penalty which Baines calmly converted (90+1). Cleverley failed to convert from the spot, meaning Everton held on for victory Watford nearly took a point back to Vicarage Road as Richarlison was hauled down in the penalty box by Pickford deep into stoppage time, but Cleverley fired his penalty wide to ensure Everton claimed a morale-boosting victory. Man of the Match - Leighton Baines Baines showed his experience and composure at an incredibly important moment in Everton's season by cooly placing his spot-kick to ensure his side would complete the victory against Watford. The 32-year-old also produced Everton's closest opportunity in the first half as his shot was tipped away by Gomes, and he added an assist to his record for Calvert-Lewin's goal to mark a fine performance. The managers David Unsworth praises his players and the Everton fans after a fine comeback win David Unsworth praises his players and the Everton fans after a fine comeback win David Unsworth: \"I'm proud of the club. Proud of the fans and players, and the way we got back into the game. \"We showed great fight and spirit and that's what you need when you're at the bottom of the table. \"You have to show desire and determination and never give in. You have to show that type of attitude. We didn't give it and we've climbed up the table tonight and it looks better than it did before the game.\" Marco Silva felt the difference was in the small moments following their 3-2 defeat to Everton Marco Silva felt the difference was in the small moments following their 3-2 defeat to Everton Marco Silva: \"It's the type of match that are not easy to explain. Its disappointing for everybody and the players in the dressing room. But this is football and you have to keep working and going. \"If we performed like that again we'll be in a good way. We have some young players and others with lots of experience so we have to be different in some moments. \"In that moment [Niasse's goal] we respect they tried to give everything but it was more our mistake to let them back in the game again.\" Opta stats Everton came from two goals down to win at home in the Premier League for only the second time ever and for the first time since May 1994 v Wimbledon (3-2). Watford have lost each of their last three Premier League games, after losing just one of their previous eight under Marco Silva this season (W4 D3). Richarlison has been directly involved in six goals in the Premier League this season (4 goals, 2 assists), more than any other Watford player. Oumar Niasse has netted four goals in his four Premier League appearances at Goodison Park for Everton this season. What's next?

Leicester had won all three games since the departure of Craig Shakespeare and got their noses in front twice at the bet365 stadium, through Vincent Iborra (33) and Riyad Mahrez (60), Xherdan Shaqiri's (39) neat finish sandwiched in between. The Foxes looked in full control at 2-1 but Crouch, who equalled Shola Ameobi's record of 142 Premier League substitute appearances, made an immediate impact to draw his team level with a powerful header (73). Player ratings Stoke: Butland (5), Pieters (6), Wimmer (6), Zouma (5), Shawcross (5), Fletcher (6), Diouf (6), Allen (6), Choupo-Moting (7), Shaqiri (7), Sobhi (6) Subs: Crouch (7), Berahino (6) Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (6), Morgan (6), Maguire (5), Fuchs (5), Ndidi (7), Okazaki (6), Iborra (7), Gray (6), Vardy (6), Mahrez (7) Subs: Iheanacho (6), Albrighton (6), King (6) Man of the match: Peter Crouch This was a contest that took a while to warm up - even referee Bobby Madley was caught cold as he limped off with a calf problem on 23 minutes, to be replaced by fourth official Jon Moss. The game needed a goal to release the shackles. That breakthrough came on 33 minutes when Harry Maguire's knockdown from a corner was lashed home by Iborra for his first goal since joining from Sevilla. Vicente Iborra celebrates scoring the first goal of the game The visitors could smell blood and Iborra should have doubled his tally but planted a header over the crossbar from a pin-point Demarai Gray cross. The home fans were becoming restless but Shaqiri eased the tension six minutes before the break by sweeping home a swift counter-attack following a fine ball from Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. Team news Mark Hughes opted to keep the same team that won 1-0 at Watford last weekend, which meant no place for Peter Crouch, Saido Berahino or Jese in the starting XI. There was one change for Leicester with Ben Chilwell missing out (knee) and replaced by Shinji Okazaki. The game swung momentum again on 60 minutes when the Foxes regained the lead just 60 seconds after Kasper Schmeichel had denied Ryan Shawcross with a flying save. Shinji Okazaki and Joe Allen battle for possession at the Bet365 Stadium Mahrez picked up the ball down the right channel, cut inside and drilled a low effort past Jack Butland, who will be disappointed to have let the effort slip through his grasp. Crouch was introduced on 68 minutes and took just five minutes to make a decisive impact, when got on the end of a left-wing corner for his 52nd headed Premier League goal. The striker nearly made it 53 with the penultimate touch of the game but his near post header was brilliantly palmed clear by Schmeichel, which meant this fixture finished 2-2 for the third season in a row. Opta stats Darren Fletcher has now appeared in 102 consecutive Premier League matches for his clubs (WBA & Stoke combined) - this is the joint-fifth longest run by an outfield player in Premier League history. Shaqiri's goal was only the third (of nine in total) that he's scored inside the box as a Premier League player - the last time he scored a league goal inside the box was back in December 2015. Shaqiri has now been involved in 21 Premier League goals (nine goals, 12 assists) - more than double the number of any other Swiss player (Ramon Vega - 10 goal involvements). Mahrez has been involved in a goal in four successive Premier League matches (two goals, two assists) - the first time he's managed this in the competition. Man of the match - Peter Crouch Hailed by Sky Sports analyst Alan Pardew as a \"golden cameo\", Crouch changed the game when arrived from the bench with 22 minutes to go just when it seemed to be slipping away from Stoke. They were lacking in ideas as Leicester were dominating the chances on the counter but the 36-year-old gave Stoke a direct option and he popped up with the all-important equalising goal. What's next? After the international break, Stoke are in front of the Sky Sports cameras again on Monday Night Football away to Brighton while Leicester host Premier League leaders Manchester City on the Saturday

Smith's Stadium on Saturday. The hosts opened the scoring a minute before half-time when Van La Parra curled an unstoppable 35-yard effort into the top right-hand corner of the net, the winger's first goal since March. David Wagner's team had to play more than the final half an hour with 10 men after Christopher Schindler's red card for two bookings, but held on to record successive top-flight home wins for the first time since November 1971.

In a tight and cagey first period, it was Huddersfield who went in ahead at the break after a rare moment of brilliance from Van La Parra, starting after recovering from the groin problem that saw him subbed at Anfield last weekend. Aaron Mooy took a quick free-kick just inside Huddersfield's half, catching West Brom out, with the hosts then launching a swift counter-attack that ended with the Dutchman beating a motionless Ben Foster from distance with one of the goals of the season so far. Rajiv van La Parra is congratulated after scoring the only goal of the game The home team's control of the contest diminished on 57 minutes though after Schindler - already on a yellow for pulling back Hal Robson-Kanu in the first half - was given his marching orders following a late tackle on Ahmed Hegazi. West Brom threw everything they had at their opponents for the final half an hour, but the closest they actually came to drawing level was in stoppage time when Jonas Lossl produced two sensational saves to earn his team all three points. The Denmark international's first stop kept out substitute James McClean's close-range header and then after the visitors recycled the ball, the 28-year-old did even better to dive full length to touch fellow substitute Matt Phillips' low drive behind for a corner. Team news Huddersfield made three changes from last weekend's 3-0 loss at Liverpool, with captain Tommy Smith, Chris Lowe and Danny Williams all dropping to the bench to be replaced by Scott Malone, Elias Kachunga and Florent Hadergjonaj. The Baggies made just one alteration from last Saturday's 3-2 home defeat to Man City, with Hal Robson-Kanu coming in for Salomon Rondon up front. At the full-time whistle, the entire Huddersfield bench, including Wagner, ran straight over to Lossl to thank the goalkeeper for securing the precious victory. Match stats Huddersfield have now won 11 points at home in the Premier League this season - only Arsenal (15), Manchester United (15) and Manchester City (13) have won more. Despite playing against 10 men for 33 minutes of this match, West Brom (49.7 per cent) still held less possession than Huddersfield (50.3 per cent). West Brom have lost all eight of the competitive matches that they have conceded the first goal in since May 2017. This is West Brom's lowest points tally after 11 games of a Premier League season (10) since 2005-06 (8), when they were relegated. Ahmed El-Sayed Hegazi (left) and Laurent Depoitre compete for the ball Rajiv van La Parra ended a run of 23 successive appearances in all competitions for Huddersfield without a goal, with his first-half strike in this game. West Bromwich Albion made a triple substitution in this match - this first time it's happened in the Premier League this season and the last time a team did it was in March (Man Utd v Bournemouth). This was the first red card that Roger East has given in the Premier League in over a year (September 2016) - he hadn't given one in any of his last 12 games in the competition. The managers David Wagner: \"The players have shown today that they are capable of both - they played good football in ball position as long as they were even,\" said Wagner. \"After the suspension of Christopher Schindler they have shown as well that they are able to defend and to show the right team spirit and fighting spirit what you have to show. \"I think they have done it brilliant, I am absolutely delighted with the effort the players have shown today. This for sure is one of the biggest wins for us as a team in this season.\" Huddersfield boss David Wagner was delighted with the different qualities his side showed in their win over West Brom and praised goalkeeper Jonas Lossl Huddersfield boss David Wagner was delighted with the different qualities his side showed in their win over West Brom and praised goalkeeper Jonas Lossl Tony Pulis: \"I expect that (booing from the West Brom fans),\" said Pulis, who took charge at the Hawthorns in January 2015. \"Every club, every group of supporters, if you have gone on a run like we have, and it is a poor run, will criticise. \"And the person who gets it is the manager. I am not stupid enough to think they are going to look anywhere else. I have been at the club nearly three years now and having joined the football club, the club is in a much better position now. \"Although the results have not gone well, the club is in a much better position than it was when I first took over by a country mile. But we need some breaks and we have not had those breaks. \"And like I say, am I worried? I do not like it, but I am more worried about the players than anything else.\" West Brom boss Tony Pulis says he understands the frustration from the supporters after they lost 1-0 at Huddersfield but adds that he has the support of everyone within the club.

The pundit - Matt Le Tissier \"It was a very gutsy win. West Brom had made it fairly comfortable up until that point (the sending-off) because they were not particularly ambitious in the game. \"But that final half an hour, I thought Huddersfield were very well organised, kept their shape pretty well and it was only really the last few minutes where West Brom exerted any constant pressure on the defence. \"Other than that, they coped admirably and when Jonas Lossl was needed, he came up with two terrific saves.\" Matt Le Tissier says it was a gutsy performance from Huddersfield after they held onto a 1-0 win, despite going down to 10 men.

Man of the Match - Rajiv van La Parra Rajiv van La Parra celebrates after scoring from long range In a game of few chances, it was the Van La Parra's magnificent long-range effort just before the interval that proved the difference between the two sides at the John Smith's. There appeared little danger when the 26-year-old picked possession of the ball some 35 yards from goal, only for the player to bring the house down with a sumptuous effort that flew past a helpless Foster into the top corner of the net. That wonder strike - the player's first-ever Premier League goal - capped off an impressive display from the all-action wide man. What's next?

highlights of Bournemouth's last-gasp win at Newcastle Steve Cook scored a 92nd-minute winner to give Bournemouth a vital 1-0 victory at Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday. Cook arrived in the area from an Andrew Surman corner at the death, meeting it with a bullet a header past Rob Elliot to give struggling Bournemouth all three points. Asmir Begovic and Elliot kept the scores level in the first half with two fine saves each, while Dwight Gayle had a goal ruled out for offside, despite replays showing he was just level. Steve Cook's stoppage-time header secured a dramatic win for Bournemouth at Newcastle Player ratings Newcastle: Elliot (7), Yedlin (5), Lascelles (5), Lejeune (5), Manquillo (5), Shelvey (5), Hayden (6), Atsu (5), Ritchie (6), Joselu (5), Gayle (6) Subs: Clark (6), Murphy (5), Perez (5) Bournemouth: Begovic (8), Daniels (7), Francis (8), Steve Cook (7), Ake (7), Arter (7), Surman (7), Pugh (7), Ibe (6), Wilson (6), King (7) Subs: Smith (6), Defoe (6) Man of the match: Simon Francis Bournemouth had the best chances of the second half through Callum Wilson, who struck wide having been played through one-on-one with Elliot, and then Marc Pugh, who hit the post after a fine deflection by Ciaran Clark. The result means Bournemouth move out of the relegation zone into 16th, while Newcastle drop into the bottom half. Both sides had chances during an entertaining opening half, the first falling to Matt Ritchie as his 25-yard piledriver was tipped wide superbly by Begovic. Team news Newcastle made two changes following defeat at Burnley, bringing in Gayle and Hayden for Perez and Diame, while Bournemouth made five changes. Arter, Pugh, Ibe, Wilson and King came in for Smith, Lewis Cook, Stanislas, Afobe and Defoe. Steve Cook wheels off in celebration after his last-gasp winner Gayle's far-post header on the stretch was then blocked well by Cook before Begovic again dived to beat away Christian Atsu's fierce half-volley from 25 yards. Gayle looked level with the last defender as he rolled the ball into the net after Ritchie's curling effort from 25 yards came back off the post, but the linesman ruled it out for offside. At the other end, Elliot tipped over Wilson's looping header and then did well to hold Josh King's shot from an angle as Bournemouth broke forward in numbers. Wilson should have made it 1-0 after the break, hitting wide after being put through one-on-one by King, before Pugh hit the post from eight yards after beating Elliot, seeing his shot come off the foot of Clark and onto the woodwork. But Bournemouth got the goal the game deserved in the second minute of injury time as Cook met Surman's out-swinging corner with a fine header into the top corner, giving them only their third win of the season. Opta stats This is only the second time that Bournemouth have won back-to-back away games in the Premier League, with the previous occurrence happening in December 2015. Bournemouth won a Premier League game with a 90th-minute winner for only the third time - the previous two were vs West Ham (4-3 in March 2017) and vs Liverpool (4-3 in Dec 2016). The last time that Newcastle lost a Premier League home game through a 90th-minute goal was back in December 2015 (0-1 vs Everton). This is the third successive Premier League game that Newcastle have played in that has ended 1-0 with the winning goal being scored in the final 16 minutes of the match.

Nathan Redmond and Sofiane Boufal came closest to scoring for the hosts in the opening 45 minutes. But an uninspiring second-half performance from Mauricio Pellegrino's men allowed Burnley in as Vokes came off the bench to seal the winner 10 minutes from time. Southampton pushed for an equaliser, but Burnley held strong to keep a clean sheet and continue their fine season, while putting further pressure on manager Pellegrino. Burnley's second win this week, following their victory over Newcastle on Monday, means Sean Dyche's men remain in seventh, while Southampton drop down to 13th. Player ratings Southampton: Forster (5), Cedric (6), Yoshida (6), Van Dijk (6), Bertrand (6), Romeu (6), Davis (6), Boufal (6), Redmond (7), Tadic (6), Gabbiadini (5) Subs: Long (5), Austin (5), Ward-Prowse (N/A) Burnley: Pope (9), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (7), Mee (8), Ward (7), Cork (6), Hendrick (6), Defour (7), Brady (6), Gudmundsson (7), Wood (6) Subs: Barnes (7), Vokes (8) Man of the match: Nick Pope Johann Gudmundsson fired an early warning shot over the bar for the visitors which proved to be their closest scoring chance in a drab opening 45 minutes. It was a tight contest at St Mary's Southampton took the initiative for the rest of the half as Redmond asserted himself on the game. First, he fired his shot on-the-run over the bar on the half-hour mark, shortly before crossing in for Boufal's half-volley, which forced Burnley's goalkeeper Nick Pope into making a reflex save. Pope was called into action again two minutes from half-time as Redmond burst down the flank and cut in onto his left foot, but the 25-year-old former Charlton 'keeper got down low to palm away the vicious effort from range. Team news Just the one change for Burnley as Chris Wood returned from a hamstring injury. He took Ashley Barnes’ spot up front. Steven Defour recovered in time after coming off against Newcastle on Monday night. For Southampton they have made two changes. Wesley Hoedt made way for Maya Yoshida while James Ward-Prowse dropped to the bench with Nathan Redmond taking his place. Southampton started the second-half intent on breaking the deadlock and they came close through Maya Yoshida, whose fierce shot on the turn was tipped over the bar by Pope, after Gudmundsson's crucially blocked Redmond's close-range shot. Captain Ben Mee encapsulated a solid Burnley defensive performance by getting in the way to block Dusan Tadic's point-blank strike that looked destined for goal in the 61st minute. It was at that point Dyche elected to go more attacking; he brought strikers Ashley Barnes and Vokes onto the pitch and the decision paid off. In the 80th minute, Vokes rose highest to meet Gudmundsson's looping cross from the right flank and placed his header into the bottom corner, beyond a forlorn Fraser Forster. Southampton failed to find a reply as Burnley held on for yet another significant victory. Opta stats Southampton have failed to score in nine of their last 12 Premier League home games (W2 D4 L6). In contrast, Burnley have kept clean sheets in five of their last eight top-flight matches, including each of the last two. Burnley have picked 19 points after their first 11 games this season - their best record at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1973-73 (24 points - assuming three points for a win). The Clarets had picked up just one point after their first six away Premier League games last season, they've already picked up 11 this season - more than they collected in the whole of last season on the road (7). Man of the Match - Nick Pope Pope put in an impressive display for Burnley against Southampton The Burnley goalkeeper kept his side in the game when they were most under pressure and pulled off a string of fine saves to deny Redmond, Boufal and Yoshida throughout the game. The 25-year-old, who was nominated for October's Premier League Player of the Month award, will continue to draw praise after yet another fine performance filling in for the injured Tom Heaton.

Brighton a 1-0 victory over struggling Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. With just under half an hour played, the visitors took the lead as Murray nudged the ball into the net from close range following Anthony Knockaert's pinpoint cross from the right wing. Swansea toiled in their attempts to salvage a point from the game in the second half and went closest to equalising in stoppage time as Luciano Narsingh lashed a shot off the top of the crossbar. Following Bournemouth's injury-time winner against Newcastle, Swansea have slipped into the relegation zone in 18th place, while Brighton are sitting pretty in eighth after stringing together a four-game unbeaten run. Murray has been in good form for Brighton of late, scoring in three successive games in the Premier League, but there was an element of fortune to his latest strike on 29 minutes as he bobbled the ball in past Lukasz Fabianski with his thigh after Knockaert had picked him out with a sumptuous in-swinging cross from the touchline. Rather than spur Swansea into the action, the goal seemed to stun them and Brighton almost went two up just three minutes later as Murray saw a goalbound volley blocked behind before Lewis Dunk's thunderous header from the resulting corner was acrobatically tipped over by Fabianski. Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (7), Naughton (5), Mawson (6), Fernandez (5), Clucas (4), Fer (6), Carroll (5), Ki (5), Dyer (5), Ayew (6), Abraham (7) Subs: Narsingh (6), McBurnie (N/A), Routledge (N/A) Brighton: Ryan (6), Bruno (6), Dunk (7), Duffy (7), Bong (6), Knockaert (8), Propper (7), Stephens (6), Gross (5), Izquierdo (6), Murray (7) Subs: March (5), Brown (5), Hemed (N/A) Man of the match: Anthony Knockaert The Swansea players were greeted by a chorus of boos from the home supporters as the half-time whistle sounded but they almost gave them something to cheer about shortly after the interval as England call-up Tammy Abraham latched onto a through-ball from Nathan Dyer inside the area, only to see his attempted chip blocked by Mat Ryan. Despite dominating the second half with just under 60 per cent of possession, Swansea's quality in the final third and from set-pieces was sorely lacking, although they did create a great chance to equalise in stoppage-time as Narsingh rattled the crossbar with a venomous strike inside the area after being slipped through by Abraham, who was the one source of invention for his side all afternoon. Team news Paul Clement made just one change to his side with Nathan Dyer coming in at the expense of Mike Van Der Hoorn. It was a tactical shift with Swansea switching from a 3-5-2 formation deployed against Arsenal last weekend to a 4-3-3.Chris Hughton named an unchanged side for the third game running for Brighton with Glenn Murray leading the line in a 4-5-1 system. There was even time for some more late drama as Fabianski came up for a late corner only to see Ki's under-hit delivery intercepted by a Brighton defender to spark a counter-attack, although substitute Izzy Brown failed to capitalise on the situation by giving the ball away rather than have an attempt on the unguarded goal. It was an extremely frustrating day for the home side that was best encapsulated by Sam Clucas' angry reaction to being substituted as he lashed out at a kit bag on the touchline before taking his seat on the bench. Brighton, though, were well deserving of their win, sealed by the evergreen Murray who now has four goals in his last three games. Opta stats Swansea have lost five of those six home league games - the first time they've ever lost five of their first six home matches in the league at this stage. There were just 15 shots in this match - only four Premier League games have seen fewer this season. Brighton & Hove Albion have picked up successive league away wins after just one point from their first four on the road this season (D1 L3). In fact, Brighton have recorded back-to-back away victories in the top-flight for only the second time, and first time since April 1981 when they won at Crystal Palace and Sunderland. Of English players since the start of last season, only Harry Kane (37) has scored more goals in the top two tiers of English football than Glenn Murray (27 - level with Tammy Abraham). Glenn Murray has scored in three successive Premier League games for the first time since April 2015. Man of the match - Anthony Knockaert In a game of minimal quality it was Anthony Knockaert who delivered the one moment of magic at the Liberty Stadium, as he cut in from the right and bent in a wonderful cross on his left foot for Murray to score the only goal. Even that moment aside, last season's Championship Player of the Year was the standout player throughout, taking every opportunity to drive at the Swansea defenders with the ball while he also contributed defensively too by winning four tackles. The managers Paul Clement: \"Another narrow defeat, it's the sixth game that we've lost by the odd goal but my first reflection on that performance is that if you play at that level, you can't be expected to win a Premier League game. The standard that we're playing at is much higher and for me that's the most disappointing thing.\" Chris Hughton: \"Every three points, particularly away from home are always a big three points. I think we learned a fair bit from the West Ham game and fortunately, we were able to bring that into today.\" What's next? Swansea are away after the upcoming international break as they face in-form Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday 18th November. Brighton will be in action against Stoke City on Monday Night Football on 20th November and the game will be live on Sky Sports Main Event from 7pm."}, {"date": "04/11/2018", "arena": "London

Liverpool's 4-1 win over West Ham Mohamed Salah scored twice as Liverpool increased the pressure on Slaven Bilic with a 4-1 victory over West Ham at the London Stadium on Saturday. Summer signing Salah put the visitors ahead in the 21st minute and Joel Matip made it 2-0 from a corner shortly afterwards. The Hammers eventually responded through Manuel Lanzini in the 56th minute, but Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain struck back just 57 seconds later with his first Premier League goal for Liverpool and Salah then made it 4-1. The win sees Liverpool close the gap on the top five, all of whom play on Sunday, while West Ham continue to hover above the relegation zone after another underwhelming performance. The home side were booed off at half-time and full-time, and manager Bilic now heads into the two-week international break with his job potentially under threat. Player ratings West Ham: Hart (5), Cresswell (4), Reid (4), Ogbonna (4), Fernandes (4), Kouyate (4), Lanzini (5), Noble (4), Obiang (4), Hernandez (4), Ayew (4) Subs: Arnautovic (4), Carroll (4), Sakho (4) Liverpool: Mignolet (5), Moreno (6), Matip (6), Klavan (6), Gomez (6), Wijnaldum (6), Can (6), Oxlade-Chamberlain (7), Salah (8), Mane (8), Firmino (7) Subs: Milner (5), Solanke (5), Lovren (5) Man of the match: Mohamed Salah The Hammers could have gone ahead early, with Andre Ayew striking the outside of the post after Roberto Firmino was denied early by Joe Hart in the second minute. Chances after that were few and far between as West Ham defended deep and tried not to give Liverpool space to run in behind. That worked until the visitors scored two goals inside three minutes midway through the first half. First, Liverpool broke from a West Ham corner, with Mane racing clear from inside his own half and then playing in Salah to finish past Hart. Shortly afterwards, Hart saved from a corner but could only palm the ball out for Matip to tap in from close range in the 24th minute. Roberto Firmino sees an early effort saved West Ham could not mount any sort of response before the break, but they did cut the deficit in the 56th minute when Lanzini chested down and then flicked a shot into the far corner. The celebrations were short-lived, though, as Oxlade-Chamberlain replied less than a minute later, finishing from close range after Hart saved his initial shot. Team news West Ham made two changes with Reid and Obiang coming in for Zabaleta (suspended) and Fonte (injured). For Liverpool, Mane made an early return from injury to start and Oxlade-Chamberlain made his first Premier League start for the club, with Henderson missing out with a thigh injury. Lanzini and Javier Hernandez spurned chances for West Ham and, after Firmino fired wide, Salah made it 4-1 when he drilled a brilliant shot into the far corner. Liverpool could have had more as West Ham fans headed to the exits, with those who did stay until the final whistle voicing their disapproval at the performance. Opta stats Liverpool have scored eight goals in their two Premier League trips to the London Stadium, the same tally as the Hammers have scored in their last nine there in the competition. Since moving to the London Stadium in August 2016, West Ham have lost more games at their home stadium than they have won (W9 D4 L11). In fact, since the move, only Swansea (44) have conceded more goals at home in the Premier League than West Ham (41). For the 14th time under Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool have scored 4+ goals in a single Premier League game - only Manchester City (16) and Tottenham Hotspur (16) have done so on more occasions in this period. Salah has registered 15 goal involvements in all competitions for Liverpool this season (12 goals, three assists), more than any other player for the Reds. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrates scoring The managers Slaven Bilic: \"Of course I believe in myself, in my staff and in my team and their character and everything. I came so far from a small country first as a player then as a manager, so it's not about that. I am a big fighter. I definitely don't feel a broken man. I am very, very strong. On the other hand, the situation for West Ham is not good and as I said two years ago, one year ago, and now, the club is about every individual and that includes me.\" Jurgen Klopp: \"I decided after just one training session to bring Sadio in from the beginning. I've never done that before, but obviously it was not the worse idea I've ever had. Sadio is a naturally fit player, he is a machine. The first goal was a fantastic counter-attack, the second from a corner and that's two goals from set-plays in a week. We've had that before - but usually from the other team. Our response to their goal was outstanding, Oxlade-Chamberlain used the chance, and then brilliant play for the fourth.\" Man of the match - Mohamed Salah Salah continued his fantastic start to the season by scoring his 11th and 12th goals for Liverpool. The first was a composed finish with just Hart to beat, while the second was a superb drilled shot across goal and into the bottom corner. Along with Mane, the Egypt international looked dangerous throughout and could have scored his first hat-trick as Liverpool continued to flood forward late in the game. What's next? West Ham are live on Sky Sports Premier League when they travel to Watford on Sunday, November 19 and also when they host Leicester on Friday Night Football on November 24. Liverpool host Southampton and then Chelsea after the international break, either side of a Champions League trip to Sevilla."}, {"date": "30/10/2018", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21031,

years in charge of Burnley with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Newcastle at Turf Moor on Monday. Neither side had created a clear opening in a cagey encounter before Jeff Hendrick finished from close range in the 74th minute. Newcastle threatened a late equaliser but Isaac Hayden's shot was tipped wide and Javier Manquillo flicked a header onto the roof of the net. Dyche has been linked with the vacant Everton job but his Burnley side are now up to seventh in the Premier League, level on points with Liverpool. Newcastle, meanwhile, drop to ninth, having struggled to create many opportunities in a tight contest that always looked likely to be settled by one goal. Player ratings Burnley: Pope (7), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (7), Mee (7), Ward (6), Brady (6), Defour (6), Cork (7), Gudmundsson (7), Hendrick (7), Barnes (6) Subs: Westwood (5) Newcastle: Elliot (5), Yedlin (6), Lascelles (6), Lejeune (6), Manquillo (6), Diame (6), Shelvey (7), Ritchie (6), Perez (6), Atsu (5), Joselu (5) Subs: Murphy (5), Gayle (5), Hayden (5) Man of the match: Jack Cork The hosts made a positive start as Hendrick flashed a shot across goal in the opening minute. However, that would be the Clarets' only real opening of the first half as Newcastle kept them at bay and enjoyed more of the possession. Jeff Hendrick celebrates scoring Burnley's winner against Newcastle Chances were still at a premium for the visitors, with Christian Atsu prodding over from close range and Jonjo Shelvey firing a first-time shot at Nick Pope. Ashley Barnes headed a cross wide under pressure at the other end, while Perez saw a curling effort pushed away by Pope at the start of a similarly tight second half. There was no more goalmouth action until the deadlock was broken, with Johann Berg Gudmundsson crossing to the back post for Hendrick to finish after Jack Cork's shot was saved. Team news Burnley’s top scorer Wood missed out with injury while Vokes was only fit enough to make the bench. Gudmundsson started with Arfield dropping to the bench.Diame replaced Hayden for Newcastle while Merino did not feature due to a back injury. Newcastle pushed for a late equaliser and, after Joselu shot wide from the edge of the box, Pope pushed Hayden's shot away and Manquillo headed over in injury-time. Man of the match - Jack Cork In a tight game, Cork was a strong presence in midfield for Burnley and played a key role in the winning goal.

watch highlights Brighton 1-1 Southampton - watch highlights Glenn Murray was on target again as Brighton came from behind to earn a 1-1 draw against Southampton in Sunday's south-coast affair at the Amex. Steven Davis had nodded the visitors in front after just seven minutes but Murray - who scored his first goals of the season in last week's win over West Ham - restored parity with a header of his own in the 52nd minute. A tight contest failed to yield a winner but both sides remain in the comfort of mid-table after a point that felt fair in their first top-flight meeting since 1983. Southampton had scored just eight goals all season, but they asserted authority from the off and were ahead when James Ward-Prowse - recalled to the starting XI - struck the corner of the goalframe with a free-kick and Davis reacted quickest, stooping to head past Mathew Ryan. Steven Davis celebrates with Cedric Soares after opening the scoring for Southampton at Brighton Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Bruno (6), Duffy (7), Dunk (7), Bong (6), Knockaert (7), Stephens (6), Propper (6), Izquierdo (7), Gross (8), Murray (7). Subs: March (N/A), Brown (N/A). Southampton: Forster (6), Cedric (6), van Dijk (7), Hoedt (6), Bertrand (7), Romeu (6), Davis (7) , Tadic (6), Ward-Prowse (7), Boufal (6), Gabbiadini (6). Subs used: Long (N/A), Redmond (6), Hojbjerg (N/A). Man of the match: Pascal Gross Brighton eased their way into the contest, buoyed by Saints' deep defending, but Davy Propper's header from an Anthony Knockaert delivery was tame (19) and a slick move down the right in the end evaded Murray. The visitors retained goal threat, Dusan Tadic crafting a yard before firing just wide (35) but Chris Hughton's side finished the half strongly, Knockaert almost converting a fizzing Jose Izequierdo ball and then dinking to the far post where Shane Duffy could only head over. Team news Brighton were unchanged from the side that beat West Ham, while Southampton made three changes. Mario Lemina missed out through injury, while Shane Long and Maya Yoshida dropped to the bench, with Wesley Hoedt, James Ward-Prowse and Sofiane Boufal recalled to the starting XI. Fraser Forster was beaten at his near post by Glenn Murray's header Southampton started the second half as briskly as they had done the first, but Brighton were level when Pascal Gross delivered a looping cross that Murray rose to meet, Fraser Forster slow to react as he was beaten at his near post. Murray and Wesley Hoedt were booked for a tussle, the game freshly competitive, but chances came and went at both ends as Manolo Gabbiadini swivelled to shoot from a tight angle and Duffy sliced a Knockaert lay-off just wide. Glenn Murray (right) scored his third goal in two games as Brighton came from behind to earn a point Izequierdo had lashed a lively ball at Knockaert before the break and another fierce drive caught Virgil van Dijk by surprise, the Saints defender wincing as he stopped the threat with his stomach. Mauricio Pellegrino threw on Nathan Redmond in search of spark but both sides ran out of ideas, as the clock ticked down, and were both seemingly satisfied enough with their efforts. Opta stats Southampton have won just four of their last 18 Premier League matches (W4 D7 L7). Glenn Murray has scored as many Premier League goals in his last two appearances (3) as he did in his previous 28 PL apps combined (3). Five of Murray's last eight Premier League goals have come from headers and half of his PL goals overall have been from a header (7/14). This is the second time this season that Steven Davis has scored from the first shot on target in a Premier League game - he also did this versus Crystal Palace in September. Harry Kane is the only other player to have done this on two occasions this season. Man of the match - Pascal Gross Murray might have had the decisive touch but Gross was the familiar creator, teeing up chances for Propper and Knockaert before standing up an inviting ball that the veteran striker made count. Gross has been involved in seven of Brighton's 10 Premier League goals this season (two goals, five assists); only Manchester City pair David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne (6) have more top-flight assists this term. The managers Chris Hughton: \"The overriding feeling is that when you're down 1-0 so early in the game, you've got to get back into it and I thought we showed great resilience to get through that difficult period and came on to a really good game. Chris Hughton says Brighton showed great resilience to come from 1-0 down to earn a point against Southampton and admitted a draw was a fair result. Chris Hughton says Brighton showed great resilience to come from 1-0 down to earn a point against Southampton and admitted a draw was a fair result. \"I think a draw in the end was probably a fair result. It would've been an injustice if we'd lost the game and we deserved to get back into it. We showed a great response to going 1-0 down.\" Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It was a really tight game. It was high tempo, up and down all the time. We never could control the ball totally and create more action because both teams were really compact and there were not too many spaces to think about. My players competed well, although we couldn't win.\" Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino says neither side could get total control of the game as they drew 1-1 with Brighton. Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino says neither side could get total control of the game as they drew 1-1 with Brighton. The pundit Alan Pardew: \"Glenn's a super lad - we let him go (at Crystal Palace) because he wanted to play first-team football - but he always wants to score goals. When that cross went in, I sensed he'd score. He loves those sorts of crosses. Fraser Forster's a bit leaden-footed there - he should be across another yard and be livelier on his toes. He's been caught out but it's still a great header.\" What's next?

over Everton, with the visitors remaining marooned in the relegation zone. With David Unsworth in caretaker charge following the sacking of Ronald Koeman, Everton were punished by Leicester's pace on the break as Jamie Vardy (18) and a heavily deflected Demarai Gray effort off Jonjoe Kenny (28) gave them an early advantage. Jamie Vardy celebrates scoring Leicester's opener against Everton Puel, who was appointed as Leicester's third manager of 2017 on Wednesday, had to watch his side defend deep for the majority of the second period - but the visitors lacked the imagination or variation in their play to trouble the scorers. This latest defeat leaves Everton in the relegation zone having taken just eight points from their opening 10 games, while Leicester climbed to 11th.

Subs: Niasse (6), Baningime (6), Sigurdsson (6) Man of the match: Demarai Gray Leicester came out of the blocks flying for their new boss and were ahead inside 18 minutes. The goal was everything Everton lacked; pure pace and aggression. The flowing move was instigated by a 70-yard counter attacking surge by Gray. He released Riyad Mahrez, who crossed for Vardy to sweep home from close range. Leicester doubled their lead on 28 minutes - although they were given a huge helping hand by the unfortunate Kenny, whose attempted clearance from a Gray centre comically flew beyond his own goalkeeper. Team news Ben Chilwell and Demarai Gray replaced Shinji Okazaki and Marc Albrighton for Leicester while Aaron Lennon made his first Premier League start since January for Everton in one of three changes from the defeat against Arsenal. Unsworth handed a Premier League debut to 19-year-old Beni Baningime at the break and he looked composed at the base of Everton's midfield, but the visitors remained unimaginative in possession when in the final third. Fellow substitute Oumar Niasse broke into some appealing positions but his finish was distinctly lacking as Leicester saw out the game relatively comfortably. Everton's Phil Jagielka attempts an overhead kick As the final whistle sounded, the home fans cheekily chanted: \"All that money, and you're going down.\" Man of the match: Demarai Gray His lung bursting run tipped the game in Leicester's favour and he earned the luck he received with his goal, which owed a huge amount to Kenny's wild clearance. Jamie Carragher said: \"He's been spoken about a lot these last couple of years in terms of potential. He's never quite nailed down a position but he's made a great start under the new manager. He'll be thinking he could be a mainstay, especially if Riyad Mahrez becomes a No 10 behind Jamie Vardy.\" New Leicester manager Claude Puel praised his side's attitude and solidarity New Leicester manager Claude Puel praised his side's attitude and solidarity Opta stats Leicester have won three games in a row in all competitions since Craig Shakespeare's departure, having won just three of Shakespeare's last 13 matches in charge. Vardy has been involved in 13 goals in his last 15 Premier League games at the King Power Stadium (11 goals, 2 assists). Mahrez has assisted nine of Jamie Vardy's Premier League goals - more than any other player. Everton named eight English players in their starting XI, the second time they've done so in the space of nine Premier League games (also against Man City); prior to this, they hadn't done so in any of their previous 780 Premier League games, since naming eight in the starting XI against Manchester United on Boxing Day 1997.

With an extra man in midfield, Spurs started to take control of the game, subduing United and going close when Eric Dier saw a looping shot saved from a corner. Team news Man Utd made three changes from their defeat at Huddersfield last weekend, with Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial making way for Eric Bailly, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford. Davinson Sanchez, Kieran Trippier and Harry Kane missed out for Spurs, with Moussa Sissoko, Eric Dier and Ben Davies starting. There was little change immediately after the break, but United were nearly gifted the opener when Lloris spilt a low effort from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Ben Davies had to whack the ball clear with Rashford waiting to tap in. Mkhitaryan then fizzed a cross through the six-yard box and Antonio Valencia drilled over from the edge of the box. Both sides went close late in the game as Alli missed the target from eight yards out after a brilliant chipped pass from Christian Eriksen before Lukaku headed against the post at the other end. It was United who snatched victory, though, as a long ball from De Gea was flicked on by Lukaku and Martial finished after getting behind Eric Dier. Opta stats Manchester United have kept a clean sheet in each of their first five home league games of a season for the first time since 2007/08. Spurs have lost consecutive games (in all competitions) for the first time since February (defeats against Liverpool and Gent). United have now scored 10 goals in the last 10 minutes of their Premier League games this season, accounting for 43% of their total. Anthony Martial has been involved in five goals in his last five Premier League games at Old Trafford (3 goals, 2 assists). Romelu Lukaku has had a hand in 10 goals in the Premier League this season (7 goals, 3 assists), a joint-high along with Sergio Aguero. Man of the match - Nemanja Matic Ashley Young was impressive for Manchester United and Martial was the match-winner, but Matic was key in a tight game. The midfielder was particularly strong in the second half as United managed to gain more control in the centre of the pitch. He looked composed in possession and also showed his strength to win the ball and break up play on several occasions. Manager reaction Jose Mourinho: \"I was so disappointed at Huddersfield because it looks like in that match we didn't know the responsibility, we didn't know the ambition, we didn't know that every point is a precious point.\" Mauricio Pochettino: \"I said before the game to everyone that always you are going to miss your main striker - and Harry Kane is one of best strikers in the world, of course. But it is not an excuse today. We didn't lose the game because Kane wasn't here.\" What's next? Manchester United are at home to Benfica in the Champions League on Tuesday and then travel to Chelsea, live on Sky Sports Premier League, next Sunday.

Despite having little possession in the first half, Swansea took the lead through Sam Clucas' neat finish (22) from Tammy Abraham's superb through ball. Arsenal levelled through Sead Kolasinac after the break (51), before Aaron Ramsey completed the turnaround just seven minutes later with a guided left-footed effort from eight yards.

Swansea scored the opener against the run of play through midfielder Clucas, who had started the game at left wing-back, tucking the ball through Petr Cech's legs after Abraham had found him with a fine pass behind the Arsenal defence. Former Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski kept the scores level as he tipped away Alexis Sanchez's fierce effort from inside the box, but Swansea should have been 2-0 up just before half-time. Team news Wenger made 11 changes in midweek for the Carabao Cup win over Norwich, but reverted back to the side that won 5-2 against Everton last weekend, with Ozil, Sanchez and Lacazette all starting. For Swansea, Ki, Clucas and van der Hoorn come in for Sanches, Briton and Narsingh following the 2-1 defeat by Leicester last Saturday. Clucas played left wing-back in a 5-3-2. Aaron Ramsey gave Arsenal the lead in the 58th minute After Per Mertesacker dwelled on the ball and lost out in the area to Jordan Ayew, the forward looked to dink it over Cech, who this time blocked well with his body. Arsenal were level six minutes after the break through Kolasinac, who found the far corner with a driven left-footed finish after the ball had fortuitously arrived to him 12 yards out from Mesut Ozil's blocked shot. Laurent Koscielny then glanced a free header just wide from Sanchez's free-kick, but Arsenal were ahead on 58 minutes as Ramsey neatly finished off a fine move from 10 yards from Kolasinac's cut back. Hector Bellerin nearly made it 3-1, hitting the top of the bar on the stretch from an angle, and despite some late Swansea pressure, the Gunners held on for a vital three points on Arsene Wenger's 800th Premier League match in charge. Sam Clucas opened the scoring on Saturday Opta stats Arsenal have now won their last 13 games at the Emirates in all competitions, their longest ever winning run at the stadium. This was Wenger's 400th home win with the Gunners in all competitions (213 Emirates, 185 Highbury, two Wembley). The Swans have mustered fewer shots (76) and shots on target (20) than any other Premier League side this season. Kolasinac has had a hand in more goals in all competitions for Arsenal this season than any other player (three goals, three assists). The managers Arsene Wenger: \"I'm very happy with the three points. I think overall we had a good domination, maybe in the first half our pace was not quick and sharp enough, but in the second we upped the tempo and created many chances. Again we showed mental strength to come back from 1-0 down to win 2-1. Overall it was vital for us to win the game today.\" Arsene Wenger was pleased with Arsenal’s mental strength Arsene Wenger was pleased with Arsenal’s mental strength Paul Clement: \"I liked a lot of things about the performance today. We've played in games recently where our performances and results haven't been so good, and the results not so good either. Today the performance was better and I think we possibly deserved more than we got.\" The pundit Matt Le Tissier on Soccer Saturday: \"Arsenal huffed and puffed and had a lot of possession but not a lot of clear-cut chances in the first half. Arsenal came out firing in the second half and got an equaliser; you thought it would only be one way from here. From then on it was a bit of a struggle for Swansea.\" Paul Clement says his Swansea side couldn’t contain Arsenal at the start of the second half Paul Clement says his Swansea side couldn’t contain Arsenal at the start of the second half Man of the match - Sead Kolasinac One goal and one assist from the left-back tells only half of the story. Kolasinac has impressed since arriving at the Emirates on a free transfer in the summer with his strength, stamina going up and down the left flank, and his delivery. Granit Xhaka constantly looked to Kolasinac as an outlet down the left with diagonal balls, and that's exactly how the second Arsenal goal came about, from a measured cut-back by the Bosnian into the path of Aaron Ramsey. He went off injured late on, hobbling off and holding his groin, and would be a huge miss for upcoming games against Red Star Belgrade and Man City.

First-half strikes from Javier Hernandez (31) and Andre Ayew (43) were cancelled out by a Luka Milivojevic penalty (50) and Zaha's dramatic last-minute equaliser (90+7) in a fiery contest at Selhurst Park. Crystal Palace pushed hard for an equaliser in the second half, but Joe Hart pulled off a string of superb saves before Zaha slotted home to secure Roy Hodgson's men a crucial draw with seconds left on the clock. The result means Crystal Palace remain bottom on four points, while West Ham move up to 16th. Player ratings West Ham: Hart (9), Cresswell (7), Fonte (6), Zabaleta (5), Ogbonna (5), Kouyate (6), Noble (5), Fernandes (6), Lanzini (6), Ayew (7), Hernandez (7) Subs: Masuaku (6), Rice (5), Antonio (5) C Palace: Speroni (6), Ward (5), van Aanholt (N/A), Tomkins (6), Dann (6), Milivojevic (6), Cabaye (7), Loftus-Cheek (6), Schlupp (6), Townsend (7), Zaha (8) Subs: Fosu-Mensah (6), Sako (6) Man of the Match: Joe Hart After a very slow beginning to the match with both sides tentative when attacking, the first real sign of action was in the 29th minute when Zaha tumbled in the box, but referee Bobby Madley waved away any protests. Following the incident came a West Ham counter-attack which Hernandez finished off as he slotted in Aaron Cresswell's low cross from close range. Moments later, Joe Hart pulled off an incredible double save. First, he denied Tomkins's header with a stunning reflex stop before he unintentionally batted away Jeffrey Schlupp's point-blank strike with his shoulder. With Palace looking sloppy going forward, it was perhaps no surprise that West Ham's second goal came from a poor giveaway by Milivojevic in central midfield. Ayew was given the licence to go on a fine individual run before he smashed the ball into the top corner from the edge of the box. Team news James McArthur lost his race to be fit in time as Ruben Loftus-Cheek took his place in midfield. For West Ham, Joe Hart, Pablo Zabaleta, Jose Fonte and Chicharito all came in for Adrian, Declan Rice, Andy Carroll and Sam Byram. Crystal Palace responded brightly in the second half and were back in the game five minutes in after Andros Townsend was bundled over in the box by Angelo Ogbonna. Milivojevic converted the penalty straight down the centre of the goal to provide Palace some much-needed momentum. Yohan Cabaye so nearly found the equaliser for Palace minutes later but his venomous drive from outside the box beat Hart, but clattered off the inside of the post and out. Palace continued to dominate in the second half but Joe Hart was proving hard to beat. In the 77th minute, he superbly pushed away Zaha's fierce strike shortly before he dived across goal to keep out Cabaye's free-kick. In the 90th minute, Hart tipped James Tomkins' header onto the bar but Palace would get their equaliser in the 97th minute. Zaha engineered space in the box to beat Cheikhou Kouyate, before firing a shot through substitute Damian Rice's legs into the bottom corner to hand Palace what could be a vital point at the end of the season. Man of the match - Joe Hart Joe Hart made a number of crucial saves, including one from Schlupp with his shoulder Joe Hart had his best match in a West Ham shirt. He pulled off two superb saves in quick succession in the opening 45 minutes before denying Zaha twice, Cabaye and Tomkins in the second half. Hart will feel hard done by to concede so late on to the Ivory Coast international, but he put on a display to be proud of and arguably justified Slaven Bilic's decision to start ahead of Adrian. The pundit - Phil Thompson \"Crystal Palace thoroughly deserved it, as poor as they were in the first half they were as good in the second. \"Joe Hart dispelled whatever people have been saying about him because he was absolutely terrific, on his own he kept Palace out. \"It was such a good atmosphere in this ground and the home fans were sucking the ball in the second half and they thoroughly deserved it because they gave it a right good go.\" Opta stats West Ham are unbeaten in the Premier League versus Crystal Palace under Slaven Bilic (W3 D2 L0). Wilfried Zaha's goal (96:06) was the second latest goal scored in the Premier League this season, after Raheem Sterling's winner at Bournemouth in August (96:34). All 41 of Javier Hernandez's Premier League goals have been scored from inside the box; only Tim Cahill (56/56) has a higher 100% record.

Mohamed Salah saw his first-half penalty saved by Jonas Lossl (42) as a defensive Huddersfield side frustrated the hosts, who were without Philippe Coutinho at Anfield. However, Sturridge capitalised on a Tommy Smith error (50) to steer Liverpool towards their first league victory since September. Liverpool turned on the style as the Huddersfield defence opened up, and Roberto Firmino's header (58) and a superb Georginio Wijnaldum strike (75) ultimately put the game beyond the visitors. Player ratings Liverpool: Mignolet (6), Gomez (6), Klavan (6), Matip (6), Moreno (6), Milner (8), Henderson (7), Wijnaldum (8), Salah (8), Sturridge (7), Firmino (8) Subs: Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Can (6), Solanke (6) Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Smith (4), Schindler (6), Zanka (7), Lowe (6), Hogg (6), Williams (6), Mooy (6), La Parra (5), Ince (6), Depoitre (6) Subs: Kachunga (6), Mounie (6), Hadergjonaj (6) Man of the match: James Milner In a clash which pitted Jurgen Klopp against old friend David Wagner for the first time, it was the latter who set up his Huddersfield side to sit back and let Liverpool attack, but the hosts struggled to find an early breakthrough as Lossl saved easily from Salah and James Milner. Jurgen Klopp got one over old friend David Wagner in their first meeting as managers Tommy Smith's tug on the shirt of Firmino then handed Salah the opportunity to score from the spot, but Lossl guessed correctly to keep out the Egypt international's penalty. The rebound did fall kindly for Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson, but he saw his volley skim the post as a relieved Huddersfield side went into the break all-square. Team news Philippe Coutinho (adductor) was ruled out, Emre Can dropped to the bench and Dejan Lovren was injured in the warm-up. In came Daniel Sturridge, Georginio Wijnaldum and Ragnar Klavan for Liverpool. For Huddersfield, Rajiv van La Parra started in place of Elias Kachunga, who was only fit enough to be named among the substitutes. However, it took Liverpool just five minutes to break the deadlock in the second half, with Sturridge latching onto a poor header from Smith before looping the ball beyond Lossl to score his second goal of the season.

Wijnaldum rounded off the victory with 15 minutes to go, taking a couple of touches inside the area before rifling his effort into the top corner. The game proved to be a much-needed quiet afternoon for Liverpool's defence, with goalkeeper Simon Mignolet not tested once. Opta stats Liverpool have lost only one of their last 43 Premier League home games against newly-promoted sides (W33 D9). Huddersfield have failed to score in four consecutive away league games for the first time since October 2007, when they were in the third tier (5 games in that run). No side has missed more Premier League penalties than Liverpool (34, level with Arsenal). Salah has registered 12 goal involvements in all competitions for Liverpool this season (9 goals, 3 assists), more than any other player for the Reds. Georginio Wijnaldum of Liverpool celebrates scoring his side's third goal with Emre Can Pundit's view - Paul Merson Paul Merson suggested Liverpool were very comfortable in their 3-0 win over Huddersfield at Anfield and praised the fans for sticking with the side during the first-half display. Paul Merson suggested Liverpool were very comfortable in their 3-0 win over Huddersfield at Anfield and praised the fans for sticking with the side during the first-half display. \"It was a walk in the park. David Wagner said 'this is an easy game for me, I know what we have to do'. Well they just went there, laid down and waited for Liverpool to win. I've never seen anything like it, they beat Man United last week, why not go and have a go? \"We were just saying how bad Liverpool are at the back, Klavan came in for Lovren and you just think they should have had a go, take the game to Liverpool and create chances but they only had one shot! Not good enough. \"As soon as Liverpool go a goal up they become the Harlem Globetrotters. Everyone wanted the ball and it could have been 4,5 or 6. It was probably the easiest game they'll have all season.\" The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"I don't think the first goal was lucky because we forced it. We were in the right positions and played the right pass. \"The second goal, usually when you hear Liverpool and goal from a set-piece it's the other way round. But today we scored one. After their heavy 4-1 defeat to Tottenham last time out, Liverpool bounced back with a comfortable 3-0 win over Huddersfield. After their heavy 4-1 defeat to Tottenham last time out, Liverpool bounced back with a comfortable 3-0 win over Huddersfield. \"Third goal, fantastic. It was nice play from Wijnaldum, so there's a lot of good things today, especially the reaction in the second half, which was outstanding. \"The boys really deserve that. We needed it, and now we have it.\" David Wagner: \"In the end, it was a deserved defeat. But for me, the idea of our game worked until we conceded a very unlucky first goal. \"We did not have the best position to defend the long ball and we gave the assist for the first goal, and then conceded the second from a corner. \"Until the first goal, I haven't seen Anfield as quiet as it was today.\" Huddersfield Town boss David Wagner was pleased with his players performances against Liverpool but they couldn't maintain their defensive displays throughout and Wagner admits that they deserved to lose in the end. Huddersfield Town boss David Wagner was pleased with his players performances against Liverpool but they couldn't maintain their defensive displays throughout and Wagner admits that they deserved to lose in the end. Man of the match - James Milner Liverpool's forwards burst into life in the second half, but it was James Milner who put in a tireless performance throughout. The midfielder got one assist to his name for Liverpool's second goal, and recorded twice as many key passes (four) as any other player. He also made the most tackles (five) on the pitch as Liverpool's central three allowed their defence to enjoy a quiet afternoon. A typical all-round performance from the 31-year-old. What's next?

Fletcher met Xherdan Shaqiri's corner with a controlled volley on his right foot after 16 minutes at Vicarage Road with the ball flying past the unsighted Heurelho Gomes via a slight deflection off Troy Deeney. On an off day for Marco Silva's side, Watford failed to produce a single shot on target with Charlie Adam hitting the post deep into stoppage time as the hosts piled men forward in search of an equaliser. Player ratings Watford: Gomes (6), Kiko (6), Holebas (7), Britos (6), Kabasele (6), Cleverley (6), Doucoure (6), Capoue (6), Richarlison (7), Carrillo (6), Deeney (6) Subs: Gray (6), Hughes (6) Away Team: Butland (7), Shawcross (9), Zouma (8), Wimmer (7), Pieters (7), Allen (7), Fletcher (8), Choupo-Moting (6), Diouf (8), Shaqiri (7), Ramadan (7) Subs: Adam (5), Berahino (6) Man of the match: Shawcross (Stoke) The result moves the Potters up to 13th in the Premier League while Watford drop to seventh. Stoke did a fine job of frustrating the hosts, and there were several flashpoints on the pitch which resulted in eight yellow cards brandished by Michael Oliver. Troy Deeney was cautioned late on for an angry altercation with Joe Allen after Watford refused to return possession to their opponents after the ball was kicked out. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting competes for the ball with Tom Cleverley Team news Watford made two changes from the side which lost at Chelsea. Andre Carrillo and Etienne Capoue came in for Adrian Mariappa and Roberto Pereyra. Stoke made three changes to the side beaten at home to Bournemouth as Kevin Wimmer replaced Geoff Cameron, Xherdan Shaqiri returned from an ankle injury to replace Glen Johnson and Jese dropped to the bench as Ramadan Sobhi was given the nod. It was Watford who began the match full of confidence, seeing plenty of the ball in the opening stages before Stoke took the lead against the run of play. Fletcher, who arrived at Stoke on a free transfer from West Brom in the summer, marked his 101st consecutive Premier League game with a sublime finish from Shaqiri's drilled corner to the edge of the box. Watford continued to dominate possession thereafter and Richarlison had a glorious chance to equalise after good work from Andre Carrillo but the Brazilian could only find the side netting with the goal gaping. But it was Stoke who had the better chances on the break as Gomes saved from substitute Saido Berahino. As Watford piled forward in search of salvaging a late point, Stoke very nearly wrapped up the victory in the sixth minute of stoppage time as Charlie Adam danced his way around Gomes but could only strike the post. Opta stats Watford have lost their last four games against Stoke, after winning four of the previous six (D2) and keeping a clean sheet in each match in that run. The Hornets mustered 14 shots in the game without directing any on target; only Burnley managed more shots in a Premier League game this season without directing one on target (20 v West Brom in August). Watford have suffered consecutive league defeats for the first time this season and since losing their last six league games of 2016/17. Darren Fletcher netted his first Premier League goal in his last 26 appearances in the competition, since scoring for West Brom v Sunderland on January 21st, 2017. Xherdan Shaqiri has been involved in four goals in his last six top-flight games (one goal, three assists), after just three goal involvements in the 19 games before that. The managers Marco Silva: \"I'm disappointed of course, in the first half we didn't play in our normal image. We gave one gift, the goal. In that moment we lost our focus and they scored a good goal. \"The second half was mostly our team, they played with 10 men behind the ball. It is normal when a team is in that position in the table.\" Mark Hughes: \"We've had a little bit of criticism and rightly so. Last weekend was disappointing and maybe we underestimated how much the Manchester City result had on us, but we showed a reaction today. \"I'm a little disappointed with the reaction of Troy Deeney. They should've given the ball back to us, so it wasn't in the spirit of the game. He grabs Allen by the face, which is not what you want to see. It hasn't covered him in any good light in my view.\" Jose Holebas and Ryan Shawcross square up at Vicarage Road Man of the match - Ryan Shawcross Kurt Zouma did a brilliant job in keeping Watford's in-form forward Richarlison quiet down the left but this was a real captain's display from Shawcross in the heart of Stoke's defence. At fault for Bournemouth's crucial second goal last weekend on his return to the side following a back injury, the experienced defender made countless clearances and vital blocks during the second half to ensure only a second Premier League clean sheet of the season.

Raheem Sterling (64) added Man City's third just minutes after coming on as a substitute in the second half, before Matt Phillips (90+2) set up a nervy ending when he scored a second Baggies goal late on. But West Brom could not find a late equaliser as their winless run extends to eight games in all competitions, while City are now five points clear at the top of the Premier League table. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (7), Nyom (6), Gibbs (6), Evans (7), Hegazi (7), Livermore (6), Barry (7), Krychowiak (7), McAuley (6), Rodriguez (6), Rondon (6). Subs used: Robson-Kanu (5), Phillips (6), McClean (5). Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (7), Stones (6), Otamendi (6), Delph (6), Fernandinho (8), De Bruyne (7), Sane (7), B Silva (7), D Silva (7), Jesus (6). Subs used: Sterling (6), Gundogan (5). Man of the match: Fernandinho. It took City 10 minutes to open the scoring at The Hawthorns. A superb pass from Fernandinho picked out Sane on the left flank and the Germany international fired into the far corner. The lead did not last long as three minutes later West Brom punished the high line of Man City's defence. Gareth Barry pumped a ball forward on the half turn as he looked to get away from David Silva, picking out the forward run of Rodriguez. He collected the pass before lifting the ball the onrushing Ederson to level the score. It did not last long, though, as Fernandinho popped up once again, this time to put City back ahead. A lovely move across the top of the box saw Sane pick out the Brazil midfielder and his shot came off the outstretched foot of Ahmed Hegazi before hammering home via the post. Team news West Brom made two changes with Craig Dawson and Nacer Chadli making way for Allan Nyom and Gareth McAuley. Man City made one change from last weekend with Sergio Aguero replaced by Gabriel Jesus. There could have been another goal in the first half, with both sides going close. Silva just headed a Kevin De Bruyne pass over the crossbar before Salomon Rondon's own nodded effort also went agonisingly wide. The second half was a quieter affair, before Sterling added Man City's third in the 64th minute, not long after coming on as a substitute. It was a superb team move from the visitors, with Silva picking out Kyle Walker down the right of the box. His inviting cross was then poked home by the waiting Sterling just three minutes after his introduction. West Brom were to have the final say, though, as they pulled another goal back in the 92nd minute. Barry was involved once again, floating a ball into the box that Nicolas Otamendi failed to deal with as his chested clearance fell to a waiting Phillips at the back post, who slotted home past Ederson.

Gareth Barry's assist was his first goal involvement in the Premier League since December 2016 (for Everton), ending a run of 27 games in the competition without scoring or assisting. The managers Tony Pulis: \"I don't think you can fault any of our players today, they really had a go and there were a couple of opportunities that you hope you can take. You need to against these top clubs. Tony Pulis credited his players for the way they worked as a team despite losing 3-2 at home to Manchester City Tony Pulis credited his players for the way they worked as a team despite losing 3-2 at home to Manchester City \"It's difficult in respect of playing a team that is that good and with so much quality, but I think the lads will come out with a lot of credit for what they have done today and the way they have worked as a team.\" Pep Guardiola: \"It was another good performance but we have three problems because we conceded three chances and West Brom scored two goals but we played really well in a lot of things. We deserved that win and it was just 3-2 but we could have scored a lot more goals.\" Pep Guardiola was pleased by Manchester City’s win at West Brom despite condeding two goals Pep Guardiola was pleased by Manchester City’s win at West Brom despite condeding two goals The pundit Charlie Nicholas: \"It's the beautiful game, it truly is. City should have had this game wrapped up and put to bed by half-time. \"They scored two goals against the top team in the land so that gives West Brom some hope. They went with a back three and tried to chop and change it as the game went on but honestly, Man City were way, way ahead of them with the way they pass and move.\" Charlie Nicholas claims Manchester City were breathtaking at times during their 3-2 win over West Brom Charlie Nicholas claims Manchester City were breathtaking at times during their 3-2 win over West Brom Man of the match - Fernandinho It's not every game that Fernandinho pops up with the attacking goods, but he had a hand in City's opening two goals, assisting for Leroy Sane before netting a fine strike himself - even if he may have had a helping hand from a West Brom defender and the post. Fernandinho celebrates adding a second for Manchester City with Kevin De Bruyne But he was also solid in the middle of the park, helping to restrict West Brom and produced some important tackles when called upon. A good afternoon for the Brazil international. What's next? West Brom face a tough trip to Huddersfield in the Premier League next Saturday.

0-1 Chelsea Eden Hazard's first Premier League goal of the season secured a 1-0 win for Chelsea against Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday. The visitors went close several times in the first half before Hazard flashed a near-post finish past Cherries goalkeeper Asmir Begovic on 51 minutes. Bournemouth created little but their best opening came when substitute Jordon Ibe saw his left-footed effort deflect narrowly over Thibaut Courtois' crossbar. The result means Chelsea sit fourth, nine points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City, while Bournemouth remain 19th having taken just seven points from their opening 10 games. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (5), Francis (5), Ake (6), S Cook (5), Smith (4), L Cook (5), Surman (5), Daniels (6), Stanislas (5), Defoe (4), Afobe (4) Subs: Pugh (5), Ibe (5), Wilson (5) Chelsea: Courtois (7), Azpilicueta (8), Luiz (8), Rudiger (8), Zappacosta (8), Bakayoko (7), Fabregas (8), Alonso (7), Pedro (7), Morata (7), Hazard (8) Subs: Drinkwater (6), Willian (6), Batshuayi (6) Man of the match: Eden Hazard It was a difficult evening for the Cherries, who didn't register their first shot on target until stoppage time and also lost Benik Afobe and Junior Stanislas to injury. Alvaro Morata wasted two good first-half chances for Chelsea, first firing wide after a poor Begovic clearance before the Bournemouth 'keeper denied the Spaniard with a smart save. The Chelsea striker had the ball in the net after 28 minutes but Cesar Azpilicueta was flagged offside just prior to Morata's close-range finish. Team news Jermain Defoe was passed fit to start for Bournemouth after a hamstring injury but Josh King missed out due to a back problem. Chelsea made one change from the 4-2 win over Watford as Davide Zappacosta replaced captain Gary Cahill. Having failed to make their dominance count before half-time, the visitors went ahead just six minutes after the restart as Hazard latched onto Morata's through ball and beat Begovic at his near post. Ibe, who replaced the ineffective Jermain Defoe at the interval, fired narrowly over as Bournemouth went in search of an equaliser but their first attempt on target did not come until the 93rd minute, when Courtois kept out Steve Cook's drive. The home fans' loudest cheer was reserved for substitute Callum Wilson, who made his first appearance since January after successive knee surgeries. Match stats Chelsea have won six of their last seven away Premier League games (L1). Bournemouth have picked up just four points from their five Premier League home games this season (W1 D1 L3), after accruing 10 points from their last five last season (W3 D1 L1). Eden Hazard has scored five goals in five Premier League appearances against Bournemouth, with four of those strikes arriving on the south coast. Alvaro Morata battles for possession at the Vitality The managers Eddie Howe: \"It's a crisis in the Premier League when you lose one game. It's a commonly used word. \"We're concerned, of course we are. November is a massive month for us.\" Antonio Conte: \"Today it was important: a good win, also because the other teams all won, apart from Tottenham who lost. \"I know very well that, in England in this league, there are six top teams, very strong. Four go into the Champions League. Two have to stay out and play Europa League. Man of the match - Eden Hazard Hazard was the best player on the pitch at the Vitality, linking up well with Morata and Pedro as Chelsea created enough opportunities to win the game more comfortably than the scoreline suggested. In fact, the Belgium international was responsible for most of them, creating seven goalscoring chances in the game. Only Mesut Ozil (8 v Everton) has managed more in a single Premier League match this season. He now has three goals in his last three games for Chelsea in all competitions, as many as he managed in his previous 17 matches. With Chelsea already playing catch up in the title race and also looking to progress from a tough Champions League group, his return to form is a timely one. What next? Chelsea face a quick turnaround as they head to Italy to face Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday before hosting Manchester United on Nissan Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League.

Despite Arsenal's early dominance, Wayne Rooney gave Everton the lead on 12 minutes with a fine right-footed effort from 20 yards, before Nacho Monreal equalised with a well-directed rebound on 40 minutes.

Despite two early chances for Arsenal for Ramsey and Lacazette, Everton somehow took the lead against the run of play through Rooney, who found the far corner from 20 yards after Gueye had dispossessed Granit Xhaka, evoking memories of 16-year-old Rooney's first Premier League goal against Arsenal 15 years ago this week. Team news Morgan Schneiderlin was out, with Everton going for a back five as Ashley Williams came in. Jonjoe Kenny also replaced Mason Holgate at right-back for his first Premier League start. Arsenal made three changes; Mohamed Elneny, Alex Iwobi and Danny Welbeck made way for Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez. Nacho Monreal pulled Arsenal level on 40 minutes Arsenal continued to dominate the ball and had 17 shots on goal in the first half, and finally got their goal before the break as Monreal fiercely struck home from 12 yards after Pickford had spilled Xhaka's deflected shot. Sanchez was then denied at close range by Pickford before half-time, but Sanchez delivered after the break, providing a beautiful cross for Ozil to head home from six yards. Gueye was then dismissed by Craig Pawson for a second booking after a needless foul on Xhaka, and Everton's task was made harder by Lacazette's first-time finish in the box from Ramsey's pass during a vicious Arsenal counter-attack. Xhaka hit the bar from long-range as Arsenal looked to add a fourth, and they then got it through Ramsey's clever finish one-on-one with Pickford after sub Jack Wilshere's through ball. Wayne Rooney had given Everton the lead against the run of play Niasse capitalised on a horrible mix-up between Monreal and Petr Cech in stoppage time, but Arsenal put the icing on the cake through Sanchez, dancing around the edge of the box before brilliantly finding the far corner from a tight angle.

They could have scored five in each half, in fairness.\" Man of the match - Mesut Ozil He's been criticised for not turning up in the big games for Arsenal, and although this wasn't against top-six opposition, the clash at Goodison Park had the feel of a must-win for Arsene Wenger. Ozil turned up, and how. He made eight key passes in the game, double the entire Everton squad and four more than any of his own team-mates, and scored Arsenal's vital second goal after half-time. He tweeted on Saturday night, saying: \"Ignore the noise and stay focused\" amid reports linking him to Manchester United. This was Ozil at his best: concentrating, battling and providing. Only time will tell if Arsenal can continue to benefit from him beyond this season.

Two early lapses from Dejan Lovren were punished by Harry Kane, who scored the first and set up Heung-Min Son for Spurs' second inside 12 minutes. Mohamed Salah halved the deficit midway through the first half but Dele Alli, on the stroke of half-time, and Kane's second on 56 minutes sealed the victory. With Hugo Lloris inspired between the sticks, there was no way back for Liverpool, who saw a nine-game unbeaten run against Spurs come to an end in front of a record Premier League crowd of 80,827 that included Diego Maradona. Team news Eric Dier, Moussa Sissoko and Fernando Llorente dropped out of the Spurs side which drew in Madrid, as Kieran Trippier, Dele Alli and Heung-Min Son got the nod. Jurgen Klopp made on change from Liverpool’s draw with Man Utd last weekend as James Milner replaced Georginio Wijnaldum. It appeared consecutive clean sheets against Manchester United and Maribor lulled Liverpool into a false sense of security at the back, as early hesitancy handed Spurs the initiative. With just five minutes on the clock, Lovren's attempt to play offside backfired as Kane raced through clear, chipped the ball over Simon Mignolet and kept his balance to finish with his left foot. Things got even worse for the visitors seven minutes later as Lovren's missed defensive header released Kane, who squared the ball for Son to fire first time beyond the Reds stopper. Heung-Min Son celebrates scoring Tottenham's second goal Spurs continued to cut Liverpool to shreds and so nearly put the game beyond them, but Son rattled the crossbar with a thunderous 16th-minute drive. The visitors took full advantage of their reprieve. A first-time pass from Jordan Henderson utilised the pace of Salah, whose scuffed effort - Liverpool's first on target - trickled beyond Lloris to reduce the arrears. Lovren was put out of his misery soon after as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain came off the bench, and Liverpool settled and threatened to level the contest. However, in first-half stoppage-time, Spurs restored their two-goal lead, Alli volleying home from 18 yards after Joel Matip cleared a Christian Eriksen free-kick. Dele Alli scored on the stroke of half-time After defensive shortcomings plagued their first-half display, it was the turn of Liverpool's goalkeeper to hamper their plans of a comeback as Mignolet failed to gather a free-kick on 56 minutes. Jan Vertonghen saw a shot blocked on the line but Kane was on hand to add his second from close range. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (8), Trippier (7), Alderweireld (8), Sanchez (7), Vertonghen (8), Aurier (7), Winks (8), Alli (8), Eriksen (8), Son (8), Kane (9).

Subs: Grujic (4), Oxlade-Chamberlain (5), Sturridge (4). Man of the Match: Harry Kane Lloris produced a world-class save to deny Philippe Coutinho's curling effort on 67 minutes, and the Spurs skipper put the finishing touch to a fine display from his side with three saves to secure the three points. Opta stats Tottenham earned their first win in 10 Premier League games against Liverpool, after a run of three draws and six defeats against the Reds. Mauricio Pochettino's side scored more goals with just 14 shots in this game (4), than they had in their four previous Premier League games at Wembley (three goals from 90 shots). Tottenham's second goal was the 1000th that Liverpool have conceded in the Premier League (now 1002), making them the sixth team to have reached this milestone (Tottenham 1237, Everton 1225, Aston Villa 1186, West Ham 1163 and Newcastle 1148). Harry Kane's opener was his first Premier League goal at Wembley Stadium, with his 29th shot at the ground. In the last eight games in which he's scored for Tottenham in all competitions, Harry Kane has scored at least twice. Man of the Match - Harry Kane Man of match, @SpursOfficial’s Harry Kane 7 shots, 2 on target 13 goals this season, 8 in PL (38 in 2017, 29 in PL) 1st PL assist of 17/18 pic.twitter.com/Q2R9W2lsrL — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) October 22, 2017 What else is there to say about Kane that hasn't already been said? Everything the Spurs striker touches at the moment turns to gold - a Liverpool side in such fortuitous mood didn't stand a chance. Kane filled his boots inside five minutes to finally score his first Premier League goal at Wembley, and, after Son was supplied with Spurs second, his second followed soon after to cap yet another fine personal display.

Batshuayi's double capped a resilient Chelsea display as they fought back from 2-1 down to beat Watford 4-2 at Stamford Bridge. Pedro curled home a stunning opener following a contentiously awarded corner (12), but in first-half stoppage time, Abdoulaye Doucoure made Chelsea pay for some slack defending (45+2) by lashing home a close-range volley. Four minutes into the second half, Richarlison squared for the unmarked Roberto Pereyra to fire beyond Thibaut Courtois (49), but second-half substitute Batshuayi's header made it 2-2 (71). With three minutes of normal time remaining, Cesar Azpilicueta nodded a third past Heurelho Gomes from Willian's cross (87), before Batshuayi prodded home a fourth to cap the victory and move Chelsea up to fourth.

Marco Silva's side started brightly, but it was Morata who had a sniff inside two minutes when he met Azpilicueta's cross under the challenge of Christian Kabasele, only to be flagged offside. But Chelsea took advantage at a corner - one dubiously given - as Eden Hazard picked out Pedro on the edge of the area, and the Spaniard curled a delicious first-time effort over the Watford defence, off the left-hand post and past a stunned Gomes. Team news Antonio Conte makes three changes from the side that lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace - Victor Moses, Willian and Michy Batshuayi were replaced by Antonio Rudiger, Pedro and Alvaro Morata. Marco Silva made a solitary change with Troy Deeney replacing Andre Gray up top. On the stroke of half-time, Doucoure fired the Hornets level with a superb volley after Luiz failed to clear a long throw into the box. Richarlison sliced a great opportunity wide from close range in a frenetic start to the second half, following good play from Kiko Femenia. But just over a minute later the Brazilian atoned for his miss by collecting Troy Deeney's lay-off before squaring for the unmarked Roberto Pereyra, who fired home over the outstretched Courtois. Pedro celebrates opening the scoring for Chelsea With 20 minutes to play substitute Batshuayi headed an equaliser from Pedro's cross from the right flank, and Azpilicueta put the hosts ahead three minutes from time, converting Willian's precise delivery. Batshuayi did get the final say deep into stoppage time, capping a superb fightback by poking his second past Gomes after Miguel Britos' poor pass. The managers Antonio Conte: \"I think our performance was a good performance because it is not simple to concede a goal in the last minute of the first half and to then go down in the first part of the second half. \"I think at that point, our confidence was low. But my players showed me great desire and will to fight to change the situation and final result.

Huddersfield went ahead through Aaron Mooy, who found the net after Tom Ince's turn-and-shot was saved by David de Gea on 28 minutes, before Laurent Depoitre made it 2-0 by capitalising on substitute Victor Lindelof's mistake in defence five minutes later. Sub Marcus Rashford halved United's deficit on 78 minutes - heading home Romelu Lukaku's deep cross - and though Chris Smalling saw a late chance blocked, United couldn't force a leveller. Aaron Mooy puts Huddersfield in front against Man Utd Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7); Lowe (7), Schindler (7), Zanka (8), Smith (7); Hogg (7), Williams (7); Ince (7), Mooy (8), Kachunga (6); Depoitre (7) Subs: Van La Parra (8), Mounie (6), Malone (NA) Man Utd: De Gea (5), Valencia (6), Jones (6), Smalling (5), Young (5), Herrera (5), Matic (5), Lingard (4), Mata (4), Martial (5), Lukaku (5) Subs: Lindelof (4), Rashford (6), Mkhitaryan (5) Man of the match: Aaron Mooy The loss is United's first of the Premier League season, leaving them five points behind leaders Manchester City. Huddersfield are up to 10th. In the first meeting between these two sides in 45 years, Huddersfield were ahead just before the half-hour mark through Mooy, who finished the move he had started. Dispossessing Juan Mata in midfield following the Spaniard's poor touch, Mooy raced forward and fed Tom Ince, whose shot was saved by De Gea into the path of Mooy to finish off into the far corner. Team news Huddersfield made three changes from the side that lost at Swansea; Malone, Biling and Van La Parra came out, replaced by Schindler, Williams and Mooy. After the goalless draw at Anfield, United introduced Lingard and Mata for Darmian and Mkhitaryan. Anthony Martial lets his frustration boil over against Huddersfield Lindelof - who had been on the pitch just 10 mintues after replacing the injured Phil Jones - was at fault for the second goal, ducking his head from a long Jonas Lossl clearance to allow Depoitre in, and the strike duly rounded De Gea to pass into the empty net. Jose Mourinho introduced Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Rashford at half time, using up all of his subs by the start of the second half, but United failed to create a clear chance until 76 minutes after Lossl superbly pushed away Ander Herrera's glancing header. Rashford made it 2-1 with 12 minutes remaining, heading into the ground and past Lossl unmarked from Lukaku's fine cross from the right for his seventh goal of the season. United huffed and puffed for an equaliser, and came closest in the fourth minute of injury time through Smalling, whose effort unmarked at the back post was superbly blocked by Mathias Jorgensen. Man of the match - Aaron Mooy If Huddersfield are to stay up, they'll likely have Mooy to thank most. Mooy ran more than any other player on the pitch on Saturday (13.04km) and made more passes than any of his team-mates as he commanded a midfield set up to disrupt the likes of Nemanja Matic and Ander Herrera in possession. The first goal epitomised the Australian - hounding down Juan Mata, he won the ball on halfway, burst forward and unselfishly fed Tom Ince to shoot - and was in the right place to follow up with the rebound. A special mention must go to Rajiv van la Parra, who arrived as a sub in the first half and put in a tireless display down the right flank, constantly gaining ground as Huddersfield looked to push out from each United attack. Antonio Valencia battles for the ball in the second half Opta stats Mourinho has failed to win all 19 Premier League games in which his side have been two goals behind (D1 L18) - that draw coming against Newcastle in September 2015 when managing Chelsea. This was only Mourinho's third defeat to a newly-promoted side in the Premier League (W33 D4) - losing against Crystal Palace in 2013/14, and Bournemouth in 2015-16 when at Chelsea. Huddersfield have beaten Man United for the first time in the league since March 1952, a 3-2 win in the top-flight. Three of the last six clubs in their debut Premier League season have beaten Manchester United at home - Burnley in 2009/10, Bournemouth in 2015-16 and Huddersfield in 2017/18. The pundit Paul Merson: \"If you'd have said to me Man United will lose this game 2-1, I'd have assumed the goalkeeper is coming off as man of the match for Huddersfield. \"But it wasn't the case. Three shots on target and one good save. That's not Man United-like. I said United had a straightforward start to the season, but I expected them to win today. Every single one of those Huddersfield players stuck to the game plan.\" The managers David Wagner: \"This result is so huge for Huddersfield, us as a football club, to beat Manchester United at home, their first defeat of the season. I think this is an absolutely huge moment for everybody. Huddersfield boss David Wagner says today’s win is a very proud moment for the club Huddersfield boss David Wagner says today’s win is a very proud moment for the club \"Today was our moment, we were at our best, maybe Man Utd weren't at their best, and the players made me very proud today. This is for sure one of the proudest moments in my managerial career. This is what makes me very happy.\" Jose Mourinho: \"We deserved to lose. The team that wanted it more, wanted to work more, compete more and be more aggressive, they won. And when the best team win, nothing to say. Jose Mourinho says Huddersfield wanted the win more Jose Mourinho says Huddersfield wanted the win more \"I don't know why, and I'm not going to be critical of my players with you, I have to analyse with them. But I just want to be as honest and pragmatic as possible and say that the best team won.\" What's next?

The Argentina international, making his first appearance since a September car accident in Amsterdam, moved level with Eric Brook on 177 goals after Bernardo Silva was brought down by goalkeeper Nick Pope (30). The Premier League leaders were made to work at the Etihad by a stubborn Burnley side, but two second-half goals by Nicolas Otamendi (73) and Leroy Sane (75) broke the visitors' resistance. A club-record 11th straight win for City in all competitions, combined with Manchester United's 2-1 defeat at Huddersfield, means Pep Guardiola's team sit five points clear at the top of the table.

Take a look at our pick of his goals in the Premier League. Meanwhile Burnley, who lost leading scorer Chris Wood to injury early in the first half, are ninth after their first league defeat since August 19. Having won at Chelsea and recorded creditable draws at Anfield and Wembley, the visitors suffered an early setback when Wood limped off with a suspected hamstring injury. That blow was compounded when referee Roger East penalised Pope for a trip on Silva, allowing Aguero to score from the spot. Team news Sergio Aguero returned to make his first appearance since fracturing a rib in a car accident in September as Pep Guardiola made two changes from the 2-1 Champions League win over Napoli. Sean Dyche named an unchanged side from Burnley's 1-1 draw against West Ham. The stand-in Burnley 'keeper was otherwise impressive as he kept his team in the game, saving from Bernardo Silva and Aguero again before the break. The visitors pushed on after half-time and wanted a penalty when Fabian Delph played the ball onto his own hand, but referee East was unmoved and a late City flourish extinguished their hopes. Nicolas Otamendi scored in Man City's win over Burnley The damage was done by two goals in three minutes as first Sane's corner teed up Otamendi to head home, before the German lashed in the hosts' third. Match stats Sergio Aguero (177) became Manchester City's joint-highest goalscorer of all time alongside Eric Brook. This is Man City's joint-best points return after the first nine games of a Premier League season alongside (2011-12). The only team with more points at this stage of the season were Chelsea (27) in 2005-06. Pep Guardiola has won 25 points so far this season with Man City; only in 2015-16 (27 pts with Bayern Munich) has he won more points as a manager from the opening nine games of the season. Leroy Sane has both scored and assisted in three of his last four Premier League appearances for Man City. Manchester City's Pep Guardiola said Bernardo Silva was brought down for their early penalty against Burnley Manchester City's Pep Guardiola said Bernardo Silva was brought down for their early penalty against Burnley The managers Pep Guardiola: \"After the Champions League it is always difficult because the Champions League is so demanding - not just physically, but mentally. \"It was a fantastic performance, we didn't concede too much and [Burnley] suffered their first defeat in away games today. \"Burnley is always tough, their physicality.

He has now recorded more league assists (69) than any other player in Europe's top five leagues since the 2012/13 season. What next?

Palace's search for a first away goal this season goes on, with Roy Hodgson's side failing to record a single shot on target at St James' Park despite dominating for large parts of the game. Newcastle burst into life with 20 minutes to go, and substitute Merino fortuitously headed in his first goal (86) for the club to send them up to sixth in the Premier League - a timely boost with Amanda Stavelely's takeover edging closer.

The official opted for a yellow despite the home fans' vehement protests. Jamaal Lascelles reacts after Yohan Cabaye's heavy challenge on DeAndre Yedlin Wilfried Zaha came closest to breaking the deadlock before half-time, but he sent his header wide from Andros Townsend's cross. Four yellow cards and zero shots on target summed up a scrappy opening 45 minutes, and it took until the 73rd minute before a goalkeeper was forced to make a save. Team news Both sides fielded unchanged XIs from their previous outings. Dwight Gayle (calf) missed out on facing his former employers, while Wayne Hennessey and Ruben Loftus-Cheek returned to the bench for Palace. It was Julian Speroni who was called into action as Newcastle upped the ante, but the Palace goalkeeper comfortably kept out Mo Diame's attempt before palming away Jonjo Shelvey's effort. Ruben Loftus-Cheek could have stolen it for Palace after replacing a disappointed Zaha, but his cross-shot neither troubled Rob Elliot nor found Patrick van Aanholt at the back post. Jamaal Lascelles and the Newcastle defence kept Crystal Palace at bay And with four minutes left on the clock, Palace were made to pay when Matt Ritchie's cross was actually headed by James McArthur against the head of Merino, which in turn sent the ball beyond the helpless Speroni. Merino wheeled away to celebrate his first goal since netting for Osasuna in June 2016, ending Newcastle's three-game winless run as a result. Opta stats Rafael Benitez has never lost a home league game in English football against a coach who has also managed the English national team (W17 D4). Crystal Palace have failed to score in their last seven Premier League away games - their longest such run in the top-flight. Mikel Merino scored his first ever Premier League goal in what was his ninth appearance in the competition. The Magpies have lost only one of their last 10 Premier League games on home soil (W6 D3 L1). Man of the match - DeAndre Yedlin The Newcastle right-back had a busy afternoon at St James' Park. The American withstood a heavy challenge from Cabaye in the first half, and went on to win two-thirds of his duels for the hosts (six of nine), more than any other Newcastle player. He also chipped in with two tackles and four clearances, keeping Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha at bay and helping his side to just a third clean sheet of the season.

Stoke 1-2 Bournemouth Quick-fire goals from Andrew Surman and Junior Stanislas in the first half were enough to hand Bournemouth a priceless 2-1 victory against Stoke City at the Bet 365 stadium. Bournemouth took the lead after 16 minutes through a fine finish from Surman, before Stanislas doubled their advantage two minutes later from the penalty spot after Ryan Shawcross had upended Benik Afobe. Stoke rallied in the second half and set up a barnstorming finish when Mame Biram Diouf bundled the ball in with his thigh just past the hour mark. However, despite a Stoke siege in the second half, Bournemouth stayed resolute to secure only their second win of the season and move four points clear of Crystal Palace at the bottom, while their opponents now join them in the relegation places. Player ratings Stoke: Butland (7), Johnson (5), Shawcross (4), Zouma (5), Pieters (6), Allen (6), Cameron (5), Fletcher (6), Jese (5), Choupo-Moting (6), Diouf (6) Subs: Berahino (5), Crouch (6) Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Adam Smith (6), Francis (7), Ake (6), Daniels (6), Stanislas (8), Lewis Cook (6), Surman (8), Ibe (7), Mousset (5), Afobe (6) Subs: Steve Cook (5), Pugh (N/A), Arter (N/A) Man of the match: Junior Stanislas Despite winning just one of their previous seven games, Stoke started slowly and they were punished for their lethargy as Bournemouth took the lead. Adam Smith burst down the right flank before feeding the ball into Stanislas inside the area and he teed up Surman to score with a wonderfully taken effort from the edge of the area. Just a couple of minutes later Stoke were 2-0 down as Shawcross haplessly bundled Afobe to the ground after failing to sort out his feet. Stanislas took responsibility from the spot and calmly slotted it past Jack Butland after sending him the wrong way. The visitors almost added a third late on in the first half but Butland was on hand to make a miraculous stop to deny Jordon Ibe, after the winger's shot took a deflection off Shawcross. Just a minute later, though, Stoke almost dragged themselves back into the game as Erik Pieters' pinpoint cross from the left was met by the head of Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, but the Cameroon international only succeeded in nodding his effort agonisingly wide of the far post with Asmir Begovic rooted to the spot. Team news Mark Hughes made three changes to his side with captain Ryan Shawcross, Glen Johnson and Joe Allen coming into the side in place of Kevin Wimmer, Tom Edwards and Xherdan Shaqiri. Eddie Howe was without both Josh King and Jermain Defoe so Benik Afobe and Lys Mousset led the line for Bournemouth. Stoke piled on the pressure after the interval and eventually got their reward on 63 minutes as Diouf netted his third goal in as many matches by guiding the ball up and over Begovic, after the ball ricocheted into his path via Choupo-Moting's knockdown at the far post. With 15 minutes remaining, Stoke had a penalty appeal of their own waved away after Jese Rodriguez was upended by Adam Smith. A late Stoke onslaught ensued and while they dominated possession in the final stages, they were unable to find an equaliser, meaning Bournemouth held on to secure their first three points away from home this season. Opta stats Andrew Surman has netted two in his last five Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 81. Mame Biram Diouf has bagged three goals in eight games this season, two more than his total of one from 27 top-flight games last season. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting has been directly involved in 4 goals in his last 4 Premier League games at the Britannia (2 goals, 2 assists). Darren Fletcher made his 100th consecutive Premier League appearance - the longest current run in the competition. The managers Mark Hughes: \"We didn't cope too well with the conditions in the first half and obviously we made a couple of mistakes, giving away a penalty almost immediately after they had scored the opening goal. \"Second half, obviously with the wind on our backs, we made a lot better use of the ball and got some decent balls in from good areas but we couldn't find those final touches that we needed. \"Bournemouth, as is their want - and they did exactly the same last year - they just killed the game and wasted time. Unfortunately when you go behind it is difficult and as an away team why wouldn't they do that? \"In the second half we were the team that was really trying to force the issue whereas Bournemouth were just trying to keep us at bay but the damage was done in the first half unfortunately.\" Eddie Howe: \"It was a massive, massive game today especially with Chelsea to come next week. We knew the importance of not becoming detached from the teams above us so that was a really gritty performance, especially in the second half. \"It was contrasting halves form us really as in the first half we moved the ball really well, some of our attacking play was really incisive and we looked like we could score goals and we got the two. \"But you did fear with the weather conditions that the second half would be a different game and it was but thankfully we showed our resilient side and managed to see the game out. \"At this level of football you can't give yourself too much to do and with each game going by that you don't win the task becomes tougher so we were well aware that we need to win quickly and this is a tough place to come so it's a special win for us.\" Man of the match - Junior Stanislas A constant threat all afternoon, Junior Stanislas' contribution was crucial to Bournemouth's win as he provided the assist for Andrew Surman's opener before scoring the winner himself from the penalty spot shortly afterwards. Despite lining up as an inside forward on the left wing, Stanislas roamed all over the pitch, intelligently finding pockets of space in the final third from which to hurt Stoke with his direct dribbling and incisive passing. What's next? Stoke City travel to Vicarage Road to face Watford next Saturday while Bournemouth have a Carabao Cup game against Middlesbrough to look forward to on Tuesday, before switching their attentions back to the Premier League for the visit of Chelsea on Saturday."}, {"date": "21/10/2018", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20521, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name":

first game in temporary charge of the club. The visitors took a 25th-minute lead when Swansea centre-back Federico Fernandez headed Riyad Mahrez's cross past his own goalkeeper, before Shinji Okazaki doubled their advantage four minutes after half-time. However, despite the home side reducing the deficit thanks to Alfie Mawson's excellent finish (56), Leicester held on to end a run of six Premier League matches without a win.

After bossing the first quarter of the game, Leicester took a deserved lead when Okazaki released Mahrez down the left wing. Swansea defender Federico Fernandez (right) shows his dejection after scoring an own goal against Leicester Swansea's defence momentarily stopped, thinking the ball had gone out of play, but Mahrez continued, before cutting back into the penalty area and seeing Fernandez inadvertently divert his drilled centre past Lukasz Fabianski. Appleton's side increased their lead minutes after the break as Jamie Vardy, on the counter, found Mahrez in space in the box, with the Swansea defence desperately pleading for offside. The Algeria international was just onside, before laying the ball across the six-yard box for the unmarked Okazaki to tap home past a horribly exposed Fabianski. Swansea did manage to pull a goal back, albeit out of the blue, as Jordan Ayew flicked a left-wing corner on to Mawson, who did brilliantly to swivel and turn in a tight space, before hooking the ball into the far corner of the goal. 5 - Shinji Okazaki has scored five goals in his last nine PL games, as many as he managed in his previous 51 in the competition. Turnaround. pic.twitter.com/NxVhUNrAyR — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 21, 2017 That strike was not enough to rouse Paul Clement's team, however, with Leicester comfortably holding out for the three points that lift them out of the drop zone. Team news Swansea made one change, with Renato Sanches having recovered from a thigh problem to replace the suspended Leroy Fer in midfield. Leicester also made one change, with Shinji Okazaki coming in for Kelechi Iheanacho in attack. Opta stats Swansea have lost four of their five home Premier League games this season (W1), after suffering just one defeat in the eight before that (W6 D1) Since the start of 2015/16, Swansea have scored 11 own goals, more than twice as many as any other side No player has scored more Premier League own goals since the start of 2015/16 than Federico Fernandez (3 - level with Jack Cork) Riyad Mahrez has had a hand in two goals in his last two Premier League games (1 goal, 1 assist), as many as in his previous 10 in the competition Mahrez has had a hand in five Premier League goals against the Swans (4 goals, 1 assist); against no other side has the winger been involved in more goals in the competition (also 5 v West Brom) Jordan Ayew has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other current Swansea player since his debut in the competition in February 2017 (7 - 2 goals, 5 assists) Shinji Okazaki (left) battles for possession with Luciano Narsingh The pundit Matt Le Tissier: Leicester were much the more dangerous side. Swansea had little pockets of play where they threatened briefly, but Lukasz Fabianski had to make far more saves in the first half, a couple of them decent ones. But he was not able to stop the one from his own defender, which was a bullet of a header from Federico Fernandez, Riyad Mahrez whipped a cross in with plenty of pace and he could only divert it into his own net. Swansea pressed a little bit towards the end of the first half, but Leicester came out of the blocks again in the second half and Shinji Okazaki put them two in front and at that point, you thought it was going to be pretty comfortable for Leicester. But Swansea gave them a good game in the end, Alfie Mawson with a terrific finish, kept the game alive for Swansea and they were right in it until the last few minutes. Matt Le Tissier was impressed with how Leicester performed at Swansea under caretaker manager Michael Appleton in the 2-1 Premier League win Matt Le Tissier was impressed with how Leicester performed at Swansea under caretaker manager Michael Appleton in the 2-1 Premier League win The managers Paul Clement: \"If you look at the nature of their goals, the first one deflects off our own player and goes into the net. \"And the other one, which I have slowed down and looked at very carefully, is marginally offside. I think it is a difficult one for the linesman, but it is offside. \"Last week we took a step forward with our performance defensively and offensively, but this week I think we have taken a step back.\" Paul Clement says Swansea’s performance in the first half hurt them as they lost 2-1 to Leicester at home Paul Clement says Swansea’s performance in the first half hurt them as they lost 2-1 to Leicester at home Michael Appleton: \"Getting the first goal was massive - that is the second time we have done it this year and obviously that is the two wins we have got,\" he said. \"It was important that we started the game really well as we have not particularly started a few of the games that well of late, and gone behind in games. \"Delighted at the way they stuck at it as they could quite easily, after they pulled a goal back, gone on to draw or even lose the game.\" Caretaker manager Michael Appleton says the Leicester players deserve praise for their attitude after a difficult week for the club ended with a 2-1 win at Swansea Caretaker manager Michael Appleton says the Leicester players deserve praise for their attitude after a difficult week for the club ended with a 2-1 win at Swansea Man of the Match - Riyad Mahrez Mahrez has responded brilliantly to being dropped by previous boss Craig Shakespeare against Bournemouth in September. The Algeria international grabbed his side's crucial late equaliser in Monday night's draw at home with West Bromwich Albion, before turning in an eye-catching display today. And with the twinkle-toed playmaker creating both of the Foxes' goals, he was the visitors' star man in South Wales. What's next? Swansea host Manchester United in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night, before travelling to take on Arsenal in the Premier League next Saturday afternoon.

Boufal's superb individual late goal secured Southampton a 1-0 victory over West Brom at St Mary's on Saturday. The game looked to be heading for a stalemate after Ryan Bertrand hit the post in the first half and former Saints forward Jay Rodriguez dragged a good opportunity wide later in the game. But substitute Boufal snatched victory for Saints in the 85th minute when he ran 70 yards, breaking away from challenges and leaving several players in his wake, before finishing into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. The victory is only Southampton's second at home in the Premier League this season while West Brom have won just two of their last 18 league matches. The Baggies showed little attacking ambition on a blustery evening and now face a tricky upcoming run with Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham to play in their next four games.

Oriol Romeu dragged a close-range shot wide from a corner before Shane Long - who has now not scored in 20 games for Southampton - failed to finish from 10 yards out. West Brom, who lost Jonny Evans to injury on the half-hour mark and saw Craig Dawson limp off later on, offered little going forward and were indebted to goalkeeper Ben Foster for tipping clear a header from Maya Yoshida. Team news Steven Davis replaced Nathan Redmond for Southampton while goalkeeper Ben Foster was passed fit to start for West Brom. West Brom lost Jonny Evans to injury Saints continued to control the game after half-time as Manolo Gabbiadini headed over and Shane Long shot at Foster. West Brom's best opening of the match fell to Rodriguez on the hour mark but he failed to even hit target after being played through on goal. Dusan Tadic was denied by Foster at the other end but Saints were eventually rewarded for their persistence, although it took a moment of individual brilliance to break the deadlock. Boufal picked up inside his own half, escaped the attentions of a few challenges and then burst clear before cutting inside on the edge of the West Brom box and finishing into the bottom corner. The substitute also set up Charlie Austin for a late chance but he hit the outside of the post. Opta stats Of Premier League fixtures played at least 15 times, games between these two sides have averaged just 1.47 goals per game (22 goals in 15 games), fewer than any other clash. The Baggies have posted a league-low 37% possession figure in the Premier League this season. Southampton have kept a clean sheet in seven of their last nine Premier League meetings with West Brom. Sofiane Boufal's goal was his first in his last 23 Premier League appearances, since netting against Middlesbrough in December 2016. Five of the last nine Premier League meetings between these two sides have been goalless at half-time. Man of the match - Sofiane Boufal He only entered the pitch in the 81st minute, but Boufal provided the match-winning moment which will go down as a goal-of-the-season contender. The substitute carried the ball 70 yards before keeping his composure and finishing into the bottom corner. It was a brilliant goal to decide a game that was otherwise short on quality in the final third. What's next? Southampton are live on Sky Sports Premier League next Sunday when they make a trip along the coast to Brighton. Meanwhile, West Brom host Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday."}, {"date": "20/10/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United",

"2:57 Watch highlights of Brighton's 3-0 win at West Ham on Friday Night Football Watch highlights of Brighton's 3-0 win at West Ham on Friday Night Football Brighton picked up their first ever Premier League away win with a 3-0 victory at West Ham on Friday Night Football, which turned up the heat on boss Slaven Bilic. A double from Glenn Murray and a fine José Izquierdo effort mean the Hammers have made their worst start to a season since 2010, taking just eight points from nine games. When Murray stroked home Brighton's third from the spot 15 minutes from time, it triggered a mass walkout from the home supporters - with some aiming their frustration towards the West Ham owners in the directors box. Slaven Bilic's West Ham have made their worst start to a season since 2010 Brighton defensive duo Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy were the foundations of a tenacious performance - making it 21 wins from 37 games when they have started together as a pair. The result moves the Premier League new boys up to 10th in the Premier League. In Chris Hughton's 100th game as a Premier League manager, the Seagulls sensed nervousness in West Ham's play and struck an unlikely opener. Player ratings West Ham: Hart (5), Reid (6), Fonte (5), Zabaleta (5), Masuaku (6), Kouyate (5), Obiang (6), Antonio (6), Lanzini (6), Arnautovic (4), Hernandez (6) Subs: Ayew (6), Fernandes (6) Brighton: Ryan (7), Bruno (8), Bong (7), Dunk (8), Duffy (8), Propper (7), Gross (7), Stephens (7), Knockaert (7), Izquierdo (8), Murray (8) Subs: March (6), Brown (6) Man of the match: Glenn Murray Pascal Gross maintained his run of being involved in every one of Brighton's goals this season by whipping in a free-kick which was flicked home by Murray with just 10 minutes on the clock. The response from the hosts was limited - they dominated territory but lacked cutting edge as Duffy and Dunk repelled anything that came into their box. Brighton, sensationally, doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time. Team news Pedro Obiang came into the midfield for West Ham as Slaven Bilic shuffled his pack. Andy Carroll missed out through suspension after his red card at Burnley so Javier Hernandez got the chance to play centrally. Gaeten Bong was handed a start by Chris Hughton as he made two changes from the 1-1 draw at home to Everton last time out. Joe Hart had to be alert to parry away a fantastic opportunity for Murray but seconds later he was picking the ball out of his net. Izquierdo cut off his left wing before unleashing a curling shot that found the top corner from 25 yards - Hart got a hand to it, but could not keep it out. Glenn Murray celebrates Albion's opener in the 10th minute at the London Stadium At times in the second half, the vocal Brighton travelling faithful serenaded their team with \"olés\" as their team kept the ball past a static Hammers midfield. Murray was denied by Hart minutes before he was sent tumbling inside the area by Pablo Zabaleta on 75 minutes. The former Palace man stepped up and fired home. That goal cued a mass exit in the home end, seemingly leaving huge questions for Bilic and his board to answer. Brighton players celebrate their third goal of the game at West Ham, scored by Murray from the penalty spot Man of the match - Glenn Murray This man loves playing West Ham. His double here made it five goals in seven appearances against the east Londoners. Some have questioned his ability to lead the line at the top level but he's made a career of proving people wrong. This performance showcased everything he's about: providing a platform for others to shine and taking chances when they come his way. Opta stats This was West Ham's heaviest home league defeat against a newly promoted side since losing 5-1 to West Bromwich Albion in November 1931. The Seagulls end the day in the top half of the top flight outside the month of August for the first time since October 1982. Since Bilic took charge of West Ham, the Hammers have conceded 18 penalties in the Premier League - four more than any other side. Murray has scored two braces in the Premier League - both against West Ham, also scoring twice against the Hammers for Crystal Palace in February 2015. West Ham have conceded more headed goals than any other Premier League side this season (5) - they only conceded four headed goals in the entirety of Slaven Bilic's first season in charge in 2015/16. Brighton's Jose Izquierdo (front) is congratulated by team-mate Gaetan Bong after netting the second goal What's next? The Hammers face a midweek trip to north London to face Tottenham in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup, live on Sky Sports Football, before tackling another London derby next Saturday against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.

League goal of the season rescued a point for Leicester in their 1-1 draw with West Brom on Monday Night Football. The Algerian made amends for an earlier miss to equalise with 10 minutes left, but Leicester could not find the winner which would have moved them out of the bottom three. Nacer Chadli had fired West Brom ahead from a free-kick (63) which left Kasper Schmeichel rooted to the spot. The draw leaves Leicester 18th and without a win since August, while West Brom move up to 10th despite seeing their winless run extend to seven games in all competitions.

With Ben Foster out, Boaz Myhill was making his first league start since 2016, and the West Brom goalkeeper got down well to keep out Danny Simpson's sweetly-struck volley from just inside the box. Riyad Mahrez (R) missed a glorious chance before Nacer Chadli's opener Leicester ended the first half with a flourish, but could not find the breakthrough as Christian Fuchs volleyed his effort into the ground and Jamie Vardy was nudged away from Marc Albrighton's low cross. Team news Craig Shakespeare made three changes, bringing in Vicente Iborra for his first PL start, as well as Riyad Mahrez and Kelechi Iheanacho. Tony Pulis also made three changes for the visitors, with Nacer Chadli, Jake Livermore and Boaz Myhill coming into the XI. Vardy came within inches of earning Leicester a penalty early in the second half, but referee Mike Dean deemed Myhill's foul to have occurred outside the area - Harry Maguire saw his header from the resulting free-kick blocked. Mahrez missed a gilt-edged chance moments later, firing over from 10 yards out despite being under no pressure on his left foot. The hosts were made to pay for that miss as West Brom took the lead when Chadli's free-kick left Schmeichel rooted to the spot. Chadli's first goal since February allowed West Brom to sit back, and Leicester took full advantage when Mahrez slotted home from substitute Islam Slimani's knock-down. Leicester searched for a winner but West Brom held firm to pick up first point on the road since August. West Brom's Boaz Myhill was delighted with his side's 1-1 draw at Leicester in the Premier League as the goalkeeper had an eventful evening.

West Brom boss Tony Pulis says he cannot fault the effort and commitment of his players after they drew 1-1 at Leicester in the Premier League. Tony Pulis: \"It's happened to us a few times this year, where we've been leading and let it slip. But as I've said before it's a tough league, every team that you play, if you take the top six out, there's not a lot between them.\" Pundit view - Jamie Carragher \"Credit to Craig Shakespeare. He bought Slimani on to give Leicester two up front alongside Vardy, and he also put Mahrez in a more central position. \"Yes, they got a bit of luck [for the equaliser] but they wouldn't normally have a player where Mahrez was for the finish in their normal 4-4-2. It would normally have been too high up for their midfielders.\" Man of the match - Marc Albrighton In a tightly-fought encounter at the King Power, Albrighton was a constant outlet for Leicester out wide and would perhaps have benefited more had Slimani been introduced earlier into the match.

But a silly foul from Brighton captain Bruno - who elbowed Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the face during an Everton free-kick - saw the visitors awarded a 90th-minute penalty that Rooney converted. It moves both sides onto eight points following the draw, with Everton in 16th and Brighton in 14th with a superior goal difference. Chances were at a premium in the first half, and it took 20 minutes for the opening chance. Gylfi Sigurdsson did well to dance his way across the top of the box and found Nikola Vlasic to his right. He, in turn, picked out Idrissa Gueye who rifled an effort through the box, but Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan did well to get down low and push the shot away. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (7), Bruno (6), Duffy (7), Dunk (7), Suttner (6), March (8), Stephens (6), Propper (7), Knockaert (8), Gross (7), Murray (6). Subs used: Izquierdo (6), Hunemeier (4), Brown (n/a). Everton: Pickford (7), Holgate (7), Keane (7), Jagielka (7), Baines (6), Schneiderlin (6), Gueye (7), Vlasic (7), Sigurdsson (6), Calvert-Lewin (7), Rooney (7). Subs used: Niasse (6), Mirallas (n/a), Davies (n/a). Man of the match: Anthony Knockaert. Thirteen minutes later and the hosts were starting to come into their own. Knockaert's initial shot ricocheted off the players in a packed box, with Lewis Dunk chasing down the rebounded ball on the right. However, his own shot came off the body of a sliding Michael Keane to send it behind, with Dunk's penalty appeals for a handball going unanswered. Everton started well in the second half and tested goalkeeper Ryan in the 53rd minute. Holgate burst into the box from the right flank before hammering an effort towards goal, but the Brighton stopper made a smart save. The Australia international was in action again not long after as Rooney picked out Calvert-Lewin in the box, who attempted to slot home but Ryan got down low to palm the effort away. Team news Glenn Murray made a return to Brighton's starting XI alongside Markus Stuttner and Anthony Knockaert in three Brighton changes. Everton also switched three players, with Phil Jagielka, Mason Holgate and Wayne Rooney coming in. Brighton had two terrific chances in quick succession with 15 minutes of the game to play. Substitute Jose Izquierdo strode across the top of the box before taking aim, but his fizzing effort was superbly pushed away by Jordan Pickford before an effort from Knockaert squirmed across the face of goal and went wide. Everton could also have had a penalty in the 80th minute when Sigurdsson had his shirt pulled by Pascal Gross in the area, but nothing was given. But the Frenchman did manage to find the target in the 82nd minute and put Brighton ahead. Izquierdo's initial shot was saved by the feet of Pickford, but the rebounded ball was poked into the path of Knockaert who slotted home before a celebratory pile-on from his team-mates. Eight minutes later, though, and Everton equalised. As Sigurdsson delivered a free kick, Bruno was penalised for a foul in the area after elbowing Calvert-Lewin in the face, and saw referee Michael Oliver point to the spot. Up stepped Rooney, who coolly slotted home and rescued a point for Everton at the death. Wayne Rooney scores the equalising penalty for Everton Opta stats Wayne Rooney has now scored against 36 of the 39 different clubs he's faced in the Premier League - only Frank Lampard (39), Andrew Cole (38) and Alan Shearer (37) have scored against more in the competition (Jermain Defoe also 36). Everton are winless in their last 12 away Premier League games - their longest such run since a run of 13 ending in March 2002. 83% - Pascal Groß has been involved in 83% of his team's goals this term (2 goals, 3 assists); the highest ratio of any PL player. Quality. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 15, 2017 Meanwhile, Brighton have also scored the highest percentage of goals in the second half of games in the Premier League this season (83% - 5/6). Six of the last nine goals Everton have conceded away from home in the Premier League have come in the final 10 minutes of games. The managers Chris Hughton (Brighton): I'm incredibly disappointed. At this moment because of the timing of the goals it feels more like a defeat than a draw. I know we are the home side, but I thought we were good value once we took the lead and it's incredibly disappointing - particularly in the manner how we conceded.\" Brighton boss Chris Hughton says he is incredibly disappointed Brighton boss Chris Hughton says he is incredibly disappointed Ronald Koeman (Everton): \"We work hard and we fight, but we know it's a difficult competition. But I'm proud of the team and what they showed today in a really difficult situation. That's the way we need to come out and win games - and we will do that.\" Everton boss Ronald Koeman reflects on his side's draw with Brighton Everton boss Ronald Koeman reflects on his side's draw with Brighton Man of the match - Anthony Knockaert It was another superb performance for Knockaert, who lit up the Sky Bet Championship last season, and showed the same form against Everton, with a number of chances falling his way throughout the game as he proved to be difficult to handle. Anthony Knockaert celebrates after scoring for Brighton against Everton He continually worked even when out of possession and of course, scored the important opener for Brighton when they were piling on the pressure. The reaction of his team-mates after the goal and the singing of his name throughout the game by the fans shows just how much he is loved at the Amex Stadium. What's next?

Newcastle Manolo Gabbiadini's double inspired Southampton as they twice came from behind to secure a 2-2 draw with Newcastle on Nissan Super Sunday. Isaac Hayden's first Premier League goal put the Magpies ahead at St Mary's on 20 minutes, but that was cancelled out by a fine individual strike from Gabbiadini early in the second half. Ayoze Perez punished an error from Fraser Forster to restore Newcastle's lead within 86 seconds, but, once again, Gabbiadini was the Saints' hero as his emphatic penalty 15 minutes from time sealed a point. The result lifts Southampton up to 10th in the Premier League, two points and one spot behind ninth-placed Newcastle. Team news Manolo Gabbiadini was drafted into the Southampton line-up in place of captain Steven Davis, who started on the bench. Rafa Benitez, meanwhile, handed starts to Isaac Hayden and Florian Lejeune as Ciaran Clark and Mikel Merino dropped out. Having failed to score in eight of their last nine home matches, Southampton boss Mauricio Pellegrino was under pressure ahead of kick-off, pressure which would have increased further had Christian Atsu's ninth-minute effort found the target and not the side-netting. The Saints responded as Nathan Redmond's cross found Dusan Tadic at the far post on 16 minutes, but the Serb headed a gilt-edged chance over and the hosts were made to pay shortly afterwards as Hayden's crisp volley flashed past Forster in the home goal from 20 yards out. Isaac Hayden celebrates his first Premier League goal Virgil van Dijk, making his first appearance at St Mary's since January, had the chance to mark his return with a goal, and draw a line under a tumultuous summer, but, having beaten Newcastle 'keeper Rob Elliot to the ball at the near post, the defender's glancing header drifted wide. Saints pressed and probed for an equaliser but it was Newcastle who came closest to scoring again as Joselu turned Perez's centre onto the crossbar within two minutes of the restart. Ayoze Perez is congratulated after restoring Newcastle's lead But, out of nothing, a moment of brilliance hauled Southampton level as Gabbiadini plucked a long ball down in the area and kept Javi Manquillo at arm's length before trickling the ball into the bottom corner. The lead was short-lived, though, as Perez fired the ball past Forster after the Saints stopper spilled his initial near-post effort. But, after Florian Lejeune brought Shane Long down in the area, up stepped Gabbiadini, this time from 12 yards, to rescue Southampton once more, before substitute Steven Davis prevented Lejeune from atoning for his penalty error by hacking his goal-bound header off the line at the death. Player ratings Southampton: Forster (5), Cedric (6), Van Dijk (6), Yoshida (6), Bertrand (6), Redmond (6), Romeu (6), Lemina (8), Tadic (6), Long (6), Gabbiadini (9).

Subs: Murphy (5), Gayle (5), Merino (6). Man of the Match: Manolo Gabbiadini Opta stats Southampton have only lost one of their last 24 home league matches against Newcastle (W16 D7). There were just 87 seconds between Southampton's equaliser and Ayoze Perez restoring Newcastle's lead at the start of the second half. Perez ended a run of 1135 minutes without a Premier League goal - his last goal came against Bournemouth in March 2016. Manolo Gabbiadini scored twice in this match - more than he'd managed in his previous 15 Premier League appearances (1). Isaac Hayden scored his first Premier League goal in his eighth appearance in the competition - it was his first goal since April when he scored against Cardiff in a Championship fixture. The managers Mauricio Pellegrino: \"We conceded a couple of, in my opinion, soft goals. We were in our best moment (in the match). We could have won the game but also we could lose the game. We are conceding goals in every single game at home and we can do better. It is one point, it is not the best for us but in how we conceded the first and second goals the point is positive.\" Rafa Benitez reflects on Newcastle's 2-2 draw with Southampton at St Mary's stadium.

We can be better and hopefully we will be better but we have to defend better.\" Man of the Match - Manolo Gabbiadini Gabbiadini was making his first start in more than a month but showed no signs of rustiness as he cancelled strikes in either half from Hayden and Perez.

Manchester United stretched to four games as Liverpool were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw at Anfield. In front of the new Kenny Dalglish Stand, Liverpool fought tirelessly for the victory, registering 18 shots to United's six, but a dogged defensive display, coupled with the brilliance of David de Gea kept the hosts at bay. It means Liverpool, who have not tasted victory over their fierce rivals in the Premier League since March 2014, failed to cut the gap on United, who remain seven points clear of Klopp's side after stretching their unbeaten run to eight games. Having won six and drawn one of their opening seven league games, United were the form side ahead of kick-off but it was Liverpool who posed the greater threat throughout. Team news Jurgen Klopp made two changes as Roberto Firmino and Emre Can replaced Daniel Sturridge and the injured Sadio Mane. Matteo Darmian was handed a rare start as Jose Mourinho made three changes, which saw Ander Herrera and Anthony Martial drafted into the starting line-up. United frantically got bodies back on 16 minutes to cut out a Joe Gomez cross after Roberto Firmino had played the right-back through, before a crucial interception from Antonio Valencia dispossessed Philippe Coutinho in the area. The pressure persisted as Firmino's low cross fell for Mohamed Salah, but the Egyptian swiped at the cross, failing to turn it home from close range. On a rare venture forward, Nemanja Matic lashed a volley narrowly wide from 20 yards, but Liverpool remained on top as Joel Matip's shot drew a sublime point-blank save from De Gea before Salah fired the rebound wide. It took United until the 44th minute to register their first, and only, attempt on target as Simon Mignolet, a virtual bystander beforehand, parried Romelu Lukaku's effort away, before the half ended with controversy as Dejan Lovren gestured Lukaku had kicked him in the face. Liverpool continued in the same manner after the break as Emre Can fired a gilt-edged chance over the bar after being picked out by Gomez's inch-perfect cross, before Salah was just too short to get on the end of Coutinho's ball to the back post on 71 minutes. Klopp brought on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Daniel Sturridge in a bid to snatch a winner but it proved fruitless as United clung on, with late headers for Lovren and Dominic Solanke missing as both teams failed to register a shot on target in the second period.

Man of the match: Joe Gomez Opta stats Jose Mourinho has won only one of his eight matches as a manager against Jurgen Klopp in all competitions (W1 D4 L3). Since Jose Mourinho took charge of Manchester United ahead of 2016-17; these two clubs have won the exact same number of points in the Premier League (89). Liverpool and Manchester United have drawn three consecutive league meetings for the first time since 1921. Manchester United have equalled their best points tally after the first eight matches of a Premier League season (20 points) also in the 11/12 & 99/00 Man Utd have kept a clean sheet in nine of their last 10 league games. Indeed, the Red Devils have recorded 18 clean sheets in the Premier League in 2017, the most in the competition. The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"I think the performance was worth three points. We were the better side. I think Man United came here for the point and they got it. We wanted three points and didn't get it. I'm sure if we played like this, you could not do this at Liverpool. Obviously for Man United it is OK. It's quite difficult when a top-class team like Man United has that defensive approach. You're not going to get 20 chances. But we had enough, a big one in the first half, and a penalty I feel, we were unlucky.\" Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp felt his side deserved three points after being the more active side in their 0-0 draw with Manchester United. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp felt his side deserved three points after being the more active side in their 0-0 draw with Manchester United. Jose Mourinho: \"They played 90 minutes with (Emre) Can, (Jordan) Henderson and (Georginio) Wijnaldum and I thought playing at home, seven points behind us, they are going to change. They never did. They changed man-for-man in attack. They kept their three midfield players in the centre of the pitch and I had no chance to answer. I only had two midfield players and had no one else to compensate that. I had no chance to bring the game in another direction so I think it is a positive point for us.\" Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho felt his side lacked power and energy in the midfield and bemoaned a lack of options from the bench after their 0-0 draw at Liverpool.

85th-minute header salvaged a 1-1 draw for Burnley against 10-man West Ham at Turf Moor on Saturday. Michail Antonio gave West Ham the lead after 19 minutes, with the former Nottingham Forest man latching onto Joe Hart's long ball and rounding Nick Pope to score. But Andy Carroll was sent off for two bookings in quick succession 10 minutes later, and Burnley's pressure finally told late on as Wood met Johann Gudmundsson's cross. Burnley remain in the top six despite failing once more to replicate their away form, while West Ham rise two places to 14th, above Brighton and Stoke City. Player ratings Burnley: Pope (6), Lowton (6), Ward (7), Tarkowski (6), Mee (6), Brady (7), Cork (6), Hendrick (6), Defour (8), Arfield (6), Wood (7) Subs: Gudmundsson (8),Vokes (7), Barnes (6) West Ham: Hart (7), Zabaleta (6), Cresswell (6), Fonte (7), Reid (7), Kouyate (6), Arnautovic (6), Lanzini (7), Antonio (7), Chicharito (6), Carroll (5) Subs: Obiang (7), Sakho (6), Masuaku (n/a) Man of the match: Steven Defour (Burnley) Sean Dyche's side looked like having more trouble on their own turf again after Antonio capitalised on poor defending from Ben Mee to break the deadlock. The versatile forward took full advantage of the centre-back's failed clearance to round Pope with ease before slotting his first goal of the season. Team news Sean Dyche named an unchanged side for the visit of the Hammers, with the same XI that beat Everton. West Ham made two changes with Marko Arnautovic coming in for Mark Noble and Manuel Lanzini replacing Andre Ayew. But West Ham's fine start was derailed in two minutes of madness from Carroll. First, he caught James Tarkowski with the point of his elbow, and he showed his frustrations moments later as he jumped into Mee, leaving referee Stuart Attwell with little option but to brandish a second yellow before a red. But the Hammers began the second period in positive fashion, with Manuel Lanzini's ball into the box inches away from the foot of Antonio, before the goalscorer nearly doubled his account when his shot was saved by Pope following excellent link-up play between Javier Hernandez and Lanzini. Burnley had shown very little, but they were mightily close to levelling after 63 minutes as Gudmundsson cut inside Aaron Cresswell before firing a left-foot shot against the post and back into the arms of Hart after the ball hit his back. Just when it seemed the Londoners had absorbed the best of Burnley's efforts, the Icelandic vindicated his introduction at the break as he found space to produce the perfect delivery for Wood to plant his header into the bottom corner. Opta Stats Burnley have gone six top-flight games without defeat for the first time since February 1975. Since Slaven Bilic took over at West Ham, the Hammers have picked up 12 red cards in the PL, three more than any other side. There were just 99 seconds between Andy Carroll's first yellow card and his second. Joe Hart is the 51st goalkeeper to provide an assist in the Premier League. The managers Sean Dyche (Burnley): \"It's a definite sending off just because it's the laws of the game. I'm not bothered about players putting themselves about, I quite like it. I think the game is missing that, actually. But it is a definite sending off. \"They're two yellows, but I think the second one possibly was a straight red. I haven't seen it back, but I just felt it was a real big challenge from a distance, jumping in. But I must make it clear, I'm not overly against the physicality in the game. I still think there's a place for it, but if it goes too far then it has to be dealt with, as it was today.\" Burnley boss Sean Dyche says Andy Carroll's two challenges definitely warranted two yellow cards Burnley boss Sean Dyche says Andy Carroll's two challenges definitely warranted two yellow cards Slaven Bilic (West Ham): \"Of course I'm angry [with Carroll]. He's a very experienced player. It wasn't deliberate but a player of his experience, you cannot do that two times in a couple of minutes - especially when you play away it's very likely you're going to get minimum a yellow card. \"That's what happened very early in the game, and after that we knew it was going to be very hard, but we defended well and we were so close to getting all three points.\" West Ham boss Slaven Bilic says a player of Andy Carroll's experience should know better, but insists neither of his elbows were deliberate after he was sent off in their draw at Burnley.

Man of the Match - Steven Defour The Belgium playmaker was behind all of the hosts' creativity as they rescued a late point. Defour's delicious ball into the box very nearly brought an equaliser sooner, but Matt Lowton was just unable to meet his cross. The 29-year-old was instrumental in galvansing his side when faced with defeat and it is not the first time this season the midfielder has been the best player on the pitch for the Clarets.

Wilfried Zaha's first-half strike earned Roy Hodgson his first victory as Crystal Palace boss as his side deservedly beat Chelsea 2-1 on Saturday. Making his first start since suffering a knee injury against Huddersfield on the opening day of the season, Zaha's smart finish on the stroke of half-time proved to be the winner at Selhurst Park. Cesar Azpilicueta's own goal (11) ended Palace's 731-minute wait for a first league goal of the campaign but Tiemoue Bakaoyko swiftly equalised with a header (18) before Zaha's decisive intervention (45). Yohan Cabaye's deflected touch opened the scoring at Selhurst Park The victory earns Palace their first points of the season, ending a seven-match losing run, while Chelsea have now lost back-to-back league matches and find themselves nine points off league leaders Manchester City. The home side started well and did not have to wait long to break their goal drought as Azpilicueta turned into his own net from Yohan Cabaye's touch.

A difficult afternoon for Chelsea was compounded by an early exit for Victor Moses, who appeared to suffer a hamstring injury midway through the first half. The expected second-half surge from the visitors failed to properly materialise although Cesc Fabregas did clip the crossbar with a fine long-range effort. Team news Both teams made four changes from their defeats before the international break, with Wilfried Zaha making his return from a knee injury for Palace. Injuries to N'Golo Kante and Alvaro Morata meant opportunities for Willian and Michy Batshuayi for the visitors. Antonio Conte introduced Pedro and Charly Musonda, who criticised Chelsea earlier in this week for a perceived lack of first-team opportunities, but the away side could not break down a stubborn Palace defence. Musonda sliced over and Fabregas dragged an effort wide after an ill-advised back-heel by Mamadou Sakho but the best chance of the second period fell to Palace. Patrick van Aanholt was left head in hands after firing wide from close range but his late miss did not cost the Eagles as they held on for a precious victory. Tiemoue Bakayoko rises highest to equalise for Chelsea Opta stats Crystal Palace scored their first goal in 731 minutes of Premier League action. Antonio Conte has lost three of his first eight league games in a campaign for the first time since 2009-10 when taking over at Atalanta (in September 2009) in Serie A (also three losses). Since joining Chelsea in August 2014, Cesc Fabregas has recorded 38 assists; more than any other Premier League player. Pundit view Charlie Nicholas: \"I don't know where this has come from for Crystal Palace. Roy has obviously been working really hard to get Zaha fit and Speroni is back in contention. \"They had one setback when they let in a goal for 1-1 but other than that they were bang at it. Zaha was outstanding and Andros Townsend… wow. \"He found the big performance he doesn't find often enough. He was absolutely fantastic.\" Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson says his players deserve to drink in their win after beating Chelsea in the Premier League. Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson says his players deserve to drink in their win after beating Chelsea in the Premier League. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"It was really enjoyable. I have just told the players they really deserve to drink in that victory, we were playing the champions of England, a team with fantastic quality. \"I thought we came off the field deserving our victory, we created lots of chances and I thought our defending was good from the first minute.\" Antonio Conte: \"We started very badly and it was very difficult. Also we need to understand the situation and to continue to work to find the right solution despite the injuries. They are big losses for us but we have to accept the situation and try to do our best. \"This [injury to Victor Moses] is another bad situation. We have to check tomorrow with the medical staff. But for sure it is another loss, a big loss for us. You know very well the importance of this player to our team.\" Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says it is difficult with three key players injured Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says it is difficult with three key players injured Man of the match - Wilfried Zaha Palace's dismal start to the season was expected to continue against the defending champions but Zaha's return galvanised his team-mates. The Ivory Coast international was superb and tormented Chelsea's defence all afternoon, alongside the impressive Andros Townsend. Zaha's first league goal of the season was a fair reward for a stand-out display full of technical quality and high on work rate. What next? Hodgson's Palace will look to build on Saturday's result when they travel to Newcastle next weekend.

Stoke fought back with two goals either side of half-time as Mame Biram Diouf (44) scored ahead of the break, and the striker was involved again as a Kyle Walker own goal (47) made it 3-2 shortly after the restart.

Stoke denied their hosts a clean sheet and had them worried for a while as they scored their goals either side of half-time. Diouf slotted home from a Jese cut-back with a minute of the first half to play, and then saw his header deflect off the thigh of Walker two minutes after the restart to pull the scoreline back to 3-2. Mame Biram Diouf scored the first goal for Stoke on Saturday But Man City raced away with the game in the reminder of the second half and scored three goals in six minutes to put themselves out of sight. Jesus added his second in the 56th minute, finding himself almost unmarked in the middle of the box as he powered home a De Bruyne cross. Fernandinho scored the goal of the afternoon as he thundered the ball past Jack Butland via the underside of the crossbar from just outside the box on the hour mark, before Sane added another two minutes later, directing home a superb De Bruyne pass at the back post. Fernandinho scored the goal of the afternoon on the hour mark And there was more to come as Bernardo Silva completed the seven-goal haul in the 79th minute, simply tapping home after a Sterling lay-off to round off a dazzling performance from Manchester City. Opta stats Man City are the first English top-flight team to score 29 goals in their first eight league games of the season since Everton in 1894-95 (30). This was the second time Stoke have shipped seven goals in a Premier League game, also conceding seven versus Chelsea in April 2010. Gabriel Jesus celebrates scoring Manchester City's fourth goal against Stoke Raheem Sterling has scored six goals in his last six Premier League games, more than in his previous 31 combined (5). Kyle Walker has provided three assists for Man City in the PL this season; no Man City defender made more than one PL assist in 2016-17. The managers Pep Guardiola: \"I enjoyed it like all our fans so we are so happy for the victory and the way we played. This season we have played in many good games, like last time at Stamford Bridge, but today we played better most of the time. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says their win over Stoke was the first time since his arrival that the team played well for the full 90 minutes Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says their win over Stoke was the first time since his arrival that the team played well for the full 90 minutes \"Sometimes we play well for 30 or 45 minutes but today, it was the first time since I've been here that we played well for a long time, except for the last minute of the first half and the beginning of the second.\" Mark Hughes: \"It was difficult from our point of view clearly. You don't want to concede the amount of goals we did although some of them were top class and with De Bruyne, you've got a genuine, world-class player in their ranks. Mark Hughes says his side found it very difficult at the Etihad and admitted that the Man City players were on a different level, especially Kevin De Bruyne Mark Hughes says his side found it very difficult at the Etihad and admitted that the Man City players were on a different level, especially Kevin De Bruyne \"We found it very difficult to stop his influence on the game and he was a big factor in them being able to take the game away from us. We got back into the game at 3-2, although if we're honest, I think it flattered us at 3-2 but very quickly, we made a few mistakes and they took the game away from us. In the end, we were grateful for the referee's whistle.\" The pundit Paul Merson: \"I don't know how you stop them. Someone like Jose Mourinho will set up tight against them because they were great today, but they did let in two goals if you want to nit-pick. Paul Merson says Man City played unbelievably during their 7-2 thrashing of Stoke and admits he is unsure how anyone can stop Pep Guardiola’s side Paul Merson says Man City played unbelievably during their 7-2 thrashing of Stoke and admits he is unsure how anyone can stop Pep Guardiola’s side \"But it's all about their movement. I can't remember anyone passing the ball and then standing still. They are all over the place. Some teams are like Subbuteo - they kick off and at half-time they are all in the same positions - but these players go everywhere. \"You felt sorry for Stoke because they just couldn't live with them. That was the standard. I feel embarrassed that I didn't pay to watch it.\" Man of the match - Kevin de Bruyne Where do you start with De Bruyne's performance on Saturday? It was nothing short of world-class, and he was involved in virtually all the goals - apart from the final strike from Bernardo Silva after he had been substituted - on what was his 100th appearance for the club. 32 - Since his Man City debut in September 2015, Kevin De Bruyne has provided 32 assists in the PL, more than any other player.

His talent is clear and he is an exciting player to watch each time he steps onto the field. Man City captain David Silva scored the third goal of the afternoon What next?

Abraham scored twice as Swansea registered their first three points at home this season with a 2-0 victory over Huddersfield. Though they started the brighter, the Swans allowed their opponents space to play for much of the first half until they took the lead when Abraham slotted home Tom Carroll's cut-back after Jonas Lossl's poor clearance (42). Australia international Aaron Mooy was introduced for the second half, but he inadvertently set up Swansea's second when he dispossessed Luciano Narsingh and the ball fell to Jordan Ayew, with Abraham ensuring the Ghanaian's dink crossed the line (48). The result means Swansea now sit 13th in the Premier League standings, just a point behind the Terriers, who continue their slide down the table. Player ratings Home Team: Fabianski (5), Naughton (6), Fernandez (5), Mawson (6), Olsson (6), Fer (7), Britton (6), Carroll (7), Narsingh (6), Ayew (7), Abraham (8) Subs: Dyer (4), Ki (5), Clucas (N/A) Away Team: Lossl (4), Smith (5), Jorgensen (4), Schindler (6), Malone (5), Billing (5), Hogg (6), Kachunga (6), Van La Parra (6), Ince (5), Depoitre (4) Subs: Mooy (6), Lowe (N/A), Williams (4) Man of the match: Tammy Abraham Swansea flew out of the blocks in the first top-flight meeting between the pair and looked like they might catch the Terriers out early on with a number of bright forays down the right flank. But Huddersfield grew into the game after being initially startled and though Tom Ince blazed over, he had a great chance to open the scoring when he met Rajiv van La Parra's teasing cross from the left after 27 minutes. Abraham grabbed his second after Jordan Ayew's dink Referee Paul Tierney had a vital call to make four minutes later when Ince appeared to be brought down inside the area by Martin Olsson as he raced onto a lengthy delivery from Lossl, but the visitors' appeals were immediately waved away. Paul Clement's men held off their opponents as the half progressed, but capitalised on a mistake from goalkeeper Lossl to take the lead - against the run of play - through Abraham three minutes before half-time. Team news Swansea pair Wilfried Bony (hamstring) and Renato Sanches (thigh) both picked up injuries on international duty and were replaced by Leroy Fer and Luciano Narsingh. Scott Malone made his first Premier League start in place of Chris Lowe, while Aaron Mooy settled for a place on the bench following his exploits in Australia's World Cup play-off win against Syria in midweek. A poor delivery in the direction of Mathias Jorgensen was intercepted by Carroll, who cut the ball back into the area towards Ayew, whose dummy gave Abraham the opportunity to slot home his third league goal of the season. Wagner introduced his trump card - Mooy - at the break, but despite an energetic start to the half, it was the Australian who unintentionally created the second three minutes after the break. Tracking back the length of the pitch, Mooy made an important challenge to dispossess Narsingh but the ball fell to the feet of Ayew, who chipped over Lossl, leaving Abraham to tap in for claim Swansea's second. Ayew played an instrumental role in the second goal The returning Ki Sung-yeung almost made it three when he shifted his weight and arrowed a low shot just wide of Lossl's post and the day got better for Swans fans as Nathan Dyer made his comeback from an Achilles injury that had sidelined him since February. But there was no way back into the game for Huddersfield, who have now scored just one goal in their last six and are without a win since August 20. The managers Swansea boss Paul Clement was pleased with his side's attacking threat and praised Tammy Abraham after their 2-0 win over Huddersfield. Swansea boss Paul Clement was pleased with his side's attacking threat and praised Tammy Abraham after their 2-0 win over Huddersfield. Paul Clement: \"It was a very important game, we knew that after the start that we've had and particularly with the start we've had at home. So we wanted to put a good performance in today for our supporters who really got behind the team. \"I'm most pleased about the performance that the players put in. We've been defending reasonably well and that's four clean sheets out of eight which is a good standard. But we hadn't really hit the ground running with our offensive play. \"We got our first goal from some misfortune but that came from our aggressive pressurising which we did throughout the game. It wasn't luck because we studied Huddersfield in lots of detail. They are a team who play out from the back and there is a certain risk associated with that and we practiced those situations. It didn't happen in the first 42-43 minutes, but we kept at it and I have to say that we forced that error. Huddersfield boss David Wagner says his side needs to be braver and cut out the avoidable mistakes following defeat at Swansea. Huddersfield boss David Wagner says his side needs to be braver and cut out the avoidable mistakes following defeat at Swansea. David Wagner: \"First half [we were] not good enough, not brave enough - I think bravery was a big problem for us in the first half. And, as everybody has seen, there were a lot of situations against us - the Tom Ince situation where it could be a penalty or a free-kick. I think you could [blow the] whistle, I've seen red cards for these situations. \"We had probably biggest chance in the first half from Tom Ince as well. We were not brave enough in the first half and we didn't have the luck in the second. I think we created moments, we hit the bar and had a number of dangerous situations in the six yard box, but unfortunately we were not able to score. \"I think it was a great tackle from Aaron Mooy, but unfortunately he tackled the ball into Ayew's feet - it was a very good finish. But this is exactly the situations that I meant - you have to invest in bravery if you like to be lucky.\" Man of the match - Tammy Abraham Two real poacher's chances grabbed by the scruff of the neck and converted by Tammy Abraham today. In the right place at the right time on both occasions, the Chelsea youngster impressed as he took his league tally to four. The striker put his defensive qualities on show a number of times, too and once again proved that he can cope with the step up from the Championship with his maiden Premier League brace. A real asset to Paul Clement. The pundit - Phil Thompson \"I like people playing football but you don't take risks; the ball has come back to Lossl and he's tried to side-foot it out. There hadn't been a great deal in the match at that point but probably Swansea had been the best. It's such a downer for Huddersfield and at this moment in time, they can do without that. \"They did have a couple of chances through Ince and Van La Parra but other than that Lukasz Fabianski didn't have a lot to do. \"It was a thoroughly deserved win by Swansea, with some good players all round. Abraham did nick the goal, but I think he's right to do that - he's a poacher.\" Opta stats Swansea have enjoyed consecutive league wins over Huddersfield for the first time since August 1993, and after drawing one and losing five of the previous six. Huddersfield have failed to score in four consecutive games in all competitions for the first time since August 2004. Abraham scored as many goals against Huddersfield (2) as he had in his previous nine league games. Carroll registered his first Premier League assist in 19 games, since March (v Burnley). Since his debut for Swansea in February, Jordan Ayew has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other current Swans player (2 goals, 4 assists). The Terriers are without a win in six league games (D3 L3) for the first time since November 2015. Swansea enjoyed their first top-flight win in five games, and have scored exactly two goals in each of their last four Premier League victories. What's next?

Watch highlights of Tottenham 1-0 Bournemouth Watch highlights of Tottenham 1-0 Bournemouth Christian Eriksen's early second-half strike fired Tottenham to their first Premier League win at Wembley with a 1-0 victory against a spirited Bournemouth side. Eriksen's (47) third goal in the Premier League this season ensured Tottenham emerged victorious against Eddie Howe's men, who were defensively solid for most of the match. Harry Kane had two glorious chances to put Spurs further ahead in the second half, but Bournemouth were able to limit the hosts to just the one goal as their away troubles continue. Victory for Tottenham places them four points ahead of rivals Chelsea in third, while Bournemouth drop down to 19th after their fourth consecutive loss on the road.

On the counter-attack, Junior Stanislas' first-time shot was blocked by Davinson Sanchez shortly before a dangerous corner forced Hugo Lloris into a reflex save to prevent Eric Dier from scoring an own goal. Bournemouth put in a spirited display against Spurs Tottenham struggled to break down Bournemouth's compact defence but their best chance of the half arrived to Kane, who met Eriksen's curling pass around the Cherries defence but his scuffed shot was parried away by Asmir Begovic. Mauricio Pochettino's side improved drastically in the second half with Eriksen scoring the opener in the 47th minute. The Denmark international jinked past Steve Cook with ease before slotting home. Team news Ben Davies missed out with illness and Danny Rose hadn't recovered from his knee injury, meaning Heung-Min Son entered the starting XI. For Bournemouth, Dan Gosling and Steve Cook entered the team for Marc Pugh and Jermain Defoe, who both dropped to the bench. Begovic was called into action to make a superb double save against Kane on the hour mark as Spurs continued to apply the pressure, but neither of the England striker's close-range attempts could beat the experienced Bosnia international. Jordon Ibe and Jermain Defoe almost made an instant impact in the 75th minute as Ibe played a lovely reverse pass through to former Spurs striker, but his low strike was saved by Lloris' trailing foot at the near post. Begovic was called into action twice in the final 15 minutes. First he denied Eriksen from the edge of the box before coming out to tackle Georges-Kevin N'Koudou on the edge of the box in the final minute, but Spurs held on for a significant victory. Man of the match - Asmir Begovic Asmir Begovic pulled off a number of crucial saves for Bournemouth against Tottenham Bournemouth may have lost in the Premier League again, but the scoreline could have been far worse if not for the goalkeeping heroics of Begovic. The former Stoke and Chelsea goalkeeper made five crucial saves in the contest, and also showed great bravery to deny Georges-Kevin N'Koudou a late second goal in injury time. Opta stats Tottenham finally recorded a home league win in 2017/18, after drawing two and losing one of their previous three this season. Bournemouth directed just one shot on target in the game, something they last managed in a Premier League match last April, against Spurs. Christian Eriksen has scored three goals in his last five Premier League games, as many as in his previous 24. Harry Kane has failed to score in his first four home Premier League games of the season, despite scoring six goals overall. The only other player to do this was Alan Shearer in 93/94.

Arsenal had appeared on course for all three points after taking the lead six minutes before the interval when Per Mertesacker, making his first start for 18 months in place of the injured Shkodran Mustafi, headed in Granit Xhaka's corner. However, the home side drew level in controversial circumstances when Richarlison went over in the box under Hector Bellerin's challenge, with Deeney smashing home the resulting spot kick. Marco Silva's side then recorded their first home win of the season when Cleverley fired home in stoppage time after a mad scramble in the box, a result that sees Arsenal fall to sixth. Team news Watford made three changes from the side that drew 2-2 at West Brom last time out with Britos, Pereyra and Gray coming in for Capoue, Carrillo and Deeney. Arsenal were without Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey, but they did have Laurent Koscielny, Sead Kolasinac and Danny Welbeck all available, while captain Per Mertesacker made his first Premier League start for 532 days. In a drab first period with few real openings for either side, it was Arsene Wenger's team who took the lead through an unexpected source. From Arsenal's first corner of the game, Xhaka swung the ball in from the right and Mertesacker rose above Cleverley to head in his first league goal since December 2013, as well as the visitors' first league strike on the road this season. Watford failed to muster a single shot on target in the first 45 minutes, but the home side went more direct after the break, and they were rewarded for their change of style. Watford's Troy Deeney celebrates after equalising at Vicarage Road Heurelho Gomes produced vital saves to deny Alex Iwobi and substitute Mesut Ozil in quick succession, with Watford equalising moments after the latter. Richarlison's surging run into the box was ended by Bellerin, but despite there being no contact, referee Neil Swarbrick still pointed to the spot, with substitute Deeney doing the rest for his first league goal in 14 games. The Brazilian, though, could now be subject to a two-match ban if the newly formed disciplinary committee deem the forward had dived to earn his side the penalty. Etienne Capoue then hit the post before Watford completed a remarkable turnaround when Cleverley found himself in the right place to coolly fire home after a series of ricochets, the midfielder's first goal for the club since his loan spell in 2009/10.

It's important, I didn't see a dive or a simulation.Richarlison has suffered the most fouls in the Premier League this season, and people are starting to say he dives.\" Arsene Wenger: \"I believe that we had many, many dangerous situations where we could have scored but didn't. We had opportunities to score the second goal. The decision on the penalty is a bit ridiculous and then we panicked a bit for their second goal and in the end we stand with a defeat.\" Man of the Match: Tom Cleverley The midfielder provided a calm presence in the centre of the park for the hosts, using the ball wisely and effectively throughout. And the 13-cap England international then capped off an impressive display by scoring his first goal in a league game for Watford since March 2010, when he netted against Sheffield Wednesday in the second tier.

highlights of Arsenal 2-0 Brighton Goals from Nacho Monreal and Alex Iwobi stretched Arsenal's unbeaten run to seven matches in all competitions in a 2-0 win over Brighton. Monreal's first goal since March 2013 and Iwobi's first of the season helped Arsenal on their way and although Chris Hughton's side put in a spirited performance, with Solly March and Davy Propper coming close in the first half, Arsenal's quality showed in a dominant display. Three points for Arsenal means they jump up to fifth in the Premier League table, while Brighton remain in 14th.

But Arsene Wenger's side did break the deadlock on 16 through Monreal, who placed his attempt into the bottom corner after the ball bounced around the penalty area following three blocked Arsenal shots. Brighton responded brightly after going a goal down. March's 20-yard shot smacked the post before Lewis Dunk fired the rebound wide. Ten minutes later and Lacazette broke through following a sloppy back-pass miscontrolled by Dunk, but the France international's shot was too timid to really trouble Ryan. Team news Rob Holding and Alex Iwobi came into the Arsenal lineup. Laurent Koscielny misses out and Mohamed Elneny drops to the bench. Nine changes overall. Chris Hughton made three changes. Izzy Brown cames in for the suspended Tomer Hemed up top, club-record signing Jose Izquierdo makes his first Premier League start of the season and Gaeten Bong is drafted in to the starting line-up. Anthony Knockaert and Markus Suttner drop to the bench. The Australian goalkeeper was called into action once again shortly before half-time as he smartly used his feet to clear Aaron Ramsey's low strike following a rapid counter-attack. At the other end, Propper curled his effort just wide of Petr Cech's goal from a tight angle. Arsenal began the second half in dominant fashion and Iwobi slotted home in the 56th minute as he latched onto a stunning backheel from Sanchez. The Chile international almost piled on the misery moments later but his shot was cleared off the line by Dunk, who then smothered Lacazette's shot with a perfectly-timed block in the 67th minute. Brighton rallied late on with substitute Glenn Murray making an impact off the bench as his vicious header hit the side netting five minutes from time, but Arsenal held on to secure a crucial victory. Man of the Match - Alexis Sanchez Alex Iwobi scored Arsenal's second after a slick move The Chile international put in a fine display against Brighton as he set the tempo for the majority of their attacks. His fine backheel for Iwobi's goal highlighted the quality Arsenal's star winger has, while he was unlucky not to have a goal of his own following Dunk's excellent block off the line. 35 - Since 2016-17, Alexis Sanchez has been involved in 35 PL goals (24 goals 11 assists), more than double any other Arsenal player.

The midfielder finished a flowing, passing move in the 21st minute of the Super Sunday clash to leave Everton in 16th, two points above the relegation zone, ahead of the international break. The win means Burnley have picked up eight away points this season - more than they managed in the whole of the previous campaign - despite playing Chelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool and Everton in those fixtures. However, Koeman - who was tipped for the sack by some of the Sunday newspapers if he lost this game - saw his side suffer their fourth loss in seven Premier League matches so far, despite the second-half introduction of Wayne Rooney from the substitutes' bench. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Baines (5), Keane (5), Williams (4), Martina (5), Schneiderlin (4), Gueye (5), Sigurdsson (5), Niasse (6), Vlasic (4), Calvert-Lewin (6) Subs: Rooney (5), Davies (6), Ramirez (n/a) Burnley: Pope (7), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (8), Mee (7), Ward (8), Cork (7), Hendrick (8), Defour (7), Arfield (7), Brady (7), Wood (7) Subs: Barnes (n/a) Man of the match: James Tarkowski (Burnley) Everton actually started well, Gylfi Sigurdsson shooting straight at Nick Pope with a presentable early chance and Oumar Niasse also forcing a save from the Burnley goalkeeper, before the visitors opened the scoring with a 24-pass move involving nine players. After some tidy build-up play, Stephen Ward cut the ball back to Hendrick near the penalty spot and he took a touch past Morgan Schneiderlin before rifling low past Jordan Pickford. Team news Ronald Koeman sprung a surprise as Oumar Niasse and Dominic Calvert-Lewin started up front with Wayne Rooney dropped to the bench. Michael Keane started against former club Burnley - who were unchanged from last week's draw with Huddersfield. Burnley ended the first half on top and wanted a penalty when Scott Arfield went down under a challenge from Ashley Williams - but the midfielder was correctly booked by referee Jon Moss for simulation. When Niasse headed Everton's first chance of the second half wide of Pope's goal in the 63rd minute, Koeman responded immediately by introducing Rooney for Schneiderlin, before Tom Davies came on to replace the ineffective Nikola Vlasic six minutes later. Jeff Hendrick celebrates scoring But it was Burnley who carved out the best chance of the second half, as Pickford was forced to block Robbie Brady's cross across the six-yard box with Chris Wood hoping for a tap-in. And despite long-range efforts from both Rooney and Davies in the closing stages - and an injury-time penalty appeal which struck the chest, rather than hand, of Matt Lowton - they rarely looked like scoring and the home fans booed the players off the pitch. Opta stats Everton have already lost as many league games at Goodison Park this term as they did in the whole of Koeman's first season at the club (2 in 2016/17). There were 24 passes in the build-up to Burnley's opener; the second-most for a Premier League goal in 2017/18 (after Fabian Delph v Crystal Palace - 31). Hendrick's goal also featured the most passes in the build-up of any Burnley goal in Premier League history (24). Burnley pair James Tarkowski and Ben Mee have made more blocks between them (30) than 16 of the other 19 Premier League teams this season. The managers Ronald Koeman (Everton): \"We started the game really well, we played aggressive, we were playing a total game and the better team. The first shot on target is a goal for Burnley. If you analyse the Burnley team it then becomes really difficult. You have a lot of possession but they are strong and organised defensively. You need to be at your best.\" Ronald Koeman understands Everton fans are disappointed but insists they can't complain about his players' attitude Ronald Koeman understands Everton fans are disappointed but insists they can't complain about his players' attitude Sean Dyche (Burnley): \"I know there is a bit of noise about how they are playing and their tricky start but they have some very good players. We didn't come here thinking remotely it would be an easy game and I thought our lads dealt with that very well. We had a bit of a soft start but we grew into the game and scored a great goal. It was a fantastic bit of play. We can play when we need to and I think we can play longer and stronger when we have to as well.\" Sean Dyche praises his defensive pairing of Ben Mee and James Tarkowski Sean Dyche praises his defensive pairing of Ben Mee and James Tarkowski Man of the Match - James Tarkowski Many may have feared for Burnley defensively when Michael Keane left for Everton over the summer, but 24-year-old James Tarkowski has filled the void superbly. Not only is he an ultra-reliable defender - he made 12 clearances, four tackles and three blocks in the game - but his passing statistics were superior to any of his team-mates. Sky Sports co-commentator Andy Hinchcliffe said: \"It has to be James Tarkowski. Michael Keane's departure gave him a chance and he really has taken it. It's been an outstanding, individual defensive display. He was rock-solid, giving Burnley a defensive platform and that's exactly what you need away from home playing this way.\" Sean Dyche appears to have unearthed another gem. What's next? After the international break, Everton travel to Brighton on Sunday October 15, while Burnley are next in action 24 hours earlier at home to West Ham."}, {"date": "01/10/2018", "arena": "St James'

Newcastle and Liverpool in the Premier League Watch highlights of the 1-1 draw between Newcastle and Liverpool in the Premier League Liverpool have now won just one of their last seven games as Rafa Benitez's Newcastle frustrated them in a 1-1 draw on Super Sunday. In what was being billed as the 'Benitez Derby' - played in a unique atmosphere of both sets of fans singing Benitez's name at St James' Park - Philippe Coutinho's stunning opener was cancelled out by Joselu. After seven games, Jurgen Klopp's men are already seven points off the two Manchester clubs at the top of the Premier League table, while Benitez remains unbeaten in five matches against his former employers. It was the visitors that made the early running, with Georginio Wijnaldum striking the post following a corner. Player ratings Newcastle: Elliot (7), Clark (7), Lascelles (7), Yedlin (7), Manquillo (6), Shelvey (7), Ritchie (8), Perez (6), Merino (6), Atsu (6), Joselu (6) Subs: Hayden (6), Gayle (6), Diame (6) Liverpool: Mignolet (6), Gomez (6), Matip (6), Lovren (6), Moreno (6), Wijnaldum (6), Henderson (6), Coutinho (7), Salah (6), Mane (6), Sturridge (6) Subs: Solanke (6), Firmino (6), Oxlade-Chamberlain (6) Man of the match: Matt Ritchie Coutinho, who was playing a deeper central role, struck the spectacular opener on 29 minutes. He was given far too much room by the Toon midfield and from 30 yards out curled home the sweetest of strikes, which left Rob Elliot clutching at thin air. Liverpool had conceded 10 goals away from home already this season and that figure became 11 on 36 minutes when Jonjo Shelvey's pass released Joselu through the middle. The striker dallied which allowed Joel Matip to get back - however, the Liverpool defender's tackle resulted in the ball bouncing off Joselu and spinning rather fortuitously into the net. Team news Rafa Benitez made two changes to the side that lost 1-0 to Brighton last weekend with Javi Manquillo and Jonjo Shelvey coming in. There were two changes as well from Jurgen Klopp from last weekend’s dramatic win against Leicester as Sadio Mane and Daniel Sturridge were handed starts. The second half was mostly played in Newcastle's half as the visitors dominated the ball. Daniel Sturridge was denied his 100th club goal by Elliot just after the break, and Mohamed Salah blazed the rebound over. For all their possession though, Liverpool failed to create much as - like in midweek against Spartak Moscow - their final pass or shot was distinctively lacklustre, typified by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's late chance which he headed over from close range. Opta stats Joselu scored the equaliser for Newcastle against Liverpool Newcastle have only lost once at St James' Park in the Premier League under Benitez (W5 D3). Coutinho has scored 17 goals from outside the box in the Premier League - three more than any other player since his debut in February 2013. Joselu is yet to lose a Premier League game in which he has scored (W5 D1). The managers Rafa Benitez: \"I liked the way they were working, the understanding of what we needed to do and against a good team. I was really pleased to play this type of game as when you see where Liverpool is now, the fantastic support that they have, the quality of the squad, a great manager... a lot of things you can see from them are positive.\" Rafael Benitez says it is important for his Newcastle side to believe they can compete against teams with as much quality as Liverpool Rafael Benitez says it is important for his Newcastle side to believe they can compete against teams with as much quality as Liverpool Jurgen Klopp: \"As you can imagine, it is not the nicest moment. We create and create and we made one mistake - a real mistake - and we got punished for it. I think the opponent made a lot more mistakes that were forced by us and did not get punished for it. \"At the end, the man of the match is from Newcastle and we have 80% possession or whatever it was. That's the situation and that's how the world looks on it and we just have to carry on. It's what we do.\" Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool made one mistake and got punished for it in their 1-1 draw at Newcastle Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool made one mistake and got punished for it in their 1-1 draw at Newcastle The pundit Jamie Carragher: \"I said last week on Monday Night Football that Liverpool's centre-backs are never switched on. As soon as that ball is lost, you have to think about what Shelvey is going to do - he'll probably play it forward - and get in position early. A lack of concentration has cost Liverpool again.\" Graeme Souness: \"When you're in such a good passing team as Liverpool are, for the people at the back, when the ball goes into midfield and beyond, they start to admire the game. They start watching rather than noticing the centre-forward drifting off them. [Newcastle's equaliser] was a classic case in point.\" Daniel Sturridge vies with Javier Manquillo (R) Man of the match - Matt Ritchie The Scotland winger has four assists in his last four appearances coming into this game, but it was his discipline without the ball that stood him out from the crowd here. He epitomised Newcastle's organisation - especially in the second period - with a defensive display to restrict Liverpool's play down their left flank. It was no surprise to note he covered 10.7km - more than any other player. What's next? Newcastle are back on Super Sunday in a fortnight's time with a visit to Southampton, while Liverpool welcome Manchester United for the Saturday lunchtime game (October 14), which is also live on Sky

Premier League at the John Smith's Stadium on Saturday. Two trademark strikes gave Kane his 10th and 11th goals of the season in the first half, coming either side of Ben Davies' cool finish after a superb Spurs team move. Substitute Moussa Sissoko rounded off the win in stoppage time, bundling the ball home via the boot of Christopher Schindler. Kane curls in his second goal at the John Smiths Stadium Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (5), Smith (5), Jorgensen (5), Schindler (5), Lowe (4), Mooy (5), Hogg (5), Kachunga (5), Ince (5), Van La Parra (6), Depoitre (5) Subs: Malone (6), Billing (5), Whitehead (NA) Tottenham: Lloris (7), Trippier (7), Alderweireld (7), Vertonghen (7), Sanchez (7), Davies (8), Dier (7), Winks (7), Eriksen (7), Alli (6), Kane (9) Subs: Sissoko (7), Walker-Peters (NA), Son (NA) Man of the match: Harry Kane The result continues Spurs' fine away form this season having won every game, while Huddersfield are without a win in five Premier League matches. Kane took just nine minutes to have an impact, latching onto Kieran Trippier's long header behind the defence before slotting into the bottom right corner. It was 2-0 just seven minutes later through Davies, who finished neatly from the left of the box as Jonas Lossl rushed out after Christian Eriksen's break forward had then fallen fortuitously to the Spurs full-back. Team news Spurs made two changes from the side that beat West Ham last weekend; Kieran Trippier replaced the suspended Serge Aurier, while Harry Winks came in for Moussa Sissoko. Huddersfield made one chnage as Rajiv van La Parra replaced Abdelhamid Sabiri. Ben Davies celebrates after scoring Tottenham's second Lossl nearly embarrassed himself after a miskick had fallen to Kane, rushing to the striker's feet to deny him, but Kane made no mistake from 20 yards moments later, finding the far corner with a fine left-footed strike. Dele Alli then hit the post after Spurs had cut Huddersfield apart again, before Laurent Depoitre hit the bar for the hosts just before half time with a long-range effort. Spurs took their foot off the gas in the second half, though Kane did have a chance to complete his second hat-trick in a week, miscuing from close range after Eric Dier's flick-on from a corner. Alli was booked for diving inside the area later in the half, while Kane was applauded by the entire John Smith's Stadium as he was subbed off late on. Sissoko made it four in the first minute of stoppage time from close range, seeing his effort from Davies' assist come off the boot of Schindler and roll into the net. Kane celebrates scoring his sides first goal with his Tottenham Hotspur team-mates Opta stats Tottenham have won each of their opening four league away games for the first time since 1960/61, when they won their first eight in a row. Spurs have scored 25 goals in their last six Premier League away matches; an average of over four per game (4.2). Harry Kane has scored against 25 of the 26 teams he has faced in the Premier League, only failing to find the back of the net against Cardiff City (two apps, no goals). Harry Kane has netted 13 goals in September 2017 for club and country, the most-ever in a single month by the English striker. The managers David Wagner: \"Today was a result of our mistakes and Tottenham's quality. They are a strong side, without a doubt, and have top quality, especially in the final third. They deserved to win this game. Maybe the result was a little bit high if you see the effort my players gave, but we made it too easy for them to score. The first goal was an individual mistakes where we could have cleared the ball.\" Huddersfield manager David Wagner praised Tottenham's quality in the 4-0 win over his side. Huddersfield manager David Wagner praised Tottenham's quality in the 4-0 win over his side. Mauricio Pochettino: \"We deserved the victory. We were better. Until today they only conceded three goals and we scored four. I speak very highly about my team, we dominated the game. I am so happy with everyone because we played Champions League in Cyprus, arrived late and came here and showed energy. It was a fantastic performance for us.\" Mauricio Pochettino says he is proud of everyone at the club for getting a good result against Huddersfield after their midweek game in Cyprus. Mauricio Pochettino says he is proud of everyone at the club for getting a good result against Huddersfield after their midweek game in Cyprus. The pundit - Gary Neville \"[Kane] is a dream. He is a lad that will never have a bad run. He won't always score goals but he will contribute to the team, he'll be a target man and bring players in to play. He'll become a leader and take on responsibility, you'll see a change in character in him in the next couple of years, which we have started seeing already. \"He has got so much more to come in terms developing his character further, on top of the face he is an absolutely outstanding professional and player.\" Man of the match - Harry Kane Of late, it seems the only debate surrounding Kane is whether he can be considered world class. On this particular afternoon, Kane showed it all. The awareness, the positioning and those trademark finishes. His first was typical Kane - running through on goal, pushing the ball slightly wide to create a gap, and duly finishing. His second was another trademark strike, but this time that snapshot from range we know so well. Co-commentator Davie Provan summed it up well: \"We saw the very best of Harry Kane in the first half, his full repertoire. Most of the adjectives have been used to describe Kane and I cannot think of anymore. He was a joy to watch his centre-forward play.\" What's next Tottenham host Bournemouth in the Premier League after the international break on Saturday, October 14, while Huddersfield go to Swansea on

Bournemouth 0-0 Leicester Bournemouth wasted a glut of chances after being held to a goalless draw by Leicester City at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday. Eddie Howe's side had numerous opportunities to break the deadlock on the south coast, but a combination of poor finishing and a controversial spot kick not given prevented them from securing a deserved three points. Bournemouth will rightly point to that early penalty appeal that was turned down by referee Graham Scott after Danny Simpson handled March Pugh's goal-bound shot, an offence that would have seen the right back sent off. As a result, the point keeps Bournemouth in the relegation zone, while Leicester also remain in trouble - sitting 17th in the Premier League table. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (6), Ake (7), Smith (8), Cook (7), Surman (8), Pugh (9), Daniels (8), Stanislas (7), King (8), Defoe (7) Used subs: Afobe (6), Fraser (7), Ibe (7) Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Simpson (6), Morgan (8), Maguire (6), Fuchs (7), Gray (7), King (5), Ndidi (6), Albrighton (7), Okazaki (6), Vardy (6) Used subs: Iheanacho (6), Iborra (5), Mahrez (6) Man of the match: March Pugh The home side were denied a third-minute penalty after good work down the right wing by Josh King, whose cross was touched on to the bar by Jermain Defoe. However, Pugh was then prevented from converting the rebound by the hand of Danny Simpson, only for referee Mr Scott and his assistant to both miss the clear offence. That was just one of a number of openings Bournemouth created in the first half, with that man Pugh in particular twice going close to breaking the deadlock, only for the midfielder to miss the target when well placed. Bournemouth continued to dominate proceedings after the interval and yet totally against the run of play, it was their opponents who created the best opening on the hour-mark. Team news Bournemouth were without midfielder Harry After due to an Achilles injury, while Leicester striker Jamie Vardy was passed fit despite an ongoing hip problem and Riyad Mahrez was dropped to the bench Marc Albrighton's hopeful ball into the box did not find its intended target Jamie Vardy, but Wes Morgan's clearance fell straight to Shinji Okazaki, but the Japan forward dragged his shot wide of the goal from just six yards out. The hosts continued to press thereafter, although the closest they came to actually scoring was when Andrew Surman's curler beat Kasper Schmeichel, only to just graze the right-hand post. Opta stats Bournemouth are unbeaten in all five Premier League meetings with Leicester City, although four have ended level (W1 D4 L0) Leicester City have won just five points from seven games so far this season, their joint-lowest return at this stage of a Premier League campaign alongside 1994-95, 2001-02 and 2003-04 The Cherries kept their first Premier League clean sheet in 10 matches, since a 1-0 win over Sunderland in April Leicester have won just once in their last 10 Premier League matches under Craig Shakespeare (W1 D3 L6), this after winning seven of the first 10 under his stewardship Jermain Defoe (29) had fewer touches of the ball than any other Bournemouth outfield player to start this match - he wasn't able to hit the target with a shot, either Bournemouth have won just four points from their seven Premier League games this term, fewer than in both 2015-16 (7) and 2016-17 (8) at this stage of the season Charlie Daniels (left) and Danny Simpson battle for possession Managers Eddie Howe: \"I had no view at the time, I just saw that the shot had been blocked. I have only seen replays just a second ago and it looks a clear-cut handball. \"But I am sure from the referee's perspective he did not see it, otherwise he would have given it. \"The linesman is on the other side, so you hope that someone could see it out of the four of them with the fourth official as well, but it was not to be from our perspective. \"We cannot look at that one incident, we had enough chances to win plenty of games there today and that is the really positive thing. I always say that if we are creating the chances, I think we have the quality to take them on another day.\" Eddie Howe was disappointed that Bournemouth didn’t take their chances in their 0-0 draw with Leicester Eddie Howe was disappointed that Bournemouth didn’t take their chances in their 0-0 draw with Leicester Craig Shakespeare: \"I have to be realistic. We did not start as well as I wanted to, but give Bournemouth credit for that - they played on the front foot right from the start and we could not play our usual offensive, front-foot game and break down Bournemouth. \"And we had to show a lot of resilience today because they attacked and attacked and to come away with a clean sheet shows the resilience of the back five, but also the players in front of them because we had to sit deep and have that low block at times. \"So we could not quite hurt them offensively. But to come away with a point when you have not played well, people will tell you that is a good starting point. \"We know we want to put more points on the board and we now have a home game to come.\" Craig Shakespeare says Leicester showed resilience to keep a clean sheet in their 0-0 draw at Bournemouth Craig Shakespeare says Leicester showed resilience to keep a clean sheet in their 0-0 draw at Bournemouth Man of the Match: Marc Pugh The tireless Pugh was outstanding until being replaced with 21 minutes left to play. The Bournemouth winger was firstly denied an early goal after the officials failed to spot that Simpson had diverted his goal-bound effort with the use of a hand. And the 30-year-old also twice went close to scoring with low drives before the interval, only to pull his efforts wide of the goal. What's next? Bournemouth travel to Wembley Stadium on Saturday October 14 to take on in-form Tottenham Hotspur when the Premier League returns after the international break.

over Crystal Palace Marouane Fellaini scored twice as Manchester United eased to a 4-0 victory over struggling Crystal Palace on Saturday. Juan Mata gave United the lead after just three minutes at Old Trafford before Fellaini finished from close range either side of half-time. Romelu Lukaku completed the scoring late on as United secured their fourth 4-0 win of the season. Injury-hit Palace, who were without a recognised striker in the absence of Christian Benteke, rarely threatened to score their first Premier League goal of the campaign, let alone pick up their first point. Defeat leaves them rooted to the foot of the table and in desperate need of a change of fortunes after the upcoming international break. United, meanwhile, move top with victory; their sixth from seven Premier League matches. Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Young (7), Jones (6), Smalling (6), Valencia (7), Fellaini (8), Matic (6), Mata (7), Rashford (8), Mkhitaryan (6), Lukaku (7) Subs: Martial (6), Lingard (6), Herrera (6) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (5), Ward (4), Sakho (5), Delaney (4), Van Aanholt (4), Milivojevic (4), Cabaye (5), Schlupp (4), Townsend (4), Puncheon (4), Sako (5) Subs: McArthur (5), Ladapo (5), Riedewald (5) Man of the match: Marouane Fellaini United took just three minutes to score the opener, with Rashford turning away from Joel Ward in the left corner and crossing for Mata to finish from the penalty spot. That did not, though, immediately open the floodgates as Palace largely kept United at bay and also occasionally threatened, with Mamadou Sakho heading over and Bakary Sako seeing a powerful strike saved. Lukaku (R) celebrates scoring United's fourth goal But United always looked in control of the game and Fellaini tapped in a cross from Ashley Young in the 35th minute before Chris Smalling headed wide from a corner and Henrikh Mkhitaryan blazed a volley over. Any doubts over the result were put beyond doubt shortly after half-time as Fellaini headed in from Rashford's free-kick. Team news Jones and Fellaini started for United, while Smalling replaced Bailly at centre-back. Roy Hodgson said beforehand that Palace had been hit by a \"plague of injuries\", and they were without Benteke, Loftus-Cheek, Zaha and Tomkins, meaning Sako started as the lone striker. Palace had strong appeals for a penalty turned down when Jeffrey Schlupp went down under a challenge from Smalling. Otherwise the visitors created few openings, despite seeing more of the ball in the second half. At the other end, Lukaku missed a one-on-one chance, Jesse Lingard fired over and Anthony Martial saw a shot saved. United eventually got a fourth as Lukaku tapped in Martial's cross from close range in the 86th minute. Roy Hodgson was left with plenty to ponder Opta stats Only Halifax Town in 1990-91 (730 minutes) have gone on a longer run from the start of a season in English league history (top four tiers) without a goal than Crystal Palace this season (630 mins). Palace overtook Burnley in 1997-98 (552 mins) in this defeat to Man Utd. Crystal Palace have lost eight consecutive league games without scoring, the joint-longest run in English league history alongside Hartlepool (two occasions,1970 & 1993) and Sunderland (1977). No player has scored more goals in their first seven Premier League appearances for Man Utd than Romelu Lukaku (seven - level with Andrew Cole). Marouane Fellaini has scored three goals from four shots in the Premier League so far in 2017-18 - more than he netted in the previous two seasons combined, two goals from 46 shots. Marcus Rashford has had a hand in nine goals in his last 10 games for Man Utd in all competitions (five goals, four assists). Man Utd kept five consecutive Premier League clean sheets at Old Trafford for the first time since a seven-game run in March 2010 under Alex Ferguson. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"I told the players that we had to respect an opponent in a difficult situation, an opponent better than their results show. It was important to respect them and play seriously. The result is probably bigger than our performance because I don't think our performance was consistent. We had good periods, good moments, we always had control of the game, but we can do better. The important thing is the three points.\" Jose Mourinho says that Manchester United's 4-0 win over Crystal Palace was a bigger scoreline than their performance deserved Jose Mourinho says that Manchester United's 4-0 win over Crystal Palace was a bigger scoreline than their performance deserved Roy Hodgson: \"There is a lot we have to put right. The message today was you have to be disappointed with the way we conceded the goals but on the other hand we didn't lay down and even towards the end we were asking a few questions. Unfortunately they found the questions relatively easy to answer.\" Roy Hodgson was pleased with the fighting spirit shown by his Crystal Palace side Roy Hodgson was pleased with the fighting spirit shown by his Crystal Palace side The pundit - Matt Le Tissier \"All credit to Jose Mourinho. In Fellaini he has somehow managed to get a tune out of a player who many thought his career at Old Trafford was over. He has gone in there, boosted his confidence. He looks a threat now. He gets himself into forward positions more often and took his goals really well. A 4-0 win at home, no matter who you play, is a great result.\" Man of the match - Marouane Fellaini What a turnaround it has been for Fellaini. Less than a year ago he was being booed by some United fans, but after scoring twice against Palace it was his name that was being chanted around Old Trafford before he was cheered down the tunnel by the Stretford End. It was Fellaini's first Premier League double since 2013 and he was a controlling presence for United throughout. \"He played really well,\" said Jose Mourinho. \"He has been doing it a long time. He is confident, he is happy with his contribution to the team.\" What's next? After the international break, Manchester United four away games in a row. They go to Liverpool in the Premier League, live on Sky Sports, then travel to Benfica in the Champions League before going to Huddersfield in the league and Swansea in the Carabao Cup.

Mame Biram Diouf nodded the hosts ahead after 40 minutes before Saido Berahino saw his penalty saved by Fraser Forster. Virgil van Dijk, making his first Southampton start for eight months, conceded the spot-kick for his challenge on Berahino, who stepped up to miss his fourth successive spot-kick during a goalless drought that stretches back to February 2016. It looked like the visitors had earned a draw when Maya Yoshida equalised on 75 minutes, but substitute Crouch snatched the three points 10 minutes later with a close-range finish after a goalmouth scramble. Nathan Redmond and Shane Long earlier squandered good chances for Southampton before the hosts went in front through Diouf - the striker nodding home Xherdan Shaqiri's excellent delivery to break the deadlock in an even encounter.

The home side wanted a second spot-kick shortly after half-time when Dusan Tadic appeared to handball Shaqiri's cross but referee Mike Jones turned down the appeal. Still, Southampton pressed after the break as Mauricio Pellegrino introduced Sofiane Boufal, Charlie Austin and Manolo Gabbiadini and those attacking moves paid off. Team news Virgil van Dijk started for Southampton for the first time since January, while Kurt Zouma returned for Stoke after he was ineligible against parent club Chelsea last weekend. Boufal made the difference as his run and cross helped tee up Yoshida, who volleyed home a spectacular leveller. But the visitors' joy was short-lived as substitute Crouch turned in Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's goalward poke to secure Stoke's second win of the campaign. There was still time for Southampton to push forward again and they went close through Gabbiadini and Austin but Stoke held on. Match stats Two of the three lowest possession figures by winning teams in the Premier League this season have involved Stoke (22.9% v Arsenal in August and 29.6% v Southampton today). Southampton have suffered their first top-flight away defeat in five games, since losing to Chelsea in April (W2 D2 L1). Saido Berahino is now without a goal in 31 hours & 48 minutes of Premier League football. Crouch is the oldest player to score in the Premier League this season (36y 243d old). Mark Hughes hailed the impact of Peter Crouch on his Stoke side following their 2-1 win over Southampton. Mark Hughes hailed the impact of Peter Crouch on his Stoke side following their 2-1 win over Southampton. The managers Mark Hughes: \"It was important to get the win. We have had some really difficult home games against some top sides and Southampton themselves are a very good side in this league. \"They have finished above us over the last few years so we knew it was another difficult home fixture. We found a way to get maximum points, it was a little bit scruffy towards the end, but Crouchy has come on and made the difference at the top end of the pitch.\" Mauricio Pellegrino: \"We were unlucky, we were pushing until the end and we put them under pressure all the time. It's part of football. They scored two goals and we scored one, we have to learn for the future.\" The pundit Phil Thompson: \"Berahino picked the ball up for the penalty and was desperate to take it. You think, after all that, he didn't have the time to settle. \"It was a good save by Forster, but it wasn't in the corner. Berahino will be kicking himself.\" Mauricio Pellegrino speaks after Southampton's defeat at Stoke Mauricio Pellegrino speaks after Southampton's defeat at Stoke Man of the match - Kurt Zouma The on-loan Chelsea defender was ineligible for Stoke's 4-0 defeat to his parent club last weekend but returned on Saturday to produce a superb display at the heart of the Potters' defence. He kept Shane Long in check and put his body on the line on several occasions to deny Southampton's attackers, especially after the introduction of Gabbiadini and Austin. With Ryan Shawcross and Bruno Martins Indi absent through injury, it was a vital performance in a crucial win for the hosts. What next?

94th-minute header earned Watford an unlikely point after coming back from two goals down against West Brom at The Hawthorns. The Hornets, who remain unbeaten away from home this season, began the game the better of the two sides, but two goals in the space of three minutes gave West Brom a commanding lead through Salomon Rondon and Jonny Evans. Andre Carrillo had a glorious chance to halve the deficit when he somehow headed over from two yards out, but Abdoulaye Doucoure's goal gave Marcos Silva's side hope. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (6), Gibbs (7), Evans (7), Hegazi (6), Dawson (6), Brunt (7), Barry (6), Krychowiak (7), Phillips (6), Rodriguez (6), Rondon (7) Subs: Livermore (6), Robson-Kanu (7), McClean (6) Watford: Gomes (6), Mariappa (6), Femenia (7), Holebas (8), Kabasele (7), Capoue (6), Doucoure (7), Cleverley (6), Carrillo (6), Richarlison (9), Deeney (7) Subs: Pereyra (6), Gray (6) Man of the match: Richarlison Just when it seemed Tony Pulis' side had done enough to hold out for the three points, Richarlison was on hand to head in Jose Holebas' cross to rescue a dramatic point. Despite Watford's early possession, Marco Silva's side lacked a cutting edge, and it was through the hosts' greater directness that they took the lead. Grzegorz Krychowiak launched a 40-yard pass downfield into the path of Rondon, and the Venezuelan striker out-muscled Christian Kabasele before firing low beyond Heurelho Gomes at his near post - only his second strike of 2017. Team News West Brom made three changes. Allan Nyom, Jake Livermore and Hal Robson-Kanu were replaced by Chris Brunt, Matt Phillips and Salomon Rondon. Watford made one change to the side that beat Swansea 2-1 at the Liberty Stadium last time out. In came Troy Deeney up front for Andre Gray, with the striker captaining the side. Things got even better for the Baggies minutes later as Matt Phillips, on his return to the side, produced a teasing corner that flicked off the head of Doucoure into the path of the grateful Evans to head in on the goal-line. Ahmed Hegazi, who would have converted had Evans not done so himself, then had the chance to stretch Albion's lead, but the Egyptian headed over at the far post from Chris Brunt's corner. The escape appeared to belatedly spark Watford into life, as the dangerous Richarlison delivered a low but fierce cross onto the head of Carrillo but the Peruvian somehow headed over from underneath the crossbar. But the Hornets did drag themselves back into the contest after 37 minutes as Doucoure latched onto Richarlison's pass to fire low into the bottom corner past Foster via a deflection off Evans - his third goal of the season. Richarlison celebrates his last-minute equaliser Gareth Barry was forced into making two crucial blocks from two fierce drives from Etienne Capoue in quick succession before Holebas' corner was missed by Christian Kabasele at the far post. But after Holebas had produced a superb last-ditch challenge on substitute James McClean, the experienced Greek full-back produced the perfect delivery in the final minute of stoppage time for Richarlison to rise above Hal Robson-Kanu to level. Opta Stats Watford are still unbeaten away from home in the Premier League this season (W3 D1 L0). This was the first time that West Brom failed to win a Premier League match that they were two goals ahead in since nearly two years to the day (WBA 2-3 Everton - 28th September 2015). Abdoulaye Doucouré has scored three goals in seven Premier League appearances for Watford this season. The only top-flight campaign in which he's scored more is 2013-14 (6 in 20 apps) for Rennes in Ligue 1. Richarlison has scored in the 90th minute in two successive Premier League games - without those goals, Watford would be three points worse off. The managers Tony Pulis: \"We should have been more set up, but it's not a free-kick. James McClean actually plays the ball. Oliver is in a great position to see that. And see where the ball goes, it goes straight back to Craig. It's a game of challenges, it's a good old-fashioned slide-tackle. Again, that's time. He played a minute overtime in the first half and in the second half. It's games we should be winning, and we're disappointed we haven't.\" West Brom boss Tony Pulis believes that the free kick that led to Watford's late equaliser should not have been given. West Brom boss Tony Pulis believes that the free kick that led to Watford's late equaliser should not have been given. Marco Silva: \"Everybody who watched this game would agree we deserved to take points. We took only one, but I think we deserved more. We came here to play our game, and our football. We knew before this match, playing against West Brom it would be a risk to play our game. We always play to take three points. This is our mentality and ambition every time, and to take four points from our past two games away is important for us.' Marco Silva says Watford deserved to take a point away from their 2-2 draw at West Brom. Marco Silva says Watford deserved to take a point away from their 2-2 draw at West Brom. The pundit - Charlie Nicholas \"Watford were very good today. Two goals down after 27 minutes, they showed great character. Richarlison must've got seven or eight knocks, he was different class today, absolutely outstanding. \"You know how physical it is with this West Brom side, but he was in their brave and he was in there where it mattered. Watford are a good side, they're neat and tidy and they certainly deserved a point. \"West Brom were quite happy to sit in defend, and it just didn't happen for them. Tony Pulis will have issues with his defenders, they don't normally concede late goals in those situations.\" Man of the match - Richarlison Watford's fightback from 2-0 down was spearheaded by the impressive Brazilian, who added another goal and an assist to his bright start to life in the Premier League. Tony Pulis had clearly told his players to get tighter on him at half-time, as the £11.2m signing from Fluminense took several knocks during the second period. But he was not to be denied as he showed his predatory instinct to head home from Jose Holebas' cross in the dying seconds.

West Ham's two substitutes Arthur Masuaku and Sakho combined for the Senegal international to convert a low cross to hand the hosts a crucial victory. Swansea, who were strong defensively throughout the match, will feel hard done by after conceding another last minute winner, but the result means West Ham jump up to 15th in the table, with the visitors dropping into the relegation zone in 17th. The contest started in an open fashion with both keen to set the tempo early. Michail Antonio had the game's first chance as he slammed a volley into the ground which Lukas Fabianski did well to parry away. Ten minutes later, and Wilfried Bony's driven shot from outside the box was strongly punched clear by Joe Hart. Player ratings West Ham: Hart (6), Reid (5), Cresswell (6), Fonte (6), Zabaleta (6), Kouyate (6), Noble (5), Antonio (6), Ayew (6), Chicharito (6), Carroll (7) Subs: Masuaku (8), Lanzini (7), Sakho (8) Swansea: Fabianski (7), Mawson (8), Fernandez (6), Naughton (5), Olsson (6), Britton (5), Carroll (5), Sanches (5), Abraham (6), Ayew (6), Bony (6) Subs: Fer (6), Mesa (6), Clucas (N/A) Man of the match: Alfie Mawson Swansea's Renato Sanches got himself into hot water after he raised his studs in a late challenge on Aaron Cresswell, forcing referee Roger East to issue a yellow card. Otherwise, it was a slow half with plenty of sloppy play evident from both teams. West Ham came out a revitalised side in the second-half and nearly took the lead seven minutes in as Antonio's dangerous ball was aimed at the back post for Andy Carroll, but he couldn't quite make the connection. The game entered a very scrappy period until Martin Olsson came close for Swansea with a curled effort from outside the box which went agonisingly wide of Hart's left post. Team news Manuel Lanzini returned to the bench for West Ham while there was a starting spot for Michail Antonio. James Collins (ankle) and Pedro Obiang (muscle injury) were the only absentees. Paul Clement turned to skipper Leon Britton. Renato Sanches and Tammy Abraham returned to the starting lineup. West Ham continually pushed to break open the deadlock, with plenty of long balls up to Carroll, but Alfie Mawson did extremely well all afternoon to contain their target man. Carroll did hit the woodwork in the 85th minute with a first-time shot following Masuaku's cross in what was arguably their closest chance in the match. But substitute Sakho would produce the heroics in the 89th minute. Masuaku went on a fine run down the left flank, driving past Kyle Naughton, before playing a lethal ball across the goalmouth for the Senegal forward to tap in and give West Ham their second victory of the season. Opta stats Diafra Sakho scores his 1st PL home goal since the last game at Upton Park in May 2016 pic.twitter.com/3ltW2b0zIF — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) September 30, 2017 This game produced a total of just 15 shots; only Burnley v Huddersfield on September 23rd saw fewer in the top-flight this season (13). West Ham have registered three clean sheets in their last four Premier League games, after managing none in the five before that. Swansea have still never kept an away clean sheet at West Ham, conceding 75 goals in 32 games in all competitions, stretching back to an FA Cup match in 1922 (W2 D7 L23). The Swans conceded their first away Premier League goal in 495 minutes of action, since Wayne Rooney scored for Man Utd against the Swans on April 30th. The pundit - Paul Merson According to Paul Merson, victory over Swansea has saved Slaven Bilic's job \"I think it has saved Bilic's job, yes. I thought with ten minutes to go that he could go. It was the performance. \"Then he made the substitutions. He brought off Hernandez and the crowd went mad. But it went to plan, as the two subs worked a treat. Swansea don't get the ball forward quick enough. Their one shot was from 25 yards.\" Man of the Match - Alfie Mawson Alfie Mawson did an excellent job of containing Andy Carroll Although he was on the losing side, Alfie Mawson produced a confident performance at centre back and did an excellent job of containing Andy Carroll, who was arguably one of West Ham's most dangerous players throughout the 90 minutes. He successfully beat Carroll to a number of crucial headers and was positionally aware throughout the game. The 23-year-old was unlucky to be on the losing side. The managers Slaven Bilic says he was relieved his side snatched a late goal against Swansea to win 1-0 after a poor first-half performance. Slaven Bilic says he was relieved his side snatched a late goal against Swansea to win 1-0 after a poor first-half performance. Slaven Bilic: \"It's all about the squad and it showed today because the substitutes made a huge impact. \"We started well and on the front foot, but after that they had much more of the ball and we were losing it with simple passes. It drains the confidence out of the players. \"We are under pressure and the players feel it but at least we showed the determination, character and teamwork and that's what gave us the three points today.\" Paul Clement believed Swansea were 'arguably the better side' after a late goal from West Ham saw them slip to a 1-0 defeat. Paul Clement believed Swansea were 'arguably the better side' after a late goal from West Ham saw them slip to a 1-0 defeat. Paul Clement: \"We're clearly frustrated to concede a goal in the last minute. Over the course of the game we were very much in it and we were the better side, particularly in the first half when we had good control of the game and got the ball forward in the attacking third. \"What was missing for us was the first and second bit of quality that you needed to convert good opportunities.\" What's next?

Man City head back to the top of the Premier League table on goal difference after the win, just ahead of local rivals Manchester United, with both sides level on 19 points. Chelsea could have taken an early lead when N'Golo Kante's right-wing delivery was just glanced over the crossbar by the rising Morata with less than three minutes on the clock. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (7), Cahill (6), Christensen (7), Rudiger (7), Azpilizueta (7), Alonso (6), Fabregas (6), Kante (6), Bakayoko (7), Hazard (6), Morata (n/a). Subs used: Willian (6), Pedro (6), Batshuayi (5). Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Stones (7), Otamendi (7), Delph (7), Fernandinho (7), Sterling (8), De Bruyne (9), Sane (7), David Silva (8), Jesus (7). Subs used: Silva (4), Gundogan (n/a), Danilo (n/a). Man of the match: Kevin de Bruyne. Both sides could have scored just before the half an hour mark. Cesar Azpilicueta's low drive was collected well by Ederson before Man City went on the break. Raheem Sterling whipped an inviting cross into the box from the right flank, but David Silva could not poke it home at the back post. Chelsea were forced into a substitution in the 35th minute as Morata appeared to be suffering from a tight hamstring, and was replaced by Willian. But it was City who could have snatched a late first-half goal as De Bruyne delivered a corner, which was powered towards goal by Fernandinho but his header was superbly pushed away by Thibaut Courtois. Team news Chelsea made three changes from last weekend, with Eden Hazard, Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas coming in for Willian, Pedro and Victor Moses. Man City replaced Benjamin Mendy and Sergio Aguero with Fabian Delph and Gabriel Jesus in two changes. After the break, Chelsea could have broken the deadlock with an hour on the clock as Cesc Fabregas picked out Eden Hazard on the left with a short free-kick. The Belgian then strode towards goal but his cross-cum-shot was well saved by Ederson at the near post. Five minutes later and Man City went ahead in some style as De Bruyne thundered home. He started the move himself, playing a fast-paced give-and-go with Jesus before powering home a volley from the top of the box, leaving national team-mate Courtois with no chance of keeping it out. Jesus could have doubled City's lead with five minutes of the game to play, but was thwarted by some superb defending from Antonio Rudiger. Sterling's chipped pass picked out the striker on the left of the box, but his effort - which had flown past Courtois - was headed away from the goalmouth by the Chelsea defender to deny the visitors a larger winning scoreline. Eden Hazard turns away from John Stones in the second half Match stats Chelsea have dropped eight points in four Premier League home games so far in 2017-18; two more than in the whole of 2016-17 (6). Manchester City have kept four consecutive clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since September 2015 (six games in that run). 9 - Kevin De Bruyne has scored nine of his last 11 @ManCity goals from outside the box, including each of the last four. Range #CHEMCI pic.twitter.com/bQLpiXQ2p6 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) September 30, 2017 Chelsea have failed to score in consecutive home league games for the first time since November 2012. Pep Guardiola enjoyed his first-ever victory against Chelsea in eight games in all competitions (not including shoot-out wins), after previously losing three and drawing four. The managers Antonio Conte: \"For sure, there is disappointment for the result but I think at the same time I am pleased with the commitment of my players. Today we gave everything and after the game you can win or you can lose but the most important thing is to see your players give everything. Today that happened. We have to accept the result because today we gave everything. \"Damage or no damage we have to go game by game and to do our best. Then we will see at the end of season what happens and where we finish in the league.\" Alvaro Morata was substituted just after the half an hour mark Pep Guardiola: \"We're in September. Of course it's so important, because winning at Stamford Bridge means they are not able to win three points. In terms of points it is so important,\" he said. \"Of course you have to adapt to your opponents but we showed in the first minute that we were coming here to win the game. That is what I want to give to the club and that is what we did in this game. Man of the Match - Kevin De Bruyne It wasn't just his superb strike that gives De Bruyne the man of the match accolade. He was constantly working for Man City whether it was powering through the midfield, nicking back possession or setting up his team-mates. Kevin De Bruyne's stunning left-foot strike proved the difference in west London He delivered some set-pieces of the highest quality too and could easily have added more goals and assists to his name at Stamford Bridge. Pep Guardiola and City will be hoping his late substitution was nothing too serious as they look to maintain their charge at the top of the table. What next? Following the international break, Chelsea will make the short trip to struggling Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday 14 October. City will also be in action on the same day when they welcome Stoke City to the Etihad."}, {"date": "25/09/2018", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59134, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal",

from Alexandre Lacazette gave Arsenal a 2-0 win over West Brom at the Emirates in the Premier League. West Brom had several chances in the first half, and Jay Rodriguez had a strong call for a penalty turned down early on, but Lacazette's headed rebound (20) had Arsenal ahead at the break. Lacazette's penalty made it 2-0 to Arsenal midway through the second half, and that's how it stayed as Arsene Wenger's side kept their 100 per cent home record this season. The result means Arsenal moved up to seventh on 10 points, while West Brom are in eighth, two points behind. Gareth Barry broke the all-time Premier League appearance record at the Emirates Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (7), Koscielny (6), Mustafi (7), Monreal (9), Bellerin (8), Xhaka (6), Elneny (8), Kolasinac (8), Ramsey (8), Sanchez (8), Lacazette (8) Used subs: Ozil (6), Giroud (6), Maitland-Niles (6) West Brom: Foster (7), Nyom (6), Dawson (6), Evans (6), Hegazi (6), Gibbs (7), Livermore (6), Barry (6), Krychowiak (7), Rodriguez (7), Robson-Kanu (6) Used subs: Morrison (6), Rondon (6), Phillips (6) Man of the match: Nacho Monreal During an action-packed first half, West Brom rightly felt aggrieved not to have been awarded a penalty after eight minutes following Shkodran Mustafi's trip on Rodriguez. The incident went unpunished by referee Robert Madley, but Rodriguez recovered, hit the post from 12 yards via a superb touch from goalkeeper Petr Cech, before Jake Livermore then struck wide with the goal gaping. Arsenal then took the lead on 20 minutes as Lacazette reacted quickest to head the ball home from five yards after Alexis Sanchez's free-kick had hit the bar and been stopped by the fingertips of Ben Foster. Team news Mesut Ozil was named on the bench as he recovers from a knee problem, alongside fellow Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere. Alexis Sanchez started alongside Alexandre Lacazette up front for the hosts. Gareth Barry was named West Brom skipper on his record-breaking 633rd Premier League appearance; Chris Brunt and Jake Livermore were fit enough to make the bench, but Nacer Chadli and Oliver Burke missed out with injury. West Brom had a strong call for a penalty in the first half West Brom went close twice before the break; Rodriguez's cross was headed goalwards by Grzegorz Krychowiak, only for Nacho Monreal to clear superbly off the line, before Gareth Barry struggled to scramble the ball home from close range after Kieran Gibbs' first-time delivery. Lacazette nearly had a second after the break, but his effort from 12 yards was superbly deflected over by former Arsenal defender Gibbs, but the Frenchman did make it 2-0 on 67 minutes, converting from the spot after Allan Nyom had barged Aaron Ramsey at the byline. Ramsey was denied by the feet of Foster late on, while Mesut Ozil made his return to action as a late second-half substitute. 2:21 The MNF panel all agreed that West Brom should have been awarded a penalty The MNF panel all agreed that West Brom should have been awarded a penalty Opta stats Alexandre Lacazette became the first Arsenal player to score in his first three home league apps for the club since Brian Marwood in September 1988. Lacazette also scored Arsenal's 100th penalty goal in the Premier League - only Liverpool (112) and Chelsea (107) have scored more penalties in the competition than Arsenal (100). Gareth Barry made his 633rd appearance in the Premier League, setting a competition record in the process. Arsenal have scored in all 23 of their Premier League meetings with West Brom, the best such 100 per cent record in the division. Jake Livermore went close in the first half The managers Arsene Wenger: \"Mustafi tackles and touched the West Brom player. Would have been given, he left [gave] the advantage the referee, and I think rightly so because they're in a position where they could score, and in the end they hit the post. \"So it's the kind of decision that is different, because if he doesn't leave the advantage, and they miss the penalty people will say why didn't he give the advantage.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said it was one-way traffic in the second half Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said it was one-way traffic in the second half Tony Pulis: \"I think everybody has seen what's happened today. I think if you want to make an example of something, Sanchez actually dives on the edge of the box for the first free-kick. And he should be booked for diving there, in my opinion. Then you see the tackle in the box on Jay, the referee's got a great view, it's a stonewall penalty. \"Jay is honest, and doesn't get his reward for being honest. We haven't had a penalty at this football club for over a year. And none of my players are told to roll around.\" West Brom boss Tony Pulis said his side should have had a penalty in the first half West Brom boss Tony Pulis said his side should have had a penalty in the first half Man of the match - Nacho Monreal Though Lacazette stole the headlines, wing-back Monreal earned the plaudits from Arsenal fans for an assured performance. His passing accuracy (93.8 per cent) was higher than any of the starting 22 at the Emirates, and made more tackles (four) and intercpetions than any other Arsenal player. Monreal played on the left of the three on Monday Night Football, and though he has looked uncomfortable there on occasions so far this season, the Spaniard strengthened his cause as Arsene Wenger continues to experiment with his defence.

Newcastle pipped Brighton to last season's Sky Bet Championship title on the final day, but the Seagulls found retribution on the first Premier League meeting between the two clubs thanks to Tomer Hemed's 51st-minute strike. Newcastle brought on Jonjo Shelvey and Dwight Gayle for the final 20 minutes but the pair were unable to replicate the form that sealed the Magpies' promotion last term as their three-game winning streak came to an end. Brighton's second victory of the season, Hughton's first over Newcastle in seven attempts, moves the Seagulls up to 13th, two points behind ninth-place Newcastle. Team news Chris Hughton made 11 changes following Brighton’s midweek Carabao Cup exit but just one from their last Premier League outing, at Bournemouth, as Bruno replaced Liam Rosenior at right-back.Rafael Benitez stuck with the same XI which beat Stoke as the Magpies went in search of a fourth consecutive win. The visitors almost took the lead inside two minutes as Matt Ritchie's corner found Mikel Merino on the edge of the area, and his volley drew Mathew Ryan into a save. Brighton responded to the early Newcastle pressure and should have taken the lead on 12 minutes, but Anthony Knockaert blocked Pascal Gross' goal-bound effort before Solly March's dipping effort called Rob Elliot into action three minutes later. Joselu is challenged by Shane Duffy in the first half In a pulsating opening quarter, Joselu came within inches of breaking the deadlock as his low effort flashed across goal before Ayoze Perez fired over after Chancel Mbemba's marauding run from deep. After a subdued end to the first half, Brighton flew out of the traps in the second period and got their reward when Hemed scooped Dale Stephens' knock-down beyond the despairing reach of Elliot for his second goal of the season. Tomer Hemed's goal secured Brighton a 1-0 win over Newcastle Elliot was on hand to prevent the hosts from doubling their lead, turning March's effort off the goal-line with a stunning last-gasp save on 56 minutes.

the match at the London Stadium Harry Kane scored twice as Tottenham beat West Ham 3-2 in the Premier League on Saturday, surviving a red card and a late home fightback. Kane produced a leaping header to score the opener at the London Stadium (35) and added his second with a simple tap-in not long after (39), before Christian Eriksen hit a hard, low effort to add the third in the second half (60). There were some hopes of a West Ham comeback when Javier Hernandez (65) and Cheikhou Kouyate (87) cut the deficit and Serge Aurier was sent off after picking up a second yellow card for two fouls (70). But Spurs saw out the game to take all three points and sit joint-fourth in the fledgling table, while West Ham dropped to 18th with just four points from six games. It was a mostly quiet first half and it took 24 minutes for the first real chance to materialise. Aurier burst down the right wing, before driving in a low cross that Kane got caught in his feet and could not slot home at the back post. However, the offside flag made the outcome irrelevant. Player ratings West Ham: Hart (6), Cresswell (6), Fonte (6), Ogbonna (6), Reid (6), Zabaleta (6), Kouyate (6), Noble (6), Antonio (n/a), Arnautovic (6), Hernandez (7).

Subs used: Winks (5), Trippier (5), Llorente (n/a). Man of the match: Harry Kane. But Kane made no mistake 10 minutes later as he gave Tottenham the lead. It was a superb passing move from the visitors as Eriksen picked out Dele Alli on the right flank with a superb diagonal ball. The midfielder then delivered a cross for the striker who produced a leaping header to hammer the ball into the net and continue his superb scoring record in London derbies. Kane made it two just four minutes later with a simple tap in. Alli's initial shot after a lovely slotted pass from Jan Vertonghen was parried away by Joe Hart but the Spurs striker was lurking in acres of space in the middle of the box to slide home. Team news West Ham made three changes with Angelo Ogbonna, Mark Noble and Marko Arnartovic coming in. Tottenham made two switches with Serge Aurier and Ben Davies back in the XI. Tottenham added their third goal on the hour mark, and Kane was involved again. His sweeping free-kick clattered off the crossbar, landing at the feet of Aurier, whose own deflected cross fell to Eriksen. The Dane then hit a low shot through the box that saw the ball evade Hart. The goals kept coming, but this time at the other end as West Ham pulled one back five minutes later. It was a first goal against Tottenham for Hernandez, who nodded home at the back post after Jose Fonte had flicked on a corner. Javier Hernandez battles with Eric Dier during the Premier League game It signalled a slight turn of fortune for the visitors, who went down to 10 men with 20 minutes left to play. It was a second yellow card for Aurier for two fouls - the second a reckless challenge on Andy Carroll - and he was given his marching orders by referee Michael Oliver. Tottenham were made to work for their victory as Kouyate powered a superb header home in the 87th minute, converting a fantastic cross from Arthur Masuaku on the left flank, but they could not find the final finish as Spurs took all three points back to north London.

All 40 of Javier Hernandez's Premier League goals have been from inside the box. Indeed, the only players with a higher 100% record of goals from inside the box are Tim Cahill (56/56) and John Terry (41/41). The managers Slaven Bilic: \"We are disappointed we lost the game. Until that first goal we were proper like last year when we beat them, it was a really good performance. \"Then we lose one ball, with enough players behind, and it was a brilliant finish. But it was a good fight from our side.\" Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says his side deserved their win at West Ham Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says his side deserved their win at West Ham Mauricio Pochettino: \"I find it hard to find the words to describe him [Harry Kane]. I am in love like the fans are in love, like his team-mates are in love. \"He is so humble, he keeps all the values that managers like me appreciate a lot. That is why I am in love with him for different reasons.\" The pundit Jamie Redknapp: \"Tottenham have the best centre-forward in the country by a mile in Harry Kane. \"Everything is there for him at Spurs and they have a great young team but it's a case of rewarding him now. Make it right that he stays at Tottenham. \"Whatever the top player in the country earns per week, he should have parity. It's as simple as that. He was sensational.\" West Ham boss Slaven Bilic was pleased with his side's reaction to going 3-0 down to Tottenham West Ham boss Slaven Bilic was pleased with his side's reaction to going 3-0 down to Tottenham Man of the match - Harry Kane It was another match-winning performance from the Tottenham striker. He added two goals to his tally for the Premier League season (4), and netted his 25th goal in 23 appearances for Spurs in 2017 - only Lionel Messi (34 in 26 apps) has scored more in Europe's top 5 leagues.

He could have nabbed his hat-trick after he twice struck the crossbar in the second half, but he will surely be pleased with his haul at the London Stadium nonetheless. What next?

Huddersfield Burnley and Huddersfield played out a drab goalless draw at Turf Moor with both sides lacking the quality they have shown this season. Chris Wood came closest to breaking the deadlock with his first-half effort from Stephen Ward's cross but the former Leeds striker headed wide. Huddersfield were the better side in the second period and had the better chances as Tom Ince fired wide from 25 yards after substitute Rajiv van La Parra had shot tamely at Nick Pope. Player ratings Burnley: Pope (6), Lowton (6), Tarkowski (7), Mee (6), Ward (7), Hendrick (6), Defour (8), Cork (7), Brady (7), Arfield (6), Wood (6). Subs: Barnes (6) Gudmundsson (6). Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Smith (6), Jorgensen (6), Schindler (8), Lowe (6), Hogg (6), Mooy (7), Kachunga (7), Sabiri (5), Ince (7), Depoitre (6). Subs: Billing (6), Van La Parra (6), Hadergjonaj (6). Man of the match: Christopher Schindler. David Wagner will be the happier of the two managers, having organised his defence extremely well with Christopher Schindler the stand-out performer in a match low on quality. In what was the first top-flight meeting between these two clubs since March 1971, both sides found themselves in the top half of the table heading into the clash. Team news Burnley made one change from the side which drew at Liverpool with Jeff Hendrick coming in for Johann Gudmundsson. Huddersfield made one switch with Jonathan Hogg coming in for Danny Williams. During a fiery opening, Abdelhamid Sabiri and Jack Cork both went into Chris Kavanagh's book for fully committed challenges, before it was Burnley who settled the better of the two sides. After 24 minutes, a lovely exchange between Scott Arfield and Ward down the left resulted in the full-back crossing onto the head of Wood, but the striker could not direct his effort inside the far post. James Tarkowski challenges Laurent Depoitre for the ball during the Premier League game Wood managed to find a yard to get in front of Schindler, but he was unable to add to the three goals already scored since his move from Leeds. It would prove the only clear-cut chance of the opening period, and the dearth of quality on show was summed up in first-half stoppage time as Arfield, looking to inject some urgency, only achieved in producing a comical foul throw. Chris Wood jumps with Tommy Smith in an attempt to win a header during the first half When the sides emerged for the restart, it was Huddersfield who began the livelier, and Laurent Depoitre ought to have done much better when released down the left by Ince but he could only shoot straight at Pope. Ince then looked to take the game by the scruff of the neck as he latched onto Aaron Mooy's pass to fire an effort that flew a yard wide of the post, but in truth, neither side did enough to earn the victory as the points were shared. Opta stats Burnley (W1 D3) are unbeaten in four Premier League games for the first time since December 2014. Huddersfield have kept four clean sheets in their six Premier League games this season (second only to Man Utd), after managing just one in their last seven Championship games. Burnley are unbeaten in four league games against the Terriers (W3 D1), after losing each of the three before that. Aaron Mooy has now created 14 goalscoring chances in the Premier League for Huddersfield, twice as many as any of his teammates. Man of the match - Christopher Schindler Chris Wood came into the game as one of the in-form Premier League strikers but he was expertly contained by Schindler throughout the match. The tall German centre-half was only beaten on one crucial occasion by his opposite man, but Wood was unable to take advantage, and the chance appeared to play on his mind for the remainder of the encounter as Schindler dominated the duel. Having scored the crucial spot-kick to confirm Huddersfield's place in the Premier League last May, the club's one-time record signing has made an impressive start to life in the top flight and was always on hand to make vital interceptions to help his side to a fourth clean sheet of the season. The managers Sean Dyche: \"We showed patience, but we're still searching for that cutting edge. Woody had a great chance from a great piece of play from Wardy but overall I'm pleased to get another point on the board. \"The only gripe I've got is they've got to change the rules on retrospective bans as I've seen a player blatantly dive in a manner that is unacceptable in football in my opinion.\" David Wagner: \"It was a tight game, very even. Maybe in the first half, Burnley were the better side with two half-chances. \"I think in the second-half, we had the best chance of the game with Depoitre's shot, and so it's a deserved result. I was pleased with the defensive side of things. \"We had our moments, of course, Burnley away is a difficult place to go. The two chances we had, we were not clinical enough.\" Huddersfield boss David Wagner says it was a deserved point for his side after a 0-0 draw at Burnley.

Bournemouth highlights Substitute Oumar Niasse scored twice as Everton came from behind to beat Bournemouth 2-1 and end a run of three straight defeats in the Premier League. Twelve months ago, the Senegal international - who moved to Goodison Park in January 2016 - was without a squad number, banished from the first-team dressing room and playing for the U23s after manager Ronald Koeman decided on the basis of a 45-minute pre-season friendly appearance he was not up to the task. But with Everton's failure to sign an adequate replacement for Romelu Lukaku in the summer, Koeman recalled the striker and he followed up a first goal for the club in the Carabao Cup in midweek with a quickfire double (77, 82) to cancel out Josh King's opener (49) and rescue all three points for the hosts. Victory relieves the pressure on Everton boss Koeman as his side move out of the relegation places and up to 13th, while Bournemouth stay 19th.

Subs: Afobe (5), Cook (6), Mousset (6) Man of the match: Oumar Niasse Dominic Calvert-Lewin was the hero for Everton in their midweek cup win over Sunderland and he almost made an early breakthrough, heading Leighton Baines' cross inches wide of the far post. Everton enjoyed the majority of the possession during the opening 45 minutes but struggled to create any clear-cut openings, while Bournemouth failed to muster any sort of threat of their own. The one real flash point of the first half came in the 34th minute when Rooney was caught by a stray arm after challenging for the ball with Francis in the Bournemouth penalty area. Blood poured from the eye of the former England captain, who appeared adamant he was elbowed, but referee Martin Atkinson waved away the appeals. Wayne Rooney was caught by a stray arm from Simon Francis If the opening 45 minutes lacked quality, then Bournemouth put that right immediately after the restart with a clinical counter-attack which saw King skip past the challenge of Mason Holgate, before firing a low shot from the edge of the penalty area past the dive of Jordan Pickford and into the back of the net. Shortly afterwards, Jermain Defoe should have doubled the visitors' lead but England U21 goalkeeper Jordan Pickford crucially saved with his foot to keep his side in the game. Everton responded by bringing on Tom Davies and Niasse to replace Davy Klaassen and Rooney and they almost grabbed an equaliser in the 70th minute when Holagte's header was hooked brilliantly off the line by Andrew Surman. Team news Ronald Koeman made seven changes from the side that beat Sunderland 3-0 in the Carabao Cup. Rooney and Sigurdsson returned to the starting line-up, while Klaassen and Calvert-Lewin retained their places. Bournemouth also made seven changes with Ake, King and Defo returning to the starting line-up. Koemen's men were level seven minutes later and it was the substitutes that combined with a Davies pass to release Niasse, and the striker smashed the ball emphatically past Begovic. The turnaround was complete in the 82nd minute when Davies' shot was deflected to the far post and Niasse was on hand to tap the ball home from close range to cap a remarkable about-turn in the fortunes of the 27-year-old. Opta stats Everton ended a run of 401 minutes without a goal in the Premier League. Bournemouth have lost 28 points from winning positions in the Premier League since the start of last season; more than any other side in that period. Josh King scored his first goal in six Premier League appearances, after netting 10 in the 12 before that. Oumar Niasse has netted in consecutive games in all comps for the first time ever in English football. No Everton player has scored more goals than Oumar Niasse in all comps this season (3), despite him playing just 59 minutes of football. Tom Davies registered his first assist in 15 Premier League games (since March 2017 v Hull). Man of the match - Oumar Niasse Dominic Calvert-Lewin led the line brilliantly for Everton, putting in another promising display but it's Oumar Niasse, who grabbed all the headlines. The striker seemed surplus to requirements in the summer following last season's loan spell at Hull City but he was named in an Everton squad for the first time since May 11, 2016 in midweek, coming on to score in the 3-0 win over Sunderland in the League Cup. Niasse fires Everton's equaliser And against Bournemouth, with Everton starring down the barrel of a fourth straight league defeat for the first time since January, 2015, Koeman turned to the 27-year-old again - and he delivered again. Latching onto Tom Davies pass, Niasse finished emphatically before being in the right place at the right time to cap a dream week with the winner as Everton came from behind to secure all three points. What's next? Everton are next in action in the Europa League when they host Cypriot side Apollon Limassol on Thursday at Goodison Park. Their next engagement in the Premier League is on Sunday October 1 at home to Burnley. Bournemouth are next in action in the Premier League next Saturday against Leicester City at the Vitality Stadium."}, {"date": "23/09/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53526,

Raheem Sterling scored twice as Manchester City cruised to a 5-0 victory over Crystal Palace, who are still yet to score a goal in the Premier League this season. Roy Hodgson's side frustrated City at the Etihad Stadium until Leroy Sane netted the opener one minute before the break. City then stepped it up after the interval, with Sterling scoring twice in eight minutes and Sergio Aguero powering in a header in the 79th minute to move within one of the club's all-time scoring record of 177, which has stood since 1939. Substitute Fabian Delph added a brilliant late fifth as City took their tally to 16 goals in their last three league matches. Palace, meanwhile, have lost all six of their Premier League matches this season without scoring and face a huge task to turn their fortunes around with Manchester United and Chelsea next on their schedule. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (6), Stones (6), Otamendi (6), Mendy (5), Sane (8), David Silva (7), Fernandinho (7), Sterling (8), De Bruyne (7), Aguero (7) Subs: Danilo (6), Delph (7), Bernardo Silva (6) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (4), Van Aanholt (4), Dann (4), Sakho (5), Fosu-Mensah (4), Schlupp (4), Cabaye (4), Milivojevic (4), Loftus-Cheek (6), Townsend (5), Benteke (5) Subs: Sako (5), Puncheon (5) Man of the match: Leroy Sane With Mamadou Sakho back in the side for the first time in the league since re-joining from Liverpool, Palace set up to be compact and frustrate City. But the hosts could have taken an early lead as Sakho headed a cross from Kevin De Bruyne against his own post and Fernandinho then shot at Wayne Hennessey from 10 yards out. Raheem Sterling of Manchester City celebrates scoring one of his two goals Palace otherwise looked solid and threatened on the break as Ruben Loftus-Cheek shot against the post before sweeping a volley narrowly wide from a cross. With some of the home fans starting to grow restless after Aguero spurned a good chance, it was Sane who finally broke the deadlock late in the first half when he finished from David Silva's excellent pass over the top. Team news Man City made just one change from their 6-0 thrashing of Watford last weekend as Sterling replaced Jesus. For Palace, Milivojevic, Sakho and Van Aanholt came in for Ward, McArthur and Puncheon. City raised the tempo after the break and soon made the game safe as Sane and Aguero provided crosses for Sterling to tap in from close range. Sane then crossed for Aguero to head in a fourth and move closer to becoming City's all-time leading scorer, before substitute Delph curled in a superb fifth from outside the box in the 89th minute after Palace had lost Christian Benteke to injury. Opta stats Crystal Palace are the first side in England's top four tiers to lose their first six games of the season without scoring. This is Manchester City's best goal return after six league games (21). Raheem Sterling has scored five goals in his last four Premier League games, as many as in his previous 31 combined. David Silva has been directly involved in seven goals in his last six Premier League appearances against Crystal Palace (four goals, three assists). Leroy Sane has scored five goals from just seven shots on target in all competitions for Man City this season. The managers Pep Guardiola: \"We started good, in the first five or 10 minutes we created two or three clear chances, but after that we were not good. The ball should be moved and we didn't move it. The last 10 minutes of the first half we started to play good again and it helped a lot to score the first goal before half-time. The second half we were at the level of the last few weeks.\" Roy Hodgson: \"I am disappointed that the play, both defensively and offensively, that we showed in the first half we couldn't get close to in the second half. A team like Man City are one of the worst you can play against when they are leading and feeling confident and creating chances.\" Man of the match - Leroy Sane Sterling might have scored twice, but it was Sane who played a starring role for City under the gaze of his international head coach Joachim Low. Raheem Sterling (top) celebrates scoring with Leroy Sane After breaking the deadlock before half-time with a composed finish, Sane played a perfectly-weighted pass into the middle for Sterling to tap in. Having spurned a good chance to score his second, the Germany international then whipped in a brilliant cross for Aguero to head in. On this evidence, Sane will be difficult for Pep Guardiola to leave out of his starting XI. What's next? City are at home again on Tuesday as they host Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. They return to Premier League action next Saturday with a trip to Chelsea. Palace travel to Manchester again next Saturday as they face Manchester United, before a home match against Chelsea on October 14."}, {"date": "23/09/2018", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance":

Utd Romelu Lukaku continued his fine goalscoring form for Manchester United to give them a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday. Lukaku scored his eighth goal in eight games for United after 20 minutes, converting a rebound after his initial header was saved by Fraser Forster. Saints piled on the pressure in the second half, going close through Oriol Romeu on two occasions, and Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands in the final minute of stoppage-time for venturing onto the pitch, but United held on for a vital three points.

New Saints owner Gao Jisheng was in the stands for the first time since buying an 80 per cent stake in the club in August, and witnessed a first half lacking in chances. United took the lead midway through the half through Lukaku, who struck home on the rebound from four yards after his initial header from Ashley Young's fine cross was saved by Forster. Team news Both sides were unchanged following victories last weekend, with Marouane Fellaini starting for United and Virgil van Dijk remaining on the bench for Southampton. Lukaku gets to the rebound first from close range Marcus Rashford hit a 25-yard free-kick inches wide later in the half, but Saints came out fighting in the second period, with Romeu sliding the ball wide from six yards under pressure from the impressive Phil Jones. Forster saved with his feet from Lukaku's low effort during one of United's rare second-half attacks, before Marouane Fellaini cleared off the line from Romeu's header. Ander Herrera then blazed over for United while Romeu slid the ball just wide from an angle late on, and United defended well in stoppage time to earn the win. Mourinho was sent off by referee Craig Pawson late in stoppage time for venturing onto the field of play, but the Portuguese boss left quietly, shaking hands with all Saints' staff before heading down the tunnel. Jose Mourinho is sent off for venturing onto the pitch in stoppage time Opta stats Sixteen points from their opening six games is Manchester United's best start to a Premier League season since 2011/12. Saints have failed to score in eight of their last nine home Premier League games, with their 3-2 win against West Ham this season the exception Romelu Lukaku has scored six goals in his six Premier League games this season - Louis Saha is the only other player to have scored as many goals in his first six games for Manchester United in the competition. Southampton have lost 11 Premier League games in 2017 - as many as they'd lost in 2016, with 15 matches still to play this year. The managers Mauricio Pellegrino: \"For me, I think we controlled the game, and never allowed them to play on the counter attack, something they are good at with pace in wide areas. Even with the long ball to Lukaku and Fellaini, I think they were under pressure all the time. \"But with this goal, they felt comfortable defending with five defenders, but that's football too.\" Jose Mourinho: \"It's not always possible to have high quality, but we fought hard. We fought hard. We did for 20-25 minutes what many teams in the Premier League do for 90 minutes, which is play with five at the back and defend with a low block. Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho says his side fought hard for their win Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho says his side fought hard for their win \"Marcus [Rashford] was phenomenal, he was phenomenal. Cedric Soares is a very good offensive full back, and James Ward-Prowse is a good crosser of the ball, so it was a good side, and Marcus felt what everybody else felt in the team, if we don't concede we win three points, so let's fight hard not to concede.\" Man of the match - Phil Jones Many thought Victor Lindelof's summer arrival at Old Trafford would mean we'd see less of Jones this season, but the England man put in a superb shift at St Mary's to give United a hard-earned three points. Southampton huffed and puffed throughout an intense second half, but Jones, alongside Eric Bailly, did everything they could to keep the hosts out. He won all 10 of his duels, didn't concede a single foul, made more clearances than any other United player and registered over 90 per cent passing accuracy. While Lindelof remains on the fringes of the side, there's no need to rush him in just yet with Jones performing impressively so far this season. What's next? United go to Moscow on Wednesday night to face CSKA in the Champions League, before hosting Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon. Saints are at Stoke on Saturday in the Premier League.

Morata scored his first Chelsea hat-trick as the champions began life without Diego Costa with a 4-0 win at Stoke. Morata struck inside 80 seconds at the bet365 Stadium to give Antonio Conte's men the lead before Pedro punished an error from Darren Fletcher to add a fine second on the half hour. Stoke, missing three of their four first-choice defenders, were put to the sword after the break as Morata doubled his tally on 77 minutes before completing his treble with a close-range finish eight minutes from time. The victory maintains Chelsea's 100 per cent away record this season and lifts them up to third in the Premier League behind the Manchester clubs. Stoke remain 15th after a fifth game in all competitions without victory. Team news Stoke were faced with a defensive shortage without injured duo Ryan Shawcross and Kevin Wimmer, while on-loan defender Kurt Zouma was ineligible to play against his parent club. Andreas Christensen, Antonio Rudiger and Tiemoue Bakayoko came in for David Luiz, Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas following Chelsea‘s goalless draw with Arsenal. Both managers, meanwhile, made 14 changes between them following their midweek Carabao Cup exploits. There was barely a minute on the clock when Chelsea took the lead, Morata slotting his fourth goal the season beyond Jack Butland after Cesar Azpilicueta's long pass released him behind a hesitant Stoke defence. The hosts recovered from the early setback but their bright attacking play offered few chances against a resolute Chelsea defence, who watched on as Pedro pounced on an under-hit back-pass from Potters captain Darren Fletcher and doubled their lead with an unstoppable curling effort into the bottom corner. Morata congratulates Pedro after he doubles Chelsea's tally at Stoke Again Stoke rallied, but Maxim Choupo-Moting was unable to turn a corner home from close range, before Mame Biram Diouf's acrobatic overhead kick flashed wide before the interval. An assured display from the champions threatened to unravel early in the second half when Marcos Alonso committed two fouls in quick succession, but referee Mike Dean issued just one yellow card to the Spaniard before he was substituted. Player ratings Stoke: Butland (6), Johnson (5), Martins Indi (6), Pieters (5), Allen (6), Fletcher (5), Shaqiri (6), Sobhi (5), Diouf (5), Choupo-Moting (7), Jese (5). Subs: Afellay (5), Crouch (4). Chelsea: Courtois (8), Azpilicueta (8), Rudiger (7), Christensen (7), Moses (7), Kante (7), Bakayoko (8), Alonso (6), Willian (7), Pedro (8), Morata (9). Subs: Fabregas (7), Hazard (7), Cahill (7). Man of the Match: Alvaro Morata His replacement, Gary Cahill, was fortunate not to give away a penalty on 65 minutes when his challenge on Choupo-Moting went unpunished, before Fletcher spurned a glorious chance to halve the deficit on 72 minutes, failing to make contact with a Xherdan Shaqiri cross from close range. From there on Stoke were ruthlessly punished for not taking their chances as Morata pounced on Glen Johnson's suicidal misplaced pass, raced clear and converted past Butland, before the Spaniard put the finishing touch to a fine move to complete his hat-trick. Diego who? 👀 Alvaro Morata scores Chelsea's first Premier League hat-trick since Diego Costa's against Swansea in September 2014. ⚽️⚽️⚽️ pic.twitter.com/ujePEiPZzw — Sky Sports PL 👑 (@SkySportsPL) September 23, 2017 Opta stats Stoke have lost more Premier League games (14) and conceded more goals (42) against Chelsea than they have against any other side in the competition. Indeed, Mark Hughes has lost 16 times and conceded 47 goals as a Premier League manager in 25 meetings against the Blues - his worst record against any top-flight club. The Potters have lost seven of their last 11 Premier League games at the Bet365 Stadium against the 'big six' - winning once and drawing the other three. Chelsea have won eight of their last nine league away games (L1), their best run over a nine game period on the road since September 2009 when they also won eight and lost one. The managers Mark Hughes: \"We've made catastrophic errors from the first minute. We were very much in the game until we lost another centre-back - Bruno Martins Indi -that's our whole senior contingent of centre-backs missing through injuries now. I cannot be too disappointed given the circumstances, we had a good go at it but they had too much quality in the end to take it away from us.\" Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says that their 4-0 win at Stoke wasn't easy despite the scoreline and added that his side must rest ahead of another busy week. Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says that their 4-0 win at Stoke wasn't easy despite the scoreline and added that his side must rest ahead of another busy week. Antonio Conte: \"It's normal to come here and suffer. Arsenal lost here, Manchester United drew but we won, and we deserved to win - but it wasn't easy. We must be pleased and satisfied to win away against Stoke because they are a strong team at home. Now it's important to rest well and prepare for another game against Atletico Madrid.\" Man of the match - Alvaro Morata Alvaro Morata scored his first Chelsea hat-trick at Stoke In the week it was confirmed Costa was set to rejoin Atletico Madrid, Morata looked more comfortable than ever in the role as his successor as Chelsea's main striker. He almost notched another couple of goals in addition to his maiden hat-trick for Chelsea, following his club-record switch from Real Madrid. Stoke boss Mark Hughes said that errors cost his side in their 4-0 defeat to Chelsea but added that Alvaro Morata had an excellent day for the champions.

watch highlights here Swansea 1-2 Watford - watch highlights here Richarlison's late winner helped Watford edge past Swansea 2-1 and record a third successive Premier League victory away from home. Andre Gray's first goal for Watford handed the visitors a deserved lead (13) before Tammy Abraham responded after the break (56). And with both teams going for the victory late on, Richarlison capitalised on some lax Swansea defending to steal all three points for the Hornets in the 90th minute. Defeat for Swansea is their third on the spin at the Liberty Stadium, while Watford - who have now won three top-flight games in a row for the first time in their history - move up to fifth in the table. Richarlison's 90th-minute winner handed Watford a third successive top-flight away victory for the first time in the club's history Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (5), Naughton (5), Van der Hoorn (6), Fernandez (6), Mawson (4), Olsson (5), Clucas (6), Fer (6), Carroll (7), Ayew (6), Bony (6) Subs: Abraham (7), Roque Mesa (5), Sanches (N/A) Watford: Gomes (6), Femenia (7), Mariappa (6), Holebas (6), Kabasele (6), Carrillo (7), Doucoure (6), Capoue (5), Cleverley (6), Gray (7), Richarlison (7) Subs: Wague (6), Pereyra (NA), Deeney (N/A) Man of the match: Kiko Femenia Watford started brightly and Gray almost broke the deadlock after six minutes, but his effort deflected wide after a superb block from Mike van der Hoorn. Seven minutes later, Wilfried Bony's wayward pass found Gray, who played it out wide for Andre Carrillo before latching onto a loose ball six yards out to fire the visitors ahead. Andre Gray (R) celebrates his first Watford goal with team-mate Andre Carrilo (L) Swansea responded well, but Federico Fernandez could not convert at the back post after Leroy Fer's header glanced across goal, Gray intercepted Alfie Mawson's back-pass but fired wide and Bony sent a free header off target as frustration mounted among the home fans. Team news Tammy Abraham and Renato Sanches were both named on the bench as Wilfried Bony and Leroy Fer came into Swansea's starting XI. For Watford, Kiki Femenia started at right-back ahead of Daryl Janmaat, while Nathaniel Chalobah (knee) was replaced by Abdoulaye Doucoure. The mood was lifted at half-time as an attacking move saw Paul Clement bring on Abraham and Roque Mesa for Van der Hoorn and Sam Clucas and it was Abraham whose impact was most telling, the England U21 striker tapping home the equaliser 11 minutes into the second half after Heurelho Gomes parried Bony's fierce strike. A tense affair ensued as both sides chased victory, and it was Richarlison who struck gold at the death as Swansea were made to pay for more defensive mistakes. Roque Mesa's pass ricocheted off Troy Deeney and fell for Richarlison, who somehow evaded Mawson's challenge before bearing down on goal and smashing it in off the bar. Lukasz Fabianski got a touch to the effort but was powerless to prevent the Swans from slipping to another disappointing defeat at home. Problems mount at home for Swansea boss Paul Clement Opta stats Watford have won three consecutive top-flight away matches for the first time in their history. Swansea have lost three consecutive Premier League home games for the first time under one manager since January 2014 under Michael Laudrup. Watford won their first away league game versus Swansea since February 1983, ending a five-game winless run. Richarlison has scored with two of his three shots on target in the Premier League.

Coutinho showed why Liverpool were keen resist Barcelona’s approaches as he scored a stunner in a chaotic 3-2 win over Leicester on Saturday. The victory broke a run of four games without a win in all competitions for Jurgen Klopp's men but they were indebted to Simon Mignolet, who saved a Jamie Vardy penalty with 20 minutes remaining. Coutinho's sensational free-kick came after Mohamed Salah's opener which put Liverpool firmly in control until Shinji Okazaki scrambled home from close range just before the break. Jordan Henderson looked to have made the game safe for the Reds midway through the second half but Vardy took just 90 seconds to hit back. Leicester were rampant and missed a glorious chance to level it up three minutes later when Mignolet denied Vardy from 12 yards. Leicester knocked Liverpool out of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday but Klopp's men were fast out of the blocks back in Premier League waters. On 15 minutes, Coutinho produced a peach of a cross to the back post where Salah was lurking to reverse a header past Kasper Schmeichel at his near post - the winger's sixth goal since joining from Roma. Mohamed Salah is mobbed by his team-mates after opening the scoring against Leicester It's been a turbulent few months for Coutinho after he handed a transfer request in the hope of joining Barcelona but his head looked fully screwed on throughout this performance, capped by a magnificent free-kick on 23 minutes. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (6), Morgan (6), Maguire (7), Chilwell (7), Albrighton (6), Ndidi (6), King (6), Mahrez (5), Vardy (8), Okazaki (7) Subs: Gray (7), Slimani (6), Iheanacho (6) Liverpool: Mignolet (7), Gomez (6), Matip (6), Lovren (6), Moreno (6), Wijnaldum (6), Henderson (8), Can (7), Salah (7), Coutinho (9), Firmino (7). Subs: Milner (6), Sturridge (7), Oxlade-Chamberlain (6) Man of the match: Philippe Coutinho From 30 yards, the Brazilian found the top-corner with a swerving right-to-left effort that had Schmeichel grasping at thin air. It was reminiscent of Coutinho's sensational free-kick against Arsenal last season. Okazaki had already seen an effort from close range ruled out for offside when he poked home just before the break to give Leicester momentum going in at half-time. It was another sign of Liverpool's struggles at defending set-pieces as Mignolet's punch from a left-wing corner hit Joe Gomez and rolled into Okazaki's path, who was only two yards out. Team news Leicester made one switch from their 1-1 with Huddersfield as Shinji Okazaki, who made a big impact against Liverpool in midweek, replaced Kelechi Iheanacho. Jurgen Klopp made four changes from their 1-1 draw against Burnley last weekend. Joe Gomez, Alberto Moreno, Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum all returned to the team. The game needed a spark after the break - and Henderson lit the touchpaper on 67 minutes with a cool finish after a flowing counter-attack. The game then descended into an end-to-end encounter. Jordan Henderson celebrates after scoring Liverpool's third goal at Leicester Vardy was on hand 90 seconds after the Henderson goal to head home from close range after a Demarai Gray volley was saved by Mignolet. With the King Power rocking, Vardy then chased a ball over the top and collided with the Liverpool goalkeeper. The contact was deemed a foul by referee Anthony Taylor and Vardy had a chance to pour more misery on Klopp from the spot - however, Mignolet read the Leicester striker's mind and palmed clear a well-struck effort down the middle to secure three precious points for Liverpool. Opta stats Liverpool have conceded 10 goals in their last three Premier League away games; the most the Reds have ever conceded over a three-game period on the road in the competition. Vardy has bagged six goals in his last four Premier League games against Liverpool - the most he has scored against any Premier League side. Salah has been directly involved in five goals in his first six Premier League appearances for Liverpool (4 goals, 1 assist); no player has had a hand in more in their first six in the competition for the club. Since joining Liverpool in 13/14, Mignolet has saved seven of the 15 Premier League penalties he's faced; more than any other 'keeper. Man of the match - Philippe Coutinho Any fears that Coutinho's head isn't fully on the job after a turbulent transfer window were put to bed with this showing. He revelled in the space just behind Roberto Firmino, producing two world-class moments to give Liverpool a foothold in the game. His cross for Salah's opener was a peach before he stole the show with a stupendous dead-ball effort from 30 yards. What's next? Leicester go in search of just their second Premier League win of the season next weekend at Bournemouth. Liverpool have a long trip to Moscow on Tuesday to take on CSKA in the Champions League before heading back to the UK for a Super Sunday clash with Newcastle next weekend."}, {"date": "17/09/2018",

Highlights: Chelsea 0-0 Arsenal Arsenal produced a resolute away performance to earn a 0-0 draw at Chelsea, who had David Luiz sent off late on in Sunday's Premier League clash. Arsene Wenger's side had lost both of their previous games on the road this season - at Stoke and Liverpool - but might have picked up all three points at Stamford Bridge, as Aaron Ramsey struck the post in the first half and Shkodran Mustafi had a goal disallowed in the second. Watch reaction from Aaron Ramsey after Arsenal claimed a goalless draw at Chelsea Watch reaction from Aaron Ramsey after Arsenal claimed a goalless draw at Chelsea Chelsea defender Luiz was sent off in the closing stages for a nasty challenge on Sead Kolasinac, as 12th-placed Arsenal missed the chance to climb into the top half, while Chelsea remain third behind Manchester United and Manchester City. The home side dominated the opening stages, but Arsenal grew into the game and almost snatched the lead in the 17th minute when Danny Welbeck headed Hector Bellerin's cross just over the bar, before Alexandre Lacazette's low shot was blocked by Thibaut Courtois. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (7), Azpilicueta (7), Luiz (3), Cahill (6), Moses (6), Kante (6), Fabregas (7), Alonso (6), Willian (7), Morata (6), Pedro (6).

Subs: Sanchez (6), Giroud (6), Elneny (5) Man of the match: Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal) Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech, on his return to Stamford Bridge, stood firm to deny Pedro when clean through on goal and Ramsey went even closer at the other end, dancing past two defenders and striking the post with Lacazette unable to turn in the rebound. Cesc Fabregas and Ramsey battle for the ball Antonio Conte had replaced Pedro with Tiemoue Bakayoko at the break, while Arsene Wenger waited until the 66th minute to make his first change, introducing Alexis Sanchez for the ineffective Lacazette. Chelsea responded by sending on Eden Hazard for only his second Premier League appearance of the season, before Welbeck sustained an injury and was forced to limp out of the action, replaced by Olivier Giroud. Team news Mesut Ozil missed out through injury and Arsene Wenger said Alexis Sanchez was only fit enough for the bench. Gary Cahill and Willian returned for Chelsea with Eden Hazard named among the substitutes. Following the flurry of substitutions, Arsenal thought they had taken the lead when Mustafi headed in Granit Xhaka's free-kick from close range - only to have his celebrations correctly cut short by the linesman's offside flag. Willian attempts to get past Nacho Monreal Hazard's curling effort from the edge of the area into the palms of Cech was as close as Chelsea came before they were reduced to 10 men with three minutes remaining. Earlier in the half, Luiz had perhaps been fortunate to escape with a booking, in light of Sadio Mane's red card for Liverpool against Manchester City last weekend, when he mis-timed an overhead kick and caught Laurent Koscielny in the face. But he was eventually shown a straight red by Michael Oliver in the 87th minute as he recklessly challenged Kolasinac with his studs showing to become the fourth Chelsea player to be dismissed this season. Opta stats Chelsea failed to score in a competitive home match under Conte for the first time (27 games). This was the first 0-0 draw between these two sides at Stamford Bridge since April 2005. Arsenal have now failed to score in eight of their last 14 trips to Stamford Bridge in all competitions. Arsenal have not won away at a 'big six' club in the Premier League since January 2015 (2-0 at Man City). Chelsea have been given as many red cards in their last five Premier League games (3) as they had in their previous 73. David Luiz was sent off late on in Chelsea's draw with Arsenal The managers Antonio Conte (Chelsea): \"I think it was a good, open game. Both teams tried to win the game and created chances to score. I think it was a good game but tough for both teams.\" Arsene Wenger (Arsenal): \"I think we were close to winning this game. It is a good basis to start from and go from strength to strength. You could still feel sometimes, because of what happened [against Liverpool], there was a little inhibition. With a bit more freedom, I believe we would have won the game.\" The pundit - Thierry Henry It wasn't difficult for Arsenal to be better than they were against Liverpool. It was standard, for me, for what you need to do away from home. Whether you are playing the champions or not you need to be careful of what's going to happen. Yes, it was way better, they got a point and Aaron Ramsey was way better but also the team defended better. The wingers were tucking in and helping and recovering. The three at the back were better also because the job was done in front of them. Everything was better today. Man of the Match - Aaron Ramsey Ramsey rues a missed chance In a game of few chances, Arsenal's midfielder produced the best of the lot, dancing past David Luiz and Cesar Azpilicueta two minutes before half-time and seeing his shot come back off the post. But he was awarded the Man of the Match trophy for his all-round play, as he covered more distance than any other player (12.34km) and completed 42 of his 51 passes. It was an energetic, determined and stubborn performance that was at the core of Arsenal's best away display of the season so far. What's next? Chelsea host Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday evening, before visiting Stoke in their next Premier League game on Saturday.

United made it a frustrating homecoming for Wayne Rooney as they thrashed Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford on Super Sunday. United's all-time leading scorer watched his former team-mates take an early lead thanks to a fantastic strike from Antonio Valencia with just four minutes on the clock before late goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Romelu Lukaku, who was scoring against his former club, and Anthony Martial put further gloss on the victory. Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku cupped his ears to the Everton fans after scoring but claimed it was just banter Manchester United's Romelu Lukaku cupped his ears to the Everton fans after scoring but claimed it was just banter Despite chances at either end, including a good one for Rooney, Everton couldn't live up to United's ruthlessness, as the hosts moved level on points at the top of the table with rivals Manchester City. The result leaves Everton with just four points after their first five Premier League games, although their tricky fixture list, which has seen them take on United, City, Chelsea and Tottenham, is behind them now. Player Ratings Manchester United: De Gea (8), Valencia (8), Bailly (7), Jones (7), Young (7), Matic (7), Fellaini (6), Mata (7), Mkhitaryan (7), Rashford (5), Lukaku (7) Subs: Martial (7), Herrera (6), Lingard (6) Everton: Pickford (5), Keane (6), Jagielka (6), Williams (6), Martina (6), Schneiderlin (7), Davies (6), Gueye (7), Baines (6), Sigurdsson (7), Rooney (7). Subs: Sandro (6), Calvert-Lewin (6), Mirallas (6) Man of the match: Antonio Valencia Everton set out with a view to containing the confident hosts - but their resistance was broken inside four minutes by a sensational strike by Valencia. Antonio Valencia of Manchester United celebrates scoring his side's first goal Nemanja Matic whipped the ball across to the United full-back, who decided to hit an outrageous first-time effort from 22 yards which pinged like a rocket into the top corner. Rooney spent most of the first half-hour being crowded out of the game but he did wriggle free to turn a Cuco Martina cross a few yards wide before Lukaku missed a glorious chance when one-on-one with Jordan Pickford. Team news Jose Mourinho made five changes to the side that beat Basel 3-0 in the Champions League in midweek. Marouane Fellaini replaced the injured Paul Pogba, while Marcus Rashford, Antonio Valencia, Eric Bailly and Phil Jones all returned. It’s was also five changes for Everton from the midweek defeat. Jordan Pickford returned in goal in place of Maarten Stekelenburg, while Cuco Martina, Ashley Williams, Idrissa Gueye and Tom Davies also were handed starts. Rooney's golden chance came just after the break when his tenacity inside the box left him with a very presentable opportunity from 12 yards out - but his former team-mate David de Gea was there to rescue the hosts. In a much more even second period, United slipped deeper as Everton grew in confidence although Juan Mata did fire a 20-yard free-kick against the post just before the hour mark and Matic fired a daisy-cutter just wide on 75 minutes. Rooney was replaced to a standing ovation with eight minutes remaining and United took advantage of Everton's gung-ho approach, firing home three late goals. Mkhitaryan was sent through by Lukaku before finishing across Pickford before the former Everton man poked home from close range minutes later. There was still time for substitute Martial to plant a penalty home after Morgan Schneiderlin had handled. Opta stats This was Everton's heaviest league defeat at Old Trafford since losing 5-1 in December 1999 under Walter Smith. The Toffees are winless in their last 11 away Premier League games (D5 L6), their worst run since May 2004 (also 11 without a win). Lukaku has scored five goals in his first five Premier League appearances for Manchester United, a record matched only by Louis Saha and Robin van Persie. Rooney has faced 38 different opponents in the Premier League - Manchester United are the only side he's never won against (P5 W0 D0 L5). The pundit - Gary Neville Wayne Rooney and Nemanja Matic battle for the ball \"It wasn't a good performance. There's a bit of a pattern building though, in terms of getting in front, being patient, waiting and sometimes even retreating with a couple defensive substitutions. \"I think Jose is renowned for being a patient coach, his team look like they have the maturity to handle it. He'll be a little bit concerned about the goals he conceded at Stoke last week and some of the chances he conceded today. Because United haven't played what I'd call the best teams in the league yet.\" Manager reaction Jose Mourinho: \"I didn't think for one single second about Manchester City - I thought about Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool, they didn't win their matches. It was a chance for us to get two points, like they got last week when we drew against Stoke. I was thinking about them and not City, who won their game and did their job.\" United boss Jose Mourinho was impressed with his side's performance, labelling the first 30 minutes their best of the season United boss Jose Mourinho was impressed with his side's performance, labelling the first 30 minutes their best of the season Ronald Koeman: \"Today we deserved more than we got. We made a big mistake by Ashley Williams at 1-0 and after that it was over. From what I saw today from the team it made me happy. More happy than Thursday (at Atalanta). It wasn't about ambition, it was about confidence. I tried to shout to them, especially the full-backs, to take a higher position but that's in the head of players after a tough period.\" Man of the match - Antonio Valencia Gary Neville: \"He's been absolutely outstanding for the last 18 months, two years. I had doubts as to whether it could last in the long-term with him, I thought it was more of a stop gap until they signed a right-back. But he's the real thing. Everton boss Ronald Koeman felt that his side played better than the scoreline suggested Everton boss Ronald Koeman felt that his side played better than the scoreline suggested \"He is a top right-back now; he's strong, quick, supports the attack, and doesn't make any mistakes. United don't need to sign a right-back. To think they signed Matteo Darmian as the right-back, Valencia is head and shoulders above him.\" What's next? United host Burton Albion in the third round of Carabao Cup next on Wednesday, live on Sky Sports Football, before a trip to Southampton next Saturday. Koeman will be hoping Goodison Park can trigger a change of form for the Toffees as their next four fixtures are all there, starting with Sunderland in the Carabao Cup.

Southampton Crystal Palace became the first team in Premier League history to lose their first five games without scoring as Roy Hodgson's tenure began with a 1-0 defeat to Southampton. Four days on from Frank de Boer's sacking, former England boss Hodgson was tasked with lifting the Eagles' early-season slump, but Steven Davis' early strike extended their miserable start to the season. Virgil van Dijk made his first appearance since January 22 following his summer transfer saga, coming off the bench to see out a victory which lifts Saints momentarily up to fifth in the Premier League. Palace, meanwhile, remain rooted to the foot of the table ahead of games against Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea.

Chelsea loanee Loftus-Cheek provided a threat throughout, evading three Southampton defenders on 32 minutes, but his drive towards goal was blocked by Ryan Bertrand. Saints remained on top though, as Tadic and Redmond almost doubled their lead before half-time. Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster (2R) saves a shot from Crystal Palace's striker Christian Benteke (2L) Hodgson got into his side at the break and they responded with an early onslaught on the Southampton goal but, again, Forster proved impenetrable, thwarting Jason Puncheon with a sublime point-blank save on 49 minutes. Southampton settled from there on, utilising Shane Long on the counter and containing Palace, whose threat in front of goal significantly reduced when Loftus-Cheek was substituted on 78 minutes. Team news Roy Hodgson made just one change to the final XI fielded by Frank de Boer, bringing in Ruben Loftus-Cheek for Chung-Yong Lee. Virgil van Dijk’s spell in the wilderness came to an end as he was named among the substitutes, while Mauricio Pellegrino reinstated Maya Yoshida, Shane Long, Dusan Tadic and Mario Lemina into the Southampton line-up after their defeat at Watford. Van Dijk then came on for the final three minutes, drawing a line under a summer of speculation which has seen him linked with Liverpool, to earn Saints their first win in three, piling the pressure on Hodgson in the process. Opta stats Crystal Palace are without a goal in 450 minutes this season, the longest ever run from the start of a Premier League campaign. The Eagles have failed to find the back of the net in six consecutive league games for the first since January 1995 (a run of nine), with three different managers taking charge during this run (Sam Allardyce, Frank de Boer and Roy Hodgson). Crystal Palace have become the 1st top division team in history to start a season with 5 defeats and no goals #CRYSOU #PL pic.twitter.com/tJfsdDjFlR — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) September 16, 2017 Southampton have won four of their last five meetings with Crystal Palace in all competitions, losing the other. Steven Davis scored his first Premier League goal since 15th May 2016 - also against Crystal Palace 489 days ago. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"It was the worst possible start, conceding the goal so early, a team that's obviously a little bit nervous and anxious anyway becomes even more nervous and anxious. Roy Hodgson says conceding an early goal was the worst possible start for Palace Roy Hodgson says conceding an early goal was the worst possible start for Palace \"I'm learning all the time, in training and also in games. I learn what I know really, in that there is a lot of heart out there, a lot of pain when it's not going well and people care. They want to do better but we have got to mould ourselves into a better football team.\" Mauricio Pellegrino: \"We controlled the ball and that is something that we need because we have the quality of players to keep the ball and dominate the game. We also did really well defensively from the beginning until the end. Mauricio Pellegrino hailed Southampton's performance, especially their defensive qualities Mauricio Pellegrino hailed Southampton's performance, especially their defensive qualities \"They created a few chances at the start, but after that, I don't remember too many other clear chances for them. I think we should have scored another goal but I am happy with the performance.\" The pundit Alan Pardew and Jamie Redknapp insist there is a lack of personality and confidence from Palace Alan Pardew and Jamie Redknapp insist there is a lack of personality and confidence from Palace Alan Pardew: \"For me, there was a lack of personality on the pitch today as individuals and a team. I'm struggling to find something really positive to say aside from Ruben Loftus-Cheek was terrific in the time he had on the pitch and he was their best player. \"There were a few players I know very well out there looking a bit short on confidence. Roy has put disciplines in there and they have taken them too literally. They were too flat in the first half and too defensive minded as a group.\" Man of the Match - Mario Lemina A summer signing from Juventus, the midfielder showed his quality at Selhurst Park. Lemina played a part in June's Champions League final and shone for Saints, breaking up the play impressively and showing his passing range. A dominant presence. Hodgson watches on at Selhurst Park What's next? Palace will look to avoid a repeat of their 3-0 opening-day defeat to Huddersfield when the Terriers head to Selhurst Park in the third round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, before beginning a grueling run with a trip to Manchester City.

Watch highlights of the 1-1 draw between Huddersfield and Leicester in the Premier League A Jamie Vardy penalty cancelled out Laurent Depoitre's first Premier League goal to hand Leicester City a hard-earned 1-1 draw against Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium. Depoitre, who was deputising for the injured Steve Mounie up front, put Huddersfield in front straight after half-time but Vardy levelled a few minutes later from the spot. Just past the hour mark, the hosts saw an Elias Kachunga goal controversially ruled out for offside before Vardy missed an open goal from Riyad Mahrez's inviting cross across the box. The result means Huddersfield continue to defy the odds in the upper echelons of the table while Leicester have shot into 14th place, having previously hovered just above the relegation zone. Player ratings Huddersfield Town: Lossl (5), Smith (6), Zanka (6), Schindler (7), Lowe (7), Mooy (8), Williams (7), Kachunga (6), Sabiri (5), Ince (7), Depoitre (7) Subs: Quaner (5), Hogg (N/A), Van La Parra (N/A) Leicester City: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (5), Morgan (7), Maguire (6), Chilwell (6), Mahrez (7), Ndidi (5), King (6), Albrighton (5), Vardy (7), Iheanacho (6) Subs: Gray (6), Okazaki (5), Slimani (N/A) Man of the match: Aaron Mooy (Huddersfield Town) Following an uneventful first half the game burst into life immediately after the interval as Depoitre opened the scoring on 46 minutes as he raced onto Abdelhamid Sabiri's pass, outmuscled Harry Maguire and fired past Kasper Schmeichel in goal. However, their lead was shortlived as just four minutes later Leicester equalised through Vardy who sent Jonas Lossl the wrong way from the penalty spot after Chris Lowe had upended Andy King just inside the box. Depoitre is surrounded by team-mates after his 46th-minute goal Huddersfield thought they had regained the lead after 62 minutes when Kachunga nodded in a Mathias 'Zanka' Jorgensen shot from close range but the goal was disallowed as the winger was incorrectly deemed to be offside. Replays showed that King had in fact played him on. Not long after Leicester should have gone in front after Mahrez bamboozled Lowe before firing a low cross-shot to the far post but Vardy inexplicably failed to get a touch on it with the goal gaping. The England international kicked the bottom of the post in frustration after failing to add to his four Premier League goals this season. Team news David Wagner was without the services of top-scorer Steve Mounie through injury so Laurent Depoitre made his first league start after signing from Porto. Abdelhamid Sabiri also made his full debut in midfield. Craig Shakespeare handed a full Premier League debut to Kelechi Iheanacho who partnered Jamie Vardy up front. Ben Chilwell came into the side in place of the injured Christian Fuchs, while Vicente Iborra was on the bench. The home side had another great chance late on when Aaron Mooy, who dictated the tempo of the game throughout, carved out an opening for Collin Quaner with just six minutes remaining but the powerful target man flicked the ball wide of the far post after beating Ben Chilwell to the ball. And in the final minute Leicester thought they had won another penalty when substitute Demarai Gray hit the ground under pressure from Zanka but Jon Moss waved away the winger's appeals. OPTA Stats Leicester have registered just one clean sheet in their last eight PL games, shipping 18 goals in that period. Laurent Depoitre scored on his first Premier League start for Huddersfield, with only his second shot on target overall for the Terriers in the competition. Jamie Vardy has had a hand in 15 goals (12 goals, three assists) in 18 Premier League appearances under Craig Shakespeare. Since their return to the top-flight in 2014/15, the Foxes have won 25 penalties, scoring 19 of them, only Manchester City (26 taken, 20 scored) can better them on both counts. The managers David Wagner: \"We got the response I wanted from the West Ham game in terms of the performance; the team showed a great attitude. From the replays I have seen, Elias Kachunga was clearly onside when he headed the ball in but we have to accept the point.\" Craig Shakespeare: \"We have to see that as a good point, I certainly would've taken a point at half time. We created chances in the second half and dug in despite being a bit off the pace. We've played better this season and got nothing but that happens.\" The pundit Paul Merson: \"Vardy's miss was one of the biggest sitters I've ever seen! Huddersfield were outstanding in the opening 25 minutes without really creating anything, but Leicester improved in the second half.\" Man of the match - Aaron Mooy (Huddersfield Town) Aaron Mooy was in impressive form for Huddersfield against Leicester As is so often the case when Huddersfield Town are in action, Aaron Mooy was the standout player as he dictated the tempo of the game from midfield. The Australian playmaker completed the highest number of passes on the pitch (84) and created the most chances with three. He was always a threat with his pinpoint deliveries into the box from wide areas. What's next? Both sides switch to their attentions to the Carabao Cup on Tuesday as Huddersfield travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace while Leicester host Liverpool live on Sky Sports Football. In the Premier League, meanwhile, Leicester again take on Liverpool at the King Power on Saturday with Huddersfield heading to Turf Moor to face Burnley on the same day."}, {"date": "16/09/2018",

frustrating week continued as Burnley battled hard for a well-deserved 1-1 draw at Anfield on Saturday despite the return of Philippe Coutinho to the starting line-up. Sean Dyche's side took the lead against the run of play in the 27th minute through Scott Arfield, but the hosts responded three minutes later through Mohamed Salah. Liverpool continued to dominate possession after the break but Burnley had chances of their own with Ben Mee denied by both Joel Matip and Simon Mignolet. Substitute Dominic Solanke then had a brilliant chance to seal all three points for the hosts late on but his shot was tipped onto the crossbar by Nick Pope as Burnley kept their unbeaten start to the season away from home intact. Player ratings Liverpool: Mignolet (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Matip (6), Klavan (6), Robertson (7), Can (6), Milner (6), Salah (8), Coutinho (7), Firmino (6), Sturridge (6).

Subs: Barnes (6), Westwood (n/a), Vokes (n/a). Man of the match: Nick Pope Liverpool dominated the early stages but it was Burnley who took the lead out of nowhere in the 27th minute. Matip and Roger Klavan failed to deal with Robbie Brady's flick-on and the ball fell to Arfield on the edge of the penalty area, and he drove the ball beyond Simon Mignolet and into the bottom corner. However, it took Klopp's men just three minutes to respond with Emre Can's pass picking out Salah, who brought the ball down in the penalty area before smashing it past Pope. Mohamed Salah celebrates his equaliser in the first half at Anfield Coutinho was starting to pull the strings for the hosts and the home fans thought they'd taken the lead when the Brazilian's pass released Daniel Sturridge, but the England striker's shot crashed into the side netting. The Brazil international, who a month ago handed in a transfer request in an attempt to force a move to Barcelona, received a rapturous welcome at Anfield and may have been guilty of trying too hard, firing a number of shots over the crossbar before being replaced midway through the second half. Team news Philippe Coutinho made his first start of the season in place of the suspended Sadio Kane. Jurgen Klopp made seven changes in total from the draw with Sevilla with Mignolet, Alexander-Arnold, Klavan, Robertson, Milner and Sturridge coming in for Karius, Gomez, Lovren, Moreno, Henderson and Wijnaldum. Burnley made two changes to the side that beat Crystal Palace last time out with Nick Pope and Scott Arfield replacing the injured Tom Heaton and Sam Vokes. It was virtually one-way traffic from there in as Coutinho, Can, James Milner, Andrew Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold all had chances. Solanke's shot from close range was then tipped onto the crossbar by the impressive Pope late on as Burnley's game plan held firm. The Clarets could have nicked it themselves when centre-back Mee had one effort headed over by Matip and another saved by Mignolet in the same attack. 30 - Liverpool had 30 more shots than Burnley today - the most in any PL game since Man Utd had 31 more than Burnley in Oct 2016. Deluge. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) September 16, 2017 Match stats Liverpool had 35 attempts on goal - since 2003-04, they've only had more in a single Premier League match once (37 vs Everton, April 2016). These were the first points Burnley earned in a league match at Anfield since a 1-0 win in September 1974 - they'd lost their previous four in a row before today. Emre Can has provided as many assists in his four Premier League games this season as he had in his previous 89 combined in the competition (2).

Consolation. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) September 16, 2017 The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"I'm angry about the performance. In a lot of moments of this game you cannot play better football than we did today. We didn't finish the situations with the goalkeeper making two outstanding saves. The quality is there. I saw a great attitude. I saw them running, I saw them playing and I saw them fighting, but I didn't see them scoring and that's a problem.\" Sean Dyche: \"First-half he [Pope] didn't have too much to do. He ended up picking the ball out of the back of the net but it was more to do with the defensive unit, who I was delighted with today. \"Second-half, when you really need your keeper he makes two great saves. One took a nick on the way through which he got a quick hand to and the second right under his bar. That's what the goalkeeper is there for. He's learning all the time and improving.\" The pundit Charlie Nicholas: \"It was an onslaught from Liverpool. I'm not taking anything away from Burnley's performance, it was dogged, resilient, you name it, but the problem with Liverpool is they started slowly. \"It's far too regular for Liverpool. Jurgen Klopp was calm on the sidelines but he will be angry inside. They will be disappointed they only got a point but this is still the story of Liverpool. They are still unconvincing against these teams.\" Charlie Nicholas gives his verdict on Liverpool's draw with Burnley in the Premier League. Charlie Nicholas gives his verdict on Liverpool's draw with Burnley in the Premier League. Man of the Match - Nick Pope Nick Pope Pope was called in for his first Premier League start following Tom Heaton's injury and it was a busy afternoon for the 25-year-old at Anfield. Liverpool dominated possession and had 35 shots at goal and every time Pope was called into action, he did his job brilliantly. In particular, saves to deny Sturridge and Alexander-Arnold stand out but the best was when he just got a touch onto Solanke's volley to tip it onto the crossbar and earn his side a well-deserved point.

winning goal for the second straight weekend as Newcastle battled to a 2-1 victory over Stoke on Saturday afternoon. Rafael Benitez was absent for the defender's heroics against Swansea last week, but the Newcastle manager returned to the dugout to witness Lascelles head the hosts to all three points in the 68th minute. Christian Atsu's first Premier League goal had fired Newcastle ahead (19) at St James' Park, only to see Xherdan Shaqiri level the match (57) with a low 25-yard strike. Jamaal Lascelles headed in Newcastle United's winner for the second weekend in a row Newcastle's third straight victory in the Premier League sends them up to fourth, while it also hands Stoke their first defeat since the opening day of the season. Player ratings Newcastle: Elliot (8), Yedlin (8), Clark (7), Lascelles (7), Mbemba (7), Hayden (6), Merino (8), Perez (8), Atsu (7), Ritchie (8), Joselu (5) Subs: Shelvey (6), Gayle (6), Diame (6) Stoke City: Butland (6), Martins Indi (7), Zouma (6), Wimmer (6), Diouf (7), Allen (6), Fletcher (6), Pieters (6), Choupo-Moting (6), Shaqiri (7), Jese (6) Subs: Sobhi (6), Crouch (N/A) Man of the match: Matt Ritchie Rafael Benitez, manager of Newcastle United, issues instructions to first-team coach Mikel Antia A bright start for Stoke came to nothing as Atsu converted Newcastle's first opportunity of the match after 19 minutes. Matt Ritchie's cross from the corner of the penalty area swung towards the back post, and Atsu was there to beat Mame Biram Diouf to the ball and tuck it away. Christian Atsu (left) celebrates with team-mate Matt Ritchie after scoring the opening goal Shaqiri then forced Rob Elliot into a stunning save - the Swiss' curled effort looked destined for the top corner before the Newcastle 'keeper got his fingertips to it. Teams news Rafael Benitez made three changes to the side that beat Swansea last weekend, bringing in DeAndre Yedlin, Chancel Mbemba and Christian Atsu for Javi Manquillo, Jesus Gamez and Jacob Murphy. Mark Hughes brought in Bruno Martins Indi for Geoff Cameron, who is out for two weeks with a hamstring injury. A hat-trick of glorious chances fell to Joselu against his former employers either side of half-time, but the forward sent a first-time strike wide, saw Jack Butland keep out his close-range effort and then flashed his shot over after Atsu's pinpoint cross. Stoke punished Newcastle for not putting the game beyond them when Shaqiri equalised with a low left-footed effort which sailed beyond Elliot and into the bottom corner. Elliot then did brilliantly to deny Diouf before a big call down the other end saw Stuart Attwell dismiss Atsu's claims for a penalty after Kurt Zouma appeared to get a touch on the ball and bring the player down with one swift movement. Xherdan Shaqiri handed a way back into the match for Stoke before Lascelle's winner However, Newcastle's frustrations were short-lived, as Ritchie's corner was met by Lascelles, whose header took a huge deflection off Kevin Wimmer and flew beyond Butland. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting missed a great chance to level at the death, but he fired over following substitute Peter Crouch's nod down before Diouf somehow headed wide of the mark in injury time. Opta stats Newcastle have won three consecutive top-flight games for the first time since November 2014. Stoke have enjoyed just one win in their last 11 away league games, drawing three and losing seven. Christian Atsu scored his first Premier League goal in his 10th appearance in the competition (despite making his English top-flight debut in August 2014). Matt Ritchie has provided 11 assists in the league since the start of last season, more than any other Newcastle player. Xherdan Shaqiri scored for Stoke against Newcastle. His last six Premier League goals have been scored from outside the box. The managers Rafael Benitez: \"It's not easy, because you are watching your team but cannot get too agitated or shout too much. So in the end, you're just passing on messages. They did a great job against Swansea, and they continued doing the same here. \"It's always good when you win and especially when the team is working so hard. Hopefully we can continue this mentality.\" Rafael Benitez says captain Jamaal Lascelles is leading by example after his second goal of the season helped Newcastle to a 2-1 win over Stoke. Rafael Benitez says captain Jamaal Lascelles is leading by example after his second goal of the season helped Newcastle to a 2-1 win over Stoke. Mark Hughes: \"We had clear-cut chances with Choupo-Moting and Diouf. In fairness, their keeper made a couple of outstanding saves so we created a fair number of chances. \"We weren't able to capitalise on that and made a couple of mistakes in terms of the goals that we conceded.\" The pundit Phil Thompson says that he doubted a lot of Newcastle players before the season began but admits they are rising to the occasion after they beat Stoke 2-1. Phil Thompson says that he doubted a lot of Newcastle players before the season began but admits they are rising to the occasion after they beat Stoke 2-1. Phil Thompson: \"There is a lot of confidence oozing through the side. A lot of players who I thought maybe lacked the ability or passion are rising to the occasion. \"None more so than the match-winner, Lascelles, who has been the rock that these victories have been built on. You can see he's a leader.\" Man of the match - Matt Ritchie With this man's delivery, Newcastle can have every hope of finishing in the top half this season. Two assists for Ritchie at St James' Park on Saturday afternoon makes that four in his last three games. The Toon Army will continue to be a danger from set-pieces so long as the 28-year-old is gearing up to take them. What's next?

A blistering first-half performance put City in control as Aguero struck twice and Gabriel Jesus added his fourth league goal of the season. Nicolas Otamendi headed home their fourth (63) before Aguero sealed his hat-trick (81) and Raheem Sterling netted a late penalty (89) after he was brought down by Christian Kabasele.

City made their dominance count with two more goals before the break, with Aguero first tapping home after Gomes fumbled David Silva's low cross. Jesus then finished smartly to add City's third, although the Brazilian looked offside before netting from Aguero's pass. Teams news Watford made two changes in defence as Adrian Mariappa and Daryl Janmaat replaced Kiko Femenia and Younes Kaboul, while Pep Guardiola made just one alteration from City's 4-0 win at Feyenoord. Raheem Sterling was preferred to Bernardo Silva. Watford, who were unbeaten before City's visit, were punished after the break as Otamendi powered in a fourth before Aguero grabbed his hat-trick with a neat finish. Substitute Etienne Capoue wasted the hosts' best chance when he nodded over from close range and Sterling piled on the misery from the spot in the closing stages. Match stats This was Watford's heaviest ever defeat in the English top-flight. Man City (11) have scored more goals in their last two Premier League games at Vicarage Road than Watford (10) have in their last nine at the ground. Gabriel Jesus has been directly involved in 15 goals in his 15 Premier League appearances (11 goals, 4 assists). Aguero has been involved in 11 goals in five appearances against Watford in all competitions (nine goals, two assists). Watford boss Marco Silva said Manchester City deserved all three points but he was left frustrated with the officials Watford boss Marco Silva said Manchester City deserved all three points but he was left frustrated with the officials The managers Marco Silva: \"I think the first goal was offside, the second goal we made a big mistake and maybe the third goal is offside too; this is the truth. \"We had one clear penalty. I'm sure it wouldn't change the result, but would give more confidence in this moment.\" Pep Guardiola: \"We played so good. Here at Watford it is complicated. Last season Manchester United and Arsenal lost and this year Liverpool was not able to win. \"They were unbeaten until now so to score six goals - especially away and especially after being away in the Champions League - we played like a team and we are so happy. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was delighted with side's performance at Watford Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was delighted with side's performance at Watford Man of the match - Sergio Aguero When City are in the mood they can be absolutely devastating, especially with Aguero as their spearhead. It is not the first time he has tormented Watford either. The Argentine has been involved in 11 goals in five appearances against the Hornets, while he has now scored in eight consecutive away league starts. His partnership with Jesus is flourishing and Aguero's treble on Saturday takes his tally to 175 Manchester City goals, just two behind club record scorer Eric Brook. Brook's mark of 177 has stood since 1939 but it's a matter of when - not if - Aguero will break it. What next? City's busy September continues as they travel to West Brom on Wednesday for a Carabao Cup third-round tie before returning to Premier League action at home to bottom-of-the-table Crystal Palace.

Hawthorns but couldn't find a winner as they were held to a 0-0 draw at West Brom. Pedro Obiang's incredible effort from 45 yards cannoned back off the crossbar in a first half that lacked any real quality. Things didn't improve a great deal after the interval, with Ben Foster arguably very fortunate to stay on the pitch for a lunge on Javier Hernandez. Andy Carroll had a few half chances, but nothing that caused Foster any real concern.

Man of the match: Michail Antonio Gareth Barry took the applause before kick-off as he equalled Ryan Giggs' Premier League appearance record against the Hammers, but it was a fresh face in Kieran Gibbs who almost got his West Brom career off to a flyer early on into his first start for the club, but he saw his goalbound effort well blocked. Then, with the quality elsewhere very low in the opening half hour, Obiang attempted an audacious effort from just inside his own half, from 45 yards, which beat Foster in the home goal, but his strike cannoned back off the crossbar. West Brom's best chance of the half came via the head of James Morrison in the 38th minute, but he failed to get to the desired purchase on the ball and it flashed across the face of goal. Team news Kieron Gibbs was handed his first start for West Brom, as he replaced Allan Nyom. Chris Brunt for Jake Livermore and James Morrison for Salomon Rondon were the other West Brom changes. Unsurprisingly, the Hammers were unchanged from the win over Huddersfield, with Andy Carroll leading the line once more. The second half saw even less goalmouth action, but the main talking point was just how Foster managed to avoid being sent off for a lunging tackle on Hernandez. The long ball over the top was there to be won, but Hernandez kicked the ball away from the advancing England international before being upended, somewhat rashly, The Hammers bench was incensed. Several opportunities came and went to create that match-winning opening, but the final ball remained poor throughout match. A point was all either side deserved for showing such little endeavour.

Of course sometimes that would be a red, but I can't see the referee has done too much wrong in that situation.\" West Brom boss Tony Pulis said it was a game of few chances in their 0-0 draw with West Ham as Gareth Barry equalled the Premier League appearances record West Brom boss Tony Pulis said it was a game of few chances in their 0-0 draw with West Ham as Gareth Barry equalled the Premier League appearances record The pundit - Matt Le Tissier I thought Foster was probably lucky to stay on. If that was a defender, he would have been off. He is two feet off the ground, out of control. Chicharito is going away from goal, so he isn't denying a goalscoring opportunity, but it is just the foul itself. Anywhere else on the pitch and it is a red card. Defensively it was an improvement for West Ham, but West Brom were very poor on the attack. I feel sorry for Jay Rodriguez up front, he was so isolated. Man of the Match - Michail Antonio Simply the only player who had a go. He got so exasperated by lack of movement ahead of him that he tried to go it alone too often. His work ethic cannot be questioned, as he never gave up. What's next? Manchester City travel to the Midlands to take on West Brom in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, which will be good preparation for an imposing-looking trip to Arsenal for Tony Pulis's men on Monday Night Football.

were left frustrated by Swansea as the Welsh side earned a 0-0 draw at Wembley in the Premier League on Saturday. The best chance of the game fell to Harry Kane in the second half, but the striker hit the bar from eight yards after Moussa Sissoko has pulled the ball back. Lukasz Fabianski kept Spurs at bay on numerous occasions, saving from Heung-Min Son twice, as well as Kane's close-range header. The result means Spurs are still without a win at Wembley in the Premier League, while Swansea move up to 14th with five points from five games. Tom Carroll vies with Toby Alderweireld Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (5), Trippier (6), Alderweireld (6), Sanchez (5), Vertonghen (6), Dier (6), Sissoko (5), Eriksen (6), Son (6), Alli (6), Kane (6) Subs: Llorente (6), Aurier (6) Swansea: Fabianski (8), Naughton (7), van der Hoorn (7), Fernandez (8), Mawson (7), Olsson (7), Clucas (6), Sanches (6), Carroll (6), Ayew (6), Abraham (7). Subs: Fer (6), Routledge (NA), Bony (6) Man of the match: Federico Fernandez Spurs, who had seemingly ended their Wembley hoodoo with a 3-1 victory over Borussia Dortmund in midweek, enjoyed 75 per cent possession and managed 26 shots in the late Saturday kick-off against a stubborn Swansea who refused to be beaten. During a first half lacking in chances, Kane forced a good save out of Fabianski from a 30-yard free-kick, before the Swansea goalkeeper denied Son from an acute angle. Spurs upped the tempo in the second half, and should have been ahead on the hour mark, only for the crossbar to deny Kane after Sissoko had picked him out in the penalty area at close range. Team news Ben Davies was replaced by Heung-Min Son in the Spurs starting XI, while summer signing Davinson Sanchez also started in defence. For Swansea, Mike van der Hoorn came in, replacing Leroy Fer. Kane's glancing header from a Christian Eriksen corner was superbly tipped away by Fabianski, before Dele Alli miscued a header from Eriksen's pinpoint cross. Spurs had several shouts for a penalty, the biggest for a Martin Olsson handball and an Olsson shove on Serge Aurier in the second half, but Mike Dean waved all away. Kane and Kieran Trippier both went close for the hosts late in the game, flashing wide from long range, and Swansea eventually held on for a vital point. Opta stats Tottenham have gone three Premier League home games in a row without a win for the first time a run of four in December 2013. Mauricio Pochettino's side failed to score for the first time in 30 Premier League home games, since a 0-1 defeat against Leicester in January 2016. Swansea failed to register a single shot on target for the third time in their five Premier League matches this season (also vs Southampton and Manchester United). In fact, the Swans have been responsible for three of the seven occasions a Premier League side has failed to land a single shot on target in a Premier League game this season. The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"Very disappointing because we did everything to win. We created chances and dominated the game but were a little unlucky. I am happy with the performance although it is another game we draw here at Wembley and that is no good.\" Mauricio Pochettino was unhappy with the draw Paul Clement: \"I think good defending should be applauded. If you got to Italy, you know that's something they are very proud of and clearly we want to attack better and have a little bit more control of the game, but we always have to be realistic.\" Man of the match - Federico Fernandez In a game where Paul Clement knew his Swansea City box would be bombarded, Argentine Fernandez was the visitors' titan in defence. Fernandez made a staggering 18 clearances at Wembley, eight more than any other player on the pitch, and more than the entire Spurs side combined. He also only lost possession three times. An honourable mention must go to Fabianski for a string of excellent saves, but Fernandez was the star man. What's next? Tottenham now host Barnsley in the Carabao Cup third round on Tuesday night, before a trip to West Ham on Saturday, live on Sky Sports Premier League from 11.30am. Swansea go to Reading in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, and then host Watford at 3pm on Saturday.

goal in 16 years sealed the Cherries' first Premier League win of the season as they came from behind to beat south-coast rivals Brighton 2-1 on Friday Night Football. The Cherries were staring a fifth-straight league defeat in the face when Solly March headed Brighton into the lead on 55 minutes at the Vitality Stadium. But substitute Jordon Ibe changed the game with two assists as Andrew Surman and Defoe struck in the space of six minutes to clinch a morale-boosting victory which eased the pressure on manager Eddie Howe. Jermain Defoe's goal was his 20th for @afcbournemouth & came 5,977 days after his 19th, in May 2001 pic.twitter.com/UoMCu5e3x4 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) September 15, 2017 Bournemouth remain second from bottom despite claiming their first three points, but move to within a point of the Seagulls, who remain in 14th position. Team news Bournemouth made three changes following their defeat at Arsenal, with Steve Cook, Tyrone Mings and Dan Gosling dropping to the bench in place of Simon Francis, Andrew Surman and Marc Pugh. After claiming their first win of the season against West Brom, Chris Hughton was just one changed as Liam Rosenior replaced injured Brighton captain Bruno. Bournemouth started brightly but it was the visitors who had the first shot in anger as Anthony Knockaert flashed an effort wide on 11 minutes, before Marc Pugh followed suit with an effort of his own nine minutes later. Both sides saw plenty of the ball in midfield but chances were at a premium. They exchanged blows in a pulsating 30th minute as Davy Propper's audacious lob on the half-hour nestled on the roof of the net before Defoe's shot on the swivel whistled past Mathew Ryan's post. Andrew Surman scored his first Premier League goal to equalise for Bournemouth Brighton came agonisingly close to breaking the deadlock on 51 minutes but Surman was in the right place to clear headers from Shane Duffy and Propper off the line from successive corners. Dale Stephens then turned Duffy's knock-down against the crossbar, and into the thankful arms of Asmir Begovic, as the Seagulls laid siege on the Cherries goal. Player ratings Bournemouth: Beogvic (6), Francis (6), Ake (6), Surman (8), Pugh (7), Arter (6), Daniels (7), Smith (6), King (7), Defoe (8), Fraser (5). Subs: Afobe (5), Ibe (9), Gosling (5).

Man of the Match: Jordon Ibe. And the visitors made the breakthrough four minutes later as Pascal Gross picked out March at the back post, and he directed a looping heading back into the far corner. Keen not to stretch their winless run to five games, Howe turned to his bench for a response - and substitute Ibe delivered, back-heeling for Surman who showed great composure to cut inside Lewis Dunk before slotting the equaliser, before deftly playing in Defoe for Bournemouth's second six minutes later. Jermain Defoe celebrates his winning goal Opta stats Jermain Defoe scored his first goal for Bournemouth since May 2001 (5977 days ago), when he was playing alongside Eddie Howe for the Cherries away at Reading. Defoe has scored in 17 different Premier League seasons, with only three players scoring in more - Frank Lampard (18), Paul Scholes (19) and Ryan Giggs (21). Jordon Ibe provided assists for both of Bournemouth's goals - before tonight, he hadn't been involved in a single goal in his previous 28 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth. Ibe is the first Bournemouth player to provide two assists in a single Premier League game. The managers Eddie Howe: \"Although we've been in the Premier League for two years, I feel like we're not used to losing. We want to win and we need to win. I want to see us play at our full level, we haven't done that yet, maybe we did in parts today but there's a lot more to come from the team.\" Chris Hughton was disappointed with the manner of his sides loss as they conceded twice after leading to give Bournemouth their first win of the Premier League season. Chris Hughton was disappointed with the manner of his sides loss as they conceded twice after leading to give Bournemouth their first win of the Premier League season. Chris Hughton: \"It was hard to take because up until the goals we'd done everything right. We knew we were up against a Bournemouth side that would be pushing to get their first win. They are very good on the ball with good movement but I thought we matched them.\" The pundit Gary Neville: \"Jordon Ibe injected something completely different into the game and took the game away from Brighton. It was that little bit of inventiveness and creativity that unlocked them and pulled them out of position.\" Jordon Ibe set up Jermain Defoe's winning goal Man of the Match - Jordon Ibe Things haven't quite clicked for Eddie Howe's men this term but the introduction of Ibe soon changed their fortunes. The winger's sublime back-heel provided the equaliser and an equally cute assist for Defoe proved decisive, with Ibe becoming the first Bournemouth player to provide two assists in a single Premier League game. What's next? Bournemouth and Brighton meet again at the Vitality Stadium on Tuesday in the third round of the Carabao Cup, before the Cherries look for back-to-back wins for the first time this season when they travel to Everton on Saturday.

Player ratings West Ham: Hart (6), Reid (6), Cresswell (6), Fonte (6), Zabaleta (7), Collins (6), Kouyate (6), Carroll (7), Obiang (6), Hernandez (7), Antonio (8). Subs: Ayew (6), Sakho (3), Rice (2). Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Smith (6), Billing (6), Kachunga (6), Mooy (7), Lowe (6), Van La Parra (5), Ince (6), Mounie (6), Zanka (5), Schindler (6). Subs: Malone (4), Sabiri (3), Depoitre (2). Man of the match: Michail Antonio. Huddersfield took time to settle and although they started seeing more of the ball, it was West Ham who had the better chances and James Collins' header was smothered by Jonas Lossl. For all the danger they posed coming forward, West Ham lacked an edge and Antonio's 20-yard drive deflected over rather than in before Kouyate missed the target when he should have scored. Aaron Cresswell's free-kick over the upright before the break was poor, with Hernandez's after just as wasteful as frustration began to creep in. Andre Ayew pokes in West Ham's second after Huddersfield fail to clear Jose Fonte's header Huddersfield's openings were rare but Philip Billing tested Joe Hart with a ferocious low drive which needed the England goalkeeper to react quickly to keep it out. Just as they seemed to be stretching West Ham, they almost shot themselves in the foot as Zanka sliced an attempted clearance just wide of his own goal. Team news Andy Carroll made his first start of the season as the hosts made five changes and reverted to a 3-4-3 shape following three consecutive defeats. Jose Fonte and Cheikhou Kouyate were also among those introduced, with Mark Noble one of the players to miss out as he was sidelined by a minor injury. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Huddersfield went with the same starting XI for the third game in a row after seven points from a possible nine. Yet it said much about this game that the home side could not make them pay from the corner and when they finally took the lead 18 minutes from the end, it was with a huge slice of luck. Obiang was credited with the goal but the fact his shot came off Zanka's back before wrong-footing Lossl and going in off the post meant it would be bold of him to claim it. Pedro Obiang sees his shot take two deflections before going in to give West Ham the lead Buoyed by that, West Ham doubled their advantage six minutes later when Jose Fonte's header wasn't cleared and substitute Ayew poked in the rebound. Tom Ince hit the bar in the closing stages but West Ham saw out a scrappy victory - not that Bilic will be caring how it was achieved. Opta stats Huddersfield are the last team in this season's Premier League to concede a goal, after 342 minutes of action Andre Ayew has been directly involved in four goals in his last five Premier League games (a goal and assist v Huddersfield and a goal and assist v Burnley last May). Andy Carroll won 13 aerial duels in the game, the most of any player in a Premier League game this season. Joe Hart registered a clean sheet for the first time in his last 23 league games. The managers Slaven Bilic: \"It was a must-win game and I was pleased with the way we played. It was a top performance and we totally deserved it. We kept calm and changed the shape a little and said we were going to get back to basics. It's my birthday and this is a great present.\" Slaven Bilic thanked his players for their efforts in their 2-0 victory over Huddersfield. West Ham’s first win of the season also gave Bilic something to smile about on his birthday! Slaven Bilic thanked his players for their efforts in their 2-0 victory over Huddersfield. West Ham’s first win of the season also gave Bilic something to smile about on his birthday! David Wagner: \"We were not good enough. It was a deserved result. We were second best in more or less every area. I am unsure if we were nervous. Today we looked like a promoted team with some nerves, especially with the ball. We made so many unforced errors.\" David Wagner says his Huddersfield side deserved to lose as they suffered their first defeat in the Premier League. David Wagner says his Huddersfield side deserved to lose as they suffered their first defeat in the Premier League. The pundit Sam Allardyce: \"That has taken the pressure off Slaven. He has got the three points on the board and can push on and the players who come back will strengthen the squad. They can be a force going forward and have lots of goals in the team, it's just about being solid at the back and getting clean sheets. Slaven's got his just rewards, as lucky as it was. That didn't matter - it was all about the result and I thought his tactics were spot on.\" West Ham's Pablo Zabaleta and Rajiv van La Parra of Huddersfield battle for the ball Man of the match - Michail Antonio The winger was a threat all night in a lively three-pronged West Ham attack alongside Javier Hernandez and Andy Carroll. He showed tremendous pace to set up Carroll early on as the former Liverpool forward hit the bar and his quick feet caused all sorts of problems for the visitors, with Zanka booked for a crude challenge on the 27-year-old. Although Antonio wasn't directly involved in either of the goals, you would expect he will set up plenty in the months ahead.

Chris Wood's early goal, which came courtesy of a horrendous error by Lee Chung-yong, turns up the pressure on new Palace boss Frank de Boer, who has overseen the club's worst start to a season since 1925. There were positives for the visitors, who had 23 shots on goal - including two efforts cleared off the line and a quite remarkable late miss from Scott Dann - but things are set to get tougher, with fixtures against Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea looming. Player ratings Burnley: Heaton (7), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (8), Mee (7), Brady (7), Defour (7), Cork (7), Gudmundsson (7), Ward (7), Wood (8), Vokes (7) Subs: Westwood (6), Barnes (7) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Ward (6), Schlupp (5), Fosu-Mensah (6), Dann (5), Lee Chung-yong (3), Cabaye (6), Townsend (7), McArthur (6), Puncheon (6), Benteke (4) Subs: Lumeka (6), Riedewald (6) Man of the match: James Tarkowski De Boer called for cool heads in the early stages, but Lee let his manager down inside the first three minutes. Under no pressure the South Korean international played a woefully short back-pass straight into the path of Wood, who anticipated and then punished the mistake with a first-time finish past the on-rushing Wayne Hennessey. Palace responded well, but a Christian Benteke header from 12 yards sailed the wrong side of the post before Dann had an effort cleared off the line by Matthew Lowton. BURNLEY, ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 10: James McArthur of Crystal Palace heads at goal during the Premier League match between Burnley and Crystal Palace at Turf Burnley lost their goalkeeper Tom Heaton midway through the first-half with a suspected dislocated shoulder and his replacement Nick Pope, who was making his Premier League debut, was kept busy in the second period. The visitors set up camp in the Burnley half but their final finish was lacking as James Tarkowski and Ben Mee were in resilient mood to keep out Benteke. Team news Sean Dyche gave Chris Wood a place in the starting eleven after his impact from the bench against Tottenham. He replaced Scott Arfield in the only change from the team that drew at Wembley. Palace made three changes with Yohan Cabaye, Lee Chung Yong and Jeffrey Schlupp reaplcing Luka Milivojevic, James Tomkins and Patrick van Aanholt. The Belgian striker squirmed through the back-line on 79 minutes but it was Pope to the rescue with a brave block down to his right. Palace continued to press and Dann was denied for the second time by a goal-line clearance, this time from Stephen Ward when Pope was beaten. That looked to be the last chance, but Dann managed to save the worst miss until last, heading wide from no more than three yards out. BURNLEY, ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 10: Scott Dann of Crystal Palace looks dejected during the Premier League match between Burnley and Crystal Palace at Turf Mo Opta stats Crystal Palace are the first top-flight team since Preston North End in 1924/25 to lose their opening four matches without scoring a single goal. Chris Wood is the first Burnley player to score in both of his first two Premier League appearances for the club. The Clarets are guaranteed to end today in the top eight of the top-flight outside the month of August for the first time since April 18th 1975. Palace have now lost their last eight Premier League games when they've conceded the first goal, failing to score in all eight of those games. The pundit Jamie Redknapp: \"Have I learnt anything about De Boer's philosophy? Not really. They were lumping the ball forward. They want to play from the back but only West Ham and Burnley have made more long passes. He's not sure how to set his team up.\" Man of the match - James Tarkowski A man mountain at the heart of the Burnley back four. Ably assisted by Mee, the former Brentford man stepped into the shoes vacated by Michael Keane to keep quiet Benteke. The centre-back made 18 clearances in the match, which is the most by a player in a Premier League game this season. What's next?

Rafa Benitez. The Magpies skipper's towering 76th-minute header proved decisive as the visitors secured a victory to give absent Benitez a timely boost as he recovers from hernia surgery. Renato Sanches had an uneventful 69-minute cameo on his Swansea debut, before being replaced by Wilfried Bony, who tasted defeat on his much-anticipated return to south Wales. The result lifts Newcastle up to 10th in the Premier League while Swansea drop a place to 15th following their second defeat of the season.

Man of the match: Jamaal Lascelles After a subdued opening half hour, the game burst into life with a flurry of chances at either end. First, Joselu thought he had scored on 33 minutes but Lukasz Fabianski pulled off a sublime save to tip his head around the post. A minute later, referee Mike Jones waved Mikel Merino to his feet after diving in the area under an Alfie Mawson challenge, and Swansea nearly sought their own retribution when Jordan Ayew stung Rob Elliot's palms with a long-range drive.

After Matt Ritchie saw yellow and not red for a Sadio Mane-esque high boot on Mawson, the chances continued as Ayew set up Kyle Naughton and Tom Carroll in quick succession, but a combination of Ciaran Clark and Elliot kept the Swans at bay. Team news Renato Sanches made his Swansea debut as Paul Clement made just one change from the team that beat Crystal Palace before the international break, Mike van der Hoorn dropping out to accommodate the Portuguese. With Rafa Benitez absent, Jesus Gamez replaced Chancel Mbemba in the Newcastle defence, while Jacob Murphy came in for Christian Atsu. Jonjo Shelvey returned on the bench against his former club following the culmination of his suspension. Magpies skipper Lascelles then expertly cleared Tammy Abraham's effort off the goal-line on the hour before Fabianski saved Ayoze Perez's low drive with his foot on 73 minutes. But Newcastle struck the killer blow 14 minutes from time as Lascelles rose high above the Swansea defence, sending an effort past Fabianski from which the Swans could not respond. Opta stats Since the start of last season, no side in the top four tiers of English football has won more away league games than Newcastle (15, level with Chelsea and Exeter). The Swans have lost their opening two home league games of a season without scoring a goal for just the second time in their history (also 1985/86). Matt Ritchie has registered an assist in all three of his Premier League appearances against Swansea (three in total).

watch highlights Man City 5-0 Liverpool - watch highlights Manchester City moved to the top of the Premier League after a comprehensive 5-0 win over 10-man Liverpool, who had Sadio Mane sent off in the first half. Sergio Aguero gave City the lead in the 24th minute before Liverpool were reduced to 10 men after Mane's high boot caught Ederson - who was stretchered from the field - in the jaw (37). Gabriel Jesus (45+6, 53) extended the hosts' advantage either side of the break before substitute Leroy Sane rounded off the scoring with a late double (77, 90+1) as City inflicted Liverpool's first defeat of the season - their biggest under Jurgen Klopp in all competitions.

Subs: Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Milner (6), Solanke (6). Man of the match: Kevin De Bruyne After their 4-0 thrashing of Arsenal, Liverpool started brightly with Mohamed Salah causing Nicolas Otamendi plenty of problems in the opening stages. In the 22nd minute Salah skipped past Otamendi, who was booked in the early stages, and burst into the penalty area, but the forward's weak effort was scooped up by Ederson at his near post. The miss proved costly as City took the lead two minutes later, somewhat against the run of play. Kevin De Bruyne's inch-perfect pass dissected the Liverpool defence to release Aguero and the Argentine rounded Simon Mignolet to slot the ball home. Leroy Sane scores a fourth against 10-man Liverpool Then came the game's big talking point. Mane was released in behind the City defence but clattered into the on-rushing Ederson, catching the City 'keeper in the face with a high boot. Referee Jon Moss did not hesitate in brandishing a red card as Ederson left the field on a stretcher. Things got even worse for the visitors when Jesus, who minutes earlier had an effort ruled out for offside, headed home De Bruyne's cross from close range as City doubled their advantage just before the break. Team news Pep Guardiola made three changes following City’s dramatic victory at Bournemouth – Sergio Aguero in for suspended Raheem Sterling, John Stones in for injured Vincent Kompany and Kyle Walker recalled, with Bernardo Silva dropping to the bench. Jurgen Klopp made three changes of his own, recalling Simon Mignolet ahead of Loris Karius and Trent Alexander-Arnold for Joe Gomez, while Ragnar Klavan got a surprise start ahead of Dejan Lovren. Liverpool switched to a back three at the break with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain coming on for his debut, replacing Salah, but the City onslaught continued. Pep Guardiola's side had a second goal ruled out for offside after Aguero's toe-poke was chalked off but they did get their third minutes later when Fernandinho released Aguero, who unselfishly squared for Jesus to convert past Mignolet. Sadio Mane catches Ederson with his boot as they challenge for the ball Liverpool's misery was compounded further in the 77th minute when Benjamin Mendy's pass afforded Sane a first-time finish and the Germany international grabbed his second of the game in stoppage time with a superb strike that picked out the top corner. Gabriel Jesus celebrates the first of his two goals with Kevin De Bruyne Opta stats This was Jurgen Klopp's heaviest defeat in all competitions as Liverpool manager and his joint-heaviest ever managerial loss (lost 1-6 with Mainz vs Werder Bremen in October 2006). It was also Klopp's first Premier League defeat away from home to one last season's top seven sides (P10 W5 D4 L1). Manchester City netted 5+ goals in a game versus Liverpool for the first time since March 1937 (5-1). Since he made his Manchester City debut, Kevin De Bruyne has assisted 2+ goals in seven different Premier League games (29 assists in total in that period). Sergio Aguero is now the top scoring non-European player in Premier League history (124), overtaking Dwight Yorke (123).

I don't think that's a red card. However the keeper ends up, the rewards are so big. His eyes are on the ball. Sorry Jon Moss, you've just ruined the game there.\" Man of the Match - Kevin De Bruyne Gary Neville: \"He was absolutely fantastic. In the big moments in the game, the first goal, it's a wonderful, wonderful pass. \"And then the second goal, in my opinion it's the biggest moment in the game other than the sending off in terms of taking the game away from Liverpool.

scored twice as Arsenal bounced back from their heavy defeat to Liverpool with a 3-0 win over Bournemouth on Saturday. The international break gave the Gunners a chance to reflect on their 4-0 humiliation at Anfield and they produced the perfect response at the Emirates. Welbeck's early header put them ahead (6) and they deservedly doubled their lead before half-time through Alexandre Lacazette (27). An excellent finish by the impressive Welbeck completed the scoring for the hosts (50), who move up to ninth in the Premier League table after their second victory of the season. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (7), Bellerin (7), Kolasinac (8), Koscielny (7), Mustafi (7), Ramsey (7), Monreal (7), Xhaka (8), Ozil (8), Welbeck (8), Lacazette (8) Subs: Coquelin (6), Giroud (6), Sanchez (7) Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Cook (5), Ake (5), Daniels (6), Smith (5), Arter (5), Mings (5), Gosling (4), Fraser (5), King (5), Defoe (5) Subs: Francis (6), Ibe (6), Mousset (6) Man of the match: Danny Welbeck There was also time for Arsene Wenger to introduce substitute Alexis Sanchez - who was close to joining Manchester City on Deadline Day - and the Chilean received a mixed reception from the home crowd. Former Schalke man Sead Kolasinac provided the most assists by a defender in the Bundesliga last season and he teed up Welbeck for the opener. Arsenal were completely dominant, with Asmir Begovic alert to keep out efforts by Granit Xhaka and Mesut Ozil before the hosts added their second. It came courtesy of another fine forward pass by Ozil, who released Lacazette to fire home after a neat exchange with Welbeck. Team news Alexandre Lacazette and Sead Kolasinac both impressed on their returns to the Arsenal starting XI after the pair missed the 4-0 defeat to Liverpool before the international break. Little went right for the Cherries, who also lost Ryan Fraser to injury before the break, and they conceded again five minutes after half-time. Dan Gosling coughed up possession and when Ramsey slipped through Welbeck, the Arsenal forward tucked away his second of the game. Jermain Defoe had struck the post with a header moments before that Welbeck strike, compounding a miserable afternoon for a Bournemouth side still looking for its first point of the campaign. The visitor's first shot on target did not come until the 85th minute, while the only blot on Arsenal's copybook was a late injury suffered by substitute Francis Coquelin. Alexandre Lacazette celebrates after his goal against Bournemouth Match stats Alexandre Lacazette became only the second Arsenal player to score in his first two home Premier League games for the club, after Marouane Chamakh in 2010. Danny Welbeck has scored three goals in four Premier League games this season, having scored just two in 16 appearances in the competition last term. Bournemouth have become only the ninth team to lose their opening four games to a Premier League season, though four of the previous eight have managed to avoid relegation. Man of the match - Danny Welbeck Bournemouth's back three struggled to cope with Arsenal's attacking threat all afternoon, with Welbeck the main beneficiary. His tally now stands at four goals from six appearances for club and country, while he also contributed an assist for Lacazette's strike against the Cherries. He was inches away from a hat-trick too when his audacious second-half chip landed narrowly wide. The managers Arsene Wenger: \"I feel we played well all over the pitch. It's difficult to single anybody out for a bad performance and overall, if you look at the individual performances, they were all quite good. \"It was a a serious performance, well focused, with a good team discipline and we scored goals and didn't concede. That's what we needed.\" On the mixture of boos and cheers for Sanchez, Wenger added: \"I don't know why, maybe it is a question of transfers. He will do that [win the fans back] quickly.\" Eddie Howe: \"We were disappointing from start to finish, we have a lot of work to do. \"If you dip below your levels you get punished, we spoke about that before the game. We were punished today. \"You don't sit on zero points if everything is going great so we will have to dig deep, we will have to really find some character - which we have always shown historically - and we have to bounce back and really show what we are made of.\" What next? Arsenal are back at the Emirates on Thursday to open their Europa League campaign against Cologne before returning to league action away to Chelsea on Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League. Bournemouth will look to end their four-match losing run in the league when they host Brighton on Friday Night Football, also live on Sky Sports Premier League."}, {"date": "09/09/2018", "arena":

Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Saltor (6), Dunk (7), Duffy (7), Suttner (6), Knockaert (8), Propper (6), Stephens (6), March (7), Gross (8), Hemed (7) Subs: Rosenior (6), Murray (6) West Brom: Foster (4), Nyom (4), Evans (6), Dawson (6), Hegazi (5), Livermore (4), Barry (6), Phillips (5), Krychowiak (5), Rodriguez (6), Ronson (6) Subs: Gibbs (6), Burke (6), Morrison (7) Man of the match: Pascal Gross A quiet first half was dominated by Brighton, and the hosts thought they found the breakthrough when Shane Duffy tapped in after Ben Foster spilled Solly March's effort - only to be correctly flagged for offside. Pascal Gross celebrates scoring Brighton's first-ever Premier League goal And following three Premier League matches without scoring, relief erupted around the Amex when Gross broke the deadlock just before half-time. The German was picked out by March at the back post, and after cutting onto his left foot, the 26-year-old tucked it home via a deflection. Team news Brighton named an unchanged XI as Tomor Hemed recovered from injury while on international duty for Israel. West Brom made two changes; captain Jonny Evans made his first start of the season, while Tony Pulis handed a debut to Grzegorz Krychowiak - fellow new boy Kieran Gibbs started on the bench. Gross grabbed his second three minutes into the second half, as he received the ball from Hemed before marching down on goal unopposed and striking it low from 25 yards out. Gross netted his second just after the break, before going on to assist Tomer Hemed A dream afternoon for Gross then saw the midfielder in acres of space down the left, and he had time to find Hemed, whose header snuck in at the near post. Morrison found the net late on for West Brom after Burke's nod down, but the comeback ended there on what was a disappointing showing from Tony Pulis' side. Match stats Pascal Gross' 45th minute opener was Brighton's first ever in the Premier League, and first in the top-flight since May 1983 when Gordon Smith scored against Norwich. Brighton had as many shots on target in this game (6) as they had in their first three Premier League games combined (6). This was Tony Pulis' first away defeat at a newly promoted club in the Premier League since his Stoke side lost 1-2 at QPR in May 2012. He had previously gone 11 games in a row unbeaten against newly-promoted opposition on the road in the competition. Tomer Hemed is the first Israeli player to score a Premier League goal since Itay Schecter for Swansea against Wigan in May 2013. The managers Chris Hughton: \"[Gross] has been good for us since day one. He settled in very easily. He has done most of the pre-season with us, which always helps, but he's a flexible player who can play in a few positions across the midfield. That adaptability will certainly help us. Brighton manager Chris Hughton praises new signing Pascal Gross as his side secured their first Premier League win with a 3-1 victory over West Brom. Brighton manager Chris Hughton praises new signing Pascal Gross as his side secured their first Premier League win with a 3-1 victory over West Brom.

We were better in the last 20 minutes so we will take some substance out of that.\" West Brom manager Tony Pulis says that his side conceded poor goals at the wrong times as they slipped to a 3-1 defeat away to Brighton.

Man of the Match - Pascal Gross Two goals and one assist makes Gross comfortably the standout player for Brighton. The German popped up when they hosts needed him most, as it looked like another half of football would pass them by without finding the net. The midfielder followed up that strike late in the first half with a well-taken second, while his assist laid it on a plate for Hemed.

Having scored twice for England in Malta during the international break, Kane opened his club account for the season with a 28th-minute cross-shot to complete his century. Christian Eriksen added a second three minutes before the break, before Kane got his second a little more than 40 seconds after the restart. The result sees Spurs win for only the second time in 18 meetings between the clubs and Everton, who deployed Wayne Rooney from the off despite his off-field misdemeaours, can have few complaints about the final outcome. Player Ratings Everton: Pickford (5), Martina (5), Keane (6), Williams (6), Baines (5), Gueye (6), Klaassen (5), Sigurdsson (5), Schnerderlin (5), Ramirez (4), Rooney (6) Subs: Subs: Calvert-Lewin (5), Davies (5), Vlasic (3) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Trippier (6), Alderweireld (7), Vertonghen (6), Davies (8), Sanchez (6), Sissoko (6), Dier (6), Eriksen (7), Alli (7), Kane (9) Subs: Dembele (4), Winks (4), Son (2) Man of the match: Harry Kane Ronald Koeman's side began brightly and Sandro Ramirez pulled a shot just wide of the target but that was as good as it got for the hosts as Tottenham grew in stature. Ben Davies enjoyed a lot of space down the left and moments after he set up Eriksen, only for the Denmark international to miss, he assisted Moussa Sissoko but Ashley Williams was in the right place to block. Harry Kane celebrates his second goal of the game There was little Everton could do to prevent Tottenham's opener, although for a while it was debatable as to whether Kane meant to score it or not. What looked at first glance like a cross from the right had dipped late and arced over Jordan Pickford's head into the net. Team News Davinson Sanchez made his first start for Tottenham after appearing as a substitute against Burnley and he represented the only change from that match, with Heung-Min Son dropping to the bench. Everton made three changes, with Cuco Martina, Morgan Schneiderlin and Davy Klaassen all coming in. Wayne Rooney also started, despite Ronald Koeman's disappointment at his drink-driving charge, with Phil Jagielka, Mason Holgate and Tom Davies losing their places and taking seats in the dugout. What was certain is the goal had an adverse effect on the hosts - and they soon found themselves 2-0 down, with Eriksen the scorer. Again, Davies was afforded too much room when Dele Alli's cross was not cleared and the full-back's low shot was only palmed away by Pickford, with Eriksen mopping up to net. Christian Eriksen scored shortly before the break to give Tottenham a two-goal cushion Kane added a third within a minute of the restart, brilliantly executing a Davies cross with a finish which looked casual but required terrific technique. From there, it was simply a case of seeing out time, with Tottenham rarely troubled and Everton surprisingly lacklustre as they seldom looked like finding a way back into the match. Match stats It took Kane 169 games to score 100 goals for Spurs; 12 games fewer than Thierry Henry to score 100 for Arsenal (181). Kane's first goal ended a run of 25 shots without scoring in the Premier League; his second longest run in the competition. Christian Eriksen is now the joint-highest scoring Dane in Premier League history, with 32 goals (level with Nicklas Bendtner). Everton are winless in their last 10 Premier League games against Spurs (D5 L5), since a 2-1 win in December 2012. Man of the match - Harry Kane Kane admitted after the match he didn't mean his opener but that didn't take away from the convincing display of forward play he provided. Indeed, his second goal was superbly taken and he made it look far easier than it was. With August now behind him, he looks to be flourishing again. Harry kane displayed excellent technique to put Tottenham 3-0 up at Everton The managers Ronald Koeman: \"I hope we take some lessons out of this afternoon. After the lucky first goal we lost domination and we lost control of the game. How we started after half-time was really bad. The second half is something to learn from because there were several situations when I think we were too nice, too weak. You need to be more aggressive.\" Ronald Koeman hopes his Everton side learn some lessons from their 3-0 defeat to Tottenham. Ronald Koeman hopes his Everton side learn some lessons from their 3-0 defeat to Tottenham. Mauricio Pochettino: \"I'm happy Kane has scored 100 goals for Tottenham.

Leicester 1-2 Chelsea N'Golo Kante was at his destructive best as he returned to haunt Leicester City by scoring in a 2-1 win for Chelsea on Saturday. Much of the pre-match talk centred on Danny Drinkwater's immediate return to the King Power as a Chelsea player, but he was an unused substitute as Kante took centre stage. The former Foxes star, who spearheaded their charge to the Premier League title in 2016, fired home from 30 yards (50) after Alvaro Morata (41) had given Chelsea a first-half lead. The club-record £60m signing from Real Madrid takes his season tally to three and has now scored 14 goals in his last 16 appearances for club and country. Jamie Vardy netted from the penalty spot (61) but it was not enough to stop Chelsea making it three wins on the spin in the Premier League. Player ratings Home Team: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (6), Morgan (6), Maguire (6), Fuchs (6), Albrighton (6), Ndidi (6), James (6), Mahrez (6), Vardy (6), Slimani (6) Subs: Gray (6), King (6) Away Team: Courtois (6), Azpilicueta (8), Luiz (7), Rudiger (7), Moses (7), Fabregas (7), Kante (8), Alonso (7), Bakayoko (7), Morata (7), Pedro (7) Subs: Zappacosta (6), Willian (7), Hazard (6) Man of the match: N'Golo Kante Morata had spent most of the first half being thwarted by Leicester skipper Wes Morgan, who made three fantastic clearances to deny the Spaniard. However, Chelsea kept feeding the striker and he opened the scoring on 41 minutes - just 45 seconds after Islam Slimani had been denied by Thibaut Courtois after a fantastic counter-attacking move. The goal was very much made in Spain with Cesar Azpilicueta whipping in a sensational delivery from the left and Morata meeting it with a firm downward header. Alvaro Morata celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game Leicester's midfield might have been forgiven when they allowed Kante - who scored only one goal during his time with Leicester - room to shoot from 30 yards just after the break. But the Frenchman caught the effort with power and precision as the ball slipped past Kasper Schmeichel into the bottom corner. Team news Leicester made one change from the defeat at Manchester United with Islam Slimani replacing Shinji Okazaki. He partnered Jamie Vardy up front who was making his 200th league appearance. There was just one change for Chelsea too, with Tiemoué Bakayoko replacing Wilian. New signings Davide Zappacosta and Danny Drinkwater – along with Eden Hazard – featured among the substitutes. The platform looked set for Antonio Conte's men to punish Leicester on the counter attack, but it was the hosts that grabbed the initiative back on 61 minutes. Courtois was caught napping by Vardy in the area, who came on his blindside to beat him to a loose ball. The Leicester striker hit the deck under slight contact and dusted himself off to fire home from the spot on his 200th league appearance. Despite the best efforts of Riyad Mahrez, Leicester rarely looked capable of finding the equaliser against a well organised Chelsea back five. In fact, it was the visitors that came closest late on with substitute Willian curling an effort narrowly wide before being denied by Schmeichel. Riyad Mahrez prepares to take a throw in at the King Power Stadium Manager reaction Conte: \"I think we were in total control of the game, scored the first goal, the second goal. We conceded to a counter-attack when we lost the ball for the penalty, and after they tried to put some pressure on, but we created many chances to improve the scoreline.\" Craig Shakespeare: \"Performance-wise thought it was okay, looking at the commitment and endeavour. History tells you Chelsea may go on and win by three or four but we showed a lot of character and resilience.\" Match stats Chelsea recorded their first away Premier League victory in the month of September since 2012 versus Arsenal (D4 L3 before today). Since the start of the 2014-15 season, Jamie Vardy has won more penalties in the Premier League than any other player (11). Only Andrea Belotti (10) has scored more headed league goals in Europe's big five divisions since August 2016 than Alvaro Morata (9). Only Diego Costa (7) and Cesc Fabregas (6) had more goal involvements within their first four PL apps for Chelsea than Morata (5 - level with Eden Hazard). Man of the match - N'Golo Kante Few Leicester fans would begrudge Kante his moment in the sun back at the King Power. He was up to his usual wrecking-ball tricks in the Chelsea midfield, completely negating any service into Jamie Vardy's feet. But what stood him out from the rest in a solid team performance from the champions was his well struck goal which proved vital in the circumstances. Kante was scoring just his third Premier League goal of his career, having also netted against Manchester United (twice) and Watford in November 2015. What's next?

ground out an industrial 2-0 win away at Southampton thanks to superb strikes from Abdoulaye Doucoure and substitute Daryl Janmaat to maintain coach Marco Silva's unbeaten start to the season. It took a driven volley from the French midfielder which skipped off the turf and beyond Fraser Forster to break the deadlock late in the first half (38), as Saints struggled to find any rhythm in the face of the visitors' energetic pressing game. Janmaat crashed in a finely-taken second (66) for the visitors with Forster perhaps slow to react to his low drive, as Southampton took until stoppage time to register a meaningful effort on Heurelho Gomes' goal when Alves Cedric shot straight at the Brazil goalkeeper. The result stretches Saints' poor scoring form to eight blanks in their last nine games, as new boss Mauricio Pellegrino struggles to inspire his side after taking over from Claude Puel. Player ratings Southampton: Forster (5), Soares (6), Stephens (7), Hoedt (6), Bertrand (7), Davis (6), Romeu (7), Ward-Prowse (7), Boufal (5), Redmond (6), Gabbiadini (6) Subs: Long (6), Tadic (6), Austin (6) Watford: Gomes (7), Kaboul (7), Holebas (7), Carrillo (8), Kabasele (6), Femenia (6), Cleverley (7), Chalobah (8), Doucoure (7), Gray (7), Richarlison (8) Subs: Deeney (6), Mariappa (7), Janmaat (8) Man of the match: Chalobah It was a game of little goalmouth activity with much of the first half characterized by the hosts looking to release full-backs Ryan Bertrand and Alves Cedric whilst Watford harried well out of possession. Nathaniel Chalobah got the better of Oriol Romeu at St Mary's The first chance came when Saints' Sofiane Boufal made space for himself on the byline and pulled an inviting ball back into the box but there was no one in red to execute the finish. Team news Dutch debutant Wesley Hoedt started at centre-back for Saints with Virgil Van Dijk still missing.Richarlison started in attack with Andre Gray for Watford Jose Holebas bent a free-kick past Forster's post for the visitors on the half-hour mark, but it took a brilliant strike out of nothing from midfielder Doucoure to set Watford on their way, the 24-year-old whipping the ball past the Saints 'keeper from the edge of the box as Saints failed to clear. Richarlison went close to making it two with a fierce near-post drive before half time, with Forster relieved to see the ball land in the side-netting. Watford's Richarlison started against Southampton Janmaat put the game beyond the insipid hosts with a lashed finish from 30 yards after a good first touch from Tom Cleverley's header. It was the third time in Pellegrino's first four games in the St Mary's dugout that his side have failed to score, with Cedric's drive well held by Gomes doing little to alleviate the home fans' concerns. Match stats Watford enjoyed a league win over Southampton for the first time in eight attempts (W1 D3 L4); their first since October 2008 (3-0 at St Mary's). Southampton have failed to score in nine of their last 12 Premier League matches, including three of their four games so far in 2017-18. Abdoulaye Doucouré scored his 14th top-flight goal in his career, but this was his first from outside the box (Premier League & Ligue 1 combined). Watford's seven goals in the Premier League this season have come via six different goalscorers - only Abdoulaye Doucouré has scored more than once in the competition for them in 2017/18. The managers Mauricio Pellegrino: \"They were better in the first half especially with long balls and second balls. Physically they were fresher than us. They created enough to score. We have to learn from today. In the second half, we were much better but we couldn't create. \"The game is 22 players to analyse not just 11. I will talk about my team and the other manager will talk about his. They had a lot of people behind the ball and it was difficult for us.\" Southampton’s Mauricio Pellegrino says his side have to learn from their defeat at home to Watford.

Summer signing Choupo-Moting put the hosts ahead in the 43rd minute, only for United to reply before the break as Paul Pogba's header deflected in off Marcus Rashford. Romelu Lukaku fired United in front in the second half, but Choupo-Moting levelled from a corner in the 63rd minute and Lukaku spurned a chance for a winner when he swiped over from close range with 10 minutes to go. There was no handshake between the managers at the end of the game, with Mark Hughes accusing Jose Mourinho of sour grapes at the result. The draw moves United back to the top of the Premier League table, above Manchester City on goal difference. After a fast start to the game, it soon settled into a pattern as United dominated possession and forced Stoke back into their own half. Player ratings Stoke: Butland (7), Cameron (5), Zouma (7), Wimmer (5), Diouf (7), Fletcher (7), Allen (6), Pieters (6), Shaqiri (6), Jese (5), Choupo-Moting (8). Subs: Martins Indi (5), Berahino (5).

Man of the match: Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. The visitors took their time to create any chances, though, with Rashford eventually testing Jack Butland with a couple of shots from inside the box. David de Gea kept out a 25-yard shot from Xherdan Shaqiri at the other end, but Stoke had otherwise hardly threatened before Choupo-Moting swept in Mame Biram Diouf's cross in the 43rd minute. United responded swiftly as Nemanja Matic flicked on a corner and Pogba's header went in off Rashford. Team news With Ryan Shawcross out injured, Stoke handed a debut to summer signing Kevin Wimmer. United made three changes from their win over Leicester as Matteo Darmian, Marcus Rashford and Ander Herrera replaced Daley Blind, Juan Mata and Anthony Martial. Although Stoke made a positive start to the second half, it was United who struck first when Lukaku finished past Butland at the second attempt. De Gea made a superb reaction stop to deny Jese from close range, but there was nothing he could do to prevent Choupo-Moting levelling from a corner shortly afterwards. Lukaku could have won it for United when he swiped over Antonio Valencia's cross from 10 yards out, while Butland made a sharp late stop on the line to keep out a header from Kurt Zouma towards his own goal. Paul Pogba celebrates with Marcus Rashford Match stats Manchester United haven't won any of their five Premier League away games at Stoke since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 (D3 L2) - only at Chelsea, Tottenham (4 each) and Cardiff (once) have they failed to win in the league since the Scotsman left. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's opener was the first goal Manchester United had conceded in 535 minutes of Premier League football, since Harry Kane's strike at White Hart Lane in May. No player has scored more goals in their first four Premier League games for Man Utd than Romelu Lukaku (4, same as Louis Saha, Robin van Persie and Zlatan Ibrahimovic). Mark Hughes has become only the second manager to go unbeaten in four consecutive Premier League managerial clashes with Jose Mourinho, after Ronald Koeman (5 games). Man of the match - Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting While Kurt Zouma impressed at the back for Stoke, it was another of their summer signings who stood out the most. Having only scored three goals for Schalke last season, Choupo-Moting opened his Stoke account by getting ahead of Eric Bailly to sweep in a cross from the right. He then headed in from a corner to level the game in the 63rd minute. The 28-year-old held the ball up well, was positive in possession and is the first player to score a Premier League double against Manchester United since Alexis Sanchez in October 2015. The managers Mark Hughes on lack of a handshake at the final whistle: \"I pushed him because he was in my technical area, maybe that's why he didn't want to shake my hand. Maybe it's because it has to be viewed as a negative result for him, coming to Stoke when everybody expected them to beat us. \"It's a negative. Sometimes managers of top-six clubs don't take negative results too kindly. Sometimes, because they're not used to having to take negative results, sometimes they react in the wrong way. Maybe he reacted in the wrong way. Jose Mourinho: \"I think it probably is a fair result. One team wanted to win, another team wanted to draw. They defended a lot and it is becoming quite trendy in the Premier League, this way of defending now, but they did well and physically they were very strong and they probably deserved the point.\" What next? Manchester United start their Champions League campaign with a home match against Basel on Tuesday. They then welcome Wayne Rooney back on Nissan Super Sunday as Everton visit Old Trafford.

The Spaniard, on his return from suspension, played a quick free-kick to Willian on the right flank before receiving the ball back and finding Morata in the area. The striker flicked it up and nodded it back into the path of Fabregas to smartly volley home with the outside of his boot. Cesc Fabregas celebrates after putting Chelsea ahead against Everton Antonio Conte's side deservedly doubled their lead 13 minutes later when Cesar Azpilicueta delivered a quality cross into the box and Morata evaded the attention of Michael Keane before heading beyond a stranded Pickford. Muhamed Besic was named on the bench for Everton, despite reports that his father was hospitalised after being shot in Bosnia on Saturday, and was introduced by Ronald Koeman at half-time to add some steel to their midfield. Team news Eden Hazard was still not fit enough to make the Chelsea squad, but Pedro and Cesc Fabragas started. Gylfi Sigurdsson started his first Premier League game for Everton. And Everton enjoyed their first chance of the match five minutes after the break when Wayne Rooney, playing for the first time since announcing his international retirement this week, released Sandro Ramirez - only to see the Spaniard scuff his shot. Chelsea wasted a number of chances to score a third as Pedro fizzed a shot narrowly wide and Victor Moses shot straight at Pickford after finding himself in space in the Everton penalty area. Alvaro Morata celebrates scoring Chelsea's second goal The visitors enjoyed a flurry of late chances as Ashley Williams' speculative effort landed on the roof of the net and he then headed Gylfi Sigurdsson's cross narrowly wide, while Idrissa Gueye forced Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to tip a long-range drive over the bar. But Everton were ultimately second best as they suffered their first defeat of the season. Opta stats Chelsea are unbeaten in their last 23 home Premier League games against Everton since a 1-0 loss in November 1994 (W13 D10). Everton have conceded 10 goals against Chelsea under Ronald Koeman, more than twice as many against any other opponent during his tenure at the club. Alvaro Morata is the first player in Premier League history to both score and assist a goal in each of his first two home games. In fact, both of his goals have been scored with his head and both assists have been headed passes. Everton had three touches in the opposition box before the 85th minute in this match - in the final five minutes (and injury time) they had four. The managers Antonio Conte praised the performance of Morata after the match, and for the manner his side built on the victory at Tottenham last weekend. Conte said: \"We must be pleased because we played a really good game. The players performed very well. We dominated and created many chances and kept a clean sheet which is very important. \"If I have to pick one negative aspect, I think we have to be more clinical. In the second-half, we had chances to close the game, and we have to do this.\" Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says his side need to be more ruthless in front of goal if they are going to kill off games this season. Chelsea boss Antonio Conte says his side need to be more ruthless in front of goal if they are going to kill off games this season. Ronald Koeman rued his side's profligacy with the ball, claiming the contest was lost in the first half, but the Everton manager is hopeful of bringing in a striker before the close of the transfer window. Koeman said: \"We did many mistakes. The side is comfortable in any system but in ball possession we must improve. \"Everyone knows the situation, let's hope we can do some business for next week. We have continued talks about the squad. Everyone knows we need a striker to bring in.\" Man of the match - Willian Willian battles for possession with Phil Jagielka Fabregas and Morata will make the headlines after scoring the goals, but Willian's energy, industry and creativity were crucial to Chelsea's success. The Brazilian dovetailed brilliantly with Pedro behind lone striker Morata and the Everton defence struggled to contain his runs all afternoon. He made four key passes in the game - more than any other player - and only a goal was missing to complete his performance.

The hosts had looked set to extend their perfect start to the Premier League season when Jay Rodriguez broke the deadlock in a low-key contest with a 61st-minute header - his first league goal for the club. But defender Ahmed Hegazi inexplicably swiped at a ball goalkeeper Ben Foster had come to claim and Crouch, not long off the bench, stooped to gleefully nod into an open net with 13 minutes remaining. Foster was incensed after his team-mate denied Albion the chance to join Manchester United at the top of the fledgling table, but Stoke, who saw two half-hearted penalty appeals waved away in the first half, might have snatched victory late on and a draw seemed fair. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (5), Nyom (7), Dawson (6), Hegazi (4), Brunt (5), Phillips (5), Livermore (5), Barry (7), Morrison (5), Rodriguez (6), Rondon (6) Subs used: Yacob (5), McClean (5), Burke (NA) Stoke: Butland (6), Zouma (6), Shawcross (6), Cameron (6), Martins Indi (6), Fletcher (6), Allen (6), Pieters (5), Shaqiri (6), Jese (5), Choupo-Moting (5). Subs: Crouch (6), Sobhi (6) Man of the match: Allan Nyom Jay Rodriguez scored the opener for West Brom Salomon Rondon's bulk had helped earn a couple of early home corners but James Morrison's fifth-minute header bounced up off the turf and wide as Stoke settled in the sunshine. The Baggies' first-half threat failed to extend much beyond set-pieces but Mark Hughes' side struggled to make possession count against typically organised opposition. The half's best chance fell to Kurt Zouma, his snapshot (24) taking a hefty deflection off Gareth Barry and sending Foster scrambling across his goal. Team news Tony Pulis brought in James Morrison and Salomon Rondon for Sam Field and James McClean, while Bruno Martins-Indi replaced Mame Biram Diouf for Stoke. Jean-Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting fell in the area over Chris Brunt's boot but referee Anthony Taylor was unmoved by the exaggerated tumble as well as the tussle, and another penalty appeal when a ball struck Brunt's arm (41) was rightly dismissed. Saido Berahino drew boos as he warmed up in front of former fans, but a dour contest was finally elevated when Allan Nyom gave Xherdan Shaquiri the slip and whipped in a ball that Rodriguez darted in front of his man to meet. Xherdan Shaqiri and Gareth Barry challenge for the ball in the first half Hughes called for Crouch but it was Hegazi who offered the aerial threat when he met a lofted free-kick (65), before Rodriguez saw a looping header hit the bar. Albion were suddenly in the ascendancy but their momentum was surrendered when Ramadan Sobhi lofted in an innocuous-looking ball, only for Hegazi to make an unwanted intervention. Choupo-Moting had a late chance to further punish the hosts but could only lash the ball into the side-netting as the teams settled for a point heading into the international break. Crouch celebrates scoring the equaliser for Stoke Opta stats Tony Pulis is yet to lose a Premier League game against former side Stoke (W5 D2). Stoke avoided defeat in the Premier League after going behind for the first time since November 2016 against West Ham - they had lost their last 13 in a row when they'd fallen behind. Jay Rodriguez has scored three Premier League goals against Stoke - against no side has he scored more (also three against Newcastle United). Only six players have scored more Premier League goals as a substitute than Peter Crouch (13). The managers Tony Pulis: \"It was disappointing. For all their possession I didn't think that they created all that many clear-cut chances. \"These things happen. They bring Crouchy on and without him doing anything his presence unnerves defenders. That is what Peter has done again today. I didn't see them scoring. As soon as we scored I thought we would win the game.\" Tony Pulis was disappointed his side failed to take three points in their Premier League match with Stoke Tony Pulis was disappointed his side failed to take three points in their Premier League match with Stoke Mark Hughes: \"I think (a point) was the least that we deserved in terms of performance. I thought that we knocked on the door all afternoon. \"It wasn't a great game I have to say. I didn't particularly enjoy it as a spectacle or even being involved at management level. It was frustrating to say the least but I never expected anything different.\" Man of the match - Allan Nyom The 29-year-old Cameroon defender was superb for West Brom in what was a battle of two defences for the majority of the 90 minutes at the Hawthorns. Nyom had Jese in his pocket for the first half - forcing Mark Hughes to bring him off at half-time - and saw his deep, calculated cross headed home by Rodriguez for the opener in the second half. Nyom would have been going home with a deserved clean sheet were it not for Hegazi's error late on, but the individual gong is his. Special mention to Gareth Barry, who controlled the Albion midfield, and won all six of his tackles - more than any other player. What next? West Brom travel to Brighton on September 9, while Stoke host a buoyant Manchester United side that have won three and scored 10 without reply in their first three games."}, {"date": "27/08/2018",

heaped more away-day Premier League misery on Arsenal with a swaggering 4-0 victory on Super Sunday. Jurgen Klopp's front three of Roberto Firmino (11), Sadio Mane (42) and Mohamed Salah (57) all found the net, as did substitute Daniel Sturridge (77) as the Reds showed no ill-effects of missing Philippe Coutinho, who continues to be linked with Barcelona. The Gunners are now winless in their last 13 league away games against last season's top six teams while - in contrast - the vibrant Reds are unbeaten in their last 11 league matches versus the same clubs. Despite hefty speculation about the futures of Alexis Sanchez and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsene Wenger, who was subject of chants to be sacked from the away end, started both, while new signing Alexandre Lacazette was left out. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville said 5 of Arsenal's key players failed to stick to basic football principles in their 4-0 defeat to Liverpool. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville said 5 of Arsenal's key players failed to stick to basic football principles in their 4-0 defeat to Liverpool. But it was a humbling afternoon for all concerned at Arsenal, who failed to register a shot on target during the 90 minutes. There have been 38 goals scored in the last nine Premier League fixtures (an average of 4.2 goals per game) between these two and Liverpool took just 17 minutes to get rolling. Player Ratings Liverpool: Karius (6), Gomez (7), Matip (6), Lovren (7), Moreno (7), Henderson (7), Can (8), Wijnaldum (7), Mane (8), Salah (8), Firmino (8) Subs: Sturridge (7), Milner (6), Grujic (6) Arsenal: Cech (7), Holding (5), Monreal (5), Koscielny (5), Oxlade-Chamberlain (3), Xhaka (5), Bellerin (4), Ramsey (3), Sanchez (6), Ozil (6), Welbeck (6) Subs: Coquelin (6), Giroud (6), Lacazette (6) Man of the match: Mohamed Salah Petr Cech had already stopped a certain goal from Salah when Granit Xhaka lost possession down the right, which gave Joe Gomez a chance to deliver. He found Firmino with a peach of a cross and the Brazilian headed home from 12 yards. Salah missed a glorious chance to open the scoring early on The Reds were rip-roaring through the Arsenal midfield at regular intervals and doubled their lead just before half-time. Team news Simon Mignolet was dropped from the squad so Loris Karius started in goal. Joe Gomez started in defence ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold, but otherwise it was the same team that beat Hoffenheim in midweek. For Arsenal, Alexis Sanchez returned to the starting XI while Laurent Koscielny returned from suspension. Summer signings Alexandre Lacazette and Sead Kolasinac both dropped to the bench. Firmino played it out to the left for Mane, who checked into the box before curling a brilliant shot into the far corner, beyond Cech's dive. Wenger tried to tighten up his midfield at half-time by bringing on Francis Coquelin for Aaron Ramsey, however, the mistakes at the back kept on coming. Hector Bellerin was caught in possession by Salah on half-way and the speedy winger sailed through on goal. Cech came out to meet him but the Liverpool man finished calmly for 3-0. That wasn't the end of the torture for the away end as substitute Sturridge took just five minutes to add his name to the scoresheet with a back post header following a pin-point Salah cross. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry said he wanted to leave Anfield during Arsenal's 4-0 humiliation at the hands of Liverpool. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry said he wanted to leave Anfield during Arsenal's 4-0 humiliation at the hands of Liverpool. Man of the match - Mohamed Salah A close call between the winger and Can, who set the platform with a monstrous performance in midfield. However, Salah's trickery, speed and creativity proved a constant thorn in the side of a sloppy Arsenal defence. He more than deserved his goal. Opta stats This was Arsenal's heaviest Premier League defeat since a 0-4 loss to Southampton at St. Mary's on Boxing Day 2015. Four of Arsenal's eight Premier League defeats by a margin of 4+ goals have come against Liverpool at Anfield. Arsenal have lost their first two Premier League away games in a season for only the second time under Wenger (the other was 2005-06). Only West Ham United (10) have conceded more Premier League goals this season than Arsenal (8). Arsenal didn't attempt a single shot on target in this match - the first time they haven't had one in a Premier League game since October 5th 2014 (vs Chelsea). Sadio Mané is only the 3rd player to score in the first 3 PL games of a season for Liverpool (after Robbie Fowler in 1994-95 & Daniel Sturridge in 2013-14). The pundit Gary Neville: \"Ozil, Sanchez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Xhaka, Ramsey, they didn't do most basic things I think every fan, manager, and player knows - when the ball goes past you and it goes towards your goal and your team-mates are struggling, you run back as quickly as you can. I'm naming those five - there may be more - but that is absolutely disgraceful. That doesn't represent the Arsenal shirt or what they're about and they've let themselves down.\" Read Gary Neville's full damning verdict on Arsenal.

The result means Tottenham's wait for a league win at Wembley will extend past the international break, while Burnley have taken four points from trips to Chelsea and Spurs. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (6), Trippier (4), Alderweireld (5), Vertonghen (6), Davies (5), Dier (5), Dembele (6), Son (5), Alli (7), Eriksen (5), Kane (6) Subs: Sanchez (6), Sissoko (6), Winks (6) Burnley: Heaton (8), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (8), Mee (7), Brady (8), Defour (6), Cork (7), Gudmundsson (6), Ward (7), Arfield (7), Vokes (6) Subs: Wood (8), Westwood (6), Barnes (6) Man of the match: Robbie Brady The visitors' game-plan worked perfectly in the first half as they blunted Tottenham's attack and threatened from set-plays. James Tarkowski flashed a header over before reacting sharply in his own box to block Harry Kane's shot from close range. But Burnley fell behind four minutes after the break when Alli scored his second goal of the new season. The England international reacted quickest after Ben Mee failed to clear a corner, converting at the second attempt past Tom Heaton. Team news Chris Wood enjoyed a dream second-half cameo for Burnley, while Davinson Sanchez came on in stoppage time for his Tottenham debut. Kane, one goal short of a century for Tottenham in all competitions, had several second-half opportunities but failed to break his August duck. Heaton denied his England team-mate twice and also saved smartly from Alli as Spurs pushed for a second to make the points safe. But Burnley battled back into the game as Sean Dyche introduced Wood, swapping Robbie Brady to the right flank, and the two combined to earn a deserved draw. Match stats Spurs failed to beat Burnley in a home league game for the first time since October 1974. Harry Kane has failed to score in every Premier League match he has played in August (13 games), despite attempting 42 shots in those games. Chris Wood scored his first Premier League goal for 1107 days, since he scored for Leicester City against Everton in August 2014.

Sean Dyche was pleased after substitute Chris Wood’s late equaliser helped Burnley to draw 1-1 against Tottenham. Sean Dyche: \"Robbie Brady put a fine pass in, we know Robbie has quality. He took a bit of time to adapt to us last season but he came back pre-season with a real thirst for doing well and he has certainly started well. \"But what a finish too from Chris [Wood], a great run. There were many pleasing things today. \"I must mention Tom Heaton as well, he made two or three great saves when it was very important.\" Man of the match - Robbie Brady The winger was quiet in the first half as Burnley soaked up pressure but came to life after the break when Dyche moved him to the right. Always capable of a dangerous delivery, he gave Ben Davies a difficult afternoon and his inch-perfect pass released Wood to fire home the equaliser. What next? Tottenham will travel to Everton on Saturday, September 9, when Premier League action returns following the international break. As for Burnley, they will look to maintain their strong start to the season at home to struggling Crystal Palace the following day, live on Super Sunday on Sky Sports Premier League."}, {"date": "26/08/2018", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10419, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [23], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["73"], "sub_off": ["90+4"]}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["90+4"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": ["56"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": ["67"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Mendy", "yellows": ["79"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": ["56"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["90+10"]}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["66"]}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["82"]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": ["90+3"], "reds": ["90+9"], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:56 Bournemouth 1-2 Man City - watch highlights Bournemouth 1-2 Man City - watch highlights Raheem Sterling scored a 97th-minute winner and was then sent off as Manchester City came from behind to overcome a stubborn Bournemouth 2-1 in a dramatic finale at the Vitality Stadium. The England international, who received a second yellow for his celebration, saw his shot deflect in off Andrew Surman after the initial six minutes of added time had been played to cruelly deny the Cherries their first point of the season. The drama came just as it seemed the points would be shared after a pulsating clash that saw Charlie Daniels' 13th-minute thunderbolt cancelled out by Gabriel Jesus equaliser. But Sterling had the final word as Bournemouth were left pointless ahead of a daunting run of fixtures after the international break. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Daniels (9), Cook (5), Smith (6), Mings (6), Ake (5), Surman (5), Arter (5), Gosling (5), King (6), Defoe (5). Subs: Afobe (5), Mousset (n/a). Man City: Ederson (6), Danilo (5), Kompany (7), Otamendi (6), Mendy (6), Fernandinho (5), D. Silva (6), Sterling (7), De Bruyne (5), B. Silva (5), Jesus (9). Subs: Stones (n/a), Aguero (5), Sane (5). Man of the Match: Gabriel Jesus Keen to atone for defeats in their first two games of the season, Bournemouth started with intensity and enthusiasm and got their just rewards as Daniels' notched the Cherries' first Premier League goal against City with an arrowed stunner. Jermain Defoe nearly scored their second two minutes later, connecting with an Andrew Surman cross, but City stopper Ederson kept his side within reach. And within three minutes, the visitors were level as David Silva dissected the defence to find Jesus, who poked the ball beyond Asmir Begovic with a first-time finish (21). Things could have gone from bad to worse for Bournemouth, who were fortunate not to have Nathan Ake sent off for bringing Jesus down, after he pounced as the defender dithered in possession. Charlie Daniels celebrates his sensational opener against City City dominated until the interval but the game burst to life on the hour as Josh King rattled the frame of the City goal after connecting with Daniels' cross. Having both scored in the first period, Nicolas Otamendi ensured both struck the woodwork with a 74th-minute header. Team news Eddie Howe made three changes for Bournemouth after their defeat to Watford, handing starts to Tyrone Mings, Dan Gosling and Jermain Defoe, who made his second full debut for the Cherries, 17 years on from the first. Benjamin Mendy made his long-awaited Man City debut as Pep Guardiola made four changes, as John Stones, Sergio Aguero, Leroy Sane and the suspended Kyle Walker dropped out. But City breached Begovic for the second time at the death as Sterling found the net, and was given his marching orders before the celebrations on the touchline and in the stands had the chance to subside. Man of the Match - Gabriel Jesus Such was the brilliance of Charlie Daniels' opener, and all-round display, it needed something special to outdo the Cherries full-back - but the brightest of City's stars of the future did just that. Gabriel Jesus celebrates his equaliser with Fernandinho Having been given the nod ahead the visibly unhappy Sergio Aguero, Jesus lead the line with the youthful exuberance Pep Guardiola so carves, while his neat finish laid the foundation for the most dramatic of comebacks. Opta stats Bournemouth have lost their first three league games in a campaign for the first time since 1994-95 in the third tier. Since the start of the 2015-16 season, only West Ham (41) have dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League than Bournemouth (39 - level with Liverpool). Manchester City have gone 11 Premier League games without defeat for the first time since September 2015 (W8 D3). Gabriel Jesus has been directly involved in 12 goals in his 11 Premier League starts for Man City (eight goals, four assists). Charlie Daniels netted his eighth goal in the Premier League but this was his first from outside the box. Pep Guardiola's men have seven points from their opening three games The managers Eddie Howe: \"My message is that I'm proud of them. If we carry on like that, we'll be fine and pick up a lot of points this season. There's no need to panic at this stage.\" Pep Guardiola: \"We are happy with the victory especially after they scored such an outstanding goal...after Daniels' goal we played quite good - we could've scored one or two goals. We tried to attack against eleven players defending. We tried to play the channels with players running in behind. At the end, we deserved the victory.\" The pundit Jamie Redknapp: For a referee to send him [Sterling] off for that? Come on man! Show a bit of compassion. It's very hard to restrain yourself - if the referee doesn't book him, do you think anyone will have a problem? The referee can turn a blind eye. What's next? Bournemouth will have to mull over a third Premier League game without victory during the international break, but have two weeks to regroup ahead of their next league game, away to Arsenal on September 9.

either side of half time were enough to help Swansea secure a 2-0 win at Crystal Palace, the Eagles' third defeat in a row. With their first shot on target of the season one minute before half-time, Tammy Abraham brilliantly guided the ball home to give the visitors a deserved lead. Three minutes after the break and it was two, as Jordan Ayew capitalised on a Palace error to double Swansea's lead. Frank de Boer rung the changes to try to get his side back in the game, but Palace lacked any imagination in attack - lumping long balls down the middle which were easily dealt with - and remain pointless and goalless this campaign. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (5), Ward (6), Van Aanholt (6), Fosu-Mensah (5), Milivojevic (6), Tomkins (5), Dann (5), Townsend (6), McArthur (5), Puncheon (5), Benteke (4).

Man of the match: Tammy Abraham The first half was a cagey affair, with Palace looking especially out of sorts and failing to muster a single effort on target for the entire opening period. Swansea should really have taken the lead in the fourth minute, but Ayew headed wide from a good position. Abraham went close after showing great willingness to chase down a lost cause, forcing Timothy Fosu-Mensah into an error, before prodding at goal. Wayne Hennessey was equal to that attempt, but could do nothing as the 19-year-old broke the deadlock just before the interval. Team news Sam Clucas went straight into the Swansea starting line up for his debut. With Ruben Loftus-Cheek missing for Palace, James McArthur was handed a start, after two goals in midweek. Leroy Fer had time to line up the cross, sending it in Abraham's direction before the ungainly hitman stumbled, but adjusted his feet superbly to guide the ball home. Palace were then masters of their own downfall as Ayew netted the second three minutes after the interval. Jordan Ayew celebrates after doubling Swansea City's lead Martin Kelly dawdled on the ball, Kyle Naughton nipped in, threaded the ball through for Ayew, who beat Hennessey to the ball, before walking it into the net. Andros Townsend led the response for Palace, but failed to find the target from four long-range efforts. The service up to Benteke was non-existent and De Boer has plenty of work to do to turn things round at Selhurst Park. Patrick van Aanholt and Leroy Fer battle for possession Opta stats Abraham celebrates his first Premier League goal Crystal Palace have lost seven of their last eight Premier League matches, failing to score in each defeat. Jordan Ayew has scored two goals in his last four Premier League as many as in his previous 29 games combined in the competition. Tammy Abraham is only the second teenager to score a Premier League goal for Swansea after Ben Davies in January 2013. Abraham's strike was Swansea's first shot on target in the Premier League this season ending a run of 223 minutes without one. Managers De Boer: \"Games are normally decided by mistakes, not because of a fantastic attack by opponents \"It was more our fault than the quality of Swansea. They had two half chances and scored two goals. We had four or five half chances, two very good ones, but didn't score. We need to get off the mark as quick as we can. \"We weren't comfortable in the way we played first half. Swansea didn't play well either. They played the same system as us, with one spare man at the back.\" Despite winning 2-0 at Crystal Palace, Swansea’s Paul Clement insists that there’s still more work to be done. Despite winning 2-0 at Crystal Palace, Swansea’s Paul Clement insists that there’s still more work to be done. Clement: \"The players recognise there is improvement to be made. And we are going to be working hard with the players that remain with us, over the international break. \"An away win in the Premier League is always difficult, and after the start we have had it was an important game to win. We can now say we have had a decent start to the season.\" Man of the match - Tammy Abraham With a frame like that, Abraham shouldn't have such fine balance and technique, but the 19-year-old displayed his array of talents at Selhurst Park, much to the delight of the travelling Swansea faithful. He took his goal brilliantly, but it was his classy touch which stood out in a match of low quality. Frank de Boer wasn’t impressed by Crystal Palace’s ‘very bad’ first half performance in their home defeat to Swansea. Frank de Boer wasn’t impressed by Crystal Palace’s ‘very bad’ first half performance in their home defeat to Swansea. The pundit Paul Merson: Something has to change [at Palace]. Sammy Lee is there, he is a great football man. There is nothing wrong with getting the ball forward every now and then. You are asking defenders to do things [keep possession] they are not comfortable doing. Last season, defenders would just lump the ball forward, job done. What's next?

to life in the Premier League with a 0-0 draw against Southampton at the John Smith's Stadium on Saturday. The hosts enjoyed the better of the first half as Steve Mounie drew a smart stop from Fraser Forster, while Nathan Redmond squandered an excellent early chance for the Saints. Southampton improved after the break and pushed for a winner in the final 10 minutes as substitute James Ward-Prowse had a penalty appeal turned down, while Jonas Lossl kept out Redmond's side-foot effort and Ryan Bertrand saw a header cleared off the line. The result means Huddersfield have two wins and a draw from three Premier League games and they have kept three consecutive league clean sheets. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Smith (8), Billing (6), Kachunga (6), Mooy (7), Lowe (7), van La Parra (6), Ince (6), Mounie (6), Jorgensen (7), Schindler (7) Subs: Quaner (6), Palmer (7), Williams (6) Southampton: Forster (6), Soares (7), Yoshida (7), Stephens (7), Bertrand (6), Romeu (7), Lemina (7), Davis (6), Tadic (6), Redmond (6), Gabbiadini (6) Subs: Long (7), Ward-Prowse (6), McQueen (6) Man of the match: Tommy Smith Huddersfield largely controlled the first 45 minutes but the best opening fell to Redmond, who fired wide when one-on-one with Lossl. Forster then denied Mounie with a point-blank save as the hosts upped the tempo and the Southampton goalkeeper almost gifted the Terriers the lead shortly before the break. He fumbled a deep cross straight into the path of Elias Kachunga but recovered to keep the score level. The visitors stepped up a gear in the second half and Manolo Gabbiadini - otherwise isolated for much of the match - forced Lossl into a low save with a shot from the edge of the area. Team news Both teams were unchanged from their previous Premier League matches, with Southampton's summer signing Wesley Hoedt an unused substitute on the bench. Mauricio Pellegrino introduced Shane Long and the Irishman made a difference, creating three opportunities in quick succession in the final stages. Ward-Prowse wanted a penalty after racing onto Long's pass and tumbling under the challenge of Mathias Jorgensen before Long teed up Redmond to test Lossl with a curling strike. There was still time for Southampton to fashion one more opening, with Long again involved. He chipped up a cross for an onrushing Bertrand but the full-back miscued his header, allowing Tommy Smith to hack clear. Opta stats Huddersfield have kept a clean sheet in each of their opening three games to a league season for the first time since 1965-66 (second tier). Southampton have failed to score in eight of their last 11 Premier League games, scoring just seven goals from 144 shots in these matches (4.9%). Saints have remained unbeaten in their opening three games of a Premier League season for just the second time (also 2003-04). Southampton’s Mauricio Pellegrino praises Huddersfield’s setup following their 0-0 draw Southampton’s Mauricio Pellegrino praises Huddersfield’s setup following their 0-0 draw Man of the match - Tommy Smith The Huddersfield captain was a rock at right-back and helped keep Southampton's attacking trio quiet for much of the match. Redmond and Dusan Tadic had little joy, while Smith looked more adventurous in attack than opposite number Bertrand. He bailed out his side late on too, clearing Bertrand's header off the line in stoppage time to preserve a clean sheet and a share of the spoils. The managers David Wagner: \"At the end maybe the fair result is a draw. I think it was one of the better 0-0 draws we have seen, especially from my side. \"In the first half after Southampton missed their first clear chance, we played very good, we created good opportunities, we were very aggressive on crosses and we kept them away from our goal. We really were in their face so I was really happy with the first half. In the second half we had some moments as well, but Southampton showed why they are one of the best teams in this division.\" David Wagner says Huddersfield’s confidence will only improve following a third Premier League clean sheet in a row. David Wagner says Huddersfield’s confidence will only improve following a third Premier League clean sheet in a row. Mauricio Pellegrino: \"It could have been three points, one point or nil because it was really tough in the beginning. \"Huddersfield are really well prepared especially in their style of play, with the long ball and second ball. On crosses we were in trouble at some moments. \"At the same time we had two chances in the first half and in the end, the last 15 or 20 minutes, we put them under pressure with our chances.\" The pundit Phil Thompson: \"I've been a big critic of Maya Yoshida in the past but what a terrific game he had. \"He is getting better and better alongside Jack Stephens. The two of them were under heavy pressure at times as Huddersfield crossed so many balls into the box. But the two of them were absolutely fantastic today for Southampton.\" What next? The international break means Huddersfield will have to wait until September 11 for a chance to keep their dream Premier League start going.

their first Premier League victory of the season, beating winless West Ham 3-0 at St James' Park on Saturday. Joselu netted the opener on his full Newcastle debut in the first half, finishing into an empty net after Christian Atsu's unselfish square ball. Newcastle grabbed a second with 18 minutes remaining through Ciaran Clark, who rose to head home Matt Ritchie's fine ball from the right. Player ratings Newcastle: Elliot (6), Manquillo (7), Lascelles (7), Mbemba (7), Clark (7), Hayden (7), Merino (7), Ritchie (8), Atsu (7), Perez (7), Joselu (7) Subs: Mitrovic (7), Diame (NA), Murphy (NA) West Ham: Hart (6), Zabaleta (5), Ogbonna (5), Collins (5), Cresswell (5), Noble (6), Rice (4), Antonio (5), Ayew (6), Fernandez (5), Chicharito (5) Subs: Kouyate (5), Lanzini (5), Sakho (5) Man of the match: Matt Ritchie Sub Alexandar Mitrovic put the cherry on the cake after rounding Joe Hart in the 86th minute, and the result means West Ham are bottom of the Premier League with no points and 10 goals conceded from three games. During a first half lacking in chances, Newcastle eventually took the lead on 36 minutes through summer signing Joselu. After young Declan Rice gave the ball away 35 yards from his goal, Atsu was released through on Joe Hart, before squaring for Joselu to bundle home in front of the Gallowgate End. Team news For Newcastle, new signing Joselu replaced Dwight Gayle, while for West Ham, James Collins and Edimilson Fernandes came in for Jose Fonte and the suspended Marko Arnautovic. Joe Hart saves from Ayoze Perez at St James' Park Hart was forced into a save early in the second half from Ayoze Perez's cross-shot, before Javier Hernandez failed to shuffle his feet quickly enough to turn home Aaron Cresswell's parried shot on the rebound from eight yards. The impressive Ritchie nearly netted just after the hour mark, Hart getting down low to save his 20-yard effort, but the Scot did have a big part to play in Newcastle's second. After wrestling the ball free on the right, Ritchie's fine ball was plum on the head of defender Clark, who found the net off the far post with a header. Hart did well to deny Mitrovic late on from an angle, but the Serbian got his goal with four minutes remaining, rounding the goalkeeper and netting after Perez's deft ball allowed him through on goal. Michail Antonio looks to break through the Newcastle defence Opta stats West Ham have lost all three of their Premier League games this season - the last time that they did this was in 2010/11, when they ended the season bottom of the league. This was the 18th time (in 79 games) that West Ham have conceded three or more goals in a Premier League match under Slaven Bilic, including all three games this season. Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored five and assisted two more in his last 10 Premier League appearances. It's now 22 league appearances without a clean sheet for Joe Hart (Premier League & Serie A combined) - last keeping one on January 8th for Torino vs Sassuolo. In fact, Joe Hart has conceded 20 goals in his last six appearances in league competition. Joselu has now scored in five different Premier League matches and has ended on the winning side on each occasion.

Great performance, I think the way everybody was working for the team at the end made the difference. When you have this effort from players, fans enjoy and they're even more behind the them. \"When you are working hard, doing well, and score the goal, the confidence is growing.\" Slaven Bilic: \"They were the better team, it's very disappointing, frustrating that we played the way we played.

Alan McInally praises midfielder Mikel Merino after his performance helped Newcastle to a 3-0 win over West Ham. Man of the match - Matt Ritchie He may not have scored, but midfielder Ritchie was the star of the show on what was initially a nervy afternoon at St James' Park. Ritchie was the livewire throughout a tense first 45 minutes, and his tenacious closing down of Manuel Lanzini and cross with his so-called weaker foot for Newcastle's second goal was simply superb. Ritchie demanded the ball throughout, and had more touches than any other player (54), while testing West Ham's defence with 10 crosses into the box. What's next? After the international break, Newcastle go to Swansea on September 10 for Super Sunday.

but will feel they should have taken all three against their 10-man hosts. Watford's Miguel Britos was rightly shown a straight red card for a wild, knee-high lunge at Anthony Knockaert on 24 minutes. But despite playing 66 minutes with a man advantage, Brighton were unable to make the breakthrough, managing just two shots on target against their resolute opponents. Knockaert had already hit the post with a curling left-foot effort when Britos was dismissed and Tomer Hemed struck the other upright with a deflected effort off Christian Kabasele as the visitors pushed to make the most of their numerical advantage before the interval.

Referee Graham Scott judged Doucoure to have missed his opponent and refused appeals for a penalty, as Brighton - who are yet to score in three Premier League outings - struggled to trouble goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes. Nathaniel Chalobah - celebrating his first England call-up - went close to opening the scoring on nine minutes, when his goal-bound header from Tom Cleverley's free-kick had to be hacked clear by Lewis Dunk as Watford had the better of the early exchanges. Referee Graham Scott shows a red card to Miguel Britos of Watford However, Brighton - who had lost their first two Premier League fixtures to Manchester City and Leicester - eventually began to get a foothold, with livewire Knockaert clipping a left foot shot from the right against the far post. Britos' recklessness then handed the visitors even more momentum, and the impressive Solly March carved out another good opening, but a combination of Hemed and defender Kabasele sent the ball onto the woodwork again. Team news Etienne Capoue was back on the bench despite scoring twice in his last two appearances for Watford. Christian Kabasele came in to replace the suspended Jose Holebas, while new loan signing Andre Carrillo was among the subs. Brighton's club-record signing Jose Izquierdo started on the bench but Chris Hughton had fit-again Anthony Knockaert back in his first XI. Tomer Hemed also started but Glenn Murray - who started against Leicester - was out of the squad, while Jamie Murphy was on the bench. Chalobah again showed his class with a low, arrowed shot just past the Brighton goal, but the Hornets were increasingly on the back foot and their cause wasn't helped when Craig Cathcart, who had come on following Britos' sending off, pulled up seconds after half-time. Kiko Femenia produced a superb sliding challenge to prevent Pascal Gross latching on to March's cross on 50 minutes before March tried his luck from range, Dunk hit an indirect free-kick inside the Watford box over the bar and Knockaert mis-directed a header from a good position. Still Brighton couldn't find the decisive blow. Indeed, Gomes' only real work of the second period came when Knockaert fired across goal from range, the keeper parrying well, as Watford threatened to strike on the counter, with the lively Richarlison leading several pacey charges up-field. But the hosts failed to unleash a shot on target at all as the spoils were shared. Opta stats Since August 2015, Watford haven't lost at home to a newly-promoted side in the competition (W3 D3 L0) and have conceded just one goal in these six games. Watford didn't attempt a single shot on target in this match - they only did this on one occasion at Vicarage Road in both 2015-16 (v Southampton) and 2016-17 (v Hull). Brighton have failed to score in their first three Premier League games of 2017-18. Before this season, 11 teams had done this and none of those sides ended the season in the relegation zone. Watford have been given six red cards since the start of last season in the Premier League; a joint-high alongside Manchester City and West Ham United.

Chris Hughton says Brighton’s 0-0 draw at Watford was their best performance so far in the Premier League. Man of match - Anthony Knockaert Making his first Premier League start of the season, Brighton ace Knockaert provided the attacking creativity this team badly need. Anthony Knockaert impressed for Brighton While the Seagulls have once again gone goalless, Knockaert looked like their best chance of breaking the deadlock throughout the contest. He hit the post with a fine curling effort with his left, and forced Gomes to parry a similar strike just before the break. He was fortunate not to be injured by Britos' fierce challenge, but that was a result of Knockaert getting the better of his marker repeatedly in the opening quarter of the game. He remained a threat in the second half, drawing a decent stop from Gomes with a long-range effort before being withdrawn late on. The pundit Charlie Nicholas: \"Brighton were slow starters today but the red card gave them a different angle on the game. They really should have won. They hit the post twice in the first half. They had some half decent chances. But the didn't have the know-how, the craft to make the change. Brighton missed an opportunity. \"Watford were counter-attacking but they couldn't really get it going. It took 84 minutes before they brought Troy Deeney on. Andre Gray hardly got a sniff all day. What's the future for Deeney? I think he'll be away. The tackle from Britos was a shocker. He knows he can't get near the ball and he jumps off the floor and takes out Knockaert. He should go an apologise to Knockaert.\" Watford manager Marco Silva says Miguel Britos’ red card looks like a fair decision having seen replays of the challenge. Watford manager Marco Silva says Miguel Britos’ red card looks like a fair decision having seen replays of the challenge. The managers Marco Silva, Watford: \"Tough game, really tough game.

At half-time we changed some things in our organisation. We worked together, showed good organisation. Brighton created more and more moments to finish. But that's normal. Our boys worked really hard and showed fantastic spirit.\" Chris Hughton, Brighton: \"It's a penalty because if you look at the cut on Knockaert's nose he has caught him. The referee hasn't given it because he's not sure. Unfortunately for us on this occasion it's gone very much against us. As a team that has just been promoted we need to get whatever points we can. But I'm really pleased with how we went about our work today.\" What next? After the international break, Watford travel to Southampton and Brighton host West Brom. Both games are 3pm kick-offs on Saturday 9 September."}, {"date": "26/08/2018", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75021, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [53], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["76"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["67"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["74"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": ["90+5"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": ["89"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["60"]}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["60"]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["76"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Islam Slimani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:36 Man Utd 2-0 Leicester Man Utd 2-0 Leicester Manchester United maintained their 100 per cent start to the Premier League season as they beat Leicester 2-0 on Saturday evening. Jose Mourinho's side have won all three of their opening league matches, keeping three clean sheets in the process, and have already hit double figures for goals scored so far this term (10). They dominated much of the game and after Romelu Lukaku saw an early second-half penalty saved by Kasper Schmeichel, Marcus Rashford broke the deadlock on the 70-minute mark just three minutes after coming on as a substitute. Marouane Fellaini took slightly longer after his introduction to add United's second, with his knee directing home Jesse Lingard's cross in the 82nd minute to seal another win for the hosts. Manchester United dominated the first half and could have taken the lead in the 19th minute. Lukaku saw a powerful effort pushed away by Schmeichel, but the ball landed at the feet of the waiting Juan Mata who slotted home, only to see the offside flag raised and the goal ruled out. Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Valencia (6), Bailly (7), Jones (7), Blind (6), Pogba (7), Matic (6), Mata (7), Mkhitaryan (7), Martial (7), Lukaku (7). Subs used: Rashford (6), Fellaini (6), Lingard (6). Leicester: Schmeichel (8), Simpson (6), Morgan (7), Maguire (7), Fuchs (6), Mahrez (7), Ndidi (6) , James (7), Albrighton (6), Okazaki (6), Vardy (6). Subs used: King (5), Gray (6), Slimani (5). Man of the match: Kasper Schmeichel But the hosts kept coming with Paul Pogba firing just wide from the right-hand side of the box two minutes later before Mata was again denied the opening goal, dancing into space before taking aim but Schmeichel was there to make another important save. Shots from all over kept peppering the Foxes goal, with Lukaku firing a long range effort just wide of the upright in the 25th minute before Pogba - who had a number of first half chances - twice went close 10 minutes later. The first was again pushed away by Schmeichel before his effort from distance also skimmed past the post. Seven minutes into the second half, and United were handed a golden chance to take the lead as Danny Simpson was penalised for handling the ball in the box. Lukaku stepped up to take the penalty, but Schmeichel continued his solid first-half display by leaping to his right and saving the spot kick, much to the delight of his team-mates. Team news Man Utd made the one change with Anthony Martial replacing Marcus Rashford in attack. Leicester were unchanged from last weekend's win against Brighton. Leicester had their best chances after the break, with David de Gea making his first save of the game in the 57th minute as Riyad Mahrez attempted a low cross into the box but the goalkeeper got down to collect. The Algerian was causing trouble again 10 minutes later, going one-on-one with Daley Blind on the right-hand side before whipping the ball through the area but no one was there to convert. But United made their pressure count in the 70th minute as Rashford broke the deadlock just three minutes and 18 seconds after replacing Mata. Henrikh Mkhitaryan delivered a corner into the box and it was ultimately a simple slot home from the striker, who was lurking unmarked in the middle of the box to fire past Schmeichel. Juan Mata had a first half goal disallowed for offside Another substitute in Fellaini doubled the lead 12 minutes later after a superb run from Lingard into space on the left-hand side. He fired a cross-shot through the box and it was diverted home by the knee of the Belgian, although there were some queries from the Leicester players about whether he was offside. Andy King could have spoiled the evening for Mourinho's men as he looked set to tap home from a fizzing Demarai Gray cross at the near post, but some great anticipation from De Gea saw him there to smother the ball and help keep a third successive clean sheet for Man Utd this season. Substitute Marcus Rashford celebrates scoring the opening goal Man of the match - Kasper Schmeichel Manchester United could arguably have matched their 4-0 scoreline from their first two games if it wasn't for Schmeichel, who kept out shot after shot from the home side in the first half. He also produced a stunning save to deny Lukaku from the spot and has now saved more Premier League penalties (1 of 1) at Old Trafford than his dad, Peter Schmeichel (0 of 3). Kasper Scheichel produced a fine save to deny Romelu Lukaku goal from the penalty spot Although two goals did go past him - the first from Rashford quite literally slipping through his fingers - there's no doubting the huge contribution he made for Leicester on Saturday and continues to on a weekly basis. Opta stats Manchester United have kept a clean sheet in their opening three league games of a season for the sixth time in their history and fourth in the Premier League era. However, the Red Devils failed to win the title in any of those five previous campaigns (1927-28, 1991-92, 1997-98, 2005-06, and 2015-16). Shinji Okazaki and Anthony Martial tangle during the Old Trafford match Romelu Lukaku has missed two of his last three penalties taken in the Premier League. Seven of Marcus Rashford's 11 Premier League goals have come at Old Trafford (64 per cent). The managers Man Utd manager Jose Mourinho: \"We scored from a corner that I didn't even see because I was speaking with Lingard. I saw the ball jumping in the net and other guys jumping. The crowd were very quiet so it would be easy to know that was a goal because it was the first time I really understand that the stadium was full.\" Jose Mourinho says he did not actually see the opening Man Utd goal as he was preparing substitute Jesse Lingard Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare: \"We knew we would have to frustrate them coming here and for large parts of the game, I thought we did that and did it really well. Of course we needed to do a bit better with the ball at times but I felt for large chucks of the game to 70 or 75 minutes, we did. \"We frustrated and restricted them. We knew they'd have moments. Then they managed to capitalise on the big moments.\" What's next? The players will now head off for the international break, with Manchester United next in action against Stoke in the Premier League on September 9 with Leicester in action on the same day at 3pm when they welcome Chelsea to the King Power Stadium."}, {"date": "21/08/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54009, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson",

earned a 1-1 draw for Man City against Everton in a bad-tempered Premier League game at the Etihad. Wayne Rooney's 200th Premier League goal gave the visitors the lead (35) on Monday Night Football before Kyle Walker was controversially sent off for two yellow cards before half-time. Sterling equalised for City with eight minutes to play and there was still time for Morgan Schneiderlin to receive his marching orders for a second booking after a challenge on Sergio Aguero. Wayne Rooney scored his 200th Premier League goal on Monday The hosts squandered two good chances to go ahead as first Aguero uncharacteristically hesitated in front of goal, allowing Phil Jagielka to make a last-ditch challenge, before David Silva's low drive struck the base of Jordan Pickford's post. Everton swiftly took advantage of City's wastefulness and went in front through former Manchester United captain Rooney. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (5), Kompany (6), Stones (6), Aguero (7), De Bruyne (6), Sane (5), D Silva (6), Fernandinho (6), Otamendi (6), Jesus (5) Subs: B Silva (6), Danilo (7), Sterling (7) Everton: Pickford (7), Keane (7), Williams (7), Jagielka (7), Schneiderlin (6), Baines (6), Gueye (6), Holgate (6), Rooney (7), Davies (6), Calvert-Lewin (7) Subs: Sigurdsson (6), Klaassen (6), Besic (6) Man of the Match: Wayne Rooney He turned home Dominic Calvert-Lewin's cross to become only the second Premier League player after Alan Shearer to reach 200 goals. It got worse for City just before half-time when Walker was dismissed for two quick-fire yellow cards. His first came after a mistimed tackle on Leighton Baines and the City summer signing was dismissed for a second booking after backing into Calvert-Lewin. Team news Everton’s club-record signing Gylfi Sigurdsson was named on the bench before coming on in the second half, while Sandro Ramirez was left out of the match-day 18 altogether. City made one change from the 2-0 victory over Brighton as Leroy Sane was preferred to summer signing Danilo. City created the better opportunities after the break despite being a man down as substitute Bernardo Silva snatched at a volley, Sterling fired over and Pickford smartly kept out Danilo's low effort. Everton club-record signing Gylfi Sigurdsson came on for his debut but had little impact before Sterling scored with an instinctive volley following a poor clearing header by Mason Holgate. City pushed for a winner after Schneiderlin's red card and went close when Bernardo's measured pass almost picked out David Silva but Davy Klaassen's expertly-timed interception denied the Spaniard. Kyle Walker is sent off after receiving a second booking The stats Manchester City defender Kyle Walker's two yellow cards were just one minute and 57 seconds apart in this match. Everton are the first opposition team that Pep Guardiola has failed to beat within his first three league meetings as a manager. Everton had eight English players in their starting XI for this match - the first time that they have had as many in their starting line-up for a Premier League game since Boxing Day 1997 (also 8). Man of the match - Wayne Rooney The former United skipper enjoyed his goal - the celebration said it all, hands cupped to his ears in front of the home fans - but it was another impressive overall performance. Calvert-Lewin occupied the central role and Rooney supported, covering a good amount of ground in the middle of the pitch. Following his debut header against Stoke, he's now in a rich vein of form having scored in five of his last eight league appearances. The managers Pep Guardiola: \"At half-time we changed. During the second half we created more chances. We brought more players into the middle for more control and we created enough chances. \"We are here for the results so at the end we have to try to analyse the performance but it is one of the most proudest days of my life seeing how we have done.\" Ronald Koeman: \"We're disappointed. Of course maybe you will sign for that point before the game, but (we were) 1-0 up at half-time and 11 against 10. \"We had problems with keeping the ball and we played too fast the long ball. We worked really hard for the result, and one point is a good result.\" What next? City will travel to Bournemouth, live on Sky Sports Premier League on Saturday. It is shaping up to be a busy week for Everton, who now head to Croatia to face Hajduk Split in the Europe League play-off round first-leg.

But Huddersfield came out fastest after the break, and were ahead five minutes into the half through Australian Mooy, who joined the club permanently in the summer from Manchester City. Team news New signing Joselu was named on the bench, while Lejeune, Dummett and the suspended Shelvey were replaced by Merino, Lascelles and Perez. For Huddersfield, Van La Parra replaced Palmer. Aaron Mooy (right) celebrates with teammates after giving his side the lead After playing a one-two on the edge of the box with Elias Kachunga, Mooy curled the ball into the corner of the net past Rob Elliot with his right foot from 18 yards. Ayoze Perez had a chance to level with 20 minutes remaining, but the Spaniard miscued from six yards after a corner had fortunately fell into his path on the volley. Huddersfield held on despite some late pressure from the visitors, who are yet to score in the Premier League this term. The stats Excluding the debut season of the Premier League in 1992/93, Huddersfield are the first team to win their opening two games in the competition. Newcastle, meanwhile, have lost their first two games of a Premier League campaign for the first time since 1999/00. The Terriers are the second newly-promoted team to keep a clean sheet in their first two Premier League games following promotion (after Charlton in 1997/98). Newcastle have now lost each of their last four Premier League games against newly-promoted opposition (Watford, Bournemouth and Norwich in 2015/16). David Wagner says he is delighted with Huddersfield's performance in their 1-0 win against Newcastle and hailed Aaron Mooy's 'moment of magic' David Wagner says he is delighted with Huddersfield's performance in their 1-0 win against Newcastle and hailed Aaron Mooy's 'moment of magic' The pundit Graeme Souness: How do you stop a goal like that? Quite easily! Mikel Merino, when he comes out to confront Mooy, his sole intention is to not receive any physical contact from Mooy, or indeed not to get hit with the ball. It's a joke! You're defending 20 yards from your goal, take a blow for the cause. You can't win games of football when you've got people making those decisions so close to your goal. It's weak, it's like something you'd see in kids' football. You've got to stand back and admire the goal, but from the other side of the coin, you've got to speak to him. Take a blow for the cause! The managers Rafa Benitez: \"I'm obviously disappointed. We have some little problems in defence, with not too many players, and we have to manage. \"They did well for a while, and we conceded because we gave them too much time on the ball. After that we were quite positive, but it's a learning process for us.\" Man of the match - Aaron Mooy Who else? In a match lacking in quality in the final third, the Australian's piece of class handed Huddersfield a win to remember. Rafa Benitez admits he does not see \"an easy window\" for Newcastle as they approach transfer deadline day Rafa Benitez admits he does not see \"an easy window\" for Newcastle as they approach transfer deadline day The finish was sublime, after a nifty one-two on the edge of the box, opening his body up to guide it beyond Rob Elliot. Besides his goal, Mooy was the most impressive player on the pitch for the first half, and had more passes in the opposition half (37) than any other player on the pitch. What's next? Huddersfield face Rotherham on Wednesday in the Carabao Cup second round at the John Smith's Stadium, before hosting Southampton on Saturday in the Premier League. Newcastle host Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup, again on Wednesday, and are then back at St James' Park on Saturday for the visit of West Ham."}, {"date": "20/08/2018", "arena": "Wembley

of Tottenham 1-2 Chelsea Tottenham's woes at Wembley continued with a 2-1 defeat to Chelsea in their first league game at their temporary home. After exquisitely putting the champions ahead with a first-half free-kick, Marcos Alonso snatched a dramatic win in the 88th minute with a shot that Spurs captain Hugo Lloris will feel he should have saved, six minutes after Michy Batshuayi's own goal had levelled the contest. It means Spurs have now lost their last four games against their London rivals at Wembley, and have only tasted victory at the national stadium once since beating the Blues in the 2008 League Cup final. Chelsea, meanwhile, bounce back from their opening-day defeat by Burnley with the first win of their title defence. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (5), Trippier (5), Alderweireld (6), Vertonghen (6), Davies (5), Wanyama (5), Dembele (6), Dier (5), Eriksen (7), Alli (5), Kane (6). Subs: Son (6), Janssen (n/a), Sissoko (4). Chelsea: Courtois (7), Christensen, (5) Rudiger (5), Luiz (6), Azpilicueta (5), Alonso (9), Moses (5), Kante (6), Bakayoko (6), Willian (5), Morata (6). Subs: Pedro (n/a), Batshuayi (4). Man of the match: Marcos Alonso Having missed the crucial penalty in Chelsea's Community Shield defeat by Arsenal, Alvaro Morata was presented with the chance to atone five minutes into his first start for the champions, but he headed Cesar Azpilicueta's cross wide. The miss failed to unsettle Chelsea as Spurs, having awoken from their early malaise, dominated possession but failed to test Thibaut Courtois, Dele Alli flashing a shot over on the 15-minute mark after Andreas Christiensen's error. Just as Spurs looked to have taken control of the game they were undone by the brilliance of Alonso, who whipped an unstoppable free-kick over the lofty wall and the reach of Lloris. The hosts rallied as Kane drew Courtois into action at his near post before fizzing a low drive through Antonio Rudiger's legs but a yard wide, before Christian Eriksen's wicked free-kick managed to evade everyone in the penalty area. There was still time for more from Spurs as Kane rattled the post on 42 minutes and Ben Davies stung the palms of Courtois, but there was no way through. Team news Kieran Trippier and Victor Wanyama returned in place of Kyle Walker-Peters and Moussa Sissoko for Spurs, while Antonio Conte made four changes. With Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas suspended, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Alvaro Morata and Andreas Christensen started, while Victor Moses returned in place of Michy Batshuayi. Barely a minute into the second half, Spurs had two glorious chances to equalise as Kane's back heel released Eriksen, whose shot was turned behind for a corner, from which Kane failed to connect with a free header from eight yards. Spurs had appeals for a penalty denied on the hour by referee Anthony Taylor, who deemed Alli's cross to have struck Azpilicueta's chest. Chelsea had the chance to put the game to bed but Morata and Moses failed to convert chances, before Willian struck the post on 73 minutes. And that opened the door for Spurs to equalise as Batshuayi turned Eriksen's free-kicked beyond Courtois, but Alonso had the last word, sending the travelling Chelsea contingent, and boss Antonio Conte, into raptures. Opta stats Spurs' 19-game home Premier League unbeaten run has come to an end, with Chelsea the first side to beat Spurs away from home since Southampton in May 2016. Tottenham have lost seven of their last nine matches at Wembley (W1 D1) and lost each of their last four games against Chelsea there. Harry Kane had eight shots, his most in a Premier League game without finding the net. Kane has now had 34 shots and played 12 games in the month of August without scoring in the Premier League. Marcos Alonso has scored two direct free-kicks in the Premier League since the start of last season, with only Philippe Coutinho (3) scoring more. Man of the Match - Marcos Alonso A match-winning brace from the wing-back who continues to prove time and again that he knows where the goal is. His free-kick to open the scoring was sublime and he was in the right place to power home the winner, even if Lloris should have done much better with his effort. What next? Tottenham go in search of their first home win at Wembley when Burnley travel to the national stadium on Saturday. Chelsea, meanwhile, will look to do the same when they host Everton at Stamford Bridge on Sunday lunchtime."}, {"date": "19/08/2018", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20862, "home_team":

United's win at Swansea Manchester United underlined their early-season Premier League title credentials with a ruthless 4-0 victory at Swansea. United looked to be labouring to a 1-0 victory after the first league goal of Eric Bailly's career on the stroke of half-time. Watch Jose Mourinho's post-match interview, as he praises his Man Utd side for the way they controlled the match Watch Jose Mourinho's post-match interview, as he praises his Man Utd side for the way they controlled the match But three goals in four minutes from Romelu Lukaku (80), Paul Pogba (82) and Anthony Martial (84) saw Jose Mourinho's men maintain their 100 per cent start to the season with a second successive four-goal win. Despite frustrating United with a resolute defensive display, Swansea offered little by way of a response as they tasted defeat at the Liberty Stadium for the first time since April 5. Player ratings Swansea: Fabianski (6), Mawson (5), Olsson (6), Naughton (5), Bartley (6), Fernandez (5), Carroll (6), Fer (5), Mesa (5), Ayew (5), Abraham (6). Subs: Narsingh (4), Routledge (4), McBurnie (4). Man Utd: De Gea (7), Bailly (8), Jones (7), Blind (7), Valencia (7), Matic (7), Mkhitaryan (8), Pogba (7), Mata (7), Rashford (7), Lukaku (7). Subs: Martial (7), Herrera (4), Fellaini (4). Man of the match: Henrikh Mkhitaryan It took just three minutes for the game's first openings as Jordan Ayew's cross deceived David de Gea at his near post, striking the crossbar, moments before Lukaku flashed a shot wide at the end of a blistering counter. Phil Jones, from an offside position, then headed the ball against the crossbar as both sides hit the woodwork in a frantic opening nine minutes. Paul Pogba leaps highest to head against the crossbar Marcus Rashford pounced on Alfie Mawson's loose header on 36 minutes, but his lofted shot went straight at Lucasz Fabianski. Kyle Bartley headed a Roque Mesa cross wide shortly before Juan Mata came close to punishing Fabianski's fumble in the area, but scooped his effort wide. Team news Paul Clement made two changes following Swansea’s opening-day draw at Southampton. Summer signing Roque Mesa replaced Leon Britton to make his Swans debut, following his arrival from Las Palmas, while Kyle Bartley was drafted in for Wayne Routledge. Jose Mourinho, meanwhile, named the same Manchester United XI that beat West Ham 4-0 in their season opener. United found the breakthrough on the stroke of half-time when Bailly reacted quickest to convert a rebound after Fabianski had expertly tipped Pogba's header onto the crossbar. Tammy Abraham proved to be the greatest threat to United's lead but he failed to convert a header on 61 minutes before coming within inches of steering a corner on target 10 minutes later. Anthony Martial celebrates scoring Manchester United's fourth with Paul Pogba But United brushed the Swans aside as Henrikh Mkhitaryan set up Lukaku and Pogba in the space of two minutes, before substitute Anthony Martial rounded off the victory six minutes from time. Opta stats Manchester United have scored 4+ goals in their opening two league games of a season for the first time in 110 years (1907/08). This is just the second time a team has won their opening two top-flight games of a season by 4+ goals to nil (also Chelsea in 2010/11). The Swans have managed just one shot on target in 180 minutes of Premier League action this season. Romelu Lukaku is the fifth player to net in his first two Premier League appearances for Manchester United (after Ibrahimovic, Martial, Macheda, Saha). Man of the Match - Henrikh Mkhitaryan Henrikh Mkhitaryan unpicked Swansea's defence twice in quick succession United looked for a set for a tense final 10 minutes at the Liberty Stadium, having failed to add to Bailly's opener. However, two exquisite assists in two minutes from Mkhitaryan allayed any lingering fears. The first, a disguised reverse pass, presented Lukaku with his first clear sight of goal from which he rifled home United's second, before the second, a deft through ball, was lofted beautifully over the Fabianski by Pogba. Paul Clement admitted Swansea's sloppy defending was punished in the second half Paul Clement admitted Swansea's sloppy defending was punished in the second half The managers Jose Mourinho: \"It was a different performance [to West Ham] but I think the same kind of consistency, confidence, discipline, I think we had that again. \"It happened to me so much with my teams - you're winning 1-0 and you can can concede. There was no need to close the door. Just let the horses run freely. \"The players are not carried away, that's not a problem for us. We have to improve.\" Paul Clement: \"I didn't want the game to finish with a 1-0 loss so I made some changes and I thought we got in a real mess for the second goal, defenders coming across into the wrong positions and that was a gift. \"We had done so many good things defensively but we gifted them that goal and then we got punished.\" What's next? United look to maintain their 100 per cent start to the campaign when Leicester travel to Old Trafford next Sunday. Swansea, meanwhile, travel to MK Dons on Tuesday for a second round League Cup tie and then head to Crystal Palace on Saturday, where they will look for their first Premier League win of the

goals from Richarlison and Etienne Capoue handed Watford a deserved 2-0 win over Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Richarlison - signed from Fluminense in August - made the breakthrough after 73 minutes, the Brazilian scoring on his full debut for his new team. And the visitors wrapped up the points four minutes from time when substitute Capoue scored a screamer from long range to hand new manager Marco Silva his first away win in the Premier League. As a result, Watford are off the mark this season thanks to their first league win since April 1, but the Cherries have begun the campaign with two straight losses, scoring no goals in the process. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Cook (6), Ake (7), Surman (6), Arter (6), Afobe (6), Daniels (6), Smith (6), King (6), Fraser (6), Ibe (5) Subs: Pugh (6), Defoe (6), Mousset (6) Watford: Gomes (6), Britos (7), Prodl (6), Amrabat (7), Cleverley (6), Richarlison (8), Chalobah (8), Doucoure (7), Gray (8), Femenia (7), Holebas (7) Subs: Kabasele (6), Capoue (7), Watson (6) Man of the match: Richarlison While the Hornets largely controlled the opening 45 minutes on the south coast, with Nathaniel Chalobah and Abdoulaye Doucoure dominating midfield, it was the home side who created the best openings. However, Heurelho Gomes was on hand to deny the likes of Ryan Fraser and Benik Afobe, with smart stops, before Watford nearly went ahead in first-half stoppage time. Richarlison showed some neat feet in a tight space in the box to bamboozle Adam Smith, only for fellow new boy Andre Gray to side-foot over the bar from just six yards out. Team news Jermain Defoe had to settle for a place on the bench, while Watford captain Troy Deeney was back after groin surgery, but only as a sub, and Andre Gray started The chances kept on coming Watford's way after the break, though, with Chalobah in particular wasting one great opening after failing to score when faced with just Asmir Begovic to beat. However, that miss was soon forgotten when the visitors did finally open the scoring through Richarlison, who found himself in the right place to tap home after Begovic and Charlie Daniels had failed to deal with Gray's low cross into the six-yard box. Despite the introduction of Jermain Defoe, it was Watford who scored again with just minutes remaining as Capoue beat Begovic with a thumping 30-yard effort. Opta stats Courtesy of their win against Bournemouth, Watford ended a run of seven Premier League games without a victory (D6 L1). Silva enjoyed his first away win in the Premier League in his 10th game on the road in the competition (W1 D2 L7). Bournemouth have failed to score in consecutive Premier League for the first time since October 2016. The Cherries have kept just four clean sheets in 2017 in the Premier League, fewer than any side to play in the top-flight both last season and this season. Man of the Match - Richarlison The one-time Brazil U20 international was handed his first competitive start for Watford, following his £13m summer switch, with Stefano Okaka dropping to the bench, and boy did the youngster catch the eye on the south coast. The 20-year-old was a constant threat to the Bournemouth back-line with his pace and quick feet, creating his side's best opening of the first half. And the forward then got the crucial first goal with just 17 minutes to go to cap off an eye-catching appearance, with more surely to come from him this campaign. Richarlison (right) celebrates his goal with Nathaniel Chalobah The managers Eddie Howe: I'm really disappointed from our perspective. I felt we started OK, but then lost direction in the game and it was no surprise to see Watford score really. The momentum was with them at that stage of the game and it was disappointing as if we had just hung in there for a little but longer, it could have been different. I can't turn round and say that Watford did not deserve to win. Marco Silva: What is important to us is we got three important points today. It is not because it is away, or at home, it is an important three points for us. Of course it is fantastic if you can win away in the Premier League, as it is really difficult to do that, and we showed this football and commitment and this is most important to me. Because if you play like we did today, with this level of organisation, the players believe in our football and idea and we are close to take good results. The pundit - Paul Merson Watford were brilliant today, a proper away team performance, and they made Bournemouth look very average today. They did not have any chances today. I cannot talk highly enough about them today. When the game opened up at 0-0 and Bournemouth opened the game up, Watford picked them off and I thought they were outstanding. If you are a manager of a football team, then that is the ultimate away performance. Bournemouth did not look like scoring, they looked a bit lost, they were not a threat, Defoe came on, but I cannot really remember him doing anything. Etienne Capoue celebrates a second for Watford at the Vitality Stadium What's next? Bournemouth travel to Birmingham in the League Cup on Tuesday, before entertaining Man City in the league next Saturday.

Hal Robson-Kanu came off the bench to score the winning goal for West Brom before being sent off shortly after in a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor. The Welsh winger livened up a dull game by breaking the deadlock with a smart finish after 71 minutes, but turned from hero to villain just 13 minutes later as he received a straight red card for catching Matthew Lowton in the face with his elbow. Hal Robson-Kanu celebrates his goal at Burnley with West Brom team-mate Craig Dawson In a scrappy game, Burnley had a few half-chances to score with Ben Mee going closest as he missed an open goal with a header in the first half, but ultimately they failed to test Ben Foster in goal as much as they would have liked. For West Brom, the result means that they have maintained their 100 per cent winning start to the Premier League season following last weekend's success over Bournemouth by the same scoreline and they are, momentarily at least, second in the table behind Manchester United. Player ratings Burnley: Heaton (6), Lowton (6), Tarkowski (6), Mee (7), Ward (5), Gudmundsson (7), Hendrick (6), Cork (6), Defour (6), Brady (5), Vokes (5) Subs: Walters (6), Barnes (5) West Brom: Foster (6), Nyom (6), Hegazi (8), Dawson (7), Brunt (6), Phillips (7), Livermore (7), Barry (6), Field (5), McClean (6), Rodriguez (5) Subs: Rondon (N/A), Robson-Kanu (7) Man of the match: Ahmed Hegazi (West Brom) It took what seemed like an eternity for the first half to spring into life with both teams guilty of ceding possession far too easily and it looked as though set-pieces would be the most likely scenario in which a goal would be scored. With five minutes of the first half remaining, West Brom created the clearest chance as Matt Phillips' in-swinging corner from the left was diverted over the bar via the back of Sam Field's head inside the six-yard box. Just a couple of minutes later it was Burnley's chance to fashion a great opportunity from a corner with Mee somehow heading the ball wide of the far post from just two yards with the goal gaping after Robbie Brady's pinpoint delivery. Team news The headline news from the West Brom camp was that Manchester City target Jonny Evans was left out of the squad completely which will only heighten speculation that he could be on the move.Burnley, meanwhile, were unchanged with Sean Dyche sticking with the side that beat Chelsea 3-2 on the opening day. West Brom's stand-in skipper Jake Livermore thought he had given his side the lead just after the interval, but his deflected shot off Mee was correctly ruled out as Jay Rodriguez interfered with play from an offside position. In an attempt to seize the initiative, Tony Pulis threw on Robson-Kanu in place of James McClean on the hour mark and his decision paid off after just ten minutes as the substitute latched onto Phillips' flick-on before firing a shot past Tom Heaton from close range. Robson-Kanu's involvement didn't end there, though, as on 84 minutes he received his marching orders after appearing to catch Lowton with a flailing arm but fortunately for him his side held on in his absence to secure the all-important three points. Watch Tony Pulis give his reaction to West Brom's win at Burnley in the Premier League Watch Tony Pulis give his reaction to West Brom's win at Burnley in the Premier League The stats Burnley have won just one of their last seven home Premier League games (W1 D2 L4), after winning five in a row before that at Turf Moor. West Brom have won their first two games of a top-flight season for the first time since 1978/79. Burnley's haul of 20 shots was their joint-second highest tally in a Premier League game. Robson-Kanu's goal on 71 minutes was the first shot on target of the game. Robson-Kanu is only the fourth player to come on as a sub, score and be sent off in the same Premier League game, and the first since Ivan Klasnic for Bolton in October 2010. 15 of Tony Pulis' 31 Premier League wins as West Brom manager have been by a 1-0 scoreline. The managers Sean Dyche: I thought we were very good today, at least decent, and I think that we deserved to get something from the game. Their chance comes from a big knock up the pitch that we didn't deal with very well but other than that I was pleased with how we played in possession and out of possession. Watch Sean Dyche's post-match interview after Burnley's defeat by West Brom Watch Sean Dyche's post-match interview after Burnley's defeat by West Brom Tony Pulis: Burnley put us under enormous pressure in the second half, particularly after Hal [Robson-Kanu] left the pitch, they really tested us but the players responded and it's a wonderful result for us. As the game got more difficult for us, there was a fella playing in the middle of the pitch who actually got better, Gareth Barry was absolutely fantastic for us. The pundit - Charlie Nicholas Charlie Nicholas analyses West Brom's win over Burnley at Turf Moor Charlie Nicholas analyses West Brom's win over Burnley at Turf Moor It was game that for 70 minutes really was all about set-pieces between two teams who are very good at them but the defenders were on top form. For the goal, Robson-Kanu's first touch was beautiful and his second touch was steered into the near post with his right foot, it was a really clever finish. But madness for his red card. Man of the match - Ahmed Hegazy The towering Egyptian international scored the winning goal on his debut last weekend and followed that up with a heroic display at the back. Twice in the opening stages, Hegazy went down injured after receiving two blows to the head that drew blood but he recovered to lead his side to victory by thwarting the Burnley attack time and time again. What's next? Both teams will switch their attentions away from the Premier League to the Carabao Cup in midweek with West Brom travelling to League Two Accrington Stanley on Tuesday, while Burnley make the short trip to rivals Blackburn Rovers on Wednesday."}, {"date": "19/08/2018", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31902, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper

Leicester to a comfortable 2-0 victory at home to Brighton on Saturday afternoon. Okazaki tapped in Leicester's opener after just 52 seconds, with Brighton goalkeeper Matt Ryan spilling Riyad Mahrez's effort into the forward's path. Summer signing Maguire rose highest to head in Leicester's second after the break and score his first goal for the Foxes in the process. Victory for the Craig Shakespeare's men is the perfect response after losing out to Arsenal in the opening game of the season, while Brighton are yet to score after two games of Premier League football. Player Ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (6), Morgan (7), Maguire (8), Fuchs (6), Mahrez (8), Ndidi (8), James (7), Albrighton (7), Okazaki (8), Vardy (7) Subs: Slimani (6), Gray (n/a) Brighton: Ryan (6), Bruno (6), Dunk (6), Duffy (6), Suttner (5), Murphy (7), Propper (5), Stephens (6), March (6), Gross (5), Murray (6) Subs: Knockaert (6), Hemed (6) Man of the match: Harry Maguire Leicester's brisk start was instigated by Mahrez, who had an enjoyable afternoon at the King Power after another week of headlines linking him with a move to Roma. Riyad Mahrez grabbed an assist for Leicester - will the Algerian remain a Foxes player when the transfer window closes? It was all too easy for the Algerian down the wing as he ghosted past Markus Suttner before unleashing his effort from the edge of the area - Ryan will be disappointed to have parried the shot straight to Okazaki, who was barely six yards out when he handed Leicester the lead. The Foxes continued to dominate and it was Okazaki who then turned provider for Jamie Vardy, but the England striker saw his effort blocked before scuffing a second attempt. Team news Craig Shakespeare named the same Leicester XI that lost 4-3 on the opening game of the Premier League season at Arsenal. Kelechi Iheanacho did not make the squad due to a toe injury. Brighton made two changes with Glenn Murray and Jamie Murphy coming into the side. Izzy Brown (hamstring) is back with Chelsea to receive treatment, Tomor Hemed dropped to the bench. The visitors grew into the game, but Jamie Murphy's blocked effort was as close as the Premier League newcomers came close to an equaliser in the first half. After the break, it was Maguire - making his home debut for the Foxes - who grabbed the hosts' second in the 54th minute. The defender stole in ahead of centre-back partner Wes Morgan at the back post to nod in from Mahrez's corner. Harry Maguire beat team-mate Wes Morgan to the ball to head in Leicester's second on his home debut Substitute Tomor Hemed then called Kasper Schmeichel into action for the first time after 73 minutes, but the Leicester 'keeper got down well to keep out the long-range effort. That was as close as it got for Brighton, who have now lost their first two games upon their return to top-flight action. Opta stats Leicester City are unbeaten in their last 13 Premier League home fixtures against newly-promoted sides, winning eight and drawing five. Brighton have failed to score in four of their last five league games, netting only one goal in that time (v Aston Villa in May). Shinji Okazaki's opener was the first goal scored within the first minute of a Premier League game this season (52 seconds). Okazaki has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time ever, with both of his goals coming within the first five minutes of games.

The 24-year-old was commanding in defence and a danger going forward. He is certainly not short of confidence with the ball at his feet, as shown in the second half when wriggling past a few challenges before being fouled by Bruno on the edge of the area. The managers Craig Shakespeare: \"I've spoken about Riyad on many occasions in terms of his focus, his professionalism - and you saw today what he's capable of. \"While he remains focused and professional, he will always be considered for selection.\" Chris Hughton gives his reaction to Brighton's defeat to Leicester in the Premier League Chris Hughton gives his reaction to Brighton's defeat to Leicester in the Premier League Chris Hughton: \"What we're having to do is play our football in the best league, and players have to adapt to it, step up to the mark and show the quality which was the reason why we brought them in. \"It has been a tough start for us and we will need to be better.\" What's next?

highlights from Liverpool's 1-0 win over Crystal Palace Sadio Mane's second-half goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League at Anfield on Saturday. Liverpool had to wait until the 73rd minute to get the winner, the ball fortuitously falling to Mane inside the box after Luka Milivojevic's mistake on the edge. Christian Benteke missed a clear opening for Palace earlier in the second half from 10 yards, blazing over the bar for the visitors' best opportunity. Daniel Sturridge looks to break under pressure from Ruben Loftus-Cheek Player ratings Liverpool: Mignolet (6), Milner (6), Klavan (6), Gomez (6), Matip (7), Robertson (8), Henderson (7), Wijnaldum (6), Mane (7), Firmino (6), Sturridge (6) Subs: Salah (6), Solanke (6), Lovren (NA) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (8), Fosu-Mensah (6), Tomkins (6), Dann (6), Ward (6), Van Aanholt (6), Milivojevic (5), Puncheon (6), Loftus-Cheek (7), Townsend (6), Benteke (5) Subs: McArthur (6), Kaikai (6), Schlupp (NA), Man of the match: Andrew Robertson Liverpool, who were without Philippe Coutinho again with his future still uncertain, held on for their first league win of the season, while Frank de Boer's new Palace side are without a point after two games. Both sides were looking for their maiden Premier League victory of the campaign, and it was the hosts who had the best chance in a goalless first half. The impressive Andrew Robertson, making his debut for Liverpool, sent a superb ball in from the left, but Joel Matip somehow headed wide from three yards after Wayne Hennessey had misjudged. Team news Liverpool made five changes as Ragnar Klavan, James Milner, Joe Gomez, Andrew Robertson and Daniel Sturridge came in, while Mohamed Salah dropped to the bench. For Palace, James Tomkins and Andros Townsend came in for Jairo Riedewald and Wilfried Zaha. James Milner vies with Crystal Palace defender Joel Ward Roberto Firmino forced Hennessey into a fine stop from long range later in the half, before Palace went up the other end and saw Jason Puncheon's effort from an angle beaten away by Simon Mignolet. Hennessey was at his best again in the second half, saving from Gini Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson's long-range effort, but Palace should have been ahead on 57 minutes through former Liverpool striker Benteke, who struck over the bar after Ruben Loftus-Cheek's fine work on the right byline. Liverpool piled on the pressure and got their reward with 17 minutes remaining as Milivojevic bolted under the pressure of sub Dominic Solanke, allowing the ball to fall luckily into the path of Mane, who made no mistake low into the net. Solanke, Robertson and Mohamed Salah could have doubled Liverpool's lead late on, but all three were denied by Hennessey as Palace stayed in the game until the final moments. Opta stats Frank De Boer is only the second Dutch manager to lose his first two Premier League games after Martin Jol (lost his opening three in the competition). Indeed, the Reds kept a clean sheet against Crystal Palace for the first time in 14 competitive matches (since January 2003). Sadio Mane has netted six goals in his last eight Premier League games. Andrew Robertson, who made his Premier League debut for the Reds today, created more chances (3) and had more touches of the ball than any other Liverpool player (134). The managers Jurgen Klopp: It was a hard job to do. I have no idea how much we had the ball but it was a lot. We need to be creative. We knew that we had to be a bit more patient. They were quite deep and defended with a lot of legs. I would have liked to score more, but it wasn't a clear situation for us. We had other chances, but it was difficult, and I'm completely happy with how the boys did the job today. Mane celebrates scoring his side's first goal with Jurgen Klopp Frank de Boer: I think we were very concentrated, and one unlucky touch from Luka we conceded the goal. That's a pity, but I said to my players if we show this spirit every week I am confident. I'm happy with the spirit, not happy with the result, but I think we can build from here. The pundit Matt Le Tissier: With the chances they had it probably should have been a larger gap than one goal. There was sometimes a lack of cohesion in the Liverpool side, maybe understandable given the changes. They thoroughly deserved the three points, however. Man of the match - Andrew Robertson On his competitive Liverpool debut, the audition for left-back spot had even more importance given Alberto Moreno's impressive pre-season. Robertson delivered at Anfield following his summer move from Hull, and provided Liverpool's main threat down the left flank with his early balls from deep. He made more key passes (three), and touched the ball more (134) than any other player in an impressive first look for the Scot. He'll now look to make that left-back spot his own, but will also receive competition from James Milner once Nathaniel Clyne returns from injury. What's next? Georginio Wijnaldum vies for possession with Jason Puncheon Liverpool host Hoffenheim on Wednesday in their Champions League play-off round second leg, holding a 2-1 lead from the first leg, before hosting Arsenal at Anfield on Super Sunday at 4pm. Palace face Ipswich at Selhurst Park in the Carabao Cup second round on Tuesday, and are again at home on Saturday against Swansea in the Premier League.

Javier Hernandez's double salvo looked to have saved the Hammers, who came from 2-0 down following goals from Manolo Gabbiadini and Dusan Tadic despite having Marko Arnautovic sent off in the first half for an elbow on Jack Stephens. Marko Arnautovic looks on in disbelief as referee Lee Mason shows him a red card In a feisty encounter, there was an argument to suggest that Tadic should not have been on the pitch when he scored after a reckless challenge on Hernandez that only received a yellow card. The game looked set to end level, however, referee Lee Mason awarded a controversial 90th-minute penalty after Pablo Zabaleta nudged Maya Yoshida following a James Ward-Prowse cross. Austin, who was once criticised by Hammers co-chairman David Sullivan over his fitness, stepped up and sent Joe Hart the wrong way to rescue the Saints. Player Ratings Home Team: Forster (5), Soares (7), Bertrand (7), Yoshida (7), Stephens (7), Davis (7), Tadic (7), Romeu (7), Lemina (7), Gabbiadini (7), Redmond (7). Subs: Austin (7), Long (6), Ward-Prowse (7) Away Team: Hart (5), Ogbonna (5), Creswell (6), Fonte (5), Zabaleta (5), Rice (6), Arnautovic (4), Noble (5), Antonio (8), Ayew (6), Chicharito (9). Subs: Sakho (6), Fernandes (6) Man of the match: Javier Hernandez West Ham started with positive intent, with the returning Michail Antonio releasing Arnautovic but he fired wide instead of going across the goalkeeper. Gabbiadini showed the Serbian how it should be done on 11 minutes - firing home from an acute angle to break a club goal drought stretching six home league games. Tadic was then lucky to avoid a straight red for a wild lunge on Hernandez before Arnautovic was given his marching orders for a needless elbow on Stephens right in front of the referee. Declan Rice and Oriol Romeu in action during the Premier League match at St Mary's The Saints took advantage of the extra man and doubled their lead on 36 minutes from the penalty spot through Tadic, after the returning Jose Fonte had pulled back Steven Davis. Team news Saints handed a debut to Mario Lemina, signed from Juventus this summer in a deal which could rise to £20million. Meanwhile, Slaven Bilic rang the changes with Jose Fonte, Declan Rice, Michail Antonio and Aaron Creswell getting the nod while Winston Reid – originally in the team – had to be replaced by Angelo Obonna after breaking down with an ankle problem in the warm-up. Hernandez then gave the 10-man Hammers hope just before the break when he turned home from close range following an Antonio effort which was parried away by Fraser Forster. The Mexican continued to provide a threat for the visitors and nipped in to nab an unlikely equaliser from close range with 17 minutes remaining. Javier Hernandez scored from close range to bring West Ham back into the game Southampton pressed for a winner but it looked unlikely until referee Lee Mason adjudged Zabaleta to have fouled Yoshida inside the box. Austin, who admitted afterwards he was surprised the penalty was awarded, fired home to claim all three points and leave the Hammers with no points from their opening two games. Man of the match - Javier Hernandez The striker didn't deserve to be on the losing side as this looks £16m well spent already. Despite playing the majority of the game with 10-men, the Hammers made the most of their limited territory with Hernandez finishing the only two chances that came his way - both from inside the six-yard box. His all-round game was also of top quality, including when mucking in as a makeshift left-winger. It's good to have him back in the Premier League. Slaven Bilic gives his reaction to West Ham's late defeat to Southampton in the Premier League Slaven Bilic gives his reaction to West Ham's late defeat to Southampton in the Premier League Manager reaction Slaven Bilic: \"I don't want to talk about the penalty decisions, because there is no point talking about it. I only want to say that I'm very proud of my team and they showed everything I said - commitment, quality, character, team spirit and we never gave up.\" Mauricio Pellegrino: \"I haven't seen the replay (of the key decisions) and sometimes when the referee (Lee Mason) makes a decision you have to respect them. When they are for you you are happy; when it's against you have to suffer and to keep going.\" Opta stats That was the first time Southampton have scored a 90th-minute winning goal in a Premier League game. Austin has been directly involved in three goals in his last two Premier League games against West Ham (two goals, one assist). Gabbiadini's goal ended a run of nine hours and 15 minutes without a Premier League goal at St. Mary's for Southampton. Arnautovic has been sent off verses Southampton in each of his last two Premier League appearances against them (also in December 2016). He's the second player in PL history to be sent off twice versus the Saints (also Sol Campbell). Mauricio Pellegrino gives us his thoughts on Southampton's late winner against West Ham in the Premier League Mauricio Pellegrino gives us his thoughts on Southampton's late winner against West Ham in the Premier League Hernandez scored his first Premier League goals since April 2014 against Newcastle (1232 days ago) - all 39 of his goals in the English top-flight have come from inside the box. What next? Next up in the Premier League for Southampton is a trip to Huddersfield next Saturday, which comes after a Carbao Cup clash with Wolverhampton Wanderers. West Ham have two more away games to contend with over the next week with Cheltenham Town in the Carabao Cup - live on Sky Sports on Wednesday - before a trip to Newcastle next Saturday in the Premier

Arsenal highlights Jese Rodriguez made the perfect start to his Stoke career, scoring the only goal of the game as Mark Hughes' side beat Arsenal 1-0 at the bet365 Stadium. The 24-year-old joined the Potters on Wednesday on a season-long loan from Paris Saint-Germain and he was thrust straight into the action, producing the match-winning moment in the 47th minute. Arsenal, who face Liverpool at Anfield next Sunday live on Sky Sports Premier League, thought they had an equaliser in the 73rd minute through Alexandre Lacazette but the strike was ruled out for offside as Stoke held on for their first win of the season. Jese was quickly involved on his first Premier League start, showing a glimpse of his talent as he burst past Shkodran Mustafi before being denied by Petr Cech. Arsenal, who felt aggrieved not to be awarded a penalty in the first-half when Mame Biram Diouf appeared to bring down Hector Bellerin, grew into the game and almost took the lead in the 20th minute when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's clipped pass released Danny Welbeck, but the England forward's first-time shot was blocked by international colleague Jack Butland.

Subs: Berahino (7), Sobhi (6), Martins Indi (n/a) Arsenal: Cech (6), Mustafi (6), Monreal (5), Kolasinac (6), Bellerin (6), Ramsey (7), Xhaka (6), Oxlade-Chamberlain (6), Ozil (6), Welbeck (7), Lacazette (6). Subs: Giroud (6). Walcott (n/a), Iwobi (n/a). Man of the match: Jese Rodriguez Minutes later Stoke, who brought on Saido Berahino after losing Xherdan Shaqiri to injury, needed Butland again as Mesut Ozil's free-kick picked out Aaron Ramsey at the far post. The Welshman volleyed the ball goalwards but Butland was quickly off his line to make a smart save. Arsenal came on strong towards the end of the first-half but it was Stoke who made the perfect start after the interval as Berahino's pass released Jese, and the Spaniard's shot beat Cech to pick out the bottom corner. Stoke striker Jese (C) celebrates with team-mates after scoring on his debut The Gunners responded well to going a goal down with Ozil's cross picking out Welbeck in the penalty area but the ball bounced off the England international's shoulder and over the crossbar. The visitors turned to last weekend's match-winner Olivier Giroud with 23 minutes remaining and straight away his touch released Welbeck, but Butland was quickly off his line to make a smart block. Team news Mark Hughes handed new signing Jese Rodriguez his Premier League debut, while Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting made his first start as one of two changes to the Stoke side that lost 1-0 to Everton last weekend. Arsene Wenger also made two changes from the side that beat Leicester 4-3 on the opening day with Shkodran Mustafi and Aaron Ramsey replacing Rob Holding and Mohamed Elneny. Jese left the field to a standing ovation in the 71st minute but moments later Arsenal thought they had an equaliser when Grioud's flick fell to Lacazette, and the Frenchman finished emphatically into the roof of the net only to find the offside flag up in what was a marginal call. Arsenal continued to pile on the pressure deep into injury-time and the final chance fell to Giroud, but the substitute headed Nacho Monreal's cross wide of the target as Stoke held on for a famous win. Alexandre Lacazette (L) and Ryan Shawcross battle for the ball Opta stats Stoke have lost just once in their last eight home Premier League games against the Gunners (W4 D3 L1). Arsenal posted their highest ever possession figure in a Premier League game (77.3%), since 2003-04 (the first season Opta have this data from). Since Stoke City's first Premier League campaign in 2008-09, Arsenal have suffered six defeats away at the Potters in all competitions. In this period, they've only suffered more competitive defeats away at Manchester United (8) and Chelsea (7), also losing six away to Manchester City. Jesé is the third player to score on their Premier League debut for Stoke, after Ricardo Fuller in 2008 and Michael Kightly in 2012. Man of the Match - Jese Rodriguez The Spaniard was thrown straight into the spotlight at the bet365 Stadium and he came up with a match-winning performance that will give the Stoke fans hope for the future. Jese showed an exciting glimpse of his potential in the early stages when he sprinted beyond Mustafi, only to have his shot saved by Cech. Jese celebrates his debut goal with Saido Berahino He worked tirelessly for his side in attack and he got his reward in the 47th minute with a fine finish to lift the roof off the stadium and secure his side's first win of the season. He was replaced in the 71st minute after running out of gas and he left the field to a standing ovation, acknowledgement of a fine debut performance. The Managers Mark Hughes: \"I think from the first few moments everybody understood why we wanted to bring him here. I think everybody is going to enjoy watching him and that he'll light the Premier League up as the season progresses. \"He can play right across the front three or four. That versatility and flexibility is perfect. He hadn't trained all week the week before this one, and trained three days this week, so it was a little bit of a risk [to put him straight in the starting line-up]. \"I thought he scored a great, finisher's goal - that of a top player in my opinion.\" Arsene Wenger: \"I believe it is the kind of night where you are angry. \"That is because not only did we not score with the number of chances we had, we made stupid mistakes centrally for the goal, first by losing the ball and after by not defending properly. \"And on top of that as well I think we were unlucky with some decisions from the referee because we scored a regular goal.\" What's next? Stoke are in Carabao Cup second round action against Rochdale at the bet365 Stadium on Wednesday night. Meanwhile, the pressure is already building on Wenger and Arsenal as they face a tricky trip to Anfield to face Liverpool next Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League."}, {"date":

Newcastle 0-2 Tottenham Tottenham opened their Premier League campaign with a 2-0 win at Newcastle as the Magpies' top-flight return was sullied by Jonjo Shelvey's red card. Rafa Benitez's side had delivered a disciplined first-half display until Shelvey lost his soon after the restart, treading on Dele Alli's ankle in front of the referee to leave a side that had already lost two players to injuries facing an even sterner task. Alli made Shelvey's team-mates pay, meeting a Christian Eriksen cross at the back post in the 61st minute, and Ben Davies slotted a second soon after (70) as last year's runners-up shrugged off scrutiny of their transfer business to start with three points on the first Nissan Super Sunday of the season. Team news Defenders Javier Manquillo and Florian Lejeune made their Newcastle debuts, while Dwight Gayle was passed fit after a recent hamstring injury. Kieran Trippier's injury meant a Tottenham start for Kyle Walker-Peters, while Moussa Sissoko got the nod from the off. Newcastle had started brightly in the Tyneside sunshine, old boy Moussa Sissoko enthusiastically booed, but Dwight Gayle caught an early half-volley with shin rather than boot and saw a penalty appeal rendered academic by an offside flag. Paul Dummett had hobbled off with a hamstring injury just eight minutes in and Benitez was forced into a further defensive reshuffle when Harry Kane scythed down debutant Florian Lejeune, Chancel Mbemba sent on in his place. Player ratings Newcastle: Elliot (7), Clark (6), Dummett (n/a), Manquillo (6), Lejeune (5), Shelvey (3), Ritchie (6), Hayden (6), Gayle (7), Perez (7), Atsu (7) Subs used: Lascelles (7), Mbemba (6), Merino (5). Tottenham: Lloris (6), Walker-Peters (8), Alderweireld (7), Vertonghen (7), Davies (7), Dier (7), Dembele (7), Sissoko (7), Eriksen (8), Alli (7), Kane (7) Subs used: Son (7), Wanyama (n/a), Winks (n/a). Man of the match: Kyle Walker-Peters Eriksen watched a snapshot spin wide of the post and saw a curling effort comfortably claimed but an organised Newcastle side largely nullified Spurs' threat and carried their own on the counter, Christian Atsu a regular source of spark down the left. Benitez would have been buoyed at the break but he was fuming just two minutes after the restart when Shelvey was shown a straight red, treading witlessly on Alli's ankle in front of the referee after the Spurs player had provocatively prodded the ball from his grasp. Andre Marriner shows a red card to Jonjo Shelvey of Newcastle United The game lurched into life, Kane scenting his 100th Tottenham goal only to be denied by Rob Elliot at point-blank range, but, to the chagrin of St James' Park, it was Alli who made the breakthrough, meeting Eriksen's clipped ball on the stretch at the far post. Spurs were now in control and Alli was involved in a neat second just nine minutes later, his flick eventually falling to Davies to slot into the far corner. Mauricio Pochettino's side might have had a third but Kane, set free by Heung-min Son's through-ball, clattered a post, his wait for a Spurs milestone - and a first Premier League goal in August - stretching on. Watch 'Mike Ashley: Speaks Direct' on Sky Sports Premier League at 7pm on Sunday Watch 'Mike Ashley: Speaks Direct' on Sky Sports Premier League at 7pm on Sunday Man of the match - Kyle Walker-Peters Despite Pochettino claiming he was not yet ready to start a Premier League game for Tottenham, Walker-Peters replaced injured Kieran Trippier in the right-back spot and proved a hit. A solid first-half defensive display was followed by a second half in which his attacking abilities came to the fore, the England U20 World Cup delivering a flurry of crosses into the box. Kyle Walker has gone but in Walker-Peters, Pochettino may have found another gem. The stats Dele Alli has scored 13 Premier League goals in 2017; among English players, only Harry Kane (21) has scored more. Jonjo Shelvey was the first Newcastle player to be sent off on the opening day of a Premier League season at St. James' Park since Alan Shearer in 1999. Christian Eriksen created both of Tottenham's goals Since the start of the 2015/16 season, Christian Eriksen has assisted more Premier League goals than any other player (30). This was Rafael Benitez's first home Premier League defeat against Spurs, having won five and drawing three of his previous eight matches on home soil against them. The pundit - Alan Pardew Christian Atsu attempts to get past Mousa Dembele \"What irritates me is it isn't a stamp like he's going to hurt him, it is a petulant stamp. That is the sort of thing that you have to ask him about in training on Monday - 'What are you doing? Why are you doing it? You are the captain of the football team and you have to set an example not just for your team-mates but for everyone watching around the world'. That's the responsibly the has to understand in that role.\" The managers Rafa Benitez: \"(Shelvey) made a mistake. Hopefully he will learn from that. He knows he has made a mistake and he has apologised but it changes nothing now. Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez says his captain Jonjo Shelvey has apologised for his red card during their 2-0 defeat to Tottenham at St James' Park Newcastle boss Rafa Benitez says his captain Jonjo Shelvey has apologised for his red card during their 2-0 defeat to Tottenham at St James' Park \"Still I would like to see if this is a more dangerous situation than the tackle from behind to Lejeune. What is worse, what is a red card? But it's no excuses because we made a mistake and that's it.\" Mauricio Pochettino: \"Maybe it was a little bit a situation you can smell. He (Alli) was a little bit of a target. He tried to play football and to score goals and with that action, you agree it's a sending off.\" Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says his side's 2-0 victory over Newcastle at St James' Park was fully deserved and he is confident there will be new signings soon Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino says his side's 2-0 victory over Newcastle at St James' Park was fully deserved and he is confident there will be new signings soon What next?

"2:52 Watch highlights from Manchester United's 4-0 win over West Ham Watch highlights from Manchester United's 4-0 win over West Ham Romelu Lukaku haunted West Ham United yet again as he netted twice on his Premier League debut for a rampant Manchester United in a 4-0 win on Sunday. Lukaku netted either side of half-time before Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba completed the scoring against slow-starting West Ham, who lost their opening Premier League game of the season for the 11th time. The Belgian striker, who cost United £90m this summer from Everton, has now scored 11 times in his last 11 league appearances against the Hammers. Lukaku celebrates after opening the scoring The result means Jose Mourinho still has never lost a home match on a Sunday in all competitions - a run stretching 112 games. Team news Two summer signings were handed starts for Manchester United - Nemanja Matic and Romelu Lukaku, but Victor Lindelhof didn’t make the squad. West Ham gave Premier League debuts to four new additions – Joe Hart, Pablo Zabaleta, Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernandez. United's main problem last season was scoring at Old Trafford as they managed just 26, which was two less than relegated Hull City. Lukaku was snapped up to improve that tally and took just 33 minutes to introduce himself to his adoring crowd. Marcus Rashford - lively throughout - sprinted at the heart of the West Ham back four and slipped a delightful ball through to the Belgian, who smashed a first-time effort past Joe Hart via the inside of the post. Lukaku didn't have to wait long until after the break to double his league tally. Mkhitaryan clipped a free-kick into the box from the left and Lukaku rose ahead of his marker Arthur Masuaku, who seemed to be sharing a joke with the striker before the ball was played in, to glance home from eight yards out. West Ham almost replied instantly when Edmilson Fernandes' cross found Marko Arnautovic, who got the wrong side of Daley Blind, but his header was tipped onto the crossbar by David de Gea. That was as good as it got for the visitors as they struggled to get former United man Javier Hernandez into the game on his full debut. United pressed on for more goals as Lukaku hunted a hat-trick. He was denied by a brilliant sliding block from Pablo Zabaleta on 64 minutes before Rashford struck the inside of the post with a fabulous effort from 25 yards. With West Ham pushing for a late salvo, United struck twice late on with Martial finishing off a flowing move instigated by Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pogba curling home a fantastic effort from 20 yards. This was Mourinho's biggest Premier League win as United manager, and their biggest home win in the Premier League since his Chelsea side beat Arsenal 6-0 in March 2014.

The midfielder won possession more times than any of his team-mates (11), played more passes (69), had more touches (89) and covered more ground (11.41km). As if that wasn't enough, he also got the crowd out of their seats when he embarked on a mazy run down the right wing that saw him jink past several West Ham players.

The Red Devils have won more opening day games in Premier League history than any other side (17), while West Ham have lost the most (11).

They look like they are going to mount a challenge. It's day one, but they look like they have the attributes to mount a challenge for the title because they seem like they have everything. \"There is no excuse for Man Utd not to challenge for the league. That's not putting pressure on the players or Jose Mourinho, but they have to challenge with the money that has been spent and the players that have been brought in. \"Last season was not good enough in terms of the Premier League, nowhere near good enough. It was a massive under-performance from those players so they have to get back up there this year.\" The managers Jose Mourinho: \"We didn't start especially well, maybe we were a bit nervous, but then we had a quality performance, with good personality and word which I like - \"confidence\".

I have to admit they were much better in every aspect, they were better in the air, on the floor, in 50-50 challenges, we knew they had a strong side but I expected us to do better.

The Premier League returned in thrilling fashion on Friday night with Arsenal's dramatic 4-3 win over Leicester and the goals continued to flow at Vicarage Road with Stefano Okaka (8) and Sadio Mane (29) exchanging strikes. Watford, led by Marco Silva for the first time in the Premier League, regained the lead soon after through Abdoulaye Doucoure (32) but second-half goals from Roberto Firmino (54) and Mohamed Salah (57) saw Jurgen Klopp's side turn the game on its head. And Liverpool, who hit the crossbar through Joel Matip, looked to be heading for all three points until Britos (90+4) struck to rescue a point for the Hornets. Team news Marco Silva named just one of his seven summer signings in his first Watford team. Nathan Chalobah – snapped up from Chelsea – was handed a midfield role but club record signing Andre Gray was named on the bench. Troy Deeney missed out through injury. Jurgen Klopp, who was without the injured Philippe Coutinho, handed Alberto Moreno a rare start at left-back ahead of James Milner, who was named on the bench. Jordan Henderson was fit to start as was new signing Mohamed Salah. Much of the build-up was dominated by the speculation surrounding Philippe Coutinho's future at Anfield which was an unwelcome distraction for Klopp and his side ahead of the season opener. They had further problems just nine minutes in as Okaka ghosted into the box unopposed to head Jose Holebas' corner past Simon Mignolet from close range to give Silva the perfect start to his Watford reign. Player ratings Home Team: Gomes (7), Janmaat (5), Kaboul (7), Britos (7), Holebas (6), Chalobah (6), Doucoure (7), Amrabat (6), Cleverley (7), Pereyra (6), Okaka (7). Subs used: Femenia (6), Gray (6), Richarlison (6) Away Team: Mignolet (6), Alexander-Arnold (6), Lovren (5), Matip (5), Moreno (6), Henderson (6), Can (7), Wijnaldum (6), Salah (8), Mane (7), Firmino (6). Subs: Milner (n/a), Gomez (n/a), Origi (n/a) Man of the match: Mohamed Salah Liverpool had hardly had a kick but found themselves back on level terms in the 29th minute when Emre Can's sensational flick picked out Mane, who curled the ball into the top corner. However, Klopp's men were level for all of three minutes as Watford, who replaced the injured Daryl Janmaat with Kiko Femenia, took advantage of more poor Liverpool defending through Doucoure's close-range finish. Abdoulaye Doucoure celebrates scoring Watford's second goal Immediately after the break Watford lost Roberto Pereyra to injury, handing Richarlison his Premier League debut, and they lost their lead, Firmino making no mistake from the spot after Salah was brought down by Heurelho Gomes. Liverpool completed the turnaround three minutes later. Dejan Lovren's long ball picked out Firmino, who lifted the ball over the onrushing Gomes, leaving Salah to bundle the ball home from close range to secure a debut goal. Mohamed Salah in action during the Premier League match between Watford and Liverpool at Vicarage Road The visitors went close to extending their lead when Matip's header cannoned back off the crossbar and Salah's shot rustled the side netting, but missed chances came back to haunt the Reds deep into injury time. Mignolet parried Richarlison's shot onto the bar but the ball dropped to Britos, who bundled the ball over the line to secure a share of the spoils. Opta stats Stefano Okaka celebrates his goal with team-mate Roberto Pereyra Watford are unbeaten in their last 11 opening day league games (W5 D6). Liverpool failed to win an opening day Premier League game for the first time since 2012/13. Six of Stefano Okaka's seven Premier League goals have come in home matches. Sadio Mane has scored with his first shot on target in the Premier League in both the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons. Mohamed Salah is the 12th different player to score on his Premier League debut for Liverpool. Man of the Match - Mohamed Salah Mohamed Salah celebrates as Liverpool come from behind to take a 3-2 lead Andy Hinchcliffe: Liverpool needed to turn things around drastically at half-time and the player that did that for them in the second half was Salah. With no Coutinho, Liverpool were looking to Salah to be this inspiration, this creative spark and his pace and his movement off the ball is absolutely superb. He got his goal, which was not the most glamourous he'll ever score but his second-half performance, including winning the penalty, was outstanding. Manager reaction - Jurgen Klopp \"They didn't create too much with the ball but of course they scored two goals and in a specific situation where everyone will say, 'Oh, it was a set-piece' \"We defended most of them really well, but at the end is it enough if we concede one goal? No. We have to work on it.\" Pundit view - Jamie Carragher \"On set pieces it's not about the defenders. The way Liverpool are set up - set piece wise - they will always concede goals. No matter which defenders they buy or how much they cost - it won't make a difference.\" What next? Jurgen Klopp during the warm up prior to the Premier League match between Watford and Liverpool It's European action up next for Liverpool as they look to bounce back from their opening day draw. Klopp's side travel to the Rhein-Neckar-Arena to face Hoffenheim for the first leg of their Champions League play-off. Meanwhile, Watford will be hoping to build on the point when they return to Premier League action next Saturday, August 19 at Bournemouth."}, {"date": "12/08/2018", "arena": "Stamford Bridge",

Burnley's shock win over champions Chelsea Burnley shocked nine-man Chelsea by beating the champions 3-2 in a thrilling opening Premier League encounter at Stamford Bridge. Captain Gary Cahill was shown a straight red card early on by Craig Pawson for a high tackle on Steven Defour, before Sam Vokes put Burnley ahead (24) with a neat flick inside the area. Stephen Ward doubled Burnley's lead with a fierce strike from an angle (39), and Vokes netted again before the break (43) with a free header six yards out. Substitute Alvaro Morata pulled one back for Chelsea on his debut (69), but Cesc Fabregas was shown a second yellow for a foul late on, having earlier been booked for a sarcastic clap towards Pawson. Burnley's Sam Vokes (C) celebrates with team-mates after opening the scoring Team news For Chelsea, Jeremie Boga started behind Michy Batshuayi for his debut as new signing Alvaro Morata made the bench, but Boga was subbed off after 18 minutes following Gary Cahill’s red. Antonio Rudiger made his debut for the Blues following his summer move from Roma. For Burnley, new signing Jon Walters was on the bench, as Sam Vokes started up front. David Luiz's late goal (88) made for a nervy ending, but Burnley held on for a dramatic victory. Chelsea were reduced to 10 men after just 14 minutes as Cahill overran the ball in midfield, before going in studs up on Defour, forcing Pawson to show a straight red. There were no complaints from new skipper Cahill, but disgruntled Chelsea fans made their feelings known to Pawson before Burnley took the lead on 24 minutes through Vokes, flicking Matt Lowton's right-wing cross into the bottom far corner from 12 yards. Player ratings Chelsea: Courtois (5), Rudiger (4), Luiz (4), Cahill (3), Azpilicueta (5), Kante (5), Fabregas (4), Alonso (5), Boga (4), Willian (5), Batshuayi (5) Subs: Christensen (5), Morata (6), Musonda (NA) Burnley: Heaton (7), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (9), Mee (7), Ward (8), Gudmundsson (7), Cork (8), Hendrick (7), Defour (8), Brady (8), Vokes (9) Subs: Arfield (6), Walters (6) Man of the match: Sam Vokes Gary Cahill is sent off by referee Craig Pawson after a high challenge on Steven Defour Ward made it 2-0 with a thunderous left-footed effort from an angle after Jack Cork's deft ball into his path, and Vokes then got his second, and Burnley's third, with two minutes of the half remaining, ghosting between Luiz and Marcos Alonso to head home Defour's cross. Chelsea pushed in the second half as Alonso forced two good saves from Tom Heaton, and Morata, who had been introduced just 10 minutes earlier, headed home from close range after Willian's fine cross for 3-1. Morata then netted at the far post, but was correctly flagged offside, before Fabregas received a second yellow for a silly late foul on Cork. Alvaro Morata opens his Premier League account for Chelsea Nine-man Chelsea continued to push, however, and somehow halved the deficit as Luiz volleyed home Morata's flick-on inside the area. Robbie Brady hit the post from a free-kick a minute later, but after a frantic final few minutes inside Burnley's penalty area, Sean Dyche's side were delighted to hear the final whistle. The stats Chelsea are only the second reigning Premier League champions to lose the opening game of the following campaign (also Leicester last season). Chelsea are the first reigning Premier League champions to concede three goals in the opening game of the next season. Chelsea are the first side to pick up two red cards on the opening day of a Premier League season. Sam Vokes has netted seven goals in his last six Premier League games, after managing just five in his previous 58. This is the first time that the reigning champions have suffered a defeat on the first matchday in successive top-flight seasons since 1968 (Man Utd 1967/68 & Man City 1968/69). The pundit - Paul Merson You look at City's bench compared to Chelsea's and it is chalk and cheese. This is not a bad team overnight and next week they go to Spurs. As a Burnley player and you see their bench before kick-off and there is only Morata on it. The next couple of weeks is massive for Chelsea Football Club and you cannot afford to drop points at home to Burnley. Cesc Fabregas reacts to being sent off The managers Antonio Conte: The Cahill sending off was a key moment, because to play the rest of the game with 10 men, and then with nine men, is not easy. But in the last three games we end the game with 10 men or less. I think I will have to adapt a new system to play with nine men or 10 men for the next game, to anticipate this situation! Sean Dyche: I thought the referee was fantastic, to handle the occasion, the stadium, the decisions, my staff tell me he's got them right. It's a good day for my players and the fans today. The win quietens down a few stories, the first win is important, especially when we're written off like we are every year. It kills a few things off early doors, and allows the players just that little edge of growth. Antonio Conte looks on during the Premier League match against Burnley at Stamford Bridge Man of the match - Sam Vokes It was a close battle between the Welshman and his team-mate James Tarkowski, but Vokes' two goals showed what a danger he can be inside the box. His first, a flick as the ball came in slightly behind him, showed great improvisation, and though his second was bread and butter for any striker, his all-round work rate was superb. He won 12 aerial duels as David Luiz and Antonio Rudiger were treated to a rough afternoon, and also won three fouls for Burnley having held the ball up well. What next?

Frank de Boer's 3-5-2 system didn't really work for Palace, with Huddersfield not put under enough pressure, and eased to that debut success with surprising ease. Team news Three debutants for Palace, with Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Jairo Riedewald all starting. Four new boys started for Huddersfield, with Tom Ince straight into the side. The visitors almost got off to the perfect start, but Tom Ince tamely fired straight at Wayne Hennessey from a good position, but they didn't have to wait long to net that first Premier League goal. Mooy worked a corner well, curling the ball into the back post, Mathias Jorgensen diverted it back across goal, Ward was in the way, but could do nothing as the ball ricocheted into the net. With Palace still reeling, Huddersfield made it two. Mooy again was at the heart of it, crossing from the left this time, the Palace defenders were caught on their heels, Mounie timed his leap to perfection, before heading into the top corner. Player ratings Crystal Palace:Hennessey (5), Ward (5), Dann (5), Riedewald (6), Van Aanholt (4), Puncheon (4), Milivojevic (5), Loftus-Cheek (6), Fosu-Mensah (6), Benteke (5), Zaha (6).

Subs:van La Parra (6), Williams (6), Quaner (7). Man of the match: Steve Mounie After the break, Palace brought on Andros Townsend, and he almost created an opening for Christian Benteke six minutes into the second period, but the former Liverpool hitman missed his kick in the box. Jonas Lossl, who had been enjoying a quiet afternoon in the Huddersfield goal for the first 55 minutes, was then called into action twice in quick succession. Firstly, he brilliantly clawed out Benteke's header from a corner, before getting down well to block a low, fizzing effort from Zaha. And with 12 minutes left on the clock, the Terriers made sure of that maiden Premier League victory, as Mounie capped a fine competitive debut by slotting home to ensure the Terriers finish the day top of the Premier League. What a debut. Luka Milivojevic under pressure from Tom Ince and Philip Billing Opta stats Crystal Palace have won only one of their last six opening day matches in the Premier League, losing four of the last five (W1 D1 L4). Huddersfield are the first team to win on their Premier League debut since Blackpool in August 2010 (4-0 v Wigan). The Terriers are just the fifth newly-promoted side to win on the opening day of the Premier League since 2008/09 (also West Ham in 2012, Blackpool in 2010 and Hull in 2008 & 2016). Frank de Boer has enjoyed just one win in his last seven league games as a manager (W1 D1 L5 with Internazionale). The managers Crystal Palace boss Frank de Boer says it was a false start to the new season for his side after they lost at home to Huddersfield. Crystal Palace boss Frank de Boer says it was a false start to the new season for his side after they lost at home to Huddersfield. Frank de Boer: \"It is a false start,\" De Boer told Sky Sports. \"If you analyse the game it is quite simple. We started quite well, but after 10 minutes the game changed. Tactically, we didn't do what we have talked about. \"They scored two goals and we were are always chasing the game. We had some good chances to make it 2-1, and if we did make it 2-1, I had a good feeling that we would get at least a point. \"We had good chances then 30 seconds later they went down the other end and scored again and the game is over. David Wagner said his side were rewarded for their aggressive style in the 3-0 win over Crystal Palace in their Premier League debut. David Wagner said his side were rewarded for their aggressive style in the 3-0 win over Crystal Palace in their Premier League debut. David Wagner: \"It wasn't bad, was it? We started quite well. We created a great chance which we missed, but then we were very clinical. We created five or six very good opportunities and scored three times. \"And we had Jonas Lossl who was outstanding in goal and in some situations we were lucky. \"It was a very good start. You cannot moan about it; playing your first Premier League game, your first at this level in 45 years and you win 3-0 against Crystal Palace. I will not moan.\" The pundit - Matt Le Tissier The win was thoroughly deserved. Even before the goals, they started so brightly. It was as convincing an away win as you are likely to see. Palace threatened a little in the second half, without really testing Lossl. Huddersfield were just really, really good. Mounie caused the Palace defence all sorts of problems. The back four were excellent and the goalkeeper made some fine saves when called upon. Man of the match - Steve Mounie Mounie is mobbed by team-mates after scoring While Montpellier struggled last season, Mounie didn't. Fourteen goals in Ligue 1 is an impressive return in a team that finished 15th, and such form proved transferable, as he netted a double on his Premier League bow. His header for his first goal almost burst the net. Never stopped running, too. What next? Huddersfield's first home takes place next Sunday, live on Sky Sports, against fellow Premier League new boys Newcastle. Up next for Palace is a very tricky visit to Liverpool next Saturday."}, {"date": "12/08/2018", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39045, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Klaassen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Sandro Ramírez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["77"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cuco Martina", "yellows": ["85"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["45"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["60"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": ["29"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["72"]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["72"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxim Choupo-Moting", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Tymon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramadan Sobhi Ahmed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:59 Everton 1-0 Stoke Everton 1-0 Stoke Wayne Rooney scored on his Premier League return to Everton as they beat Stoke 1-0 in their opening fixture of the season. It was a fairy-tale return to his boyhood club as Rooney headed home the winning goal in the added minute of injury time in the first half, and sealed the three points for the hosts. The Toffees had drawn their last four opening day matches but managed to hold out for the victory against a Stoke side who had very few clear-cut chances, with Xherdan Shaqiri almost snatching a draw late on, only to be denied by a superb Jordan Pickford save. The first half saw scoring efforts at a premium, although Mame Biram Diouf forced Pickford into a good stop after 10 minutes as the goalkeeper pushed the Stoke forward's shot over the crossbar at his near post. Team news Wayne Rooney made his second Premier League debut for Everton alongside Sandro Ramirez. Fellow new signing Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane and Davy Klaassen also started. Darren Fletcher and Kurt Zouma started for Stoke while Eric Choupo-Moting and Josh Tymon were on the bench. Joe Allen also started after reported transfer interest from Swansea. Idrissa Gueye went closest for Everton in the opening period. He thrashed an effort towards Jack Butland's goal just after the 20 minute mark from the top of the box, only to see it well collected by the Potters stopper, before he tried again from the same distance three minutes later after an Everton corner was half-cleared but it flew wide. As the fourth official signalled for a minute of added time, Rooney made it a return to remember as he netted the opening goal. He set off the move himself with the ball going through Gueye, Sandro Ramirez and Dominic Calvert-Lewin down the right flank before the latter whipped a cross into the box which Rooney rose to meet, powering the ball past Butland. Stoke started the second half well and could have had an equalising goal five minutes after the break, but Erik Pieters' fine cross flashed past four Stoke players in the box before Kurt Zouma produced a fantastic tackle to deny Clavert-Lewin a one-on-one with the goalkeeper at the other end.

Subs used: Crouch (5), Choupo-Moting (5) Man of the match: Wayne Rooney Darren Fletcher also went close for the visitors just before the hour mark as Joe Allen slotted the ball into feet, allowing the Scotland international to let fly from around 20 yards but it just flashed wide of Pickford's post. The fantastic battled between Zouma and Calvert-Lewin continued throughout the second half and the Everton youngster left the defender on the floor in the 69th minute, bursting into the area but his shot at goal was kept at bay by the hands of Butland. His opposite number Pickford was the hero for Everton in the 93rd minute as Xherdan Shaqiri drove towards the box and let fly with a thunderous effort, the England goalkeeper making a superb leaping save to ensure the three points stayed at Goodison Park. Man of the match - Wayne Rooney Wayne Rooney is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring It was not just the goal that sees Rooney take the plaudits from the match, he looked to be back to the player of years gone by. He was everywhere on the field, playing some brilliant passes for his team-mates and also put a shift in at the back. Of course, his goal will stand out but his overall contribution cannot be overlooked. Manager reaction Ronald Koeman: \"I'm happy with the points. Maybe every manager before the start of the season thinks that their team is ready and prepared but it was really a difficult game.

Stoke made it really difficult and if you now that, and you keep the clean sheet and the points at home, it is a perfect result.\" Mark Hughes: \"We are disappointed about the result clearly because we wanted to get off to a winning start if we could but the key from our point of view, it was the level of performance we are looking to produce so I was reasonably pleased with that. Stoke boss Mark Hughes says his side just need to add a cutting edge to their game but took the positives from their defeat to Everton Stoke boss Mark Hughes says his side just need to add a cutting edge to their game but took the positives from their defeat to Everton \"Everton didn't really have too many clear-cut chances so we restricted a very good side who spent a lot of money and have got a lot of quality. I think that all bodes well for the games we have ahead of us.\" Pundit reaction Charlie Nicholas: \"In the second half, Rooney was by far and away the man of the match for me, his passing was excellent. They changed it after the break and went to a back four with two up front. \"Calvert-Lewin looked stronger alongside Sandro and Rooney dropped back into that deeper role of the triangle which, for me, is where he's going to play. Where are they going to fit Gylfi Sigurdsson or Ross Barkley if he stays? There are too many midfielders and now enough forwards.\" Charlie Nicholas thinks Everton need to work out what formation they're going to play this season - and stick with it Charlie Nicholas thinks Everton need to work out what formation they're going to play this season - and stick with it Opta stats Rooney also set a new Premier League record for the longest gap between goals for the same club (4869 days days between Everton goals). No player has scored more Premier League goals on the opening day than Wayne Rooney (8 - level with Alan Shearer & Frank Lampard). Bojan Krkic tussles with Idrissa Gueye at Goodison Park Mark Hughes hasn't won any of his last seven opening day Premier League games (D2 L5) in charge of three different clubs in that time (Fulham, QPR and Stoke).

continued as they were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw by Swansea on the opening day of the season. There was plenty of positivity around St. Mary's ahead of a new campaign under newly-appointed manager Mauricio Pellegrino, but a sixth successive stalemate spoiled the occasion. The Saints dominated from the first whistle to last, registering 29 shots on goal - two on target - but failed to convert their dominance against a dogged Swansea outfit. It means nine hours and five minutes of Premier League football have passed at St Mary's since Southampton last scored - James Ward-Prowse's strike against Crystal Palace on April 5. Team news Virgil van Dijk was absent with a virus, as uncertainty continues to surround his Southampton future. Jan Bednarek and Mario Lemina started on the bench. Tammy Abraham made his first start in the Premier League for Swansea following his season-long loan from Chelsea, while summer signing Roque Mesa started on the bench. Gylfi Sigurdsson was left out completely. Manolo Gabbiadini's second-minute header clipped the crossbar and Dusan Tadic fired wide two minutes later as Saints, keen to atone for failing to score in their final five home games of last season, flew out of the traps. Tammy Abraham failed to take advantage of that reprieve, heading Wayne Routledge's cross wide on 10 minutes as Swansea stirred. Southampton soon regained control though but failed to score as Gabbiadini's turned Tadic's cross over before Alfie Mawson and Marcus Olsson blocked Ward-Prowse's effort.

Subs: Bartley (4), Fulton (4), McBurnie (n/a). Man of the match: Ryan Bertrand Lukasz Fabianski pulled off a fine stop to deny Ward-Prowse's curling effort on 25 minutes before referee Mike Jones chose not to award the hosts a penalty when Federico Fernandez tripped Tadic in the area. Maya Yoshida acrobatically volleyed wide on 37 minutes and Abraham's great swivel and shot was headed clear by Cedric Soares a minute after the restart. Saints were soon back in charge, though, as Gabbiadini curled a shot wide on 52 minutes. But there was to be no way through for Southampton as Fabianksi denied Tadic 11 minutes from time and Yoshida headed a glorious chance over on 80 minutes. Tammy Abraham and Jack Stephens battle for possession Opta stats None of the last six Southampton managers have won their first Premier League game in charge (inc. Mauricio Pellegrino). Southampton have never won an opening day home fixture in the Premier League (D6 L4). Seven of Southampton's last nine Premier League games have been goalless at half time. Swansea failed to land a single shot on target, while the hosts Southampton fired in just two despite attempting 29 shots in total (inc. blocks). The managers Mauricio Pellegrino: We did everything to win the game. Our football was effective. But we had to score. We were playing well but sometimes in football you create chances but are not precise enough to score goals. Paul Clement: Southampton had a massive amount of shots so I'm sure they are going to be disappointed and be thinking how they haven't won. But, at the same time, we've hung in until the very end, so, overall, I'm pleased to have come away with a point. Man of the Match - Ryan Bertrand One of the few bright lights in a hugely uninspiring affair. Bertrand grafted hard and combined well with Nathan Redmond to carve Swansea open down the left flank time and again. What's next?

opening day win against Bournemouth at the Hawthorns. The Baggies took all three points in a relatively comfortable win to kick off their Premier League season as Hegazi (30) powered in the decisive goal from point-blank range. Despite dominating possession, particularly in the second half, Bournemouth struggled to break down a compact, organised West Brom defence who were rarely troubled all afternoon. West Brom's threat from set-pieces proved to be the difference, with Hegazi enjoying a day to remember. Team news Jermain Defoe started on the bench for the Cherries as Benik Afobe started up top with Josh King behind him. £20m signing Nathan Ake started in defence while Asmir Begovic also makes his debut. For West Brom, Ahmed Hegazi started at central defence in place of the injured Gareth McAuley. There's a place in the starting XI for 19-year-old Sam Field while Jay Rodriguez also makes his competitive debut after joining from Southampton in the summer. Jonny Evans and James Morrison missed out through injury. The contest began slowly but Jay Rodriguez looked keen to impress his new boss Pulis, who signed a new two-year contract on Friday. The former Southampton striker tested Asmir Begovic early with a shot from distance before having a close-range attempt saved by the Bosnia international. West Brom, a notoriously threatening side from set-pieces, profited from another one as Chris Brunt's in-swinging cross towards the penalty box was headed in by Hegazi from close range. The Egypt international nearly scored another two minutes later, but his strike from just outside the box went narrowly over the bar. Player ratings West Brom: Foster (7), Nyom (7), Dawson (8), Hegazi (9), Field (6), Yacob (6), Livermore (6), Phillips (7), Brunt (7), McClean (6), Rodriguez (8) Subs: Harper (6), Robson-Kanu (6), Rondon (6) Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (6), Cook (6), Ake (7), Daniels (6), Fraser (6), Surman (6), Arter (6), Pugh (6), King (6), Afobe (6) Subs: Ibe (5), Defoe (6), Smith (6) Man of the match: Ahmed Hegazi The Baggies kept applying the pressure in an opening half where Bournemouth struggled to forge any real clear-cut opportunites. And, just minutes before the break, Ben Foster made a crucial slide tackle on Josh King to prevent him from having a shot on goal. West Brom started the second half brightly and continually proved dangerous from corners. Brunt had a corner cleared off the line while Phillips' ball in for Claudio Yacob struck the post. Bournemouth only had two shots on target Bournemouth enjoyed the lions share of possession for the rest of the match, but they could not find a way past the resolute West Brom defence and had just two shots on target all game. Substitute Salomon Rondon would have scored for Albion in injury time if it not for Begovic, who tipped his curling strike around the post. Opta Stats Bournemouth struggled to break West Brom down West Bromwich Albion have won successive opening day fixtures in league football for the first time since 1992. Bournemouth have lost all three of their opening day fixtures in the Premier League, losing 1-0 to Tim Sherwood's Aston Villa in 2015, Jose Mourinho's Manchester United 3-1 last year and to Tony Pulis' WBA today (0-1). The Baggies had 28.8% possession in this match - the 15th occasion that WBA have had less than 30% possession in a Premier League game under Tony Pulis. Of those 15, they've won six. WBA's Rekeem Harper was only the second player born this century (08/03/2000) to play in the Premier League, after Man Utd's Angel Gomes on the final day of the 2016-17 Premier League season. The Managers West Brom boss Tony Pulis says his squad is not strong enough despite beating Bournemouth 1-0. West Brom boss Tony Pulis says his squad is not strong enough despite beating Bournemouth 1-0. Tony Pulis: \"We want everybody to chip in and the quality we got from set plays today was absolutely fantastic and how we never scored more than one goal I just don't know. \"We need to get some players in and quickly. Sam Field did fantastic today and Rakeem but we need to get more players and good players. Everybody from around the football club is waiting for them to come in.\" Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe says his side didn't create any clear cut chances despite their possession during their defeat at West Brom. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe says his side didn't create any clear cut chances despite their possession during their defeat at West Brom. Eddie Howe: \"I'm disappointed. I thought with the set-plays we obviously didn't deal with that well. It's unlike us to have so much possession and not create what I felt was a really good chance was probably the most disappointing thing. \"I was disappointed with the build-up to it [the first goal], which against West Brom puts you under pressure so that's disappointing. They defended very well and very deep with numbers\" The Pundit - Alan Curbishley \"Last season West Brom scored over 40 per cent of goals from set plays and they've done so again today. As Eddie Howe said, if you're not prepared to defend against those then they're going to score. \"[West Brom] need to bring in some more players. We heard this from Pulis last season, and because he does so well, they do get complacent and they can't afford to do it again this year. He realises they need to bring in more players than last season. The board needs to back him.\" Man of the Match - Ahmed Hegazi Hegazi put in a Man of the Match display Hegazi may not have started if Jonny Evans was injury-free, but he certainly impressed as he converted a header from a corner and then went on to keep Josh King and Benik Afobe at bay and secure a West Brom clean sheet.

defeat as two late Man City goals earned the visitors a 2-0 win at the Amex on Saturday evening. City dominated possession but were made to wait until the 70th minute for their opener as Sergio Aguero finished smartly after a mistake by Dale Stephens. Lewis Dunk's own goal five minutes later sealed victory for Pep Guardiola's side, who also had a Gabriel Jesus goal ruled out for handball. Aguero squandered City's first chance when he mis-kicked from Kyle Walker's cross, before Izzy Brown was forced off for Brighton with a suspected hamstring injury. Team news Brighton handed debuts to Mathew Ryan in goal, Davy Propper and Pascal Gross, while Glenn Murray and Anthony Knockaert started on the bench. Manchester City had three new faces in their XI, with Premier League debuts for Ederson, Kyle Walker and Danilo. Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus started in attack. It almost got worse for the hosts on 27 minutes but Jesus' bundled finish was ruled out for handball by referee Michael Oliver. City failed to make their dominance count before the break as a fantastic save by Mathew Ryan denied Jesus, who struck the post on the follow-up under pressure from Bruno. The visitors had the ball in the net again after the break but Silva was adjudged offside, while Aguero wasted another opening after Shane Duffy's short back-pass put Brighton in trouble. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Bruno (6), Dunk (6), Duffy (6), Suttner (6), Brown (6), Propper (7), Stephens (5), March (5), Gross (5), Hemed (5) Subs: Knockaert (6), Murray (6), Murphy (6) Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (8), Kompany (7), Otamendi (7), Stones (7), Danilo (6), Fernandinho (7), De Bruyne (7), D Silva (7), G Jesus (7), Aguero (7) Subs: Sterling (6), B Silva (6), Sane (6) Man of the match: Kyle Walker The hosts enjoyed a short spell of pressure shortly before Aguero's opener, with Duffy's deflected strike flying narrowly wide. But they fell behind with 20 minutes to play and could not recover. Stephens surrendered possession cheaply in midfield and when Kevin De Bruyne played in David Silva, he picked out Aguero to finish. City kept their foot down and got their second through Dunk, who headed past his own goalkeeper under pressure from Jesus. Gabriel Jesus had a goal disallowed in the first half Opta stats Sergio Aguero has now scored against 30 of the 31 sides he has faced in the Premier League (only failing to score against Bolton). Lewis Dunk is the seventh player to score an own-goal on his Premier League debut. Goalkeeper Mat Ryan attempted more passes than any outfield Brighton player in this match (27). Brighton enjoyed just 21.9 per cent of the possession against Manchester City; last season their lowest share in a Championship game was 31.5 per cent (vs. Huddersfield in February). Man of the match - Kyle Walker The new City full-back marked his competitive debut with a sharp attacking performance. He will get tougher tests defensively but made the most of City's dominance to storm forward at every opportunity, creating the game's opening chance for Aguero. Full-back is a position Pep Guardiola attaches particular importance to and it was just the kind of performance from Walker that City often lacked last season. The managers Chris Hughton: \"For 70 minutes we played the game that we had to play. \"When you're up against the quality that they've got - they have designs on Champions League; ours is to stay in this division next season. \"For 70 minutes we kept them to minimal good chances. But probably the first moment you allow yourselves to get really stretched as a team they capitalised. That's the quality that they've got.\" Pep Guardiola: \"The first game is always complicated. We saw this weekend what happened in many games. From my experience in Barcelona too, especially against the newly promoted it's always difficult. And we did it. \"We were stable. We controlled the game and the game was in our hands. To start with three points away it's always so important.\" What next?

Leicester Arsenal produced a stunning late comeback to beat Leicester 4-3 as the Premier League returned in thrilling fashion on Friday night. Arsene Wenger's men were 3-2 down with seven minutes remaining but goals from substitutes Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud stole the game from under Leicester's noses. Big-money signing Alexandre Lacazette took just two minutes to score on his debut but he was outshone by the visitor's No 9 as Jamie Vardy scored twice against the team that came close to signing him last summer. In what was a pulsating start to the new season, which was kicking off for the first time on a Friday, Leicester equalised within three minutes of Lacazette's opener through Shinji Okazaki and then took a shock lead through Vardy. Arsenal responded just before the break through Danny Welbeck but Vardy headed home from a Riyad Mahrez corner on 59 minutes. As the home fans started to become restless, Arsenal staged a late fightback with Ramsey and Giroud both finding the net from close range within two minutes of each other to send the roof off the Emirates. Those that have been craving Premier League football over the summer were given a sweet release inside the opening five minutes with two goals - one at either end. Team news Arsenal handed Premier League debuts to Sead Kolasinac and Alexandre Lacazette as Arsene Wenger continued to play three at the back. Alexis Sanchez - linked with a move away - was missing with an abdominal injury. Leicester decided to leave £25million signing Kelechi Iheanacho on the bench but Harry Maguire was handed his debut. Despite looking on the verge of joining Roma, Riyad Mahrez started on the right wing. Lacazette averaged a goal every 86 minutes for Lyon last season in Ligue 1 but needed just two minutes to get his season rolling at a jumping Emirates Stadium. Mohamed Elneny whipped the ball in from the right and there in the box waiting was the Frenchman, who stooped to divert a clever header into the far corner. It rekindled memories of Ian Wright at Highbury such was his poacher-like finish. The home fans' joy lasted just three minutes. Marc Albrighton sent a ball in from the right which new signing Harry Maguire did brilliantly to loop back into play at the back post. Okazaki was waiting out-jumped Granit Xhaka to head home from close range. Despite Arsenal's domination of the ball, Leicester were back to their title-winning best on the counter attack. They pressed high on 29 minutes and stole the ball off the Arsenal defence before moving it out wide to Albrighton. The former Aston Villa man caught Rob Holding napping in the middle with a tasty ball into the six yard box which Vardy gobbled up from close range. Player Ratings Arsenal: Cech (6), Holding (5), Monreal (5), Kolasinac (5), Bellerin (5), Elneny (6), Xhaka (6), Oxlade-Chamberlain (7), Ozil (7), Welbeck (8), Lacazette (8) Subs: Ramsey (8), Giroud (8) Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Simpson (7), Morgan (5), Maguire (7), Fuchs (5), Mahrez (7), Ndidi (7), James (6), Albrighton (7), Okazaki (7), Vardy (8) Subs: Iheanacho (6), Gray (6), Amartey (6) Man of the match: Alexandre Lacazette You could feel the tension in the stands rising with every passing minute of sloppy Arsenal play. A goal was required and Welbeck stepped up just before the break to ease the restlessness in the stands. Mesut Ozil showed a fleet-of-foot on the edge of the box and the play developed inside the box before the German squared a fantastic ball to Welbeck - which took Kasper Schmeichel out of the game. The Arsenal striker couldn't miss. Danny Welbeck celebrates with team-mates after equalising late in the first half The equaliser would presumably set the platform for Arsenal to step on the gas in the second period, but it was the visitors who pressed on. Petr Cech had to be quick off his line to stop a surging Riyad Mahrez run before flying to his left to push a long range effort wide from the same player. Cech could do nothing to stop Vardy on 59 minutes - although his defence should have. Mahrez slung over a near post corner which found Vardy in three yards of space. Nacho Monreal looked at Holding while Xhaka looked at Monreal. This left Vardy with the simple task of flicking home from eight yards out. Arsenal looked nervous in their bid to equalise, prompting Wenger to call from Ramsey and Giroud from the bench - and they repaid their manager's faith. After a spell of pressure inside the Leicester box, Ramsey controlled at the far post and drilled the ball beyond Schmeichel with seven minutes left. Arsenal now smelt blood and went for the kill. From a right-wing corner Giroud rose highest to head the ball over the line, via the crossbar, with goal-line technology confirming the goal. It sent the Emirates into delirium. If you didn't know already, the Premier League is back. Man of the match Alexandre Lacazette: Have Arsenal found the fox in the box they've been searching for? Strong, quick and very nimble on the ball, the striker was a handful on his debut as the Gunners didn't seem to miss the hustle and bustle of Alexis Sanchez. He took his goal like a natural born goalscorer, too. Manager reaction Wenger on Giroud: \"I love the man and the player because he is a fantastic guy, he loves the club and he does not want to leave and I am happy that he wants to stay. \"But at some stage I opened the door for him because I knew that I had many strikers, but he is really loved here and we really love him and in the end he decided to stay.\" Craig Shakespeare: \"I think when teams make substitutions from the corners, it can cause a bit of confusion. That's not making any excuses because when subs go on, they are given jobs and I expect them to pass on information. \"If you look at the third goal, I'm a bit disappointed with the handball leading up to it but that aside, once you get the corner, you have to defend it better.\" Opta stats Lacazette scored with his first shot (and second touch) as a Premier League player; just 1:34 in to the game. Lacazette is just the seventh player to score on his Premier League debut for Arsenal; after Kevin Campbell, Steve Bould, Fredrik Ljungberg, Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri & Thomas Vermaelen. Olivier Giroud's goal was his 50th in all competitions at the Emirates Stadium for Arsenal. Since the start of last season, Giroud has scored seven Premier League goals as a substitute - three more than any other player in this period. What next? Arsenal travel to Stoke City next Saturday evening for a tough clash with Mark Hughes' men. Leicester host new boys Brighton and Hove Albion at the King Power Stadium."}]
