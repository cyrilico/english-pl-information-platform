the end there was to be no denying Manchester City, no excruciating stress to endure as Brighton & Hove Albion repelled the barrage whipped up by the visitors on the south coast and no nail-biting finale as City strained for a winner while news filtered through of Liverpool’s ascendancy on distant Merseyside. What tension that existed here had been lanced after a little over an hour. Everything thereafter was a celebration of the champions’ excellence.\n\nGuardiola thanks ‘incredible’ Liverpool but backs Manchester City to kick on Read more\n\nCity know they have been challenged this year, stretched wonderfully by Liverpool’s startling progress. The mind-boggling tally of points collected by Jürgen Klopp’s side would have been enough to claim the championship in all but three of the previous 119 campaigns based on three points for a win and yet it was still not enough to overhaul Pep Guardiola’s team.\n\nThey have won 198 points across two seasons, a staggering haul. Their 95th top-flight goal of the campaign, a free-kick whipped sumptuously into the top corner by Ilkay Gündogan, summed it all up. Mat Ryan sprang to his left but could not lay a glove on it. Opponents have been trying and failing to do that with City all season.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nNot for a decade has a side retained this title but the form mustered in the run-in – 14 successive wins stretching back to a defeat at Newcastle in late January – represented a blistering response to the challenge on their authority being mustered from Anfield. Times had been slightly more trying over recent weeks when Liverpool simply would not let up, with a succession of slender wins keeping the holders marginally ahead, and there would be early pangs of anxiety here against opponents liberated from their fears of relegation.\n\nBrighton were more adventurous than normal and Glenn Murray’s header, the striker reaching Pascal Gross’s corner ahead of a flailing Ederson, had represented City’s first deficit in a Premier League match since that defeat at St James’ Park.\n\nPlay Video 2:35 Guardiola calls Man City's Premier League title his 'toughest triumph' – video\n\nPerhaps uncertainty would have crept in if that advantage had held a little longer, say to the interval. Maybe City would have wilted as they chased the contest, particularly with confirmation of Sadio Mané’s goal at Anfield having rippled round the arena. In hindsight neither of those seemed remotely plausible. The worst thing Brighton could have done was to provoke them. Where the visitors had initially been laboured in their monopoly of possession, prone to over-elaboration as they ran aground on Albion’s resistance, the shock of shipping that opener shook them awake.\n\nPep Guardiola stands alone as Manchester City’s biggest star | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nSuddenly there was urgency. Instantly there was incision. The hope that flared up on Merseyside was snuffed out in 83 seconds as Aymeric Laporte and David Silva, with a flick Chris Hughton described as “sublime”, sent Sergio Agüero into space within sight of goal. The striker slipped a crisp shot through the on-rushing Ryan and in an instant the champions’ momentum had been restored. “The most important thing was this team went behind but came back immediately,” said Raheem Sterling. “The manager here is all about mentality: it’s about winning no matter what. I’m just happy to be under his wing.”\n\nThere was an air of inevitability about so much that followed, with Brighton never likely to withstand the onslaught that ensued. Ryan may have done well to deny Bernardo Silva’s diving header but there was pizzazz to City’s passing again and a far more upbeat tempo to their movement. They smothered the life out of their hosts in what remained of the first half, swarming over panicked opponents.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nMurray’s poor pass would present the ball to David Silva, with Ryan doing well to deny Riyad Mahrez. Unperturbed, the Algerian swung over the corner and Laporte, having evaded Murray, thumped his header down and in from the edge of the six-yard box. The Frenchman has been a pillar of strength all season. It was fitting he should draw the focus on the league season’s final day.\n\nIf there was anxiety to endure thereafter, it was mainly born of Guardiola’s pursuit of perfection. Ederson kept out Lewis Dunk’s free-kick but the City manager expected something more resounding than mere narrow success. It was only after Mahrez, on only a fourth league start this calendar year, gathered and tormented Dunk, cutting back inside to leave the centre-half crumpled on the turf, before ripping a glorious right-footed finish into the top corner via a touch off Ryan’s glove that the City manager acknowledged the race had in effect been won. He joined those on the visitors’ bench, from coaching staff to substitutes, in spilling out on to the turf, the goalscorer lost in the mess of joyous bodies. They knew there would be no coming back for either Albion or Liverpool from this.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest City’s players including Aguero, De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva and Kompany celebrate victory. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nThe rest, from Gündogan’s free-kick to Vincent Kompany being granted the ovation he deserves as he departed the fray five minutes from time, was a celebration. This is the Belgian’s fourth Premier League title. “And by far the hardest and most draining,” said the captain, whose winner against Leicester last week ended up feeling like the campaign’s defining moment. “The first one was one in the last minute of the season [with Agüero’s goal back in 2012], but this was constantly knowing you had to win and perform.\n\n“We defeated one of the all-time great teams in England, too. But, from the first meeting we had this season it’s all been about trying to get back-to-back titles, and, straight away, I knew we would achieve that.” Kompany and City have an FA Cup final to come next weekend as they attempt to secure an unprecedented domestic treble.

was not quite the inconveniently meaningless detour it might have initially appeared.\n\nQuite apart from rubber-stamping Unai Emery’s team’s fifth-place finish, it confirmed Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang is a striker to be reckoned with and young Joe Willock surely has an exciting future.\n\nWhile the Gabon striker scored twice – as well as hitting the woodwork and missing a sitter – to end up joint-top of the division’s scoring charts with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané on 22 goals, Willock impressed in an attacking midfield role. It is early days and he is a different type of player but maybe, just maybe, Arsenal have a long-term successor to the departing Aaron Ramsey in their ranks.\n\nSadio Mané double sinks Wolves but Liverpool’s title wait goes on Read more\n\n“We didn’t have enough points to be in the top four so we cannot be 100% happy but we are improving,” said Emery, whose side will need to beat Chelsea in Baku to qualify for the Champions League next season. Otherwise it’s back to the Europa once more, although at least fifth position avoids any chance of the need to enter a qualifying round in July.\n\nMore immediately, Arsenal’s manager is waiting to discover if he can play his Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan in Azerbaijan. “It’s a political issue,” Emery said. “We don’t know. We’re doing all we possibly can. I don’t know what the solution is. I would prefer to play closer to home and move more supporters with us. I don’t know why they decided to play there.”\n\nHe made nine changes from the side which overcame Valencia in Thursday’s semi-final. Only Nacho Monreal and Aubameyang retained their places in a slightly experimental XI with the 19-year-old Willock making his first league start of the season.\n\nWithin minutes, Aubameyang had struck the woodwork after meeting the fallout from a free-kick won by Willock but conceding goals has been much more of a problem than scoring them for Arsenal this season – particularly on the Premier League road, where they have kept only one clean sheet all season.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAshley Barnes highlighted this vulnerability as he headed narrowly wide before an unmarked Chris Wood saw his low shot rebound off the inside of a post. Arsenal were out of defensive synchronicity and it was probably a blessing in disguise when injury prompted the replacement of the rather wobbly centre-half Konstantinos Mavropanos with Laurent Koscielny.\n\nArsenal’s collective concentration seemed to be wavering in the glorious sunshine illuminating the Pennine moors above the stadium and the cricket match unfolding on an adjacent pitch visible in a gap between Turf Moor’s stands.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest All eyes on the ball at Turf Moor. Photograph: Alex Dodd - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images\n\nBar the moment, late in the first half, when Willock swivelled sharply and shot just wide, Sean Dyche’s side were in control. “It was as good as we’d played all season,” said Burnley’s manager, “but Arsenal were really strong in the second half.”\n\nCardiff mark top-flight departure with victory at Manchester United Read more\n\nIn other words Aubameyang woke up. His 21st goal of the domestic campaign arrived following a ghastly Ben Mee error, involving the home defender permitting Jark Cork’s backpass to squirm free from beneath his boot.\n\nAubameyang revelled in darting into the gap and placing a low shot beyond Tom Heaton’s grasp. Goal No 22 was a close-range volley lashed home after his powerful connection with Alex Iwobi’s pass.\n\nBarnes reduced the deficit with a thumping header before Aubameyang faced a moment of destiny. He could and should have secured that golden boot when Mkhitaryan slid the ball across the box but, at full stretch, he stabbed a shot tantalisingly wide with an open goal at his mercy.\n\nPeter Crouch has a habit of scoring on the final day of the season and, having stepped off the bench he sent a half-volley flashing goalwards only for it to be deflected to safety by his teammate James Tarkowski. The scene was set for a visiting substitute, Eddie Nketiah, to enjoy the final word, pushing the ball through Heaton’s legs for his first Premier League goal, deep in stoppage time."}, {"date":

Zaha then carried possession into the visitors’ penalty area from where he had to stretch to shoot, leaving Travers with a simple save that rebounded off Jack Simpson and rolled into the net.\n\nJefferson Lerma unexpectedly struck on the stroke of half-time and Bournemouth were given hope of a comeback 12 minutes into the second half when Jordon Ibe’s low, goal-bound shot deflected off Joel Ward and beyond the unfortunate Vicente Guaita’s reach.\n\nZaha was again crucial in the goal that effectively ensured a home victory. After receiving possession from Patrick van Aanholt, he took out three defenders before setting up the Dutchman to routinely finish from close range. Joshua King’s 73rd-minute, back-post strike, after Chris Mepham had flicked on Ryan Fraser’s corner, again narrowed the visitors’ deficit, before Andros Townsend added Palace’s fifth seven minutes later with Zaha once again bamboozling the Bournemouth defence.\n\n“We didn’t deal very well with [Zaha] at all,” Eddie Howe said. “We’ve maybe not had a better individual opponent this season.

The Geordie fans crooned throughout this stroll of an end-of- season win in honour of their manager. “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay” was on repeat. From the dugout Benítez gave an understated wave. Not enough to read into, but symbolic of his attachment to Newcastle, something strong enough for him to express his hope they can find a way “to move forward, maybe together”.\n\nAt the end it felt significant that the owner, Mike Ashley, was in attendance in the directors’ box and made his way down to the dressing room to offer his best wishes to the manager and his players. “He said congratulations, talking with me and the team, nothing special,” Benítez said. The main talking will take place next week, mindful that the manager’s contract expires at the end of June, and guarantees of ambition are required to mend damaged trust. Ashley could not fail to have noticed how cohesive and positive the team were. That old chestnut about where they are, and whether they are making the very best of themselves, remains at the heart of it all.\n\nRafael Benítez suggests he is close to signing new Newcastle contract Read more\n\nIt was one of those days where the football was there to be played and enjoyed without stress. Fulham were largely accepting as they bade a feeble farewell to the top flight for the time being, while Newcastle’s players provided their own convincing tribute to the outstanding work delivered by Benítez.\n\nFinishing the campaign in sunny midtable, it was worth remembering Newcastle began with a run of eight defeats and two draws from their first 10 Premier League games (worse form even than Fulham’s). Benítez pulled it all together expertly.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nIn a perfect world, would he want to stay at St James’ Park? “We have a meeting coming soon, hopefully as soon as possible, and then we will see where we are,” Benítez said. “Someone will ask me the question, do I want to stay? It’s very easy. I can see the potential of this massive club and hopefully we can do things in a way that will be good for everyone to move forward, maybe together. At the moment, it’s just keep talking and see what happens next week.”\n\nIn the ninth minute the Newcastle contingent were given a moment to savour. From a corner swung in by Matt Ritchie, Jonjo Shelvey scored with an outrageous volley. The combination of high velocity and swerve was joyful, and he cantered the length of the pitch for a clenched fist uppercut of a bow in front of travelling fans who were going loopy. If those on the pre-match booze cruise down the Thames must have wondered if they had seen the goal straight that was more than understandable.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jonjo Shelvey has had a frustrating season at Newcastle, making just 17 appearances. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA\n\nNewcastle helped themselves to a more comfortable lead just two minutes later, with thanks to the problem that has dogged Fulham’s season – frail defending. Christian Atsu cut inside and drove in a shot which Sergio Rico spilled into dangerous territory. Ayoze Pérez was quicker to the ball than any Fulham marker for his sixth goal in the past five games.\n\nMark Noble leads West Ham to top-half finish after win at 10-man Watford Read more\n\nTheir third in the second half was oh so easy. Another corner, another tidy delivery from Ritchie, and this time Fabian Schär nodded in unmarked, before Salomón Rondón had the last word.\n\nAll in all it highlighted the job Scott Parker faces to rebuild Fulham in the Championship next season. Fulham offered little. “Come on!” screeched a plaintive voice in the Johnny Haynes Stand. “Where’s the urgency?!” As rhetorical questions go, though, the honest answer was that urgency began to go missing back in August, not long after the optimism of promotion began to unravel.\n\nParker recognises how much work there is to do and emphasises the club will fight to keep their most valuable assets. “The owners are very committed and will do everything in their power to keep the best players,” he said. “It has given us a clear idea of what needs to be done at the football club. This club needs a culture, an identity. That’s what we’re going to do. It’s a big year for us and I am really looking forward to it.”\n\nThere was, though, a sliver of light, a symbol of how football relies on that indefatigable sense of hope for better times.

extending his stay at Stamford Bridge. “I have made my decision but it is not just about me,” Hazard said.\n\nHazard’s future has turned into something of a saga, prompting him to admit he would have liked everything to have been cleared up much earlier in the season. “Yes, I wanted that but that’s not happened,” Hazard said. “I’m still waiting like you are waiting and like the fans are waiting.”\n\nSpeaking after this stalemate against Leicester, when he came on as a second-half substitute to huge cheers from the travelling supporters, Hazard went on to admit that Chelsea securing a top-four finish – they pipped Tottenham Hotspur to third spot – would not make any difference to his thinking. Asked whether he has told the club of his decision, Hazard said: “Yes. A couple of weeks ago.”\n\nAlthough Hazard has known for some time what his next move will be, he insisted his mind has not strayed from continuing to give everything for Chelsea.\n\n“Never, never.

I know very well that Eden tried to do his best for seven seasons at Chelsea. He did very well, he has become one of the best two or three players in the world, but I think also that we have to respect him and his decision.\n\n“I hope, of course, like every fan of Chelsea, that he will remain with us.

From his own perspective, he is keen to stay and believes he has achieved everything that had been asked of him, by bringing Champions League football back to Stamford Bridge next season.\n\n“The season was really very difficult for us but I think at the end we are happy, because we were in trouble three months ago,” Sarri said. “We were able to react very well. At the end we are in the third position and we reached the target of the club – the Champions League – and we played a final against Man City in the League Cup. Now we have to play a very important match, the final in the Europa League. So at the moment the season is very good but the season can become wonderful.”\n\nSarri was pressed on whether he will be back for a second season at Chelsea. “I think but I am not sure,” he replied. “I don’t know.

Liverpool won, again, courtesy of Sadio Mané’s latest two goals and it is the first time in 39 years they have gone successive seasons without losing a single league fixture on their own ground.\n\nLiverpool have equalled their club record of winning 30 times in the league, the last time that happened being 1978-79 over 42 matches. They have accumulated the third highest points total in history for a 38-game season and, yes, there is still the small matter of a Champions League final to come.\n\nUltimately, though, the only detail that mattered here is that they had finished second – the best runners-up, undoubtedly, there have ever been but second all the same – and at the final whistle it cannot have been easy for Jürgen Klopp and his players to try to disguise all that raw disappointment.\n\nThey certainly had a lot to take in bearing in mind the fast-changing emotions of a day in which Liverpool, for 21 minutes, had led the “as-it-stands” table. Mané’s opening goal arrived in the 17th minute and, in that first half, it was difficult to comprehend all the possibilities that were open – or, indeed, what could be believed and what could not.\n\nFor starters, how about that moment, nine minutes after Liverpool had taken the lead, when the drama suddenly went up another few notches? The roar started in the Main Stand and spread, left to right, growing louder and louder. It was the noise of a crowd that had been told City were losing. But it was a deception, a false alarm, a cruel way to play with everyone’s nerves.\n\nPlay Video 3:00 Premier League 2018-19: the highs and lows of the season – video review\n\nFor two minutes, at least. The next roar crackled round the stadium like electricity and this time it was real. Up in the directors’ box John Barnes was pumping his fists. Kenny Dalglish was checking his phone, grabbing the arm of the person in the next seat. His phone told him: Brighton 1 Manchester City 0.\n\nFor Liverpool the exhilaration did not last long enough. The next update came barely a minute later: a goal for City. Soon afterwards there was another one. In between, a pocket of Liverpool fans started to celebrate another phantom Brighton goal. But the reality was that City were winning and, after that, every significant update from the south coast was a bad one as far as Klopp and his players were concerned.\n\nManchester City pip Liverpool to title with crushing win at Brighton Read more\n\nAmid this bran tub of emotions it was difficult at times to concentrate on what was happening on the pitch. It must have been strange for the Liverpool players, too, to know what was going on, what they could believe and what it meant. They also had to hold off a spirited response from Wolves and that was not straightforward when their opponents, in seventh position, wanted to show why they had finished higher than any promoted side since Ipswich were fifth in 2000-01.\n\nTo begin with, it was difficult for Liverpool to get through. Wolves defended deeply, hoping to spring on the counterattack, and looked relatively comfortable until Trent Alexander-Arnold’s deflected cross set up the opening goal. Mané rifled in a right-footed shot, first-time, from six yards out and Anfield heaved with excitement.\n\nUntil, at least, the updates started coming through about City’s recovery on the south coast. “Brighton came very close to an equaliser on the stroke of half-time,” the announcer George Sephton told the crowd at half-time, doing his best to soothe the mood. They know George here as the Voice of Anfield, playing his music and feeding in the scores. “So fingers crossed for the next 45,” he added.\n\nWolves had also come close to equalising, when Matt Doherty’s shot skimmed the crossbar, and for the first 20 minutes of the second half they looked the more dangerous side. Liverpool appeared weary, worn down possibly by all the drama and emotion of what happened here against Barcelona last Tuesday.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBut they kept going. Mané’s second goal was an 81st-minute header and, again, it came from one of Alexander-Arnold’s deliveries. It was the 13th goal that Liverpool’s right-back had set up this season, a record for any defender in the Premier League era. It also meant Mané pulling level with Mohamed Salah – as well as Arsenal’s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – with 22 league goals to finish joint-top for the Golden Boot. That, however, seemed a consolation prize compared with the party going on elsewhere."}, {"date": "12/05/2019", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74457, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United",

2018-19: 10 games that decided its destiny Read more\n\nThis dire defeat to already-relegated Cardiff followed last Sunday’s draw at the also doomed Huddersfield and means they have flat-lined since Ole Gunnar Solskjær was made permanent manager. That was in late March and since then only Watford and West Ham have been beaten in a run of two wins and eight defeats.\n\nSolskjær signed a three-year deal and believes a rebuild is required. He may need all of this time to make United contenders again after they finished a yawning 32 points behind the champions, Manchester City. Their 66 points are 15 less than last term’s 81, when, under José Mourinho, they finished second. It means United end in sixth place – the position they occupied when Solskjær took over before Christmas – and face participation in the Europa League qualifiers in July if Watford win the FA Cup.\n\nAsked if the owners, the Glazers, and Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, understand how difficult United’s position is Solskjær was emphatic.\n\n“Definitely,” he said. “I’ve had loads of conversations and they’ve been up front and honest. They know we’re in for a rebuild. We know where we are and our form towards the end of the season makes it clearer. When we had that great run [eight consecutive wins] and played some great football at times but towards the end we’ve seen that exceptional efficiency didn’t last. The big plus is the season is over.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Pogba (right) was subject of abuse by a Manchester United fan after the match. Photograph: Paul Currie/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nSolskjær admitted he was not shocked at how United have gone into free-fall. “No,” he said. “It’s not a shock.”\n\nWhile Juan Mata, Ander Herrera, and Antonio Valencia could lead a summer exodus of players, one Solskjær hopes to keep is David de Gea though there is no progress regarding the goalkeeper signing a new deal.\n\n“David’s got one year left and we want to extend with him and we’re in talks and let’s hope it will get sorted and 1 July we know who’ll be with us,” he said. “It’s going to be a very important pre-season for us.”\n\nUnited finished as close to Cardiff in the final relegation berth as City at the top and had to suffer Neil Warnock, the manager who has overseen the Bluebirds’ demise, saying: “It will take more than two or three windows to turn things around. The fans are going to have to bite their tongues for a few years.”\n\nManchester City pip Liverpool to title with crushing win at Brighton Read more\n\nWarnock stated he would never manage again in the Premier League even if he guided Cardiff back up instantly next season. He would not be drawn why.\n\nWarnock is, though, to meet the hierarchy. “I am having a meeting with the chairman [Mehmet Dalman] and chief executive [Ken Choo] on Monday. I’m looking forward to it,” he said. “The club is in a strong position from when I took over and they can push on like Burnley did when they went down. I will leave the club in a good state whenever I leave.”\n\nUnited began brightly but were toothless in front of goal as they allowed Cardiff too easy an outing. Solskjær gave the 17-year-old Mason Greenwood a full debut and made five changes as Diogo Dalot, Andreas Pereira, Jesse Lingard and Chris Smalling also came in. Valencia, the captain, was on the bench for a final involvement in the matchday squad, while Herrera was not included.\n\nWarnock made two changes as out went the injured Víctor Camarasa and Danny Ward (to the bench), and in came Kenneth Zohore and Leandro Bacuna.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nCardiff’s first goal came after Nathaniel Mendez-Laing sprinted past Dalot. When the right-back tried to recover he stuck out a leg and down went the Cardiff man. As Dalot protested, the referee, Jonathan Moss, gave the penalty, which appeared harsh. Up stepped Mendez-Laing who scored to the delight of the travelling fans’ who sang, “1-0 to the Championship” and, to their former manager, “You’re getting sacked in the morning.”\n\nFor the second half Solskjær took off Phil Jones and brought on Anthony Martial. The re-jig here involved Scott McTominay going to centre-back and he was soon conceding a throw in near goal under pressure from Zohore.\n\nIt was McTominay’s missed tackle that led to Cardiff’s second. This let Josh Murphy in along the right and with wide open space in front of De Gea he picked out Mendez-Laing who finished adroitly.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nUnited were veering into shambolic territory and it was Cardiff who could and did strut through the rest of the game. Solskjær’s last move was to take off Pereira and Dalot for Angel Gomes and Valencia, the latter receiving a warming reception.\n\nBut this was as content as the home fans felt – Paul Pogba being the

Everton were the better team and they took charge in the second half with goals from the former Arsenal winger, Theo Walcott, and Cenk Tosun. Christian Eriksen’s rasping low free-kick earned Spurs a draw but they had needed to better Chelsea’s result at Leicester – and that would also finish in a draw.\n\nChelsea secure third place in Premier League with goalless draw at Leicester Read more\n\nStill, there were no tears from Mauricio Pochettino and his players – on the contrary. Their struggles this season have been well documented, taking in the lack of signings and the delay in moving into their new stadium. But they can now reflect with pride on a fourth top-four finish in succession. Pochettino called it the best of his five at the club.\n\n“It is difficult to assess now but in time the people will realise what we achieve,” the manager said. “We have made history by reaching the Champions League final and, if we can win, we will write history and change the perception of this amazing club.”\n\nThe attention now turns to the showpiece with Liverpool on 1 June. It promises to be the longest of waits, during which the players will have to maintain physical and mental sharpness. Pochettino said he would give them two days off before the preparations begin in earnest.\n\nThe positive side of the delay is that the squad’s injured players – chief among them Harry Kane and Harry Winks – ought to have time to recover fitness. Pochettino substituted Dele Alli at half-time because the attacking midfielder felt jaded. He can recharge.\n\nPlay Video 3:00 Premier League 2018-19: the highs and lows of the season – video review\n\nA celebratory tone underscored the afternoon, from the moment before kick-off when the home crowd bellowed their appreciation for Lucas Moura, whose hat-trick had destroyed Ajax to take the club to their first European Cup final. After the game the on-pitch announcer enjoyed saying that Arsenal would compete in next season’s Europa League, although that would not be true if they were to win this season’s edition of the tournament. Virtually every fan stayed for the squad’s lap of appreciation, which reflected the overall happiness.\n\nNo one at Spurs had given a thought to the outlandish eight-goal swing with regards to Arsenal to relegate them from the Champions League places, least of all Daniel Levy, who wrote in his programme notes: “Securing a top-four spot to give us Champions League football for a fourth successive season is in itself something of which to be immensely proud.”\n\nManchester City pip Liverpool to title with crushing win at Brighton Read more\n\nThe chairman did not hold back on the hyperbole. “Even before the incredible events of Wednesday night in Amsterdam, this campaign has been one of the most epic in the club’s history,” he said. “Moments we could only dream of have become reality. We dare to dream and we want nothing more than to bring the Champions League trophy to north London.”\n\nSpurs scored early when Eric Dier lashed home following a corner and, pretty soon, the minds of many fans, particularly those on the Everton side, had begun to drift to matches elsewhere – namely in Brighton and Liverpool.\n\nWhen the news filtered through that Manchester City had gone 2-1 up at Brighton in the 38th minute, the cheers rang out in the away enclosure. Some Everton fans had sung Blue Moon on the trains to the stadium and fraternity was the order of the afternoon. “We’ll all be having a party, when Tottenham win the cup,” chanted the Everton fans, with a nod to the Champions League final.\n\nEverton knew they could not finish higher than eighth and, as such, Europa League qualification was beyond them. They stabilised after a poor start and had a clutch of chances to equalise. The best one came for Michael Keane, following a 10th-minute free-kick, but he sent a free header straight at Hugo Lloris.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe visitors finally got what they deserved when Walcott took a pass from Gylfi Sigurdsson, cut inside and threaded a left-footed shot into the bottom corner . It was Walcott’s fifth goal in his last 10 league appearances against Spurs.\n\nThe travelling fans had erupted to acclaim City’s fourth goal at Brighton and, seconds later, they could acclaim another of their own when Tosun scrambled home after Lloris had pushed out Keane’s header from a corner.

With an end-of-season vibe in the stands, this was always going to be the sideshow to the main event of the FA Cup final next Saturday but 10-man Watford spectacularly imploded against a clinical West Ham to hand Manuel Pellegrini’s side a top-half finish at their expense.\n\nMichy Batshuayi leads Crystal Palace to 5-3 victory over Bournemouth in thriller Read more\n\nWatford finished a history-making league campaign on a whimper – they have won only once since securing their place in the final – and Manchester City’s attacking armoury will be rubbing their hands together at the prospect of facing a defence that has not kept a clean sheet since February and was pulled from pillar to post by Michail Antonio.\n\nMark Noble started and finished the scoring here, with Marko Arnautovic and Manuel Lanzini also on the scoresheet for West Ham, with Gerard Deulofeu’s goal ultimately immaterial. To make matters worse, Watford were reduced to 10 men after José Holebas was sent off for tugging at Antonio and will miss the final unless they succeed in their appeal to the FA.\n\n“In my opinion I can’t believe one player will miss the final for that contact; I can’t believe it,” Javi Gracia said. “Maybe it is a foul, soft foul, light foul but I can be angry with that decision. In this moment it is difficult to accept knowing you have an important game next week. It wasn’t a foul. That contact with one player like Antonio, [if] it is a foul there are lot of fouls during the game.”\n\nAs for West Ham, they have other worries, such as whether Declan Rice will still be at the club next season. “It is impossible, I cannot know the future,” Pellegrini said. “It is a player, of course, who has had a brilliant season, who is 20 years old, who is an English player so he doesn’t use a space in any squad. So he has a lot of qualities: age and nationality, so maybe some of the big teams or all of them will want him. But that is one thing and the other is that, if he stays here or will go, I cannot say.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest José Holebas is shown a red card by referee Chris Kavanagh. Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images via Reuters\n\nWith all eyes on the final, a couple of murals have sprung up outside Vicarage Road to mark the occasion. One, adjacent to the Cornerstone Church opposite the ground, depicts a handful of the 30,000 expected supporters and Harry the Hornet making their way up Wembley Way; the other shows Heurelho Gomes and the Watford captain, Troy Deeney, celebrating under the national stadium’s famous arch.\n\nWatford may have caught Cup fever but Gracia resisted the temptation to rest a raft of players and his side bossed the opening 15 minutes until Noble picked up a cute Antonio pass. As the Watford defence backed off, Noble surged forward, fooling Christian Kabasele on the edge of the area before coolly striking into the corner of Ben Foster’s goal.\n\nWest Ham were soon wheeling away in celebration once more. Antonio was again the catalyst, collecting a raking ball by Noble and bullying Will Hughes, Kiko Femenía and then Craig Cathcart on the edge of the area and rattling the crossbar. Lanzini simply prodded home the rebound.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe brittleness of Watford’s defence may be a cause for concern but Gracia has few worries going forward. Deulofeu was excellent before being withdrawn on the hour mark, earning Watford a route back into an entertaining game 12 seconds after the restart. Zabaleta undercooked an attempted backpass for Fabianski and Deulofeu latched on to it, proceeding to nudge the ball beyond the exposed West Ham goalkeeper and poke home. That roused the hosts but they were incensed a couple of minutes later. Antonio charged on to a Felipe Anderson pass, Holebas clumsily clawed at the forward’s shoulder and, though it was soft, the referee, Chris Kavanagh, showed the Greek defender a straight red card.\n\nIt was not all doom and gloom for Watford – Cathcart did superbly to slide the ball away from Arnautovic – but West Ham were ruthless in the final third. When Ben Foster tipped an Anderson volley on to a post, it cannoned kindly into the path of Arnautovic who swept the ball home for his 10th goal of the season. Antonio caused havoc all afternoon and deserved a goal but he failed to beat Foster with a cheeky lob. Nevertheless, Noble still managed to round off the scoring from the penalty spot, sending Foster the wrong way after Femenía had fouled Antonio."}, {"date": "06/05/2019", "arena": "Etihad Stadium",

the television gantry: “Where do you want your statue, Vincent Kompany?” It was, without question, the goal of a lifetime from the Manchester City captain and the rewards will be measured in silver if his team can extend their winning 13-game sequence by just one more match. It is simple now: a win at Brighton on Sunday and there will be nothing Liverpool, a point behind in second position, can do about it.\n\nNo wonder every single player made a beeline for Kompany at the final whistle. One by one they embraced the Belgian. They were soon joined by the substitutes, various members of Pep Guardiola’s coaching staff and the tracksuited players who were not in the squad. Everyone went to the same player. And then it was Guardiola’s turn, with a bear hug for the man who may just have struck the decisive blow at the top of the table.\n\nBernardo Silva catches the eye before Kompany leaves indelible mark Read more\n\nKompany might not get a statue – not yet, anyway – but his fourth championship winner’s medal from his 11 years at the club would make up for that, one imagines, and, if the trophy does remain in Manchester, there can be no doubt how people will remember the defining moment of the title race.\n\nThere were 70 minutes on the clock when Kompany took possession of the ball and started loping forwards. Nobody in a Leicester shirt went to close him down because, well, it was Vincent Kompany, and he was not going to shoot, was he? Yet they underestimated him. Kompany took the ball into striking range and pulled back his right foot to take aim. It was a mix of desperation and inspiration, all in one. His shot was still rising as it flew past Kasper Schmeichel into what is known, in the parlance of the sport, as the “postage stamp”, just beneath the crossbar at its join with the post.\n\nIt was the 100th home goal City have scored in all competitions this season. Brilliantly it was the first time Kompany had tried a shot from outside the penalty area since 2013. Sergio Agüero later told Kompany he had been shouting for him not to shoot. “Everyone was telling me the same,” Kompany clarified. Yet the ball was struck with curve and spin so it was arcing away from Schmeichel. It was struck majestically. And in that moment, amid all the euphoria and the unmistakable feeling we were watching the champions-in-waiting, suddenly it did not seem to matter it had been such a stodgy performance from Guardiola’s team.\n\nKompany certainly knew the significance of that goal: he was in tears as he walked round the pitch at the end to thank the crowd for their backing. He and his teammates had toyed with the emotions of those supporters. It was anything but straightforward for the reigning champions and, until Kompany decided to take matters into his own hands, it was shaping up to be a potentially calamitous evening.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pep Guardiola and Vincent Kompany embrace after the match. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nIt still might have been but for Kelechi Iheanacho, their former player, squandering Leicester’s outstanding chance of the night, three minutes from the end of normal time. Iheanacho was clean through on goal, with the ball on his favoured left foot, after Hamza Choudhury had picked out his run and, for a split-second, there was a pained silence inside the stadium as everyone waited to see where his shot would end up. It was not even close and, 40 miles or so away on Merseyside, a devastating miss for the Liverpool supporters watching on television.\n\nLeicester had been difficult opponents for a team defending the league title. Guardiola’s team are never quite the same when they are missing Kevin De Bruyne. Fernandinho was also on the list of notable absentees and early on, when an onslaught might have been anticipated, it did not happen. The crowd was flat, twitchy, waiting for something to materialise. The players were flat, too, with the honourable exception of Bernardo Silva, who seemed utterly determined to lift everyone around him.\n\nManchester City v Leicester: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nBy half-time, there had been only one occasion when Schmeichel had been seriously called into action. Agüero’s header had struck the underside of the crossbar, direct from a corner, but could conceivably have spun over the goal-line had it not been for Schmeichel, mid-air, clawing the ball away.\n\nLeicester looked relatively comfortable otherwise, as well as being lively on the break, and though the home crowd occasionally took out its frustration on the officials, it would not have been out of the question for the referee, Mike Dean, to show David Silva, of all people, two yellow cards, rather than just one, in that period. Kompany escaped with a booking for a wild challenge on James Maddison and that, again, demonstrated how the home side were not playing with their usual control.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSomething had to change if the players in light blue were not to blow the league title. Guardiola removed Phil Foden in the 56th minute, bringing on Leroy Sané, and that meant the team operating in a 4-2-4 formation. The full-backs, Kyle Walker and Oleksandr Zinchenko, had the licence to power forward and gradually it became the kind of match that might have been expected earlier on: one side doing virtually all the attacking, the other pinned back.\n\nEven then Leicester still had promising moments on the counterattack, not least when Harry Maguire’s run from defence led to Maddison firing narrowly wide from 20 yards. Schmeichel saved again from Agüero but the home side’s momentum was building. Then the ball was at Kompany’s feet and, in that moment, he produced the reminder that big players like to contribute big moments.\n\nKompany has provided plenty of them over the years but this one was the pick of the lot. He will never strike a sweeter shot. It will never be forgotten here if it is followed up by another victory this weekend and afterwards Guardiola was asked if he knew his captain was capable of hitting the ball so well. “Honestly?” the

"This match encapsulated Chelsea’s bizarre campaign of extremes. There had been a chorus of boos from the home support as the players retired at the interval, all the festering doubts over Maurizio Sarri’s stewardship exposed yet again, only for the jeers to be choked within the first few minutes of the restart and replaced with a raucous taunting of Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe Italian’s team ended the weekend with Champions League qualification guaranteed, a reality celebrated in the bars around this empty arena as Chelsea leapfrogged Spurs into third place. A return to Europe’s elite club competition constitutes a successful first season in English football, though the head coach swerved the post-match lap of appreciation, preferring to survey the scene from the mouth of the tunnel as Gary Cahill, his children in tow, led the players round the pitch. Sarri’s relationship with fans remains strained and the doubters will clearly need more than a dismissal of the FA Cup finalists to be convinced that his tenure is to be embraced.\n\nChampionship roundup: Norwich take title, Boro and Bristol City miss play-offs Read more\n\nEven at a club where life is never simple these are strange times indeed. Chelsea have secured Champions League football, reached the League Cup final earlier this year and could secure passage to Baku and the Europa League final later this week, yet Sarri remains unloved. Perhaps the rather chaotic first-half showing here partly explained why, given their lack of pattern or focus as Watford, slicker and stronger, threatened to run riot. The hosts were outclassed in that period, during which unrest mounted in the stands. The head coach put that slack showing down to fatigue, his squad having returned from the 1-1 draw in Frankfurt only at 4am on Friday. “When you are not brilliant physically, you have to move the ball, one touch or two touches,” he said. “The ball is not tired. The man is tired.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chelsea’s Kepa Arrizabalaga keeps out a Watford effort. Photograph: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images\n\nScoring so early in the second half, from Eden Hazard’s beautifully clipped cross and Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s powerful header, raised the collective mood. Within minutes David Luiz buried a second from Hazard’s 15th assist of the season. Even Gonzalo Higuaín, desperately slack in so much of his play through that plod of a first half, roused himself to clip in an exquisite third after darting behind Craig Cathcart to reach Pedro’s shrewd pass. Further chances were passed up by Olivier Giroud, Higuaín and Pedro and their new-found comfort persuaded Sarri to grant Cahill a farewell appearance for the final few minutes before his summer free transfer. A player dismayed by a lack of communication over his final year at the club could at least depart with a first appearance since November, and his team-mates giving him the bumps in the centre-circle.\n\nThis could, of course, have been a Premier League farewell at Stamford Bridge for Hazard, Giroud and David Luiz too, not to mention the loanees Higuain and Mateo Kovacic, though they will feature here against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday, when N’Golo Kanté is likely to be absent after hurting his hamstring early on.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“It’ll be very difficult to recover him for the next two matches but we’ll try and have him in the final in case [we qualify],” said Sarri, who accepted it might have been wiser to have granted the Frenchman a breather. “Probably today he had to rest. Sometimes it’s very difficult to put on the bench a player so important like Hazard, like Kanté, but you have to do it. Otherwise you take a risk. I made a mistake.” That is a concern, for all that Eintracht spent their Sunday being humiliated at Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga. They will travel to London in hope rather than expectation.\n\nWatford, in contrast, had expected more than this. Quite how they ended up losing so emphatically was baffling given their considerable dominance of that first half. Troy Deeney had bullied his markers while Abdoulaye Doucouré, Gerard Deulofeu and Roberto Pereyra swarmed unchecked through midfield. It took a brilliant, instinctive save from Kepa Arrizabalaga to deny Deeney’s early header, the Spaniard leaping acrobatically to his right to push the ball on to the post. Yet profligacy became a recurring theme.\n\nDoucouré, José Holebas and Deulofeu, three times, should have scored. Holebas also clipped the bar late on and Isaac Success would have scored with his first touch had his header not flicked off Andre Gray, standing in an offside position, en route into a gaping net. Watford have now lost 11 of their last 12 games against the top six, and Manchester City await in the FA Cup final later this month. “But analyse the games against Arsenal, United, Chelsea... in many of them, we had real chances to get better results,” said Javi Gracia. “After that, for sure, I recognise we have to do something better. We have to be more clinical in that situation, more aggressive, in both boxes.”"}, {"date": "05/05/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24263, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield

"Manchester United’s slender hopes of a top-four finish were ended in shambolic fashion when they surrendered an early lead to relegated Huddersfield, allowing the club marooned at the bottom of the table with 14 points to claim a wholly unexpected 15th that will alter the nature of Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s summer.\n\nNot that much has gone for the Terriers in their two-season stay in the Premier League, but at least the side that shares the early relegation record with Derby County can take pride in taking four points off Manchester United in two league meetings at the John Smith’s Stadium. Huddersfield won this fixture last season, and despite a dreadful start to this game they had their chances in the second half to cause a similar shock.\n\nHuddersfield Town v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nIn the circumstances they were delighted with a draw, which is more than can be said for United. Solskjær’s side were hoping to stay in contention until the final day of the season at least, but this result coupled with Chelsea’s win over Watford put a Champions League placing firmly out of reach.\n\nUnited had no one to blame but themselves. They put some impressive moves together in the first half-hour, mainly because they were allowed to, with Juan Mata, Paul Pogba and even Alexis Sánchez finding it easy to slice through the home defence. Yet in terms of end product the visitors were almost as ineffective as Huddersfield themselves, and only turned round ahead because Jonas Lössl failed to make a routine save from Scott McTominay’s speculative shot.\n\nIt was the sort of mistake David de Gea has been making of late. Lössl was possibly unsighted as McTominay sent in a shot from the edge of a crowded area, but even so an effort of no great pace went straight through the goalkeeper to give United an early lead.\n\nDe Gea himself retained his place in the United goal, as Solskjær had promised, and though he had to wait until the 40th minute for Huddersfield to land an attempt on target when the call came he managed to keep out Karlan Grant’s shot with his legs. Pogba headed against the bar just before the interval, and Marcus Rashford could have been sharper to react at the near post when Sánchez beat Erik Durm to a ball the defender thought was rolling dead, though United were unable to translate their clear superiority into goals and on occasions Pogba and Sánchez were downright wasteful in possession.\n\nPlay Video 1:35 'The table seldom lies', says Ole Gunnar Solskjær as Manchester United miss out on top four – video\n\nA better team than Huddersfield might have made them pay early in the second half when Sánchez gave the ball away and Juninho Bacuna drove purposefully towards goal, but instead of returning his pass Grant blazed high over the bar.\n\nUnited still felt safe enough to send on Ander Herrera for Nemanja Matic and Tahith Chong when Sánchez went down injured, only for Huddersfield to hit them with a route-one sucker punch. With everyone except Luke Shaw up for a corner, Lössl caught Mata’s cross and punted the ball downfield, where the bounce eluded the defender’s attempt to cut out the danger and allowed Isaac Mbenza to claim his first Huddersfield goal with a shot under De Gea.\n\nThe stadium erupted, Huddersfield fans having had little to cheer in recent weeks, and when a chant went round the ground reminding the visitors that they were playing a relegated side some of the United supporters joined in. If that was comedy the five-minute wait for a new corner flag after Mbenza snapped one with his goal celebration was pure farce, a reminder if one were needed that United were up against opponents of Championship standard.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nPogba hit the bar again as United chased a late winner, Chong saw a shot saved and Rashford missed the target with a decent chance, though Grant brought a save from De Gea at the other end as the visitors left themselves stretched. A draw was a fair enough result on the balance of play, and there was no doubt who enjoyed it most. “Champions League, you’re having a laugh,” was the taunt as the away section of the ground quickly emptied. Honest as ever, Solskjær was not afraid to admit it. “We haven’t been good enough,” the United manager said. “The Europa League is probably the right place for us at the moment.”"}, {"date":

The smattering of fans who had stayed to bear witness to this joyless formality did at least bid hearty farewells to Petr Cech, Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck, none of whom will play a home game here again. Moments before that Arsenal had said goodbye to any realistic chance of finishing in the Premier League’s top four this season.\n\nArsenal v Brighton & Hove Albion: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nArsenal could yet make it if things get freakish on the last day of term – they would have to win big away to Burnley, for a start, and hope Tottenham lose heavily at home to Everton – but Unai Emery accepts that the only realistic route to next season’s Champions League is to win the Europa League. “Our first target was [to finish in the top four] in the Premier League so we are very, very disappointed,” said the Arsenal manager. “But we need to keep a strong focus for Thursday in Valencia, we can still do something important.” His side take a 3-1 lead into that second leg but will need to show more fortitude than they did here if they are to preserve it.\n\nThis was the latest instalment of a race for the top four that seems more like a lobbying campaign to have the number of English clubs in the Champions League reduced. Arsenal came into the game after three domestic defeats and, despite taking an early lead through a penalty by Pierre-Emerick Aubemeyang, came close to suffering a fourth, as Pascal Gross miskicked from three yards in the dying minutes with the goal at his mercy.\n\nBrighton had drawn level half an hour earlier when Glenn Murray converted a penalty given away in daft fashion by Granit Xhaka. That was Brighton’s first away goal in five matches, and earned them their first point at the home of a top-six team this season.\n\nThe disintegration of Arsenal’s form at the Emirates, which had been impressive until they lost to Crystal Palace in their previous game, attested to a team whose limitations had at last come home to roost.\n\nBrighton, meanwhile, came into this game liberated of the threat of relegation thanks to Cardiff City’s defeat on Saturday. Perhaps Chris Hughton would free up his players to attack with gusto? That looked a zany notion after the opening minutes, during which Brighton’s green-clad players massed around their own box like soldiers guarding a precious asset.\n\nGuarding it badly, too. Arsenal nearly took the lead within two minutes after Alexandre Lacazette demonstrated one of the skills that led to him being announced as the home club’s player of the season before kick-off, dodging between the giant trees in the visitors’ area before laying the ball back to Henrikh Mkhitaryan, whose low shot struck a post.\n\nBrighton’s resistance did not last. In the ninth minute Nacho Monreal went down in the corner of the box as Alireza Jahanbakhsh tried to stretch a leg around him to win the ball. The referee pointed to the spot, from which Aubemeyang fired the ball into the corner of the net. It was the Gabonese striker’s 20th league goal of the season, and there was plenty of time left for him to increase that tally.\n\nBut Arsenal slackened and the imbalances in their team became apparent. Sokratis Papastathopoulos earned himself a booking for a nonsensical dive near halfway in the 15th minute in what was a symptom of the drop in standards.\n\nBrighton bucked up their ideas. And as so often, Arsenal’s defence looked vulnerable under pressure while their midfield failed to offer adequate protection.\n\nAt right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, a 35-year-old making his first league start since February owing to the suspension of Ainsley Maitland-Niles, had trouble keeping up with Solly March.\n\nBernd Leno spawned jitters with erratic distribution, most alarmingly in the 26th minute when he kicked the ball straight to Jahanbakhsh at the edge of the box. In the pandemonium Shkodran Mustafi did well to block a shot by Murray before March clipped a cross back for the striker to try again from eight yards. Leno reacted sharply to stop his downward header.\n\nArsenal seldom control matches. But at least they carry a threat at the Emirates and they created chances to extend their lead. Mat Ryan had to parry a header from Mustafi following a corner in the 35th minute. Moments later the goalkeeper had to fling himself to his right to claw away a low shot by Aubemeyang after a cross from the right by Mesut Özil. And just before the conclusion of a damningly low-key first half Mkhitaryan raised the tone with a blast from 20 yards. Ryan batted it away.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWhatever Emery said at half-time made no difference. Whether that is the manager’s fault is a matter of debate. His players continued to look disjointed and brittle. And the way they allowed Brighton back into the game was downright ridiculous, Xhaka slapping March on the shoulder as the attacker flew past him in the box. Murray sidefooted the penalty into the net.\n\nArsenal found urgency, at last, but could not locate the net.

On a madcap afternoon at Bournemouth, they played for 42 minutes with nine men, after having Son Heung-min and the substitute Juan Foyth sent off, while they were fortunate not to lose Eric Dier to another red card. Their rap sheet also featured five yellow cards.\n\nMauricio Pochettino’s depleted team held out until stoppage-time and it had to be said that Bournemouth were strangely toothless opposition, not entirely comfortable when the onus was on them to force the issue. But they found the killer blow when Nathan Aké showed more desire than anybody around him to head home from Ryan Fraser’s corner.\n\nBournemouth 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe upshot for Spurs was that unless results involving the teams immediately below them go in their favour on Sunday, they will need something – possibly a victory – at home to Everton on the final day to ensure a return to the Champions League via league position.\n\nSpurs’ poor form goes on. They have now lost seven of their past 11 league fixtures and this was not the preparation they had in mind for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final at Ajax on Wednesday, in which they trail 1-0.\n\nPochettino’s players were the architects of their own downfall, with Son getting himself into trouble when he lost his cool on 43 minutes to push Jefferson Lerma, and Foyth leaping into a poor challenge on Jack Simpson almost immediately after his introduction as a half-time substitute.\n\nBournemouth played like a mid-table team at the end of their season, although Eddie Howe could relish a nerveless professional debut from the 19-year-old goalkeeper Mark Travers, but at least they could enjoy the finale. The irony that Aké’s goal came from a set piece, when Spurs had the personnel to defend properly, was not lost on Pochettino. Bournemouth are now one point shy of their best Premier League points tally.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Son Heung-min shoves Jefferson Lerma in the first half. The South Korea forward was shown a straight red card. Photograph: Mark Leech/Offside/Getty Images\n\nHowe felt a little cheeky, to borrow the word that he used, in pointing out Dier should have been the first man sent off but everybody inside the stadium could see it – apart from the referee, Craig Pawson. Already booked for taking out Fraser on the break, he slid back to trip Joshua King on another Bournemouth counter in the 34th minute.\n\nThe entire Bournemouth team moved towards Pawson to demand Dier’s dismissal and, when he allowed play to continue, they were almost caught cold when Spurs broke through Dele Alli. Pawson had the whistle to his lips before he appeared to think better.\n\nDier would get away with another rash challenge on 42 minutes when he went into Callum Wilson inside the area. Dier got none of the ball and all of the man, and it was a mystery as to how Bournemouth did not get a penalty. Pochettino withdrew Dier at the interval because he had become a danger to his team and he did likewise with Toby Alderweireld because he was also on a yellow card.\n\nThe Tottenham manager said he did not want any more dismissals but Foyth would make a mockery of that hope after just three minutes. The young defender over-ran the ball and, stretching to rectify the situation, his momentum took him into Simpson. The Argentinian’s boot was extremely high.\n\nSon had felt the red mist descend after conceding a free-kick to Fraser. He picked himself up, felt Lerma aim a dig in his back and raised his hands in an aggressive manner. Lerma went down dramatically but Son ought to know better. It was possible to wonder whether Pawson’s lack of action over Dier had preyed on the referee’s mind.\n\nSaturday clockwatch: Premier League, League Two finale and more – live! Read more\n\nPrior to the dismissals, the central figure had been Travers. He was almost lobbed from the halfway line by Lucas Moura in the early running but subsequently made a string of saves in the opening 33 minutes, when Spurs were in the ascendancy. The best was a flying tip over the bar to keep out an Alli header. Son also blew a good chance on 31 minutes when he fired high after running around Steve Cook.\n\nKing was denied by Hugo Lloris in the 38th minute – the goalkeeper reached the ball before taking out the man in the area – while Simpson went close in first-half stoppage-time. But with the two-man superiority, Bournemouth hardly laid siege to the Spurs goal. Jordon Ibe drew a routine save from Lloris with a shot from distance and the substitute Lys Mousset blew a free header.\n\n“Of course we’re not happy,” Pochettino said. “We dominated the first half and we played for so long with nine men and their goalkeeper is the man of the match. Crazy. We’ve now got two finals against Ajax and Everton.”"}, {"date": "04/05/2019", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 59961, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz

Andros Townsend had just scored Crystal Palace’s third goal, ending any hopes the Bluebirds had of turning this game around and taking their battle for survival to the final day, when a chant broke out among the home supporters. “There’s only one Neil Warnock” reverberated loud and clear, followed by widespread applause.\n\nAlthough this is the third time that Warnock has been relegated at this level, the season will never go down as a failure. Cardiff had exceeded all expectations by winning promotion in the first place and it says much about the grit, determination and spirit that Warnock has harnessed in his players that they were still in with a chance of staying up with two matches remaining.\n\nCardiff City relegated from Premier League after loss to Crystal Palace – live! Read more\n\nUltimately, the gulf in class was too wide to bridge and, as Warnock admitted afterwards, this was one of those occasions that exposed their limitations. Palace, bristling with attacking intent, ruthlessly took advantage of some benign defending to continue their outstanding away form – 19 points on the road in 2019 – while at the other end Cardiff’s profligacy in front of goal cost them dear.\n\nWarnock sounded a little emotional. He admitted that he had a tear in his eye when the fans were singing his name but also went on to cast doubt on whether he would continue as the club’s manager. There was an extremely poignant moment, too, in his post-match press conference. “Somebody asked me [before entering the room] about Emiliano [Sala] – you spend two months trying to get a player. But I think that also puts things in perspective. We’ve got relegated. The lad lost his life.”\n\nThat tragedy will be the first thing that comes to mind when anyone at Cardiff thinks back to this season in years to come. Sala, a 28-year-old Argentinian striker, was on board a plane that went missing in the Channel on 21 January, little more than 48 hours after Cardiff had announced he had joined them in a club-record deal. “It was so difficult, there’s no point saying it wasn’t,” Warnock added.\n\nNine-man Tottenham undone at the last as Aké snatches win for Bournemouth Read more\n\nThe Cardiff manager had joined his players on a lap of appreciation here – the number of supporters that stayed behind said everything about how much they appreciated the efforts of a team that had been written off before a ball was kicked – and the assumption has always been that Warnock will lead the club in the Championship next season. That, however, seems far from certain in the wake of Warnock’s comments.\n\nAsked whether it was his intention to stay on at Cardiff, Warnock said: “I think we’ve just got to relax for a few days and have a think about everything. I’ve not spoken to anybody. You can’t make rash judgments at this stage of the season with one game to go.”\n\nWarnock then added: “I will be working next year, I will have a year somewhere. I am looking forward to that challenge again now. It’s been a great experience for me [here] and probably my best job ever to have done what we’ve done with the club. I’m right proud of the club.”\n\nWith their goal difference vastly inferior to Brighton, Cardiff knew that they had to beat Palace and Manchester United in their final two fixtures to have a shot at Premier League survival. That was always going to be a tall order, and in many ways the win-or-bust scenario played into the hands of a Palace side that love to play on the counterattack.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andros Townsend celebrates after scoring what proved to be the winner. Photograph: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images\n\nWilfried Zaha’s pace troubled the home side throughout and it was no surprise when the winger, who had a loan spell at Cardiff five years ago, put Palace ahead with a low shot from the edge of the area.\n\nMartin Kelly’s farcical own goal levelled things up – the Palace defender got in a terrible tangle trying to clear Leandro Bacuna’s cross – but Michy Batshuayi soon restored Palace’s lead following a one-two with Jordan Ayew in the Cardiff area.\n\nPlenty of chances then came and went at both ends before Townsend, carrying the ball from just inside his own half, stepped inside Joe Bennett and drilled a low shot that went in off the near upright. Typically, Warnock’s team still kept plugging away and got reward when Bobby Reid pulled a goal back in the 90th minute.\n\n“Cardiff have never given up this season,” said Roy Hodgson, the Palace manager, “and I feel they deserve a lot of credit for that.”"}, {"date": "04/05/2019", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52206, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup":

more. Jürgen Klopp’s team have dragged the title race and Manchester City to the wire with a punishing late victory at Newcastle where Divock Origi reprised his role as unlikely saviour for the club that never gives up.\n\nThe Belgium forward was on the pitch only as a consequence of a head injury to Mohamed Salah, who was carried off after a collision with the Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Liverpool’s title chances appeared to be disappearing along with their leading goalscorer as Rafael Benítez’s determined hosts twice came from behind in search of a merited point.\n\nLiverpool ride their luck but game of fine margins remains wide open | Louise Taylor Read more\n\nBut in the 86th minute Matt Ritchie was wrongly adjudged to have fouled Fabinho deep in the Newcastle half. “It was not a foul,” said the simmering former Liverpool manager. Xherdan Shaqiri whipped over an inch-perfect free-kick and his fellow substitute Origi, plus a slight touch from Jamaal Lascelles, headed home the winner. The pressure is back on Pep Guardiola’s team yet again.\n\nLiverpool and City have now traded 20 consecutive Premier League victories between them, a remarkable stand-off in an enthralling title race, and the margin for error will remain nonexistent until the final day. For Klopp’s team to return to the summit after the painful exertions in Barcelona on Wednesday, after the loss of Salah and only four minutes from a hugely damaging draw, is testament to the depth of their resources – mentally as well as physically. Unlike Ernesto Valverde, who fielded a second-string Barcelona side against Celta Vigo, wholesale changes were out of the question for the Liverpool manager. He confirmed Roberto Firmino will miss the semi-final second leg with a muscle problem and Salah is a doubt with the aftereffects of his head injury. There are no doubts about Liverpool’s resolve or title credentials.\n\nFor 20 minutes they were in complete control against a Newcastle team frantically clearing their defensive lines. Benítez, so diligent in his positional work and collective organisation, looked on aghast at the spaces that invited Liverpool to flood through his five-man defence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Salomón Rondón celebrates scoring Newcastle’s second. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters\n\nSalah was sharp from the off and had gone close twice before Liverpool struck their first blow. Ritchie diverted Salah’s second attempt wide with a vital block. Trent Alexander-Arnold swept the resulting corner into the heart of the Newcastle area, where Virgil van Dijk powered in a textbook header completely unmarked. Lascelles slipped as the corner arrived but had lost Van Dijk before the PFA player of the year scored his sixth goal of the season. Klopp credited his analysts with the set-piece routine.\n\nKlopp’s delight over Origi’s magical finish tempered by Salah injury Read more\n\nThe Liverpool manager reacted with a thumbs-up and an appeal to his players to retain concentration. Newcastle’s reaction was more impressive, however, as they woke from their slumber to transform the flow of the game. Benítez’s side levelled after Dejan Lovren put his own defence under pressure with a wayward pass. Javier Manquillo centred, Salomón Rondón flicked on to Ritchie and turned his return cross goalwards from close range. Alexander-Arnold blocked the shot on the line with an outstretched arm and was fortunate in the extreme that Christian Atsu was on hand to bury the rebound. It would have been a red card for the Liverpool defender plus a penalty had Andre Marriner not played the advantage. He also escaped the yellow for unsporting behaviour that should have been shown.\n\nLiverpool were on the ropes. Manquillo tested Alisson with a diving header, Ayoze Pérez struck the crossbar and Ki Sung-yueng forced the Liverpool goalkeeper into another save from distance. Newcastle, though, then abandoned their defensive duties to damaging effect once again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everyone watches the ball as Divock Origi’s winner, deflected of Jamaal Lascelles, beats Martin Dubravka in the Newcastle goal.

Salah, remarkably, was alone in front of Dubravka’s goal to restore Liverpool’s lead with a deft volley. It was the Egypt international’s 22nd league goal of the season and Alexander-Arnold’s 11th assist in the Premier League campaign, bringing him level with Andy Robertson and the Premier League record for a defender.

The German’s problems intensified, to a worrying degree, when Salah was floored by an accidental collision with Dubravka when the keeper punched clear.

Coleman was on hand to head in the rebound when Heaton pushed Lucas Digne’s shot into his path. It was just his second strike in 27 months. Everton almost had a third of the night when the substitute Ademola Lookman’s shot flicked the bar.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSilva is not a manager with a noted sentimental streak but provided a different sort of late drama by granting Phil Jagielka a late cameo. A 385th Everton appearance may be the last. “There is a good possibility it could be,” said the captain, whose contract expires in a summer when he turns 37. “The answer will come in the next 10 days. I hope there are some great moments to continue but if not I can’t complain. If it is the farewell game at home then so be it.” The reception he was granted amounted to an appreciation of 12 years’ stalwart service. “Everything he deserves,” said Silva, who will meet Jagielka next week.\n\nIf Everton merited victory, Burnley had a gripe. It is a bugbear of Sean Dyche’s that his side rarely get penalties and their manager was irritated when the former Burnley defender Michael Keane escaped unpunished for a shove on Matej Vydra. “I think it is two in 92 [games],” he said. “It is a natural fall and you don’t get them any more. Me being a dinosaur, I am the only one who seems to bother.”"}, {"date": "28/04/2019", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32037, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup":

Wanderers, now Leicester City: three defeats in the space of eight days, and at arguably the worst time of the season, mean that Arsenal’s hopes of a top-four finish are unravelling. Frustration was written all over Unai Emery’s face on an afternoon when Arsenal imploded and the Spaniard lost his cool.\n\nThe early dismissal of Ainsley Maitland-Niles sparked an angry reaction from the Arsenal manager, yet that red card was a long way from being the defining factor in this chastening defeat. Arsenal looked meek and brittle when it was 11 v 11 and once again their defending was desperately poor individually and collectively. Alarm bells must be ringing given that this is the first time since 1967 that Arsenal have conceded three goals in three successive top-flight matches.\n\nLeicester City 3-0 Arsenal: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nYouri Tielemans, who has been so impressive since joining Leicester on loan from Monaco, headed the home team in front and there are no prizes for guessing who got the second and third goals. Jamie Vardy, who has been transformed since Brendan Rodgers took over as manager, extended his remarkable record against the club he rejected the chance to join in the summer of 2016. The 32-year-old has now scored eight goals in his last seven matches against Arsenal, with his brace here taking his Premier League tally for the season to 18.\n\nThose two goals may have arrived late but they were no more than Leicester deserved after comprehensively outplaying Arsenal. Aggressive with their pressing – young Hamza Choudhury caught the eye with his combative presence in midfield – and dynamic going forward, Leicester registered 12 shots on target compared with Arsenal’s one. It was embarrassingly one-sided at times and a little baffling to listen to Emery’s assessment afterwards. “The players worked very well and I am proud of them,” the Arsenal manager said.\n\nIn Emery’s eyes everything came back to the dismissal of Maitland-Niles, even when he was quizzed on the 1967 statistic that highlighted the scale of the defensive problems Arsenal have had across their last three matches, not just here. “The first yellow card [for Maitland-Niles] is not for me,” said Emery. “It has affected our gameplan a lot.”\n\nRodgers, perhaps not surprisingly, saw things differently and it was hard to argue with the Leicester manager’s view that Michael Oliver, the referee, was right to give Maitland-Niles an early yellow card for fouling Ben Chilwell and “stopping the counter-attack”. Although Emery threw his arms in the air in despair and several Arsenal players argued with Oliver, it was notable that Maitland-Niles never complained. Either way, the Arsenal right-back was playing with fire when he brought down James Maddison later in the first half, leading to a second yellow card.\n\nLeicester had already caused Arsenal plenty of problems by that stage, in particular through the movement and pace of Vardy, who lifted one shot over the barafter escaping in the inside-right channel and had another saved by Bernd Leno. The Arsenal goalkeeper also produced a one-handed stop to keep out Wilfred Ndidi’s header and repelled a third Vardy effort just before half-time.\n\nEmery sacrificed Alex Iwobi, who was responsible for that solitary Arsenal effort on target with a left-footed shot that Kasper Schmeichel blocked with an outstretched boot, and brought on Laurent Koscielny at the start of the second half, yet Leicester continued to dominate and it seemed only a matter of when, not if, they would score.\n\nThat moment arrived just before the hour-mark. Maddison, who was afforded so much time and space, delivered an inviting cross that picked out Tielemans’s intelligent run. Granit Xhaka, for reasons only he knows, made no attempt to track Tielemans and it was a lovely header that the midfielder directed beyond Leno from about 10 yards.\n\nEmery became increasingly irritated on the touchline, leading to a lengthy conversation with Oliver at one point in the second half. Arsenal’s biggest problems were of their own making, however, and it was alarming to see how easily Leicester carved them open, even allowing for their numerical advantage. Leno denied Ricardo Pereira and Harvey Barnes in close succession before Vardy scored his first in bizarre circumstances.\n\nSchmeichel drilled a long straight kick upfield and, inexplicably, neither Sokratis Papastathopoulos nor Koscielny was able to deal with the ball. Vardy scampered in behind and headed in the rebound after his first effort had come back off the bar. Pereira then glided past Koscielny to set up Vardy for a tap-in with what proved the final kick of the game.\n\n“A very good performance. We didn’t waste any time today. We showed we are a good side,” said Rodgers, whose team are up to eighth. “We were really aggressive in our pressing and really connected as a team.”"}, {"date": "28/04/2019", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21605, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight McNeil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Driscoll-Glennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Foden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arijanet Muric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Thirty-six games in, the title race strayed dangerously close to becoming an ordeal for Manchester City.

No wonder Guardiola was so effusive in his praise. “Aah, he’s a legend,” said the City manager afterwards.\n\nAgüero’s latest goal puts him alongside Alan Shearer in one respect. They are the only two players in the Premier League era to score 20 times or more in six different seasons.\n\nYet the more important detail relates to what that goal means for the title race on a day when the supporters of Liverpool, an hour into the game, might have dared to think the momentum was about to swing dramatically their way.\n\nInstead, it turned out to be City’s 12th successive league victory, restoring their one-point lead above Liverpool, and if they can extend that sequence to 14 in their last two games by beating Leicester at home and then Brighton away, there will be nothing Jürgen Klopp and his players can do about it.\n\nAgüero, in particular, looks absolutely intent on making it happen and, when the final story comes to be told of what could yet be a domestic treble for City, a special mention should be made of that moment, after 63 minutes, when he controlled Bernardo Silva’s delivery, held off James Tarkowski in the Burnley penalty area and swung his left foot at the ball.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nIt was the first time Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal had not been able to get in the way of City’s goalbound shots. Matthew Lowton blocked the ball on the goal-line but there was a reason why the referee, Paul Tierney, felt a buzz on his wristband.\n\nIt was the goal-line technology letting him know that the momentum of the ball had taken it over the line. In another era Burnley might have got away with it. Not here, though – 29.51 millimetres, to be precise.\n\nBurnley were awkward, obdurate opponents and City did not always look like champions-in-waiting, particularly in the first half when there were even a few “olés” from the home supporters during their periods of possession. OK, they did not even reach half a dozen passes before City had the ball back. Yet it was a clear sign that the game was not going in the way that Guardiola and his players would have wanted.\n\nPerhaps they were missing the elegant touches of Kevin De Bruyne. Maybe they are not quite so slick when Fernandinho is missing. Or perhaps it turned out they were not immune to nerves, after all.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWhatever it was, it was strange to see Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sané play with so little menace during the first half. David Silva was not having his usual influence. Bernardo Silva, such a delightful player, was more effective when he swapped positions with Sterling but there were only a couple of occasions throughout that period when Heaton had to save his team. Even then they were routine pieces of goalkeeping rather than real moments of danger.\n\nAt one point Oleksandr Zinchenko had the ball at his feet and a moment of carelessness let it run out for a throw-in. Not long afterwards Sané could be seen waving his arms in anger after Agüero, dropping back in his desperation to make something happen, overhit a pass. Sané had won his place back after a brilliant performance, as a substitute, in City’s win at Manchester United last Wednesday but he found it difficult to continue where he had left off and was substituted immediately after the goal.\n\nThe best chance of the first half actually fell to Burnley when Kyle Walker lost his footing bringing the ball forward from defence and Jeff Hendrick had the chance to put Chris Wood through on goal. Unfortunately for Burnley, Wood was not so alert to the possibilities. His touch was heavy and Ederson was quick off his goal-line to avert the danger.\n\nAshley Barnes fails to provide twist that Jürgen Klopp wished for | Nick Ames Read more\n\nAfter the break, however, City subjected their opponents to a period of almost unremitting pressure. They ought to have had a penalty when Ashley Barnes jutted out his arm to stop Bernardo Silva’s shot and, at 1-0, it needed a brilliant goalline clearance from Ben Mee to stop Gabriel Jesus, Sané’s replacement, doubling the lead.\n\nGuardiola noted afterwards that his team had not conceded a single corner and, as such, subdued Burnley’s threat from set-plays.\n\nYet it was still a tense finish and his state of mind could probably be summed up by his decision to replace Agüero with John Stones and then bring on another centre-half, Nicolás Otamendi, for Sterling. “I was trembling,” City’s

The manager now has a decision to make regarding whether he should drop the goalkeeper, who may benefit from having to take stock of why his form has nosedived so dramatically.\n\nEden Hazard, who had a quiet afternoon, said: “A good day but could be better. We came here thinking about winning the game; a draw is not a bad result. We now have two games and we will try and be in the top four.”\n\nSolskjær made five changes from the derby defeat by Manchester City, removing Fred, Chris Smalling, Jesse Lingard, Andreas Pereira and Matteo Darmian. While the latter two were replacements and Smalling and Lingard injured, it was unclear why Fred was absent. In came Mata, Romelu Lukaku, Ander Herrera, Nemanja Matic and Eric Bailly, the latter’s inclusion of particular interest as his last league start was at Leicester City on 3 February.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjær backs De Gea despite goalkeeper’s latest error Read more\n\nSarri’s XI had four different players from Monday’s draw with Burnley: Andreas Christensen, Emerson, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi went out for Rüdiger, Mateo Kovacic, Alonso and Willian.\n\nIf Hazard shines, Chelsea tend to and it was the Belgian’s early cross – aimed at N’Golo Kanté – that offered a first warning. Luke Shaw provided his side’s riposte, a long ball allowing Lukaku a run at Kepa Arrizabalaga but he dawdled and the danger subsided.\n\nThe next time United attacked they scored with a slick move – Shaw to Paul Pogba to Lukaku who sent the left-back Shaw darting in behind Chelsea. When he turned the ball in, Mata beat Arrizabalaga with a right-foot finish.\n\nThis was United’s first goal from open play in 541 minutes, since Scott McTominay’s in the 2-1 defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 2 April, illustrating why Solskjær’s team entered the contest having won only twice in their previous nine outings. And the quality of the sequence that undid Chelsea made the run of form more puzzling.\n\nAfter the opener the visitors had a free-kick and two corners in succession but did not ask De Gea to show his recent shakiness was behind him. Yet a Shaw header that handed Gonzalo Higuaín a chance to shoot was hardly reassuring and he was grateful theNo 9 failed to capitalise.\n\nThe game was being played at an attractive pace, each team contributing. Hazard out-manoeuvred Matic and hit a ball into the area that United scrambled away and suddenly Lukaku was bursting down the right and finding Marcus Rashford. A corner was claimed and Bailly’s head met Ashley Young’s corner as he came close to doubling the lead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Juan Mata is congratulated by Paul Pogba after scoring United’s goal. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images via Reuters\n\nPogba was back to looking the leader of this team, popping up everywhere, driving at Chelsea, generally proving a nightmare to contain. This was mirrored by Lukaku, Herrera and Mata, in particular – a trio whose speed of thought and execution was helping United dominate.\n\nWhen Young pinged in a free-kick from the left that, again, had Chelsea concerned, United seemed to be sailing into a half-time lead. But then, in increasingly typical fashion, disaster struck. Rüdiger hit a shot from 30 yards straight down the goalkeeper’s throat. It should have been a regulation save yet somehow he spilled it to his right and Alonso was there for an equaliser that went in off the far post. De Gea’s other recent errors include culpability for both of City’s finishes in the defeat here on Wednesday plus the one that allowed Lionel Messi’s second in the 3-0 loss at Barcelona two weeks ago.\n\nSarri’s talk at the interval may have featured an order to pepper De Gea whenever possible; Solskjær’s might have reminded his outfield players of how dominant they had been.\n\nA Rashford 20-yard free-kick gathered safely by Arrizabalaga was the second half’s first action. From here the sides traded blows, though these were jabs rather than anything that stung. On 65 minutes Alexis Sánchez replaced the misfiring Rashford and Rüdiger hobbled off for Christensen. This caused a break-up of rhythm which continued when Bailly had to be helped off with what appeared a knee injury.\n\nWhen play restarted United tried in vain to force the winner but seven minutes of added time were not enough for them to find the breakthrough as Marcus Rojo’s header was cleared off the line by Pedro and the game petered out."}, {"date": "27/04/2019", "arena": "Tottenham Hotspur

Back in the 2015-16 season, when Spurs were pushing for the Premier League title, it was Antonio who helped to derail them with the only goal of a 1-0 West Ham win at Upton Park. On this occasion the forward struck the first goal by a visiting player to Spurs’ new stadium and it was one that stands to damage the home club’s hopes of a top-four finish.\n\nAntonio’s reward was no more than West Ham deserved for a fluent second-half display and it served to end their woeful recent away run. They had arrived on the back of one point from an available 24. Manuel Pellegrini described it as the “complete performance” and nobody could argue. West Ham were compact and committed en route to a rare clean sheet while Mark Noble was excellent and Felipe Anderson threatening.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 0-1 West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nSpurs could have been forgiven for having one eye on Tuesday’s Champions League semi-final, first-leg against Ajax and it was alarming to see how flat and laboured they were in the second half. They looked out on their feet in the closing stages and West Ham could easily have added to their lead. Marko Arnautovic was denied by Hugo Lloris, the impressive Issa Diop strode through only to be thwarted by the goalkeeper and Antonio was twice put off at the last.\n\nMauricio Pochettino finished with the substitutes Fernando Llorente and Vincent Janssen on as an unlikely strike partnership and the latter went close in stoppage time; Fabián Balbuena cleared his header from in front of the line. But this was the day when Spurs’ perfect record at their new home ended. Finally, after 427 minutes, they conceded but it was a first defeat in five matches in all competitions that represented the pain.\n\nPochettino was determined to blot out all thought of Ajax and he went with a strong line-up, although he left Kieran Trippier on the bench and rested Jan Vertonghen entirely. Vertonghen was feeling a bit of fatigue, which is plainly a problem for several Spurs players. It also felt significant that Pochettino withdrew Danny Rose, Dele Alli and Lucas Moura.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michail Antonio finishes emphatically for what proved to be the winning goal in the 67th minute. Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images via Reuters\n\nSpurs hogged the ball and they had chances in the first half, with Alli laying on the best of them for Son Heung-min. The forward had only Lukasz Fabianski to beat up the inside-left channel but the goalkeeper got his angles right and blocked.\n\nSon got away with a stamp on Robert Snodgrass, Alli avoided censure after a swan-dive on the edge of the West Ham box and Spurs were frustrated by Diop. The centre-half blocked off Alli and Son (twice), although he was robbed by the latter on 36 minutes. The ball broke to Christian Eriksen but Fabianski, once again, was out smartly to save. Lucas flashed a low drive past the far post.\n\nAnderson is a lovely player to watch when he is on his game, as he was here, and he ran on to Snodgrass’s 20th-minute pass only for Lloris to deny him. The goalkeeper kept out another effort from him just before half-time, after it had deflected. West Ham were keen to test out the makeshift Spurs right-back, Juan Foyth, and they made inroads, at times, up his flank.\n\nPochettino sent his players out early for the second half, which appeared to reflect his desire for greater urgency. But if they struggled to create clearcut chances in the first half, they hit the wall after the break – both mentally and physically.\n\nWest Ham fought hard in the one-on-ones and, with Arnautovic waking up after the interval, they came to realise that Spurs were there for the taking. Arnautovic, who later departed with a slight muscular problem, signalled his arrival with a magnificent touch on a high ball, killing it with the outside of his boot and spinning away from his man in one movement, and it was he who laid on the goal.\n\nArnautovic’s cross was pitched beautifully over Toby Alderweireld’s head into the stride of Antonio, who took a touch on his chest to get away from Davinson Sánchez before blasting into the far corner. Sánchez did not react quickly enough to the danger but it was an excellent finish from Antonio, who celebrated with some crazy dance moves.\n\n“I’ve been busting those out in a couple of clubs so it was time to bring it out on the pitch,” Antonio said. “It lets me show my personality.” It was a day when Spurs failed to show theirs."}, {"date": "27/04/2019", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance":

Yet while Warnock refused to blame the referee Chris Kavanagh’s decision not to award a penalty in the first half for his team’s shortcomings, he did acknowledge that the death of the £15m striker Emiliano Sala in January had left his side short of firepower as they chased an equaliser here.\n\nSouthampton safe despite Callum Wilson’s late equaliser for Bournemouth Read more\n\n“You get what you pay for,” he said in reference to Babel’s winner. “It just brings it home to me how disappointing the whole Emiliano tragedy was.\n\n“I felt he could have scored 10 goals between January and the end of the season, which is what we’ve been lacking. It’s been blow after blow really.”\n\nThese two clubs know each other well after slugging it out for the second automatic promotion spot last season behind Wolves, with Cardiff coming out on top as Fulham eventually went up via the play-offs. However, the contrast between their approaches to life in the top flight could not have been greater, with Fulham having spent more than £100m on recruits in the summer but still ending up being relegated on 2 April whereas their opponents found themselves still in with a fighting chance of survival despite one of the smallest budgets in the division.\n\nYet despite their woes this season, Scott Parker has instigated something of a revival at Fulham since relegation was confirmed and the former England midfielder should now be in line to be handed the permanent role at the end of the season after a third successive victory that equalled the club’s Premier League best.\n\nOn a blustery day by the Thames this was always going be a test of both sides’ mettle but Cardiff certainly had reason to feel aggrieved in the eighth minute when Sean Morrison was dragged to the ground in the box by Aleksandar Mitrovic. Warnock, who was otherwise complimentary to the officials, will surely have noted the similarity to last week’s incident against Liverpool involving Morrison and Mohamed Salah that led to a penalty.\n\nMichail Antonio and West Ham send Spurs to first defeat at new stadium Read more\n\nHaving escaped at one end, Mitrovic was close to giving Fulham the lead after he was set up by Babel but the outstanding Neil Etheridge was there to beat his shot away. Denis Odoi, who had already been accidentally struck in the face with the ball by Aron Gunnarsson after being fouled in the third minute, then came to the rescue for his side as Oumar Niasse was bearing down on goal, heading the ball back to his goalkeeper just in time but taking another whack in the head, this time from his own teammate Maxime Le Marchand. The Belgian seemed to be out cold as he hit the ground and received treatment on the pitch for nine minutes before being carried off. Thankfully he had recovered enough to watch the second half from the stands.\n\nWarnock emerged early after the break and headed over to Cardiff’s travelling support in an effort to raise the atmosphere. Yet he was grateful to see Mitrovic spurn another golden opportunity just two minutes in after Tom Cairney’s intelligent cutback ended with the Serbian placing his shot embarrassingly wide.\n\nDanny Ward was summoned from the bench to replace Niasse in attack as Cardiff’s sense of urgency grew, with the fans offering a rendition of ‘all we are saying is give us a goal’. They were duly granted one, but at the wrong end as Babel rounded off Cyrus Christie’s mazy run with a brilliant strike from outside the area.\n\n“It was a moment of sheer class and it deserved to be the matchwinner,” said Parker.\n\nCardiff could have rescued a point had Junior Hoilett not struck the crossbar late on and Sergio Rico not saved well from Morrison’s header. But, while Cardiff will definitely not give up until the end, Warnock now knows they need fortune to smile on them to stand any chance."}, {"date": "27/04/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium",

players on halfway, finally able to toast securing their Premier League status for another season. The result was not the perfect takeaway but a point was sufficient for his team, who played their part in a topsy-turvy match-up between south-coast neighbours whereby defending was an afterthought. It proved equally satisfying for Gareth Southgate, the England manager watching from the stands, with two goals from Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson and James Ward-Prowse also on the scoresheet.\n\nFor Southampton’s players it meant not only safety but three days off. “They don’t have to listen to me until Wednesday, it is the best present I can give them,” Hasenhüttl said. The job the Austrian has done deserves genuine acclaim, though, ensuring survival after inheriting a team ensconced in a relegation scrap and with only a single win to their name in December. “We have had many ups and downs. I wanted to celebrate with my players and my staff because we have enjoyed working together.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion v Newcastle United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\n“We were waiting for the moment that we could be sure that we can work together next year,” Hasenhüttl said. “The first step is done now. I’m very happy for the club, the supporters, my staff, everybody who is with us. To be clear two games before the end is tremendous; it is sensational. I don’t know why it is like this; the easy way is not my way. This summer we will rebuild. We can start planning for next year tomorrow and the target is to get 40 points earlier than this year. A bit less stress would be nice.”\n\nBournemouth’s goals-against column took another hammering – only relegated Fulham and Huddersfield have conceded more league goals this season – but after three defeats in their previous four matches they savoured a point on a day when attack was seemingly the best form of defence. “It’s not one for the defensive coaches to take too much from but both sides tried to go for it,” Eddie Howe said. “It was a constant ebb and flow. There were a lot of tactical reshuffles that were great to be a part of. I have a lot of respect for their manager and I think they [Southampton] will be a much stronger team next season.”\n\nFulham 1-0 Cardiff, Southampton 3-3 Bournemouth and more – live! Read more\n\nShane Long required only 7.69 seconds to open the scoring in midweek and earned Southampton another early advantage here, slotting home inside 12 minutes after dispatching Nathan Redmond’s sliderule pass. After 19 minutes Howe had seen enough, calling Ryan Fraser back from his warm-up on the touchline. But as Fraser was getting stripped for action, Bournemouth cantered upfield on the counterattack through Joshua King. The forward found Wilson, who laid the ball off for Dan Gosling to thump home an equaliser. Howe nevertheless still sought change, switching to a more orthodox back four with Fraser replacing Chris Mepham.\n\nAfter a dreadful start Bournemouth became more comfortable in their own skin, so much so that Wilson’s first goal came as no surprise. It stemmed from a short corner, when Southampton failed to clear Fraser’s cross from the right. David Brooks recycled possession on the edge of the area, driving at goal from 20 yards and catching a scrambling Angus Gunn cold in the Southampton goal. Gunn managed to reach the strike but palmed the ball to Wilson, who swept home.\n\nBournemouth have been blighted by injury and losing Gosling early in the second half led to them surrendering their midfield bite. It was something that Southampton gleefully seized on, with Ward-Prowse unchallenged to steer a low effort into the bottom corner after a lukewarm challenge from King 20 yards from goal. That gave Saints the impetus to push on, with Targett nodding home Yan Valery’s cross but Bournemouth fashioned a leveller through Wilson four minutes from time – and in truth he should have completed a hat-trick but failed to beat Gunn right at the end."}, {"date": "27/04/2019", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20323, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster",

Glenn Murray, free at the far post, rose marginally too early and nodded the ball over a gaping net. Chris Hughton buried his head in his hands in disbelief, the chance of a first league win since early March passed up. Yet, once the dust had settled, Brighton could still reflect on a point which may well have preserved their Premier League status.\n\nThe draw they secured late, with a first goal for seven weeks, has edged them four points clear of Cardiff and, even with daunting fixtures still to come against Arsenal and Manchester City, the likelihood is their current tally should prove sufficient to survive. Given the difference in respective goal differences, the Welsh club will realistically have to win their last two games, against Crystal Palace and at Manchester United, to stand a chance. That is probably asking too much.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe sense of dread that has gripped this corner of Sussex has eased marginally. Their team may be limping over the line but there was relieved applause, rather than the livid exasperation which had become the norm, to greet the final whistle. “It’s a step towards safety,” said Hughton. “The cautious part of me still has to think anything can happen but the feeling is still better now than it was at half-time. Relaxed isn’t the word but there’s relief that what looked such a poor performance which would likely leave us with no points became one which showed spirit and better quality.”\n\nThat recovery remains the real reason for optimism. It was hard to imagine a first-half showing more insipid than that offered by the hosts, a performance so abject that it arguably eclipsed the dreadful recent displays mustered in defeat to Bournemouth and Cardiff. They had been frozen by fear, even in the wake of City’s defeat earlier in the day, with no intensity, no urgency and, as a result, little conviction. Newcastle had merely played round them, with Jonjo Shelvey offered the freedom of Falmer to dictate the tempo. The visitors should have led by more than Ayoze Pérez’s goal at the break.\n\nYet a team who had appeared condemned would revive. Solly March’s introduction was the catalyst, the winger injecting some impetus to break the paralysis of the first half and shrug them free of the creeping panic. His scurries up the flank roused his teammates, belief suddenly lifted by the sight of March forcing Federico Fernández into a smart block. They were never scintillating but at least they were unrecognisable from the initial plod. “There were a few harsh words [at half-time], which is normal, but credit to the players,” said Hughton. “Sometimes there can be a turn in the game and Solly made a real difference.”\n\nThe equalising goal was simply constructed but smartly taken. Bruno’s cross prised the visitors apart, Murray finding space to head back for Pascal Gross, so rusty up to then after a season littered with injuries, to exploit space between Fernández and Paul Dummett and guide in Albion’s first goal in 735 minutes of football, the longest drought in the club’s history. “The first half was disappointing but we still believed,” said the scorer. “We are a team, we have to stick together and we deserved a point in the end.”\n\nRyan Babel’s late winner for Fulham leaves Cardiff on brink of relegation Read more\n\nHad Murray gone on to win it, Newcastle would rightly have felt aggrieved given their early dominance. Pérez’s injury, to his right hip after a bodycheck from Shane Duffy, had contributed to the lopsided nature of their own display, though the Spaniard had been carrying the knock when he rasped the visitors ahead. The goal had summed Brighton up. No one sought to close down Dummett as he trundled forward on the ball, surveying the scene ahead and considering his options. His centre found Salomón Rondón’s chest, the Venezuelan having edged easily away from Bernardo and Lewis Dunk beyond the far post, with the ball dropping to Pérez, unmarked just inside the penalty area. The finish was emphatic.\n\nFabian Schär, bored at the back and strolling up beyond the grounded Dunk into the opposition penalty area, would have walked in a second had Mat Ryan not reacted.

The first part of their title duty was fulfilled in rampant and historic fashion as Huddersfield were routed at Anfield. Top of the Premier League with two to play, their longing for a favour turns to Burnley on Sunday. Manchester City are acutely aware that Jürgen Klopp’s team will not go quietly.\n\nLiverpool returned to the summit with a comprehensive victory over Jan Siewert’s relegated team, who looked every inch a Championship side from the first minute. Klopp’s leaders rarely had to exert themselves to break new ground. They have earned 91 points, eclipsing the total won by 105 of the 119 champions of English football if applying three points for a win to every season. Mohamed Salah overtook Roger Hunt and Sam Raybould for the most number of goals in his first 100 games for Liverpool. Numbers 68 and 69 arrived here, the latter courtesy of Andy Robertson’s 11th Premier League assist of the season. That equals the record for a defender set by Leighton Baines and Andy Hinchcliffe.\n\nLuis Suárez: ‘Any player would like to go to Liverpool now. It was different then’ Read more\n\nSadio Mané also scored twice and would have celebrated a hat-trick of headers but for the woodwork. Mané and Salah have 20 and 21 league goals respectively while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain generated the loudest ovation of the night with his first appearance in over a year. Klopp had a multitude of reasons to insist his thoughts were on Liverpool’s accomplishments, not what City may do, after watching his team equal their biggest win of the campaign.\n\nAn opponent that had been relegated in March and taken a pitiful four points since November were always welcome for a team in title mode, yet it was still a surprise how obliging Huddersfield proved to be. They gift-wrapped Liverpool their quickest goal in the Premier League era – timed at 15 seconds – with an opening that defined naivety and ineptitude.\n\nThe visitors opted to play out from the back with their central defenders out wide against a Liverpool side rather well known for its prowess in the press. Goalkeeper Jonas Lössl passed to recalled central midfielder Jon Gorenc Stankovic who took far too long in possession and invited Naby Keïta to close him down. Stankovic’s attempted pass found Salah who released Keïta through the gaping hole in the Huddersfield defence to score with a low finish off the inside of Lössl’s far post. Liverpool’s 100th goal of the campaign in all competitions would have settled a few nerves inside Anfield had there been any. It was the start of a creative, energetic and dominant display in central midfield from Keïta.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mohamed Salah after scoring his second and Liverpool’s fifth goal. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nIn fairness to Huddersfield they responded well to their calamitous start and briefly took the game to Liverpool. Two dreadful corner routines and weak shots from Stankovic and Steve Mounié provided a further reminder of why they are rooted to the foot of the table.\n\nLiverpool doubled their lead from a familiar source when Robertson collected Virgil van Dijk’s pass out on the left and, under no pressure, delivered a pinpoint cross into the heart of the opposition penalty area. Mané, under no pressure from Terence Kongolo, headed his 10th goal in the last nine games beyond the exposed Lössl.\n\nRobertson has an internal competition with Trent Alexander-Arnold over which full-back will provide the most assists this campaign and the 20-year-old responded in kind on the stroke of half-time. The right-back floated a delightful ball in the channel between Kongolo and Erik Durm for Salah to sprint through on goal. Huddersfield’s goalkeeper charged out and the Eygpt international accepted the invitation to lob Lössl to score. Records have tumbled throughout Salah’s time at Anfield but a 68th goal in a century of Liverpool appearances is a staggering achievement. And he was not finished yet.\n\nJürgen Klopp admits injured Roberto Firmino could miss Barcelona tie Read more\n\nAnother glowing statistic that reflects the foundation of Liverpool’s title challenge was the 20th clean sheet kept by Alisson, the goalkeeper equalling the club record set by Pepe Reina in 2005-06 and 2008-09. The Brazilian would have been kept waiting for a share of the record had Karlan Grant connected in front of an open goal when Juninho Bacuna’s shot deflected his way or if Mounié had moved with any degree of urgency when played clean through. Both opportunities were squandered before Bacuna drew a fine save from Alisson with a fierce long-range drive.\n\nHuddersfield had conceded four goals in three of their previous five games and it was always only a matter of time before the outclassed visitors made it four in six. Salah had gone close to another memorable goal at the Kop end when he sent a half-volley just wide from distance after flicking the ball over Kongolo. From their next attack Jordan Henderson whipped a first-time cross in from the right and Mané, despite being in a penalty area containing five Huddersfield players, was unmarked to steer his second header of the game beyond Lössl. Mané’s 20th league goal of the season was also a career first for the Senegal international and underlined his merited place in the PFA Team of the Year.\n\nSalah sealed the rout from Robertson’s low centre late on, the full-back released behind the visiting defence by substitute Xherdan Shaqiri. The only worries for Liverpool concerned injuries ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final second leg at Barcelona. Van Dijk declared himself fit after Mounié landed painfully on his foot while Klopp’s post-match update on Roberto Firmino left an element of doubt over the striker’s involvement.

Wolves, who have been so impressive against the Premier League’s top six this season, added another scalp to their collection with a resounding win that raises major questions about Arsenal’s ability to secure a top-four finish.\n\nInspired by the outstanding Diogo Jota, who would later leave the field to a standing ovation, Wolves tore Arsenal apart during a devastating 19-minute spell in the first half that yielded all three goals. Ruben Neves scored the first with a glorious free-kick, Matt Doherty headed in the second and Jota dispatched the third on the stroke of half-time.\n\nLeroy Sané fires Manchester City past United to tip scales in title race Read more\n\nArsenal looked shellshocked. Their defending in the 3-2 home defeat against Crystal Palace on Sunday was awful and those frailties were once again exposed by a rampant Wolves side. Bernd Leno hardly covered himself in glory with his goalkeeping on the second and third Wolves goals, although in truth there were poor Arsenal performances all over the pitch.\n\nUnai Emery took responsibility for the result – “I was angry with me, we didn’t do the game-plan like I want,” said the Arsenal manager – but, deep down, the Spaniard must have been desperately disappointed with his players, too. They looked horribly disjointed at times in the first half and vulnerable whenever Wolves seized possession and broke in numbers.\n\nSokratis Papastathopoulos pulled a goal back 10 minutes from time, but the damage had long been done on an evening when Arsenal suffered back-to-back league defeats for the first time since their opening two fixtures of the season. “We lost the possibility to have [Champions League qualification] in our hands but we can recover,” said Emery, who made seven changes to the side that lost against Palace, including dropping Shkodran Mustafi.\n\nFor Wolves, this was another special evening under the lights at Molineux. A first top-flight win over Arsenal in 17 attempts, going back to 1979, means that Nuno Espírito Santo’s side are now up to seventh place in the table, opening the door to the prospect of qualification for the Europa League. “It was a good performance against a top team,” said Nuno, who is a man of few words.\n\nHis team are much more expressive and a joy to watch at times. They have now collected 16 points against the Premier League’s top six, which is a remarkable return in their first season back at this level. With a visit to Anfield to come on the final day, it is possible they could yet increase that tally.\n\nJota was the spark for the purple patch that saw Wolves take control of this game. Full of running, the Portuguese lifted his teammates and the home supporters by winning the ball deep inside his own half and setting off on a driving run that took him past several Arsenal players. Ultimately, the move came to nothing, but the mood in the stadium shifted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wolverhampton Wanderers’ Diogo Jota scores their third goal. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters\n\nWolves were suddenly alive. João Moutinho curled narrowly wide and Raúl Jiménez lifted a shot inches over the bar. Arsenal, after dominating possession without looking like scoring in the opening 20 minutes, appeared vulnerable. Wolves sensed it and ruthlessly took advantage.\n\nJota broke into the Arsenal half and released Jonny Castro Otto, who was brought down by Nacho Monreal about 25 yards from goal. Neves stood over the ball and, after a short and straight run-up, struck a wonderful free-kick that dipped wickedly after clearing the wall and found the corner of the net.\n\nAgüero up front but no room for Eriksen: my Premier League team of the season | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nNine minutes later it was 2-0 after some abysmal Arsenal defending. Jonny, under no pressure from any Arsenal player, received the ball from Moutinho following a short corner and delivered an inswinging cross that Doherty glanced over the head of the stranded Leno, who had come to punch but was caught in no man’s land.\n\nDesperately needing the interval to regroup, Arsenal then conceded with almost the last kick of the first half. A loose pass from Granit Xhaka, deep inside his own half, granted Jota the chance to run at the Arsenal defence again. After skipping past Papastathopoulos with embarrassing ease, Jota hit a low angled shot that seemed to go under Leno’s left arm.\n\nWith Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang absent because of a “small sinus procedure”, Emery’s attacking options to try to get back into the game were limited. Sead Kolasinac and Mattéo Guendouzi replaced Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Lucas Torreira, yet it was Wolves who came closest to scoring again through Jiménez.

No wonder there was such jubilation at the final whistle from the players in blue.\n\nPep Guardiola turns Manchester City’s focus to Burnley after derby win Read more\n\nPep Guardiola wanted to emphasise there was still the potential for another late twist. All the same, it was difficult to leave Old Trafford without thinking City had struck a decisive blow courtesy of the second-half goals from Bernardo Silva and the substitute Leroy Sané.\n\nThey had won at Old Trafford for the sixth time in eight visits. It was a seventh defeat for Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s team in their past nine games, as well as being the first time United have failed to score in three successive games since October 2015, and it means no other away side in the Premier League era can match City’s haul of seven victories at this ground.\n\nUltimately, the only statistic that really mattered was that the reigning champions had moved a point clear at the 35-game mark. Liverpool had been displaced at the top of the table and that, for United, can be the only consolation on a night when the away end was determined to rub it in. Ole’s at the wheel? “The wheels are coming off,” was one gloating cry, amid all the victory songs from the corner of Old Trafford accommodating City’s supporters.\n\nPlay Video 1:47 'The title is in our hands', says Pep Guardiola after Manchester City's win at United – video\n\nFrom that point of view it was certainly an unusual occasion bearing in mind the politics, divisions and sporting enmity that exists, at varying levels, between the two Manchester clubs and the one from Merseyside. Were there United fans feeling compromised and secretly rooting for City in preference to helping Liverpool to their first championship for 29 years? The equivalent, say, of a fat lip rather than a black eye and a blow to the solar plexus?\n\nObsession with past leaves Solskjaer’s United stuck in a footballing Pompeii Read more\n\nThe answer, undeniably, was yes. Yet the noise inside Old Trafford was of a crowd who wanted to put one over their neighbours and let the rest take care of itself. Solskjær’s players did at least show they understood what it meant to pull on United’s colours and for that alone it was a much improved performance than Sunday’s 4-0 defeat at Everton. That, however, can hardly soothe their disappointment when the second half was such a stark reminder of their shortcomings. This time it boiled down to an imbalance of talent and, for United, facing up to the difficult truth, namely that Guardiola’s men play a style of football that they dearly wish could be their own.\n\nTrue, City had found it difficult during a first half when United had played as though affronted by the statistic that in 15 of their previous 17 Premier League matches the opposition had run further.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nAfter the break, however, the away side swiftly took control, especially after Fernandinho had gone off with an injury and Sané was brought on to add his pace and penetration to the attack.\n\nIt was an adventurous substitution from Guardiola, meaning a tactical switch that involved Raheem Sterling swapping sides, Bernardo Silva taking a more central role and Ilkay Gündogan filling in for Fernandinho as the holding midfielder. Sané slotted in seamlessly and, within three minutes, Silva had drifted inside Luke Shaw to beat David de Gea with a low shot for the opening goal.\n\nManchester United 0-2 Manchester City: Premier League player ratings | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nThe first reaction of the Stretford End was to burst into a song about the 20 times they has seen their team win the title. It was a show of defiance but not one that will hurt this City side. Sergio Agüero skimmed the post with one shot soon afterwards and for the rest of the game we saw the deterioration of a club that once had a midfield quartet of David Beckham, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs but, here, had Ashley Young, Andreas Pereira, Fred and Shaw filling those positions.\n\nSolskjær had dropped, among others, Romelu Lukaku, Anthony Martial and Nemanja Matic, experimenting with wing-backs in an experimental 3-4-3 formation, and playing on the counterattack with Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford operating either side of Jesse Lingard.\n\nRashford, in particular, looked lively but Ederson had a good match in City’s goal whereas De Gea is ending the season strangely out of form. He was slow to go down for City’s first goal and when Sané made it 2-0 it was another occasion when the goalkeeper might have been expected to do better.\n\nIt was a classic breakaway from City, starting with Fred losing the ball to Vincent Kompany, and United looked vulnerable as soon as their opponents started streaming forward. Sterling’s pass invited Sané to take aim and draw back that elegant left foot. He had been dangerous since coming off the bench and his angled shot went in off De Gea’s boot at the near post to leave City looking like champions-in-waiting."}, {"date": "23/04/2019", "arena":

Tottenham’s Champions League semi-final against Ajax it has been possible to forget their basic target for the season remains a top four domestic finish. There was no room for a slip-up against Brighton, no scope for their focus to drop and, on a dramatic night, they got the result that they wanted. Just.\n\nShane Long scores after 7.69 seconds in Southampton’s draw at Watford Read more\n\nThere were 88 minutes on the clock when Christian Eriksen picked up possession in front of the Brighton penalty area, as he had done throughout the match, probing for the solution. It had eluded him yet this time he found it, arrowing a low drive through the defensive shackles and into the bottom corner.\n\nLike Eriksen, Mauricio Pochettino had struggled to see a way through. The Spurs manager even sent on Vincent Janssen as an 80th-minute substitute; the club’s forgotten striker was given a stirring ovation on his first action of a bizarre season. But thanks to Eriksen’s flash of inspiration, Spurs remain on course.\n\nIt is a curiosity that they have lost as many league games this season – 11 – as they did in the previous two combined. Yet they have drawn only once and have frequently been rewarded for their indomitable spirit. Their run-in features two home games out of three – against West Ham and Everton – and their record at their stadium remains unblemished. It shows four wins from four matches in all competitions and no goals conceded.

At full time, he marched over to the Brighton supporters, hands held high in applause; the picture of defiance. On the inside, he was devastated.\n\nHughton must go back to the 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on 9 March for Brighton’s last league goals; they have gone 660 minutes without scoring. But this looked like being a match when what they did at the back would fire their survival hopes. Lewis Dunk, in particular, was immense. The centre-half sank to his knees when Eriksen’s goal went in and for him and his teammates it added up to a sixth defeat in seven matches.\n\nBrighton had started the day in 17th place, three points clear of Cardiff, who had played one game more, and under no illusions about the size of their task. Their home match against Newcastle on Saturday already felt enormous and how about it now? Brighton finish with a visit to Arsenal and home game against Manchester City and the fear for them is that Cardiff may get something from their games with Fulham (away) and Crystal Palace (home).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christian Eriksen lets fly from outside the area. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nBrighton’s determination was ferocious. Hughton’s men flooded the space around the Spurs attackers while they put their bodies on the line time and again, none more so than Dunk, who made some colossal interventions.\n\nIt was rough and ready at times – witness Jan Vertonghen’s elbow on Florin Andone in the 25th minute, which he levered into his opponent, rather than throwing it. The referee, Christopher Kavanagh, took no action.\n\nAndone himself diced with disaster. Harshly booked for a trip on Danny Rose, as Kavanagh tried to assert his authority, the Brighton striker stamped into a tackle on Kieran Trippier in the 36th minute, missing the ball and catching the Spurs full-back. It looked like more of a yellow card than the one he received but Kavanagh disagreed.\n\nSpurs lacked invention in the first half. Dele Alli took a marvellous touch on a high ball and prodded goalwards only for Shane Duffy to clear off the line, while Vertonghen saw Dunk block a shot at close quarters. It was otherwise heavy going. Brighton could point to a one-man break from Andone that was halted by a slide challenge from Rose.\n\nZac Efron brought a touch of Hollywood glamour – the actor, who was picked out by the TV cameras, changed into a Spurs shirt for the second half – yet there was frustration around him, particularly at the delaying tactics of the Brighton goalkeeper, Mat Ryan.\n\nDuffy headed at Hugo Lloris from a tight angle on 46 minutes but the pattern was entrenched: Spurs pushing, Brighton resisting. There were lengthy periods in the second half when Lloris was the only player outside of Brighton’s defensive third.\n\nThe margins were agonisingly fine. Toby Alderweireld saw a shot hit the inside of the post and roll across goal but Spurs could not force the ball home and they had other chances. Rose’s dipping long-range shot was palmed up in the air and away by Ryan, while Alli, Son Heung-min and Trippier all went close.\n\nNot for the first time, Spurs could be grateful to Eriksen. He has been tipped to depart in the summer when he enters the final year on his contract but losing him does not bear thinking about.\n\n“It is a very special situation,” Pochettino said. “The timing for him or for the club to be agreeing something is maybe different to another player. I hope and I wish Christian can be with us in the future. Christian and us – we are so open to talk and we will see what happens. It is so close, the end of the season, and [there is] a lot of time to talk after.”"}, {"date": "23/04/2019", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 19170, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup":

Yet, even then, it was their catastrophic start, a comedy of errors from the kick-off, which still drew all the focus. “A strange game, an even stranger start,” said Javi Gracia, their manager. Long, substituted before the end and interviewed in the tunnel, cursed the fact that the lead he had secured while plenty were still taking their seats had not forced his own team further from the relegation zone. He was oblivious to the fact he had made history.\n\nThe Irishman had scored with the sixth touch of the game. There had been a pass slid back matter-of-factly by Roberto Pereyra from the centre-spot and cushioned control from Craig Cathcart, deep inside Watford territory, which probably left the ball marginally under his feet. Even so, it seemed awkward rather than perilous. Yet there was Long sprinting to close him down, leaping up on the half turn and charging down the attempted clearance. Cathcart was caught on his heels as the ball rebounded behind him and tantalisingly into space.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe striker sprinted on to it unchecked, prodding it on and then clipping his finish over the advancing Ben Foster from just inside the penalty area. His celebration, arms held wide and hint of a salute, was that of a man who could hardly believe his luck. It was officially timed at 7.69sec, comfortably beating Ledley King’s previous record of 9.82 against Bradford back in December 2000. Just as implausible was that Long, who in January ended a run of 1,320 minutes without a Premier League goal, has now scored three times in four games.\n\nHe is a player revived under new management as, indeed, is this team. “Shane has, a bit, the image that he doesn’t score so much, but that was another amazing performance,” said Ralph Hasenhüttl. “The game we play at the moment, the style of football with immediate transitions forwards, he likes to play. He’s very quick and is an intelligent player who knows where he has to be to be dangerous. He will not forget this game. He did something historic in the Premier League.”\n\nQuick guide The Premier League's fastest goals Show Hide Shane Long has taken the record for quickest Premier League goal off Spurs’ Ledley King, who had held it since December 2000. 1 Shane Long 7.69sec\n\nWatford 1 Southampton 1, 2019 2 Ledley King 9.82sec\n\nBradford 3 Tottenham 3, 2000 3 Alan Shearer 10.52sec\n\nNewcastle 2 Man City 0, 2003\n\nHasenhüttl’s only regret was that the freakishly bright start did not prove the prelude to Southampton moving eight points clear of the bottom three. They had sliced through their opponents at will during that first period, the excellent Nathan Redmond a menace on the flank and Long a man possessed.\n\nTwice the visitors struck the outside of a post, first through Redmond via a smart save from the goalkeeper, and then Ryan Bertrand as he capitalised on the winger’s cross and Long’s flick. The striker’s assured collection under pressure, cradling a lofted pass on his instep in the build-up to Redmond’s chance, reflected soaring confidence. He probably should have added a second, first nodding James Ward-Prowse’s cross wide and then Redmond’s centre over the bar.\n\nSouthampton would end up regretting that profligacy. They never really quelled the threat posed by Gerard Deulofeu but aside from Angus Gunn’s smart save from Gray within three minutes of Long’s goal, had kept the home side at arm’s length until caution overwhelmed them at the last. Further and further they retreated, their back three a blur of blocks and stretched tackles, and Watford were invited to conjure up some rhythm. It would take another smart save from Gunn to deny Pererya from close range but with the pressure relentless, they cracked as full time approached.\n\nThe ball ricocheted around a cluttered penalty area, no visiting player able to hit it clear, before it broke for Gray to lash the ball high beyond the goalkeeper via a deflection from the unfortunate Maya Yoshida.\n\nSouthampton’s players were crestfallen at the final whistle, Hasenhüttl spurning the chance to punch the air in front of the travelling support when, in truth, a point at Vicarage Road is to be celebrated.\n\nThe six-point

"report": "As the squabbles and scuffles erupted between players and coaching staff from the touchline to the mouth of the tunnel, Chelsea’s frustration was laid bare. They have become the latest team to stutter in their pursuit of a top-four finish over a round of Easter fixtures wasted by all those in contention but that tells only part of the story. The fractious draw that culminated in chaos as good as secured Burnley’s Premier League survival.\n\nChelsea’s Maurizio Sarri incensed by comments from Burnley bench Read more\n\nExasperation had been building for Chelsea, incensed by the time-wasting David Luiz would later decry as “anti-football” and comments allegedly made from the opposing bench to Maurizio Sarri, and eventually it spilled over in stoppage time. The award of a free-kick near the touchline deep in Chelsea territory prompted a mêlée, with Mateo Kovacic squaring up to Jack Cork, David Luiz clashing with Ashley Barnes, and Olivier Giroud separating Dwight McNeil and Cesar Azpilicueta. Sarri, forever encroaching in front of the away technical area, scurried down the touchline to jab and growl his disapproval. Once Kevin Friend had dealt with the players he dismissed the Italian to the stand.\n\nThat was actually Chelsea’s first sending off of the campaign, and one that left Sarri so aggrieved that he waived his post-match duties as he was “too emotional” having been stung by some of the comments allegedly flung his way by Burnley’s staff. The verbal battle carried through to the final whistle. The fitness coach, Paolo Bertelli, seemed to spend most of those additional five minutes offering out anyone on the Burnley bench who cared to listen. The assistant manager Ian Woan laughed him off but the goalkeeping coach, Billy Mercer, eventually bit and duly confronted Bertelli, his opposite number Massimo Nenci and Antonio Rudiger, unavailable here due to a knee injury.\n\nOthers muscled in nominally to pull people apart but the free-for-all was prolonged and spilled down into the tunnel, where the pushing and shoving continued.\n\nEven then, David Luiz and Ashley Westwood would go tête-á-tête as they retired from the turf. “I don’t know what you are allowed to say any more,” said Sean Dyche. “There were manbags, handbags, bumbags, some kind of bags in the tunnel. I didn’t see much of it. I was out clapping my fans.” That reflected a job well done by the visitors, with the 40-point mark secured and survival to all intents theirs. Burnley had scrapped, infuriated and, perhaps most significantly of all, undermined Chelsea with two set-plays back when the thrill of this occasion was still the football. Their recovery from a dreadful opening to this season has been impressive.\n\nYet, while they celebrated, the damage incurred was all Chelsea’s. Callum Hudson-Odoi limped away with a ruptured achilles, a player who has helped illuminate this team over recent weeks facing a prolonged period in rehabilitation and his hopes of excelling for England in the Nations League in June wrecked. An innocuous first-half fall on the touchline was all it took to curtail his campaign. His side’s efforts to rekindle some of the zest and attacking invention of their early forays duly ran aground on stubborn defence, their rhythm disrupted as Burnley slowed the game and the drain of the season taking its toll both mentally and physically. They could find no way beyond Tom Heatonand a mere point felt unsatisfactory. It may have lifted them back into the top four but, with those around them playing in midweek, their stay could be temporary.\n\nAll of which contributed to the furious finale overshadowing the brilliant rat-a-tat of the distant first half. Back then the hosts had showcased their fluent attacking best. There had been Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s barnstorming run from deep, Jeff Hendrick bouncing off him helplessly en route, and Eden Hazard’s tormenting of Matt Lowton as he sized up a cross. Twice the full-back thought he had his man covered, and twice he was hoodwinked and left embarrassed. He had barely picked himself up off the floor by the time N’Golo Kanté slammed in a fourth goal of the campaign from the Belgian’s pull-back.\n\nChelsea’s Callum Hudson-Odoi out for rest of season after rupturing achilles Read more\n\nFast forward 113 seconds and Jorginho’s burst, Azpilicueta’s cute backheel and Gonzalo Higuaín’s slick spin away from Ben Mee sliced Burnley open yet again. The angle was unkind but Higuaín, already denied by Mee’s earlier goal-line clearance, thrashed in his team’s second off the underside of the crossbar. Yet, without Rudiger marshalling their rearguard, Chelsea’s vulnerability was just as glaring. Those goals had been sandwiched between the visitors’ own rewards, both conjured from neatly constructed set-plays.\n\nHendrick’s stunning volley, thumped in from the edge of the area after Azpilicueta had headed a corner only half clear, had opened the scoring. And then, just as Chelsea appeared to have wrested back the initiative, Ashley Westwood floated over a free-kick to Mee, his run beyond the far post unnoticed and the centre-half’s header was flicked on by Chris Wood and converted on the volley by Ashley Barnes. The striker had also been left alone to net an 11th goal of the season.\n\nThereafter, it all became a scrap, in every sense, and only one team would depart satisfied. Sarri had warned there would be twists still to endure in the pursuit of a top-four finish.

And that was merely a routine 2-0 reverse at the end of a brief era. Five years later, at the start of a supposed new dawn, came humiliation. Ole Gunnar Solskjær is the inheritor and latest supervisor of a shambles.\n\nOn Friday the United manager said his players were in need of a reality check. It landed heavily on them as Marco Silva’s slick, expansive and clinical team recorded Everton’s biggest win over United since October 1984. Four outstanding goals from Richarlison, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Lucas Digne and Theo Walcott, plus one complete team performance, left Solksjær with another lament, this time over United’s failure to match Everton in the basics. A damning appraisal backed by a damning statistic: the visitors running 8.03km less than their opponents.\n\nEmbarrassment for United was not confined to the scoreline. It was writ large in the apathetic displays of their overpaid players, in Anthony Martial diving for a nonexistent penalty, in David de Gea throwing the ball straight at a dawdling Diogo Dalot and in United starting with the same central defence as in Moyes’ last stand in April 2014. There they were, Chris Smalling and Phil Jones, the latter getting himself injured yet again to add to the sense of chaotic deja vu. At least in that moment he offered a semblance of commitment that was otherwise absent. Champions League qualification is the least of their worries.\n\nEverton v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nEverton were superb and battered the visitors not only physically but in terms of quality, desire and work rate. United, fielding three changes to the side outclassed in Barcelona in midweek, were pathetic. A two-goal deficit at half-time flattered their spineless display.\n\nThe fear factor evaporated from United long ago yet the lack of reaction to their Champions League exit would have been galling for Solskjær and the club’s vociferous travelling support. They are a club welcomed with open arms when calling with the chequebook and visiting on their Premier League travels these days. A fifth consecutive away defeat in all competitions – the club’s worst sequence since 1981 – had a feeling of inevitability once Richarlison fired Everton ahead only 13 minutes in.\n\nSilva’s team continued where they left off in their last home win against Arsenal, refusing their opponents time or space to build from the back and winning almost every second ball. Often unchallenged. United’s refusal, reluctance or inability to press in return contributed to a comfortable stroll for Everton.\n\nThe breakthrough was a replica of Phil Jagielka’s winner against Arsenal in its construction, although far removed in its execution. The excellent Digne launched a long throw towards the six-yard box where Dominic Calvert-Lewin beat Smalling in the aerial challenge. Richarlison met the flick-on with an acrobatic, emphatic overhead kick that flew into the roof of De Gea’s net before the goalkeeper or Dalot, the Brazilian’s designated marker, could react.\n\nRicharlison’s stunning 13th league goal of the season was also the 45th conceded by United, equalling the club record for the most conceded in a Premier League campaign. It was also their 11th game in a row in all competitions without a clean sheet, extending their worst run for seven years. Number 46 and a unwanted club record was not long in coming.\n\nPlay Video 1:39 Ole Gunnar Solskjær apologises to Man Utd fans as Marco Silva celebrates Everton's 4-0 win – video\n\nEverton’s second stemmed from a United corner taken by Marcus Rashford and headed clear by Richarlison. Idrissa Gueye exchanged passes with the brilliant Bernard before releasing Sigurdsson into the United half. The counterattack slowed as he considered his options. Sensing a complete lack of resistance from Nemanja Matic offered the best solution, Sigurdsson stepped inside and swept a precise finish from over 25 yards inside De Gea’s right-hand post.\n\nThe United goalkeeper could have been sharper with his reaction – a criticism that could have been directed at everyone in pink – but Matic’s passive part in the goal encapsulated the visiting display.\n\nGoodison revelled in Everton’s superiority as well as the toils of its former striker Romelu Lukaku on his 250th Premier League appearance, who led what was a three-pronged attack in name only. Lukaku’s defeat in a 50-50 challenge with Seamus Coleman was particularly well received.\n\nThe third was yet another outstanding finish, this time from Digne, who rifled a half volley inside De Gea’s near post after the keeper had punched clear a Sigurdsson corner. Martial was closest to the France full-back when the ball dropped but decided against any defensive effort. Moments later Sigurdsson took another corner from the left and attempted to score. What is known as taking the Michael. Only De Gea’s sharp reaction to volley off his own goalline prevented Sigurdsson succeeding.\n\nEverton’s influential No 10 fashioned the fourth for Walcott with an impudent nutmeg of Victor Lindelöf. Calvert-Lewin had beaten two United players to a Digne throw before Sigurdsson sent the substitute sprinting clear. Walcott’s first touch took him away from goal but he still had time to correct his run and beat De Gea with a precise finish.\n\nSolskjær headed over to the away section after the final whistle to offer an apology.

How wrong could they be.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum drives Liverpool back to top of league after Cardiff win Read more\n\nIf Unai Emery was lulled into thinking he could afford to over-rotate, that notion was obliterated as a combination of Arsenal’s lamentable defending and Crystal Palace’s determination injected the afternoon with a pressure that left its burning mark. Roy Hodgson’s team capitalised on an underpowered and incoherent Arsenal line-up and wreaked havoc with their own power from set pieces. Arsenal’s 10-game winning streak at the Emirates evaporated at a costly moment. Emery rued that it was a “big frustration”.\n\nSome of the responsibility lies at his own door, having picked a team comprising a mix of established and fringe players. There is a risk of sending too many Carabao Cup-esque squad members into the full glare of Premier League intensity and Emery’s gamble was exposed here. In such a situation, with the team already lacking some of its usual composure, it was extraordinarily bad timing for one of the more experienced players to implode. Shkodran Mustafi’s errors had a direct role in all three Palace goals. It felt all the more damaging as Arsenal’s defence had sharpened up enough lately, conceding only one goal in seven games, before this disintegration.\n\nTitle race, top four, promotion and relegation – what's still at stake? Read more\n\nNaturally Hodgson felt his team deserved plenty of credit for the way they executed their gameplan. “It was a very satisfying performance and we knew set-plays would be a weapon,” he said. “We had good delivery and players who are good at attacking the ball. I can’t say I am surprised. Arsenal’s strength is their fantastic play going forwards.” Direct comment about their defensive weakness was left unsaid but his team spoke loudly enough for him on that one.\n\nPalace went ahead in the 16th minute, punishing Arsenal with ridiculous ease. Christian Benteke ran into the box blissfully unattended as Luka Milivojevic floated the ball in and the lack of awareness in the Arsenal defence was startling. Mustafi abandoned marking duties and allowed the striker to nod his first goal of the season – his first for almost an entire year – past Bernd Leno.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe home crowd became fractious, worrying about the stakes. Their angst grew as Arsenal were denied a penalty shortly before half-time. Sead Kolasinac planted a cross towards goal which struck Aaron Wan-Bissaka on the arm. Jon Moss was surrounded by appealing Arsenal players but gave nothing.\n\nEmery made a double change at half-time to try to repair some of the damage. The improvement was briefly encouraging. Arsenal wove their finest move of the match just after the restart and threw off the shackles to equalise. The goal belonged to Mesut Özil, architect and marksman. He found Alex Iwobi in space and the move flowed on to Alexandre Lacazette, whose deceptive pass was perfect for Özil. The finish was straight out of his personal playbook – dinking the ball in by chopping it into the ground first.\n\nBack came Palace, aided by more chronic Arsenal defending. Another set piece was hoicked in and Mustafi inexplicably stalled like an old tractor. Wilfried Zaha unsurprisingly did not stop in sympathy and calmly guided the ball past Leno.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wilfried Zaha celebrates after putting Palace back in front Photograph: Michael Zemanek/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nHodgson was pleased for Zaha and sprang to the defence of a player caught up in a media story about leaving the club. “How many players, if the question is put to them, will say they don’t want to play Champions League football?” he asked. “Congratulations to the journalist, who has caught him at the right moment and extracted an honest answer out of him. Would you like to play Champions League football? Yes, I would. ‘Do you think you’re good enough to play at a higher level?’ He says yes. I don’t know what I can do to gainsay that. He’s certainly happy at Crystal Palace. That wasn’t the performance of a guy who wants to get away from his club. I would say quite the reverse. He’s on a four-year contract and I’m looking forward to seeing him in a Crystal Palace shirt for many years to come.”\n\nPalace inflicted even more damage from another dead ball. Scott Dann’s header flew at James McArthur at such speed he did well to react and deflect the ball in.

Read more\n\nThe pressure was there for all to see and so was the relief on a day when Liverpool had to stay patient, hold their nerve and find a way to win a game that had frustrated them for the best part of an hour. In the end they came up with the answer themselves during a half-time conversation in the dressing room that led to the clever set-piece routine that broke Cardiff’s resistance.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum’s unerring first-time shot, from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s short corner, caught Cardiff out and any hopes Neil Warnock had of salvaging something from the game were extinguished nine minutes from time when Sean Morrison wrestled with Mohamed Salah and James Milner converted from the spot.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSalah may have fallen a little theatrically – “I think the end of it was a 9.9 Tom Daley job,” said Warnock – but Morrison had his arms all over the striker in full view of Martin Atkinson, the referee. Although Salah looked a little disappointed not to have the chance to take the penalty himself, it was smiles all round come the end as Liverpool chalked up their ninth successive victory in all competitions.\n\nLiverpool are up to 88 points, which is a Premier League club record and says everything about the standard Jürgen Klopp and his players have set this season. The bottom line, though, is that it will all feel rather hollow unless the campaign finishes with a first league title for 29 years.\n\nPlay Video 2:24 Jürgen Klopp claims Cardiff's dry pitch was dangerous for his Liverpool players – video\n\nLiverpool are doing their bit on that front but the worry is that they need a favour from a Manchester United side in freefall. Klopp is focused only on Liverpool winning matches. “The points total is like a bill, you don’t know what it’s going to be, but when it comes, you pay it,” he said. “In the end we will see how many points we have and then we get what we get. If you are only motivated to win the holy grail, then something is wrong with you. We are motivated to play for this club, we want to win games because we enjoy the ride with the fans. But we have no influence on the other games.”\n\nLiverpool were not at their fluent best, in particular their famed front three, who squandered some excellent chances, yet it was still a thoroughly professional team performance. Naby Keïta was an industrious presence in the centre of the pitch, Joël Matip strode out from the back with the ball on several occasions and Wijnaldum produced a splendid finish when Liverpool needed it most.\n\nJürgen Klopp: players came up with Cardiff corner routine at half-time Read more\n\nFrom Cardiff’s point of view, this game had always felt like a free hit in their battle to avoid relegation, and there were plenty of positives to take, especially the performance of Nathaniel Mendez-Laing. Signed on a free transfer from Rochdale two years ago, his direct, penetrative running on the left flank caused Alexander-Arnold problems time and again in a first half that nearly ended with Cardiff taking the lead. Oumar Niasse’s acrobatic volley was superbly tipped over the bar by Alisson in the 44th minute.\n\nLiverpool had wasted a few chances of their own by that point, with Roberto Firmino profligately shooting over and Salah’s stabbed effort blocked by Neil Etheridge’s outstretched boot.\n\nLiverpool and Manchester City are both deserving of title-winners’ confetti | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nWijnaldum was not so forgiving in the second half. As Alexander-Arnold shaped up to take a corner from the right, the Cardiff defenders expected the ball to be delivered into the six-yard box but the Liverpool full-back expertly disguised his intentions. His whipped, low centre picked out Wijnaldum in space and it was a terrific shot from 12 yards that flashed past Etheridge.\n\nWarnock felt Cardiff should have had a penalty moments later, claiming that Andrew Robertson had hold of Morrison as the central defender tried to get on the end of a corner. Klopp claimed that Atkinson had told him afterwards he would have given Liverpool a free-kick for a foul on Alisson had the ball ended up in the back of the net.\n\nJordan Henderson should have given Liverpool some breathing space but wastefully fired Sadio Mané’s intelligent cut-back over the bar. Liverpool then lost Fabinho to concussion only moments after the Brazilian had come on but Milner, his replacement, quickly made Klopp feel at ease with his penalty kick. Only Etheridge’s fingertips prevented Salah from adding a third Liverpool goal.\n\n“We wanted to give them a game, attack and not just sit back,” said Warnock, whose team will need a minimum of four points from their remaining three games to have any chance of staying up. “Whenever we could, we had a go at them. But they’re a good side, aren’t they? There’s not a weakness in their team.”"}, {"date": "20/04/2019", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54489, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [],

that mattered most to them, but Pep Guardiola will have been satisfied with the reaction his players showed after the draining events of Wednesday in the Champions League. The City manager had confessed he had no idea how such a cruel late setback might affect his side, though they gave one of their more solid performances of the season to take three points from a gutsy and resolute Spurs team to move back to the top of the Premier League table.\n\nKevin De Bruyne set to miss derby with hamstring injury, Guardiola admits Read more\n\nThis was not City at their fluent, most incisive best, they did not cut their opponents to pieces or rack up the goals as they are capable of doing, but Liverpool and Manchester United will still have been impressed. Liverpool are well aware of the difficulty of grinding out results against stubborn opponents at this stage of the season, while United, who play City next, might be encouraged by a relatively low-key home performance but will find it challenging to defend for 90 minutes as well as Spurs did.\n\nRealistically the third meeting of these sides within a fortnight was never going to live up to the breathless excitement of midweek, but they deserve credit for producing professional performances after their exertions in Europe. The only drawback from City’s point of view was that Kevin De Bruyne did not complete the game, twisting a knee in the act of shooting and limping off before half-time, though City have prospered without the influential Belgian for much of the season and appear equipped to do so again.\n\nBernardo Silva is one of the less celebrated names on the shortlist that was released on Saturday for the PFA player of the season award, and he gave Ben Davies a game he will not forget in a hurry. Time and again the Portugal international turned and tormented the wing-back trying to mark him, and he was unlucky to have a penalty appeal turned down midway through the first half when Jan Vertonghen caught his leg.\n\nBefore that Silva had been instrumental in creating the first goal, cutting in from the right after five minutes to pick out Sergio Agüero at the far post. The striker was not in a position to score but had the awareness to nod the ball back across goal, where Phil Foden’s reward for following up assiduously was a first league goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phil Foden (centre) celebrates his early header, which proved to be the match’s decisive moment. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nSuch an early breakthrough raised hopes of an end-to-end goalfest to resemble midweek, but the rest of the first half took on the aspect of an end-of-season encounter without much at stake, which was odd considering the fixture had been sold out for weeks and until a few days ago was considered make or break in City’s attempts to win another title.\n\nThey were comfortably in control for the most part, without finding the cutting edge that had brought them the lead, and while Spurs were reduced to sending long balls in the direction of Son Heung-min in the absence of Harry Kane, with Christian Eriksen supplying the passes and Son excelling at making the most out of very little, the visitors always looked capable of finding an equaliser.\n\nQuick guide Premier League title race: the remaining fixtures Show Hide Manchester City (86 points) 24 Apr Man Utd (a)\n\n28 Apr Burnley (a)\n\n4 May Leicester (h)\n\n12 May Brighton (a) Liverpool (85 points) 21 Apr Cardiff (a)\n\n26 Apr Huddersfield (h)\n\n5 May Newcastle (a)\n\n12 May Wolves (h)\n\nSon showed blistering pace to get goal side of Aymeric Laporte from Eriksen’s first invitation, only for the defender to recover in time to block his eventual shot. Eriksen had brought the first save of the game from Ederson, but it was Son who created Spurs’ best chance before the interval with a stunning turn in the middle of the pitch followed by a run through City’s defence all the way into the area, where he was foiled by the keeper’s alertness in leaving his line.\n\nAgüero had a shot blocked by Toby Alderweireld early in the second half and at the other end Spurs would have had a penalty had VAR been around to catch Kyle Walker’s hand diverting the ball away from Dele Alli, before Guardiola decided to be more proactive and sent on Leroy Sané, switching Raheem Sterling to a central role to try to inject more pace into City’s attacks.\n\nThe pair almost produced a goal within minutes when Sané’s cross found Sterling in the middle, yet what looked a straightforward tap-in was kept out by Paulo Gazzaniga’s trailing leg. Ederson had to make a sharp save from Lucas Moura shortly after that as the game began to live up to its original billing.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThere were no more goals, though the four minutes of stoppage time – with Vertonghen and Sterling booked after a scuffle and Spurs pumping high balls into the City area – were just as nervy and frenetic as anything on Wednesday. With the home fans shrieking for the whistle the contest ended almost comically, with Sané rolling around in agony, Guardiola almost stepping on to the pitch in his anxiousness to get involved and Fernandinho finally attempting to boot the ball out of the stadium in a bid to relieve the pressure.\n\nIt was not what City are famous for, but at this stage of an attempt to win an unprecedented

I thought it was going to be a really good day for us.\n\nGerard Deulofeu takes Watford seventh with victory over Huddersfield Read more\n\n“We were sharp with the ball, created opportunities and I think that’s the thing we need to look at today, the amount of presentable opportunities we had. The fact we didn’t score after being so clinical last weekend is a difficult one to work out.”\n\nBournemouth’s preparation was disrupted after right-back Adam Smith was injured in the warm-up and his replacement, Junior Stanislas, limped off after 23 minutes. With a number of other defensive injuries, that left the hosts with a four-man backline comprising four centre-backs and Howe admitted his side suffered as a consequence.\n\n“When you lose a player of Adam’s quality that was difficult for the team but then doubly difficult to lose Junior as well,” Howe said.\n\n“Upon that injury we’re then left with four centre-halves across our backline, so that was a difficult one for us to overcome. “We never fully got our rhythm back in the match and we just hope the injuries aren’t serious.”"}, {"date": "20/04/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium",

The hosts lost their 14th Premier League game at home this season to match Sunderland’s mark set in 2002-03 and 2004-05. Grant’s late header at least lifted Town up to 20 league goals this season, level with Derby’s record low of 2007-08.\n\nHuddersfield found themselves a goal down in the fifth minute following an unfortunate error. Jonathan Hogg slipped after taking goalkeeper Jonas Lössl’s pass 20 yards from his penalty area and although Terence Kongolo’s last-ditch tackle denied the surging Abdoulaye Doucouré, Deulofeu picked his spot from the rebound.\n\nHuddersfield’s best early chance fell to Aaron Mooy, whose free-kick on the left edge of the area arced narrowly wide in the 17th minute. Winger Isaac Mbenza, back after illness and making his first start since February, tested Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster with a fierce 20-yard shot. Huddersfield threatened again soon after. Mbenza and Tommy Smith combined down the right and, from the latter’s cross, Elias Kachunga was superbly denied by Adrian Mariappa.\n\nMariappa, stand-in skipper for Watford’s suspended striker Troy Deeney, snuffed out another ball in from Smith, while Huddersfield’s 18-year-old midfielder Matty Daly made his first-team debut just before half-time in place of Hogg. Town striker Steve Mounié’s overhead kick cleared the crossbar shortly after the restart and, at the other end, Deulofeu forced Lössl into a low save.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nFoster comfortably held Mooy’s low effort as Huddersfield maintained their game pursuit of a rare Premier League goal, but crosses from Smith and Mbenza eluded everyone in the box. Deulofeu sealed victory for Watford in the 80th minute when he side-footed home after Lössl had saved Ken Sema’s initial shot.\n\nHuddersfield gave their fans something to cheer in the third minute of added time when Grant, a 66th-minute replacement for Mounié, nodded home Chris Löwe’s headed pass.\n\n“I’m happy about [being seventh], but in this moment I’m not thinking if we are going to be able to keep that position or not,” said Gracia. “I prefer to be focused on our next game in three days … At the end of the season we can achieve something really special.”"}, {"date": "20/04/2019",

given Manuel Pellegrini’s side the lead in the first half. Lucas Pérez thought he had won it after an equaliser from Jamie Vardy but it was another substitute in the form of Barnes who had the final say in stoppage time, even if West Ham’s manager felt aggrieved that another Pérez effort moments earlier was disallowed for offside despite replays showing he was level.\n\n“Unfortunately for us we lost five points,” said Pellegrini. “If we had the points that we deserved in the last game against Manchester United and today then we could be fighting for seventh position. When you have two games in a row with such big mistakes then it is hard to take.”\n\nThe sense of injustice after the defeat against United last week - West Ham’s third successive loss in the league – had appeared to drive forward his side in the first period in which they dominated their visitors. Pellegrini had recalled Marko Arnautovic after he missed the United game while a groin injury to Manuel Lanzini also meant a return for Antonio. Rodgers also made two changes including the return of Marc Albrighton after more than two months out with a hamstring problem.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michail Antonio takes a lie down on the new stadium carpet after opening the scoring. Photograph: Richard Calver/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nLeicester’s defeat against Newcastle last week had somewhat dampened their hopes of snatching seventh spot and judging by their approach to the first half here, there is plenty of work to be done as a lackadaisical display allowed West Ham to take a deserved lead through Antonio eight minutes before the break. The winger had already been denied twice through last-ditch defending but made no mistake after Felipe Anderson’s cross was delivered perfectly into box, rising above Ben Chilwell before celebrating by rolling around on the new £250,000 claret and blue carpet surrounding the pitch that was making its debut.\n\nA lengthy dispute with landlords the London Legacy Development Corporation had meant the unveiling of the new carpet was delayed until this week, with Pellegrini spending most of the first period testing it out on the 30-metre walk from dugout to pitchside and back. Rodgers was often not far behind as he attempted to cajole his side into a response in the second half, although the home supporters seemed in the mood to tease and responded by chanting “You’re only here for the carpet” when one half-chance was spurned.\n\nGerard Deulofeu takes Watford seventh with victory over Huddersfield Read more\n\nBarnes was summoned from the bench and the result was an equaliser within three minutes as Vardy was on hand to stab home Chilwell’s low cross at the near post after the England defender was given acres of space to deliver.\n\nSuddenly, Leicester looked enthused by their task and could have gone ahead had James Maddison picked out Vardy with a quarter of an hour to play.\n\nIt looked like they had been made to pay when Pérez was the first to react when Pedro Obiang’s shot came back off a post and the points would surely have been safe had his second goal been allowed to stand after a pinpoint pass from Obiang. But a superb through-ball from Youri Tielemans as the clock ticked into additional time allowed Barnes the opportunity to spoil West Ham’s day.\n\n“We showed a great mentality,” said Rodgers. “We’re

Chris Hughton had called on his players to show resilience and togetherness between now and the end of the season and both were in evidence when Brighton picked up a precious point to halt a run of five successive defeats and edge a step clearer of the relegation zone.\n\nDefensive from the first minute to the last, Brighton got exactly what they came for. It made for a desperately poor spectacle – “How do you watch this every week?” and “Boring” chanted the exasperated Wolves supporters – yet no one in Brighton colours was complaining.\n\nHarvey Barnes scores late Leicester leveller to aggrieve West Ham Read more\n\nThe travelling fans, who were bathed in sunshine, greeted the final whistle with huge cheers. Brighton are now three points clear of Cardiff, who are 18th in the table, with four games to play – three of which are against Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester City. Wolves, in short, was a game that Brighton could not afford to lose and they played with that mindset throughout.\n\nThey rode their luck at times, no more so than when Diogo Jota’s glancing header came back off the inside of the far upright in the second half. Leander Dendoncker, who had been on the pitch for a couple of minutes, pounced on the loose ball, only a couple of yards out, but Mat Ryan, the Brighton goalkeeper, smothered the substitute’s shot.\n\nJota had earlier hit the bar and Ryan had a few other saves to make, but Wolves never worked Ryan enough despite dominating possession. Only five of their 22 shots were on target and there were times when the home team needed to show more conviction in front of goal and move the ball quicker.\n\nAs for Brighton, that Rui Patrício, the Wolves goalkeeper, never had a save to make says it all. A 4-3-3 on paper was a 4-5-1 on the pitch, with Ryan touching the ball more times than any other Brighton player in the opening half an hour.\n\nWith 10 players generally behind the ball, Brighton were disciplined, organised and compact and Wolves never had enough about them to find a way through.\n\nHughton, who had endured a tough week with Brighton losing back-to-back home matches against Bournemouth and Cardiff, admitted that his overriding emotion at the end was one of relief.\n\nAsked whether he would be happy to hear opposition fans chant “boring” in the final four matches, he replied: “At this moment it’s about effort, determination and organisation. All that’s important in these four games is about getting over the line.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mat Ryan makes one of his series of saves.

We’re lacking a little bit of confidence in front of goal, so that’s probably the next bit. But we were on the back of two very disappointing results and the reaction shows that we’re not such a bad team.”\n\nFrom Wolves’ point of view it was a day of frustration. Jota, who has been so impressive of late, dragged a shot narrowly wide in the first half and clipped the top of the bar shortly before the interval. When Dale Stephens shot from more than 40 yards with almost the last kick of the first half it was met with ironic cheers by the Brighton supporters.

virtually rubber-stamped their team’s Premier League status for another season.\n\nFeaturing a yellow card that should have been red, a smart second-half switch to 4-4-2, two clever substitutions and an Ayoze Pérez hat-trick, this was a game that kept on giving. Indeed it was so good that, for 90 minutes, home supporters all but forgot about the enduring impasse between Rafael Benítez and Newcastle’s owner, Mike Ashley, over negotiations to extend a managerial contract that expires in June.\n\nNewcastle United 3-1 Southampton: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nBy the final whistle Pérez had emphasised his metamorphosis from perceived weak link to Tyneside cult hero and nagging, albeit slim, relegation worries still lingered for a Southampton side who started and finished badly but impressed immensely in between.\n\n“I’m really pleased,” said Benítez. “We can see the potential, we can see how big this massive club in this fantastic city can be.” Asked what was happening regarding his contract the reply was instructive. “I have no idea,” he said. “I am the manager until 30 June, so we have to talk.”\n\nIf he looked mildly cross when Anthony Taylor, the referee, denied his side a second-minute penalty for Pierre-Emile Højbjerg’s perceived handball, Benítez was downright disgusted when James Ward-Prowse escaped with a yellow card after a cynical bodycheck on a rapidly counterattacking Miguel Almirón.\n\nConsidering Ward-Prowse was the only remaining marker between the badly winded Paraguayan playmaker and Angus Gunn’s goal, everyone in black and white was convinced the blow to the solar plexus represented the denial of a clear-cut goal-scoring opportunity and an automatic red card.\n\nTaylor presumably ruled that Ward-Prowse should be spared a sending-off as Almirón was still in his own half but that contentious judgment provoked a torrent of Spanish swear words from the usually much more measured Benítez. Given the bodycheck was so blatant it was arguably worthy of a dismissal alone and there was a real sense of justice being done when Pérez scored two goals in quick succession.\n\nHis first began with Isaac Hayden dispossessing Højbjerg before picking out Pérez with a fine pass that left the Spanish forward with his back to goal on the edge of the area and quite a bit to do. Pérez though proved equal to it, holding off Maya Yoshida to swivel superbly and direct a low-angled shot through the legs of Jan Bednarek before watching it brush the inside of a post en route to the bottom corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rafael Benítez congratulates Pérez after the game. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters\n\nThe celebrations had barely subsided when Pérez claimed his second after dodging Ryan Bertrand on the wing-back’s blindside, sliding in to connect with a Salomón Rondón cross and leaving his right foot to do the rest.\n\nSouthampton resembled a side who had spent the day dozing in the unseasonably warm Tyneside sunshine and could not quite wake up. They certainly failed to deal with Almirón’s coruscating pace and did not appreciate Newcastle’s assiduous closing down in a midfield dominated by Ki Sung-yueng and Hayden.\n\nIt was time for Ralph Hasenhüttl to earn his money and Southampton’s manager did not disappoint as he switched from 3-4-3 to 4-4-2 at the interval, introducing Stuart Armstrong and Mario Lemina to transformative effect.\n\nHasenhüttl acknowledged his players were “too slow” and “not aggressive enough” in the first half but his revamp had a radical impact as the visitors finally began blitzing Martin Dubravka’s goal and a dangerous Ward-Prowse cross was headed tantalisingly wide by Yoshida.\n\nAlthough Ki saw a low shot rebound off the base of a post with Gunn beaten, Southampton were a side reborn and no one looked too surprised when Lemina reduced the deficit. Nathan Redmond crossed, Armstrong cushioned the ball for his fellow substitute and Lemina sent a low shot curving, subtly and exquisitely, beyond the diving Dubravka’s grasp.\n\nSuddenly Newcastle were straining every sinew and could have done without Almirón being helped off with a nasty looking hamstring injury. Another Redmond cross resulted in Yoshida volleying fractionally over the bar from six yards but Hayden’s deflected volley very nearly reinstated Newcastle’s two-goal cushion.\n\nPérez delighted in completing that restoration job four minutes from full-time by redirecting Matt Ritchie’s header into the net to lift Newcastle to 12th on 41 points. All that remained was for St James’ Park to turn up the collective volume and implore Benítez to stay."}, {"date": "16/04/2019", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30226, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Fernandes da Silva Junior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [54]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jürgen Locadia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Andone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [54], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Button", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Burn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Peltier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [50], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aron Gunnarsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Mendez-Laing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [22], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kenneth Zohore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kadeem Harris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brian Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rhys Healey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was the kind of result to stoke Cardiff’s bid for survival with conviction rather than wildly optimistic hope. The gap to safety and Brighton has been whittled to two tantalising points. Given everything the Welsh club have endured this term, on and off the pitch, to be in such close contention with four games to play would already have seemed miraculous. Now, remarkably, the momentum may actually be with them.\n\nThe panic that gripped the majority inside this arena, players and supporters alike, betrayed as much with the home side overwhelmed by their newfound deficiencies long before the end. Where they wilted abjectly for the second home game in succession, their approach choked by anxiety and all confidence utterly drained away, Cardiff’s players and staff would congregate in front of the away support after the final whistle with belief pepped.\n\nNeil Warnock says Tiger Woods’ Masters win can be Cardiff’s inspiration Read more\n\nIt was quite a time to secure a top-flight away victory by a two-goal margin for the first time in 63 years. “Bloody hell, I was only seven,” said Neil Warnock. “People said it would be our last game in the Premier League, but we’re alive and kicking. You might think I’m in cloud cuckoo land but we’re more than capable of picking up points against any of the teams we’ve got left to play this season.”\n\nThe margin for error remains slim given two of those teams are Liverpool and Manchester United, but the manner in which Cardiff coped under pressure bodes well. A team who had won only once in seven games simply had to seize the initiative in Sussex. Brighton could bemoan the non-award of an early penalty after Bruno Ecuele Manga grappled with Lewis Dunk but, in truth, Cardiff were everything Albion were not: disciplined, composed, ruthless. Their gameplan was exquisite.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nathaniel Mendez-Laing’s shot flies beyond Mat Ryan. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nThey were abrasive through their core and slippery across their front-line. Aron Gunnarsson, the kind of street fighter suited to this kind of scrap, and Joe Ralls were all tigerish energy, revived as if this was a fixture plucked from the tail end of their Championship promotion campaign, with Leandro Bacuna “like Paul Pogba when he came on”, according to the manager.\n\nThey hassled and harried, discomforting Albion’s jittery midfielders whose passing became ever more erratic. Sean Morrison’s late smothering of Florin Andone’s attempt summed up the commitment of their rearguard, and they had a cutting edge on the counterattack with which Brighton could not contend.\n\nDavid Squires on … the Premier League's game of thrones Read more\n\nThe majesty of the goal that set the tone, in amid all the frenetic huff and puff, had floored the home side. Another Brighton attack had run aground just outside the penalty area, with Nathaniel Mendez-Laing sprinting upfield with no opponent close enough to muster a challenge. The free signing from Rochdale exchanged passes with Junior Hoilett on the flank, Albion defenders waving him through, before whipping a sumptuous shot from distance across Mat Ryan and into the far corner.\n\nBrighton, in truth, rarely played like a team capable of recovering from that early setback. They had started well enough but faded as soon as they met proper resistance and never exerted any kind of control. Instead they looked every bit a side who had won only twice in the league this year, with even the confidence of Dunk and Shane Duffy, once the team’s forte, long since shattered.\n\nEarly in the second half, Víctor Camarasa floated an inviting free-kick into the six-yard box where Morrison, having escaped Glenn Murray with the slightest of nudges, leapt unchecked behind Dunk – drawn under the flight of the ball – to thump his header down and across Ryan.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nIt was a wretched concession, and one to prompt another wave of frustration cascading down from the home support as Chris Hughton, memories of Norwich’s late-season capitulation under his charge five years ago perhaps flooding back, watched on helplessly.\n\n“As a team, as a club, and as individual players, there is only one way we can ensure we stay in this division: that’s by fighting as hard as we can,” he said. “If we’re not able to score the goals we need then we have to make sure we’re not conceding.” Four of their last five games are against sides from the top eight.

Always good for a soundbite, it was after this fixture in October 2017 that the Watford captain accused Arsenal’s players of lacking a certain male body part and outlined how he liked to “whack the first one” whenever the sides met.\n\nWell, 18 months on, Deeney did indeed give an Arsenal player a whack and he was sent off for his troubles.\n\nThe flashpoint came early, after 11 minutes to be precise, and somewhat out of nowhere. Arsenal had just taken the lead through a combination of impressive opportunism by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and outright doziness by Ben Foster when the referee, Craig Pawson, was suddenly displaying a red card. Deeney was the guilty party having, it seems, been spotted by Richard West, the assistant on the far side, throwing his right forearm into the side of Lucas Torreira’s head as he ran past the Arsenal midfielder.\n\nWatford v Arsenal: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nFrom where West was standing, it is possible he deemed that Deeney had hit Torreira with his elbow, with Pawson possibly coming to the same conclusion. As Javi Gracia was at pains to point out afterwards, that was not the case, yet there was no denying Deeney had been reckless and could have little complaints with what was his second ever Premier League dismissal and one that rules him out of Watford’s next three fixtures.\n\nDeeney being Deeney he did complain, on the pitch and as he walked topless past the dugouts, with reports suggesting he swore at Unai Emery as he passed the Arsenal manager. Emery later confirmed the player did say something to him but did not confirm it was foul language and for the 30-year-old there followed the humiliation of hearing the away supporters take great delight in his absence as he watched the remainder of the first half in the players’ tunnel. A strong case of schadenfreude and, for Deeney, some comedown eight days after playing a crucial part in Watford’s remarkable FA Cup semi-final victory over Wolves.\n\n“I don’t agree [it was a red card],” said Gracia. “Troy put his arm there but there was no contact with his elbow. I never saw an aggressive movement. I don’t understand why the referee took the decision.”\n\nThe Spaniard’s frustration was clear but he was also right to praise his team for how they reacted to the loss of their leader. As was the case at Wembley, Watford showed resilience in the face of adversity and created enough chances to feel they were somewhat unfortunate to suffer their first loss here since Boxing Day.\n\nCraig Cathcart and the excellent Étienne Capoue both forced Bernd Leno into smart saves before half-time before Adam Masina clipped the bar with a swerving long-range drive on 62 minutes. And then, with time running out, Andre Gray went around Leno and appeared set to pass the ball into an open net only for Ainsley Maitland-Niles, on as a substitute, to produce an excellent block.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Troy Deeney (right) looks straight ahead after his elbow on Lucas Torreira. Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n“To play with 10 players against Arsenal was demanding but we showed our spirit and character,” said Gracia. “My players deserve recognition.”\n\nDespite the result, Emery was less effusive about his own side. Arsenal may have dominated possession and chances created but, as their manager said, they “lacked control” despite their numerical advantage. Yet in the end they did enough to secure a hugely important win – only their third in their last 13 away games in all competitions and one that moves them to fourth in this most intriguing of battles for Champions League qualification. The visitors also secured their first away clean sheet of the campaign.\n\nQuick guide Premier League top-four race: remaining fixtures Show Hide The four-way sprint for the third and fourth Champions League places Tottenham\n\n20 Apr Man City (A)\n\n23 Apr Brighton (h)\n\n27 Apr West Ham (H)\n\n6 May Bournemouth (A)\n\n12 May Everton (H) Arsenal 21 Apr Crystal Palace (H)\n\n24 Apr Wolves (A)\n\n29 Apr Leicester (A)\n\n4 May Brighton (H)\n\n12 May Burnley (A) Manchester United 21 Apr Everton (A)\n\n24 Apr Man City (H)\n\n28 Apr Chelsea (H)\n\n5 May Huddersfield (A)\n\n12 May Cardiff (H) Chelsea 22 Apr Burnley (H)\n\n28 Apr Man Utd (A)\n\n4 May Watford (H)\n\n12 May Leicester (A)\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Deeney’s sending-off, the only goal of the game arrived like a bolt from the blue – or should that be a bolt from mint green given Arsenal’s colours. They were on the back foot and seemingly rattled by Watford’s aggressive start when a rare surge upfield led to Daryl Janmaat being forced into playing a back pass to Foster under pressure from Aubameyang. The Arsenal striker chased the ball down and was rewarded for his efforts when Watford’s goalkeeper hit his clearance straight at his left foot and could only look on as the ball rolled into the net.\n\nFor Aubameyang it was a 23rd goal of the season while for Foster, usually such a reliable presence, it was a moment to well and truly forget. “I’ve said sorry to the lads,” he said afterwards. “I think I should have just Cruyff-ed him, but it’s not my style.”\n\nIn fairness to Arsenal, they showed plenty of spirit themselves in a consistently physical encounter and created chances to double their lead, with Alex Iwobi particularly threatening from an advanced left-sided position. On the basis of this display, the 22-year-old would be a decent bet to start Arsenal’s Europa League quarter-final second-leg against Napoli on Thursday."}, {"date": "14/04/2019", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25721, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Vicente Guaita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Luka Milivojevic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [81], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [22]}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Max Meyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [22], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Mendy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15, 63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arijanet Muric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Manchester City will not let up. They endured, at most, four minutes of real anxiety here, as energy levels dipped and their hosts roused themselves to press for an improbable equaliser late on, but this felt a success as straightforward as they come, against the only team to have claimed Premier League points from the Etihad stadium this season.\n\nThat late flurry aside, it was a win devoid of drama – the kind of routine victory the champions seem to specialise in and that leaves onlookers debating the inequalities in the elite division.\n\nHow Liverpool would have yearned for Crystal Palace to inflict proper wounds as they had done up in Manchester, rather than merely summoning a free-kick from Luka Milivojevic close to the end that hinted at an unlikely finale.\n\nPep Guardiola says Manchester City must win all games to retain title Read more\n\nThere was no concerted onslaught to follow. Once City had regained composure they infuriated home fans by hogging the ball near the corner flags before Gabriel Jesus, marginally offside but permitted to continue on to Kevin De Bruyne’s slipped pass on the counterattack, scored a third goal in stoppage time to have Pep Guardiola and his staff spilling out in celebration from the dug-out.\n\nThey, like everyone present, knew that anything other than an away win would have been a scandal. This had been a masterclass in the suffocation of opponents through blanket possession and almost the perfect stroll, given that City have a deficit to retrieve in the conclusion of their Champions League quarter-final against Tottenham on Wednesday.\n\nRaheem Sterling, whose goals had set the tone, insisted refuelling was his priority rather than the chance to sit and watch Liverpool take on Chelsea. “I’m hungry, I need food,” he said through a smile.\n\nCity were without Fernandinho but hope to have the Brazilian restored against Spurs, and others have found form and fitness to bolster options in a cluttered schedule. Ilkay Gündogan was imperious, pinging passes merrily and utterly unflappable until he and Vincent Kompany messily upended James McArthur on the edge of City’s area to allow Milivojevic his opportunity.\n\nDe Bruyne, free at last from injury, was just as incisive whether operating from the flank or centre. “The last three or four games he’s played, he’s been incredible,” said Guardiola. “We’d missed him a lot. He has that ability and vision that most human beings do not have. He is fresh mentally and in his legs, too.”\n\nThe Belgian’s delivery tends to be thrilling, the whip and bend to his crosses cutting out backlines, and the weight of pass along the ground immaculate, to leave opposing defenders floundering. His through-balls seem to be almost magnetically drawn to team-mates who collect them in their stride. Sterling had been the early beneficiary, De Bruyne sliding one of those tantalising passes inside Patrick van Aanholt for the forward to chase beyond Scott Dann. The finish was dispatched emphatically across Vicente Guaita and high into the net.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raheem Sterling scores the opening goal. Photograph: Tony O’Brien/Action Images via Reuters\n\nSterling is appreciated in these parts, his recent dedication to Damary Dawkins – a 13-year-old member of Palace’s elite player development centre who died last month after a four-year battle with a very rare acute lymphoblastic leukaemia – on scoring for England against the Czech Republic having won him friends. Even this rampaging display will not damage that favourable reputation.\n\nCrystal Palace 1-3 Manchester City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nHis scuttling runs brimmed with menace and Palace, a team shorn of first-choice centre-halves and saddled by a dreadful home record, never came close to stifling his threat. They might have shipped to him earlier, Gündogan bustling round McArthur to the by-line before pulling back a cross that Sterling, unmarked at the far post, side-footed mystifyingly wide of the upright. In terms of his afternoon’s work, however, that miss proved exceptional.\n\nAll Palace could do was cling to the contest, hoping City would eventually succumb to sloppiness, complacency or fatigue, which never seemed likely. Only the substitute Cheikhou Kouyaté seemed intent on disrupting their rhythm as Christian Benteke, a striker without a goal in open play for 14 months, admirably attempted to unsettle Kompany in the absence of much support.\n\nPlay Video 1:10 Guardiola: title is in our hands after Manchester City beat Palace – video\n\nRoy Hodgson was torn between committing in pursuit of parity or hanging on until asking his players to rally late. As it was, having survived without further damage until just after the hour, Leroy Sané fizzed a pass across goal and Sterling, having again squeezed space from Van Aanholt, sidefooted a first-time finish with a thud of his boot back across Guaita and in.\n\nThe gulf between the contenders and the rest can gape at times, for all Palace’s defensive resolve and late semblance of a rally. “I can’t disagree that there’s an inequality in the league but I don’t know if it’s a problem: it’s a fact of life,” said Hodgson. “In all leagues cream rises to the top. That cream is well fortified by the amount of money available to spend and the quality of the players they can bring in.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“Those of us who can’t get into that group for various reasons – least of all financial – have to accept that and find ourselves playing quite a few games like this where the chances of winning are not great.

The great players rise with pressure and the striker chose his moment and his spot to perfection to drive Liverpool over the most daunting hurdle remaining in their pursuit of the title.\n\n“We can finally close the slipping book,” Jürgen Klopp reflected. A greater sense of closure is tantalisingly within reach should City falter now.\n\nParallels with the Chelsea visit that derailed Liverpool’s title pursuit in 2014 ran only as far as the scoreline and a slip in possession from Andy Robertson that was frankly irrelevant. Otherwise this was a match that reinforced the strength of Liverpool’s resolve in the face of City pressure and the class they possess to turn the most tense affairs in their favour.\n\nJürgen Klopp ‘blown away’ by Mohamed Salah’s thunderbolt against Chelsea Read more\n\nSadio Mané set Klopp’s team on course for a seventh successive victory in all competitions with his 13th goal in 16 games. Seconds later, 142 seconds to be precise, Salah produced a moment that will live long in Anfield’s collective consciousness. His 19th league goal of the season will take permanent residence there should it prove a defining moment for Liverpool’s hopes of a 19th league crown.\n\nFor Maurizio Sarri it was a fourth defeat in four visits to members of the so-called Big Six this season. Chelsea had opportunity to change the complexion of the afternoon through Eden Hazard but their man of the moment failed to match Salah’s contribution to an absorbing afternoon. Their failure to withstand Liverpool’s breathless start to the second half was crucial.\n\nIt did not take long for Chelsea fans to revisit recent history in an attempt to stir anxiety among the home crowd. Eight minutes before kick-off, in fact, was when the first rendition of the Steven Gerrard/Demba Ba song aired. Only two players remained from that infamous game in April 2014, however, César Azpilicueta and Salah, and the latter was wearing blue that day.\n\nSterling maintains Manchester City’s title push against Crystal Palace Read more\n\nThe most important sound from the crowd before the game was of course silence for the victims of the Hillsborough disaster on the eve of the 30th anniversary. It was impeccably observed by all, as one mosaic reading “30 Years” filled the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and another that simply said “96” dominated the Kop.\n\nThe following 45 minutes were tense and far removed from the monumental occasion it would become. Liverpool started on the front foot but without the aggression and composure on the ball that so often makes their control count. Sarri’s side, with Hazard operating as a false nine, worked their way into promising situations on the counterattack without troubling Alisson in the Liverpool goal. Their first-half display was encapsulated by Willian breaking from a David Luiz clearance, cutting inside Virgil van Dijk and Jordan Henderson, then slicing well wide from 18 yards.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Virgil van Dijk shouts at his teammates after Chelsea’s Eden Hazard misses a chance. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters\n\nLiverpool’s best chance of the first half fell to Salah in their first attack. Mané, who unnerved Azpilicueta from the opening whistle, delivered a deep cross into the six-yard box. Unmarked, Salah shinned his volley straight at Kepa Arrizabalaga. Mané turned another good opportunity wide when Salah returned the favour but overall it was a flat opening reminiscent of that game from five years ago. A jaw-dropping start to the second half by Liverpool ensured there would be no repeat.\n\nLiverpool 2-0 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nUntil Mané struck his 18th goal of the league campaign the most significant moment was the knee injury sustained by Antonio Rüdiger when chasing a Joël Matip ball over the top towards Mané. The Chelsea central defender had started authoritatively and laboured on for another 18 minutes before collapsing again. He looked in a bad way when carried off the pitch by two members of the Chelsea medical staff.\n\nRüdiger’s replacement, Andreas Christensen, came on for his fifth league appearance of the season and was that rusty he spent the half-time interval warming up on the pitch. He and his team-mates were caught cold from the restart.\n\nThe game, the atmosphere and quite possibly the title race turned six minutes after the restart when Matip picked out Salah with a measured pass out of defence. Liverpool’s leading marksman played a one-two with Roberto Firmino that should have been cut out by Emerson. The Chelsea left-back was weak in the challenge, Henderson nipped in ahead of Jorginho and floated a delightful cross over from the by-line for Mané to head home.\n\nPlay Video 1:42 Jürgen Klopp: Salah strike against Chelsea 'blew me away' – video\n\nA collective gasp was then heard around Anfield when Salah sealed a most precious victory with a shot of exquisite beauty. He was lurking in a similar position to the opening goal when he took a cross-field pass from Van Dijk with a polished first touch. This time he stepped across Emerson and, before the Chelsea defence could react, unleashed an angled drive that flew straight and true into the top corner of Arrizabalaga’s goal. It was an unforgettable moment that left Klopp looking on in joyous disbelief and over 50,000 others following suit.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nLiverpool were rampant at this stage, Firmino flashing another shot from distance just wide, yet Chelsea could have levelled with two glorious Hazard chances in as many minutes. He had only Alisson to beat when Christensen’s long ball caught out the Liverpool defence. He beat the Liverpool goalkeeper but his low shot smacked against the post. Seconds later, from Willian’s inviting delivery, his free shot was spilled by Alisson and Van Dijk hooked clear before Hazard could capitalise on the rebound.\n\nThere would be no slips from Liverpool on this occasion.

Champions League quarter-final, second leg at Manchester City on Wednesday. They lead 1-0 from the first leg.\n\nAs such, the visit of relegated Huddersfield felt like a distraction; an irritation, even. It added up to a test of Spurs’ mentality, which Mauricio Pochettino has had cause to criticise on a few occasions this season. The points were still imperative to the club’s top-four aspirations.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 4-0 Huddersfield Town: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nPochettino could rest easy. The victory was not in doubt from the moment Victor Wanyama sashayed through to score the first goal and it was glossed by a clinical hat-trick from Lucas Moura – the Brazilian’s first since his move to Europe and Paris Saint-Germain in January 2013. He celebrated at full-time by having a kickaround with his little son on the pitch. How the crowd loved that.\n\nPochettino’s decision to rest the majority of his big guns for the City tie was vindicated. The manager indicated on Friday that Son Heung-min was in condition to play but, in the event, he found a way to use him as a late substitute. That way was to revert to a back three and include Jan Vertonghen. Christian Eriksen and Moussa Sissoko were the only other first-choice outfield players to start. Sissoko was excellent, pulling off a crowd-pleasing roulette in the early running and departing to a standing ovation when he was substituted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Victor Wanyama skips around Ben Hamer to give Spurs a 1-0 lead. Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty Images\n\nPochettino was without the injured Harry Kane while he did not risk Dele Alli, who broke his hand in the first leg against City and is currently coming to terms with playing in a protective cast. Pochettino said he was unsure whether Alli would be OK for Wednesday. “He needs to feel comfortable and it’s painful,” he said. Also of concern is Harry Winks, who felt his groin in training on Friday. He is a doubt for the second leg.\n\nThe team news was always going to be a prominent subplot and it was not just that of Spurs that registered with a degree of force. Huddersfield’s stay in the Premier League has proved short-lived and for the manager, Jan Siewert, it is time to test out players for the Championship – and overlook those that could fetch a transfer fee in the summer. Hence, Jonas Lössl, Philip Billing and Mathias Jørgensen are fading from view. Siewert also demoted Aaron Mooy and Alex Pritchard to the bench.\n\nPlay Video 1:18 'Tough period ahead': Pochettino looks to Spurs top-four fight after win – video\n\nHuddersfield roused themselves in the final 20 minutes. Sissoko had to tear back to put off Karlan Grant; the substitute Steve Mounié missed a gilt-edged header and Hugo Lloris tipped a Juninho Bacuna free-kick against the crossbar and away. But the gulf in class was plain and for much of the game it was difficult to overstate how bad Huddersfield were. Siewert has lost 10 of his 11 matches in charge. Spurs, by contrast, have won three out of three at their new stadium and kept three clean sheets.\n\nSpurs’ strength in depth is sometimes questioned but Pochettino could call up players of proven quality, not least Moura, who was in the mood from the outset. He put Spurs in charge with the second goal on 27 minutes and it was a rasping finish, after Sissoko had played him in. Lucas would put Huddersfield to the sword at the end. First, he took Eriksen’s cross and guided a shot past Ben Hamer and then he collected Son’s pass and fired into the far, top corner.\n\nWanyama’s goal was his first for Spurs since a piledriver at Liverpool in February 2018 – and it owed everything to a well-timed burst and an ice-cool walk around Hamer. Fernando Llorente laid it on and his link-up play was a feature of the match. Llorente did everything but score. His best moment came early in the second half when he took a lovely touch from Juan Foyth’s pass and, first time and on the volley, lifted against the crossbar.\n\nHuddersfield’s only first-half flicker came when Jon Stankovic fluffed a volley from Bacuna’s corner while Eriksen would hit the post with a deflected shot in the 81st minute. Now for City.\n\n• This article was amended on 15 April 2019 because a photo was captioned as showing Jonas Lössl in goal when Victor Wanyama scored; the goalkeeper was actually Ben Hamer."}, {"date":

end up surviving a second season in the Premier League, then Chris Hughton knows they have no one to blame but themselves. A Bournemouth side who had won only once since the 4-0 victory over Chelsea at the end of January inflicted Brighton’s heaviest defeat since moving to the Amex in 2011. Anthony Knockaert was shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge that completed a miserable afternoon for both the Frenchman and his manager.\n\nOnly the intervention of the referee in two out of Cardiff’s last three matches has meant that a dangerous situation has not become more critical for Brighton who now face a crucial meeting with Neil Warnock’s side here on Tuesday. On this evidence, as Hughton acknowledged, they will be up against it.\n\n“It’s not something we have experienced before. It was our worst result ever,” he said. “There is no doubt they know how poor the performance was today. Now we will be looking to see the type of reaction we will get from them against a Cardiff team who will be highly motivated.”\n\nWith Tottenham, Arsenal and City to come in three of Brighton’s final four fixtures, Hughton had insisted this week that he wanted to ensure safety before the end of the month. He could not have wished for much better opponents with Bournemouth having lost 11 of their last 12 matches on the road in all competitions. Yet having been outbattled in the home defeat by Burnley last week, Eddie Howe was given the response he had demanded with an impressive start that could easily have seen the visitors take the lead twice through Callum Wilson and Josh King before they did. Both moves emanated from the jinking feet of Ryan Fraser on the left wing but it was David Brooks – deployed on the opposite flank – who was the architect of the opening goal. A superb piece of skill from the Wales international picked out Wilson’s run and Dan Gosling was on hand to finish with aplomb from his pass.\n\nNathan Redmond hauls Southampton towards safety with win over Wolves Read more\n\nAn atmosphere that was already nervous suddenly became full of tension, with Brighton struggling to find a response despite the best efforts of the energetic Yves Bissouma and Knockaert. They left the field at half-time to a smattering of boos, although the news that Cardiff were trailing at Burnley would have cheered them up slightly.\n\nGlenn Murray was sent to warm up immediately after the restart, just as Chris Mepham and Knockaert were squaring up to each other following a clash off the ball. Both ended up being booked, although Mepham was perhaps slightly lucky to stay on the pitch after appearing to lean his head into his opponent’s forehead.\n\nSpurred on by the perceived injustice, Brighton attempted to push forward but were almost caught out on the break when Wilson’s cross just failed to pick out King. Less than 60 seconds later Knockaert carelessly gave the ball away in his own half and the lead had doubled, Fraser curling home his seventh Premier League goal of the season after another precise pass from Wilson.\n\nThat was the cue for Murray to make his bow, yet still it was Bournemouth who appeared more likely to extend their lead. Any hopes of a late rescue act were extinguished when Knockaert was shown a straight red for taking out Adam Smith with what his manager described as “an emotional and reckless” challenge after losing the ball. “He is aware that he has let the team down,” added Hughton.\n\nA brilliant run from Smith soon after allowed Brooks to score a deserved goal after more good play from Fraser, who was then on hand to set up Wilson for the next after another Brighton error. “We want five,” sang the Bournemouth fans.

If it was a little bad-tempered at times it probably reflected the tension of a relegation six-pointer that ended with Burnley all but mathematically safe and Cardiff travelling to a freefalling Brighton on Tuesday knowing victory could still boost their slim hopes of staying in the Premier League.\n\n“If Brighton beat us it’s probably all over,” said a surprisingly sanguine Neil Warnock who had turned incandescent when his Cardiff side were awarded a penalty after a linesman spotted a handball by Ben Mee, only for the referee, Mike Dean, to change his mind.\n\n“But I think we’re going to be inundated with luck in our final five games.”\n\nThe visitors had only themselves to blame for a poor first half and the game had barely begun when Wood hit the post after making a headed connection with a whipped-in free-kick from Burnley’s highly promising winger, Dwight McNeil.\n\nThe 19-year-old’s dead-ball delivery and crossing posed Cardiff a litany of problems and he created both Wood’s goals. The first came from a McNeil corner met by the unmarked New Zealand striker whose perfectly timed advance encountered zero resistance from a slapdash visiting defence. Wood glanced his header beyond Neil Etheridge and nudged Cardiff closer to the Championship.\n\nThe loss of Sol Bamba, their best defender, to a season-ending injury has hit them hard and their backline reverted to papier-mache mode again as Ashley Westwood found himself clean through with only Etheridge to beat. The goalkeeper, partly assisted by the distraction offered by a desperately backpedaling Sean Morrison, did well to come off his line and make an important save but he should never have been placed in that position.\n\nA series of tetchy sub-plots was unfolding involving assorted warring players. The most notable involved Joe Bennett clashing with Ashley Barnes and both players were booked shortly before half-time, Cardiff’s left-back for fouling the home forward and Barnes for appearing to kiss Bennett twice on the nose in mischievous response.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ashley Barnes appears to kiss Joe Bennett of Cardiff City on the nose. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nBurnley players probably felt like kissing Dean following his volte face. The referee had awarded Cardiff a penalty after being alerted to a handball. After pointing to the spot and initially appearing to tell protesting players he would not be discussing the matter with the linesman, Dean then changed his mind and the decision. Replays suggested that in attempting to cut out a cross, the defender had accidentally headed the ball on to his hand. “It’s tough on Cardiff but the officials reached the right decision,” said Sean Dyche.\n\nThe decision left Warnock chewing gum with a frighteningly manic intensity. “It’s one of those things,” he said. “I’ve been to see the referee but that’s between us. It’s annoying, we keep getting one kick in the teeth after another.\n\n“He does seem to lift his hand to the ball, so there is some movement there. But I can’t fault my players, they really tried hard and we’ve got to be ready for Brighton now.”\n\nIt would be no consolation to Cardiff’s manager that, by then, his side had improved significantly. While Harry Arter curled a shot tantalisingly over the bar and Junior Hoilett tested Tom Heaton with a tricky 25 yard shot; Hoilett then scuffed his shot after being set up by Kenneth Zohore.\n\n“I really thought we could have won it in the second half,” said Warnock. Instead he had to endure watching more clever wing play from McNeil preface Wood heading his 13th goal of the campaign after the youngster’s cross was deflected by Bruno Ecuele Manga.\n\nBurnley have reached the nirvana otherwise known as 39 points and the Royal Dyche, the nearby pub re-named in their manager’s honour, could anticipate brisk Saturday-night trade.\n\n“The lads have been terrific,” said Dyche, whose side have collected 27 points from their past 15 games. “They deserve to stay up.”"}, {"date": "13/04/2019", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 24971, "home_team": {"name":

the Championship was confirmed last time out at Watford, the home team ran out as 2-0 victors.\n\nTheir captain, Tom Cairney, opened the scoring before Ryan Babel wrapped up their first victory since January and a first win for their caretaker manager, Scott Parker.\n\nChris Wood boosts Burnley and keeps Cardiff deep in relegation mire Read more\n\n“If ever the focus was on this team it was now. We realised the challenge ahead, staying in the Premier League, was tough,” Parker said. “But once we were relegated it would have been easy ... and questions have been asked of me: ‘Are your players still up for the fight or on the beach?’\n\n“Ultimately they answered those questions. For me, the fans and everyone else that character was brought into play today and certainly the players proved people wrong and showed real fight and determination.”\n\nIt was a rare successful day for Fulham’s defence, which celebrated a first clean sheet of 2019. An early mix-up from Everton set the tone for the afternoon as Jordan Pickford smashed a clearance straight at Phil Jagielka, although fortunately for Marco Silva’s side the ball bounced harmlessly back to the goalkeeper.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic flashed a shot well over the crossbar before testing Pickford for the first time soon after as Fulham started on the front foot. The striker should have opened the scoring with 11 minutes on the clock but could only shoot tamely after beating the Everton offside trap.\n\nThe visitors slowly grew into the contest, Bernard drawing a low save out of Sergio Rico before Mitrovic again went close, Pickford this time pushing his header over the bar.\n\nThe Serbia international saw his header from the resulting corner deflected behind. Calum Chambers was next to pass up a good chance as he failed to make enough contact with Cairney’s cross.\n\nThe first half was summed up when another well-worked Fulham move resulted in Mitrovic hitting the crossbar as the scores remained level at the interval.\n\nIt did not stay that way for long. Cairney opened the scoring 31 seconds after the restart, sending a low finish past Pickford from just inside the area after good work from Babel.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson had the ball in the net for Everton soon afterwards but it was correctly ruled out by the referee, Lee Probert, as Rico was caught by the outstretched boot of Dominic Calvert-Lewin beforehand.\n\nNathan Redmond hauls Southampton towards safety with win over Wolves Read more\n\nFulham, too, had a goal chalked off as Mitrovic was adjudged to have fouled Kurt Zouma to allow Ryan Sessegnon to fire in.\n\nCalvert-Lewin clipped the post as Everton started to push for an equaliser but Fulham extended their lead when the former Liverpool man Babel collected Mitrovic’s pass and coolly dinked the ball over the onrushing Pickford.\n\nEverton could not respond and so missed the chance to move up to seventh. “It was a disappointing result, we did not perform in the way we want. You have to do more and better because we have the quality to do that,” said Silva.\n\n“The first half we did not play really fast and create problems. It was not a good first half.

Saints were floundering in 18th position when the Austrian replaced Mark Hughes as manager and had a solitary Premier League win for the season.\n\nSince then they have been transformed and this win, their eighth in the league under Hasenhüttl, could have been even more emphatic. It hoisted them eight points clear of the team now in 18th, Cardiff City.\n\n“It was a massive win but we are not celebrating staying in the league yet,” said Hasenhüttl while Southampton fans did exactly that in the stands. The way Southampton are playing now makes a sudden collapse highly unlikely.\n\nChris Wood boosts Burnley and keeps Cardiff deep in relegation mire Read more\n\nUnder Hasenhüttl they have a method, intelligence and vital energy, and within that collective certain players are shining. None more so than Nathan Redmond. A player once compared to a young Thierry Henry by the former Southampton manager Claude Puel and publicly encouraged by Pep Guardiola to express his skills more boldly is thriving under Hasenhüttl. His two goals here took his tally for the season to eight in all competitions and put Southampton out of Wolves’ reach.\n\n“I think we have a special relationship and I demand a lot from him,” said Hasenhüttl. “I ask him to show he is the guy who can make a difference. Today he was in the right place and the right moment and his finishing was clinical.”\n\nRedmond struck here after less than two minutes, raising suspicions that Wolves were still mourning last week’s defeat in the FA Cup semi-final. Nuno Espírito Santo rubbished that theory but the visiting defence looked sleepy as Josh Sims raced down the right wing and sent in a low cross that Redmond turned into the net after darting in front of Romain Saïss.\n\nThe creation of that goal brought more vindication for Hasenhüttl, who had chosen to give Sims a first start since the winger returned in January from an unhappy loan spell at Reading. Hasenhüttl suspected that Sims’ speed could trouble Wolves’ left wing-back, Jonny, and he was right.\n\nJonny scored his only goal of the season during Wolves’ 2-0 win against a Hughes-led Southampton in September but Sims forced him on to the back foot for much of this match. Nonetheless, once Wolves woke up they enjoyed plenty of possession and made sure that the hosts also had to defend.\n\nRúben Neves had a shot blocked before Leander Dendoncker sent a header wide from eight yards. The visitors deserved their equaliser when it came in the 28th minute, Willy Boly rising well to head a corner by João Moutinho into the net from eight yards.\n\nSouthampton regained their lead within two minutes. Sims was involved again before Danny Ings slipped a nifty pass through to Redmond, who had scampered unnoticed through the heart of the Wolves defence and finished with a dainty clip over Rui Patrício.\n\nSims should have scored before the break following another cute pass from Ings but dragged a shot wide from the edge of the box.\n\nWolves had plenty of possession in the second half but Southampton kept them out of harm’s way. Then in the 69th minute Maya Yoshida misdirected a header straight to Raúl Jiménez and was grateful to see the striker welly a wild shot into the stands from 15 yards. The Mexican could have done with a mask to hide his embarrassment.\n\nThe cost of that miss increased moments later when Yoshida helped to increase Southampton’s lead. After Wolves failed to clear a corner the defender tried to score with an overhead kick. The ball rebounded to him and, while still on the ground, he stabbed it into the path of Shane Long, who flicked it into the net from close range.\n\nTwo minutes later Patrício made a point-blank save to stop Yoshida from inflicting more damage.

They were hardly pretty but will not care given the business end of the season requires wins and wins only. Paul Pogba was the saviour as he scored two penalties, creating the latter with a ball into Anthony Martial, as Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s team secured all three points with only 10 minutes left.\n\nBoth United’s penalties were dubious, though, as was the decision to rule out a Felipe Anderson effort for offside when the game was scoreless.\n\nWith Luke Shaw and Ashley Young suspended and Tuesday night’s Champions League quarter-final second leg at Barcelona in mind, changes for United were inevitable. Of the starters in Wednesday’s 1-0 first-leg defeat here, six survived as in came Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Juan Mata, Martial and Jesse Lingard.\n\nAnthony Knockaert sees red as Bournemouth help Brighton self-destruct Read more\n\nManuel Pellegrini’s side had three changes from the XI that began Monday’s 2-0 defeat at Chelsea, with Pablo Zabaleta, Robert Snodgrass and Arthur Masuaku brought in. Marko Arnautovic was the most notable absentee, through illness.\n\nThere was an open start to a half that continued throughout. Felipe Anderson’s “illegal” goal came when he finished beyond David de Gea but the strike was ruled offside despite Diogo Dalot appearing to have kept him onside.\n\nWest Ham were enjoying space between the United defence and midfield and along the flanks. Still, there was the same freedom to play for the home side and, when Fred utilised this to move his team forward, Mata was dumped over by Snodgrass and the referee, Graham Scott, pointed to the spot despite the Spaniard perhaps being outside the area and contact possibly fair. Up trotted Pogba to hammer home a 15th goal of the season.\n\nWest Ham attempted an instant response but Manuel Lanzini’s free-kick went for a corner and, when a second followed, Anderson’s glancing header bounced wide.\n\nThe end-to-end stuff continued, Romelu Lukaku leading a charge to West Ham’s area that had Pogba, Martial and Mata following. This move eventually broke down due to offside. Dalot was next to threaten but the right-back’s shot went wide.\n\nSolskjær, whose side began the game in sixth, had said attaining a Champions League berth was a challenge and given how average United were throughout this first half it felt an understatement. After Lukaku’s shot was deflected for a corner Chris Smalling’s subsequent header was as misdirected as Rojo’s attempted clearance at the other end a few moments later.\n\nUnited ended the period hanging on, with De Gea having to clear an Anderson effort off his line with a boot.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Pogba fires home his, and Manchester United’s, second goal of the game. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nDeclan Rice showed first after the break, West Ham’s holding player surging down the right, and he was about to help create an equaliser that began and ended with a De Gea error, four minutes into the second half.\n\nThe Spaniard’s loose throw was meant for Pogba but found only Rice. He passed to Snodgrass, who moved the ball to Lanzini. The No 10’s cross from the left went right across goal to Felipe Anderson and his close-range attempt was allowed to squeeze in at the near post, thanks to De Gea’s poor attempt at a save.\n\nManchester United were stunned and West Ham were in the ascendancy. Solskjær reacted quickly by replacing Mata with Marcus Rashford.\n\nThe reshuffle had Lukaku fanning out right and Rashford becoming centre-forward. There was nearly an instant dividend. Smalling played Rashford in along a right-hand channel and his shot was parried by Lukasz Fabianski, West Ham’s keeper.\n\nThis signalled an upturn in urgency and energy and Rashford really should have restored the home side’s lead with a close-ranger header seconds later. United were camped in West Ham’s defensive third but unable to dominate, with Rojo the chief culprit in a rearguard in disarray when the Hammers attacked.\n\nBoth managers made changes. With 14 minutes left Rojo and Lukaku made way for Andreas Pereira and Mason Greenwood. Yet it was Michail Antonio, introduced by Pellegrini just beforehand in place of Javier Hernández, who was soon crashing a shot off the bar before De Gea had to produce a fine save from his header.\n\nBut Ryan Fredericks, who had come on for Zabaleta, then brought down Martial and Pogba again did the business from the spot – Pellegrini later claimed Rashford, from an offside position, touched the through ball on but by then it was too late."}, {"date": "12/04/2019", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32108, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name":

But here, at least, Benítez and his team celebrated a deserved win, sealed by Ayoze Pérez’s first-half header.\n\nLeicester City 0-1 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nLeicester remain seventh but their European ambitions were damaged by this defeat, which leaves them vulnerable to being overtaken by at least one of the clubs with matches in hand. Benítez said he is in talks with Ashley about making the sort of summer recruitment that would enable Newcastle to beat teams such as Leicester regularly enough to mount their own challenge for seventh place – although he would not accept that his team’s current tally of 38 points guarantees survival.\n\n“We’re not safe yet, we’ll see what happens,” he said before explaining what he would like to happen in the summer. “Go into the transfer window and sign the players you need at the right time. The top six are a little bit far away but we can compete in the other range. We’re talking behind closed doors.”\n\nThis win was a perfect example of Benítez making the most of the resources available. It also presented Rodgers with a challenge that Leicester had not yet faced during their previous four matches, all won. Benítez suffered a blow last week in the form of Florian Lejeune’s season-ending injury but he persisted with a formation involving three centre-backs, with Paul Dummett filling in for the unfortunate Frenchman. Newcastle then executed their plan so well it was a wonder they had not won away in the league since before Christmas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ayoze Pérez scores leaps to guide a superb header into the net for the winning goal.

In the first minute Newcastle forced a corner from which Jamaal Lascelles got off a header that Kasper Schmeichel had to block, albeit without difficulty. Within 20 seconds the action had switched to the other end, as Martin Dubravka stopped an effort from Jamie Vardy. Soon the contest settled into the expected pattern, Leicester probing while Newcastle strove to keep them at bay and strike on the counter, with Salomón Rondón serving as an ever-willing one-man front line.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\n\nRondón nearly opened the scoring in the 15th minute when he sent a terrific free-kick from 25 yards over the wall. Schmeichel could only wave at the ball as it flew past him. He was mightily relieved to see it bounce out off the crossbar.\n\nDoing something right despite the hysteria: in defence of Maurizio Sarri | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nLeicester were struggling to pick a way through Newcastle’s defence, able only to fumble around the edges like men trying to retrieve a wallet from a prickly bush. But in the 21st minute Ben Chilwell cut through with a sharp one-two. Dubravka foiled his attempt to curl a shot into the bottom corner. Moments later the Slovakian thwarted Harvey Barnes, too. Then Newcastle tore forward and broke through. Matt Ritchie’s cross from the left was perfect and so too was Pérez’s run, which enabled him to beat Wes Morgan to the ball at the near post and guide a splendid header into the net.\n\nBy half-time Benítez’s plan was looking good and Rodgers needed to come up with a new one. Instead Leicester deteriorated as Newcastle chased a clinching goal. A cross from the left by Rondón offered Pérez a chance to double his tally in the 52nd minute but the Spaniard miskicked from 10 yards out. Fabian Schär then went on a safari downfield before setting up Miguel Almirón, whose attempted finish was wild.\n\nLeicester were unable to feed Vardy for most of the match and then, when Youri Tielemans finally presented him with a chance, the striker shanked the ball into the stands.\n\n“It was the first time I’ve seen us play in this type of game where the opponent sits deep with 11 men around the ball,” said Rodgers. “The important thing is to learn from it.”"}, {"date": "08/04/2019", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 40537, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup":

brilliance. His had been a virtuoso display, played out to gasps of disbelief from stands, dug-outs and opposing ranks alike. It might have been tempting to panic prematurely and wonder who could ever come close to replacing the Belgian when, as seems inevitable, he eventually departs to Real Madrid, but sometimes it is best just to savour every last second of excellence.\n\nThe worrying can wait. If this was Hazard serving notice of his determination to leave on a high, then the next few weeks could be a joy. Take the goal midway through the first half which prised West Ham apart, slicing them through their centre from the moment he flicked the ball ahead into space, the turbos kicked in and the scuttle became a gallop. There were swerves away from a half-hearted Mark Noble challenge, with Declan Rice an observer too far off the pace to muster a challenge. Then came the zig-zagged slalom, played out at breakneck speed, through Angelo Ogbonna and Fabián Balbuena just inside the visitors’ box.\n\nChelsea v West Ham: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nHazard went on to reach the penalty spot before dispatching his shot into the corner of the net before Ryan Fredericks, a fifth panicked opponent left littering his vapour trail, could slide in and attempt to suffocate the attempt. “It was something special,” admitted the playmaker through his adrenaline-fuelled post-match beam. “I am small so, when I play against big guys, it is very hard for them to change direction when I run at them.”\n\nThose crumpled West Ham players had been left dizzy by the whole experience, helpless and forlorn. It was a goal to draw the focus, one of the best of his seven-year stint in English football, though, in truth, it did not tell the whole story of his effervescence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eden Hazard proved a constant menace to West Ham throughout the match. Photograph: Tony O’brien/Action Images via Reuters\n\nJust as sumptuous had been the weight and accuracy of his passing, often fizzed from deep beyond full-backs and invariably while on the move. Gonzalo Higuaín, who struck a post, and Callum Hudson-Odoi benefited from the type of delivery Hazard summons at will, and to which the locals now take for granted. Then there was his dribbling, summed up in that initial reward but replicated with regular scurries into enemy territory after the break, a lone blue shirted blur among claret. West Ham charged four players with swarming around him at times in a bid to suppress the threat, but the hosts’ No10 would not be suffocated. Marko Arnautovic resorted to shoulder barging Hazard off the ball in the box, and was fortunate the referee did not deem that a foul.\n\nHis 19th goal of the campaign, dispatched from Ross Barkley’s pass as a pulsating derby entered its final minute, relieved the tension that had been built up by West Ham’s improved display after the interval. The visitors’ newfound aggression – Manuel Lanzini, Felipe Anderson and Aaron Cresswell all came close to an equaliser, while Arnautovic saw a header deflected behind by Emerson – coupled with Chelsea’s profligacy had served to whip up the tension where the hosts’ initial dominance should have driven anxiety from the tie.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nYet Hazard, given the masterclass he had conducted, was never likely to be denied his moment. Chelsea are now third, with momentum restored after three league wins in a little over a week, ahead of Slavia Prague in the Europa League quarter-finals and Sunday’s daunting trip to Liverpool. They will take heart from the Belgian’s presence on Merseyside. The league leaders should be wary.\n\nMaurizio Sarri, of course, was not permitted that chance to ignore the likelihood of his team’s inspiration departing in the summer. Could this club afford to lose a player of his class and calibre? “From a technical point of view, no,” he said. “Not at the moment. It’s impossible to find another Hazard. At the moment there isn’t another Hazard, his level is so high. You’d have to find two players to make the level of Hazard. So I hope Hazard can stay here, otherwise we’ll have to try something different.\n\nWatford in wonderland, Der Klassiker and celebrity black pudding – Football Weekly Read more\n\n“I’m sure the club doesn’t want to sell him. But, of course, we all have to respect his decision. He will be entering the last season of contract and, if he wants to have another experience, we’ll respect that. We’ll try, of course, in any way to convince him [to stay] but it’s not easy.” The Italian suggested £100m would be “too cheap in this market”, with that a message to Real. The Spanish club had hoped to resume negotiations later this week in the belief Chelsea might be driven down towards the £85m they would be happier to pay. That, surely, will prove wishful thinking on their part.\n\nOn this evidence he can still leave Chelsea with Champions League football as a parting gift and with his reputation among their support unaffected. Those in the lower tier of the Matthew Harding stand had unfurled a huge banner depicting Hazard in a trademark knee-sliding celebration prior to kick-off. At some point he will be missed but, for now, irrepressible performances like these are simply to be cherished."}, {"date": "07/04/2019", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39400, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [10], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Digne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Gomes", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Bernard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cenk Tosun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Bernd Leno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sokratis Papastathopoulos", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Matteo Guendouzi", "yellows": [6], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephan Lichtsteiner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Denis Suárez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Just when it seemed Arsenal had discovered the resolve and momentum to propel themselves into next season’s Champions League they reverted to being, well, Arsenal. The old flaws of recent years, particularly weakness in character and defence, resurfaced at Goodison Park to ruin Unai Emery’s hopes of leaving with his team’s grip tightened on third place.\n\nEverton were far more comfortable victors than the scoreline suggests. Phil Jagielka, a late inclusion in Marco Silva’s starting lineup, pounced early to give the home side a third consecutive win and a second in succession at home against a member of the so‑called big six. Silva’s side were dynamic, industrious and resilient in every department as they kept a fifth clean sheet in six outings. Arsenal were found wanting on every count. With one away win in the Premier League since November and only two of their remaining six matches at the Emirates Stadium, the greatest obstacle to their chances of rejoining the European elite is abundantly clear. Yet Emery’s latest attempt to remedy the fault was as ineffectual as his team.\n\nEverton controlled proceedings, with Bernard and André Gomes injecting elegance and class into an industrious afternoon. “I am delighted with everything we did from the first minute,” Silva said. “The desire, the fantastic spirit, and we deserved the three points. We were the best team on the pitch and with more goals it would have been fair. We showed the solid team that I like.”\n\nJagielka was called into the side moments before kickoff after Michael Keane fell ill during the warmup. The 36-year-old has endured a frustrating campaign, suspension, injury and heightened competition restricting him to three league starts, but that was forgotten as he swept Everton into a lead their display richly deserved. The breakthrough reflected much of the opening exchanges – direct and effective by the home side, weak and careless from the visitors.\n\nLucas Digne launched a long throw into the Arsenal penalty area that Jagielka won comfortably. Dominic Calvert-Lewin won the second ball with a diving header that deflected back to the veteran defender and, onside and unmarked, he beat Bernd Leno with a close-range finish. The setback preserved Arsenal’s record of conceding in every league game on the road this season, the only club in England’s top four divisions to do so.\n\nEverton remained comfortable against a lightweight Arsenal midfield of Mohamed Elneny and Matteo Guendouzi. The home side’s work-rate has improved immeasurably, along with their form, and their growing confidence was typified by a lovely back-heel from Bernard that released Gomes and Kurt Zouma performing stepovers during one determined run. Gomes was immaculate in central midfield. Calvert-Lewin is developing as a young centre-forward of promise by the game. Only Richarlison struggled and several inviting situations for a second goal went astray down his right flank.\n\nSilva’s team were given licence to dictate by Emery’s 5-3-2 formation and decision to omit Aaron Ramsey and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from the starting lineup. The introduction of both at the start of the second half, and a switch to 4‑2‑3‑1, was the manager’s admission of his own mistakes. The brittle defending and lack of movement was entirely the responsibility of his players.\n\nArsenal improved as an attacking unit after the interval, and Ramsey could have levelled when Jordan Pickford’s weak punch dropped into his path inside the area. The midfielder’s volley sailed harmlessly over and the chance to wrestle back the initiative went with it. Emery’s side had the occasional moment, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan shooting inches wide of Pickford’s far post, but Everton were the brighter, stronger and more dangerous unit throughout. Only their failure to land a second blow on Arsenal’s glass jaw kept the contest alive.\n\nEverton discipline Jordan Pickford over fracas but he will not lose his place Read more\n\nBernard was presented with a clear run at Leno’s goal when Ainsley Maitland-Niles miscued a header. The angle and the bouncing ball were awkward for the Brazilian, and the Arsenal keeper saved comfortably at close range. Gylfi Sigurdsson, tireless alongside Bernard and Gomes, had several opportunities to convert from well-timed runs into the area. One volley was driven over, a shot from Richarlison’s cutback was straight at Leno and a third effort was blocked by Sokratis Papastathopoulos.

They sit 10 points clear of 18th-placed Cardiff, who have a game in hand, but again played with such a lack of confidence that the gap could narrow over the coming weeks.\n\nBy falling to 13th they also find themselves only two points above Burnley, who at kick-off had appeared at greater risk of losing their Premier League status, after taking the lead then conceding three sloppy goals.\n\nCrystal Palace’s Luka Milivojevic leaves Newcastle looking over their shoulders Read more\n\nThe afternoon began disastrously for Sean Dyche’s side with Ashley Barnes’s early own goal. However, the striker went on to score their third after Chris Wood and Ashley Westwood had given them the half-time lead.\n\nAt the end of October, Howe’s team were challenging for Europe, but with only five victories since then their form has become a significant concern, and the manager said: “I don’t know how many times I’ve got to say that we’re not safe. We had a good start and you thought that was the lift we needed but we didn’t deal well with Burnley’s threats. We came under pressure, the wind was against us and we didn’t deal with it.\n\n“The biggest disappointment for us was the second half. You expected us to pen them in and put them under pressure but that pressure didn’t really come. We made individual mistakes for which we need to take collective responsibility.”\n\nBournemouth received the early gift of an own goal. It was in only the fourth minute when, from a free-kick on the left wing, Ryan Fraser classily curled the ball into the area to Jefferson Lerma, whose header towards Nathan Aké was then headed in by the under-pressure Barnes beyond the diving Tom Heaton and inside the far left post.\n\nBurnley swiftly regrouped. Desperate defending from Nathaniel Clyne gave them a left-wing corner in the 18th minute, and when Westwood then curled the ball towards the back post, his delivery – perhaps aided by the windy conditions – floated high beyond the stranded Asmir Begovic, leaving Wood to routinely nod into a near-open goal.\n\nIt took only a further two minutes for them to then take the lead, after Bournemouth had again offered too little resistance.\n\nWhen the lively Dwight McNeil sent a low cross from the left wing into the area, Chris Mepham’s weak attempt at a clearance went only as far as Westwood, who had the space to shoot first-time with power into the bottom-right corner from near the penalty spot.\n\nThen Charlie Taylor, in possession on the left in the 57th minute and amid protests from the hosts that he had run the ball out of play, crossed towards Begovic, who under pressure from Wood at the near post spilt the ball to the striker, from where he teed up Barnes for the easy finish that secured victory.\n\nIf their present points tally of 36, with five remaining fixtures, is not enough for them to be considered safe Burnley can essentially achieve that ambition with victory next Saturday at home to Cardiff.\n\n“The calmness was key and I was really pleased with that,” Dyche said. “Twenty-four points in 14 games since Christmas, that’s a fantastic return.”\n\nAsked of the latest promising display from McNeil, 19, the Burnley manager responded: “He continues to enjoy the challenge, he continues to enjoy his performances.\n\n“The midfield two were excellent and Westwood is having a fine second half of the season.”"}, {"date": "06/04/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24126, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town",

League’s best strikers. Vardy’s double in the Foxes’ 4-1 win at relegated Huddersfield lifted him level with Gary Lineker in the club’s all-time goalscoring charts on 103.\n\nYouri Tielemans opened the scoring at the John Smith’s Stadium, with Vardy doubling the lead. An Aaron Mooy penalty reduced the arrears but a free-kick from James Maddison and a Vardy spot-kick gave City the win.\n\nRodgers, who has won four straight games after losing his first, said: “Gary was obviously a top‑class striker for many years but it’s been a real joy to work with Jamie, I think from the first evening I met him when I joined. He’s very hungry to improve and get better, and obviously the style of the team and the impression of the team always helps him.\n\nBurnley move eight points clear of drop zone to ease relegation fears Read more\n\n“You’re pressing the game hard when you haven’t got it and you’re creating opportunities. He’s one of the best in this league, he’s already proven that, but he’s shown the hunger to continue with that.”\n\nTielemans’ shot from 20 yards midway through the first half deceived Ben Hamer, who appeared to misjudge the flight of the ball. Huddersfield’s Karlan Grant should have equalised soon after half-time but the striker’s close‑range effort from the substitute Isaac Mbenza’s cross was saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Leicester then made their hosts pay when Vardy showed them how to finish following a similar move, in which the former England striker was on target after Ricardo Pereira’s ball in from the right at the far post.\n\nHuddersfield were thrown a lifeline four minutes later. Caglar Soyuncu was penalised for his clumsy challenge on Grant inside the area and Mooy scored from the penalty spot. The Huddersfield manager, Jan Siewert, then sent on Steve Mounié for Alex Pritchard and the Benin international forced Schmeichel into a brilliant 70th-minute save.\n\nBut the visitors sealed their win in the 79th minute when Maddison curled home a superb free-kick from the left edge of the penalty area after Vardy had been bundled over by Jonathan Hogg. Vardy then picked himself up after being hauled down by Terence Kongolo to score an 84th-minute penalty and was a whisker away from securing a hat-trick when his low, angled shot rolled the wrong side of the post.\n\n“We were really exciting going forward and this was always going to be a tough game for us,” Rodgers added. “Obviously, Huddersfield unfortunately were relegated last week so they would want to come home and show a reaction. We got off to a good start.”\n\nSiewert, who has lost nine of his 10 games as Huddersfield manager, felt the scoreline was harsh on his bottom-of-the-table side. “At the end, yes, it was but I have to give big credit to Leicester because they were more clinical than we were,” Siewert said. “They won the game because from two chances they made two goals. We had our possibilities but this season we have needed too many possibilities to make a goal.”\n\nThe manager said he had learned much about his players since relegation was confirmed by last week’s defeat at Crystal Palace. “I learned a lot, especially this week because I think it was the hardest week for all of us,” Siewert added. “It was hard mentally for the players, and in a way the result is explainable.”"}, {"date": "06/04/2019", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51926, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Martin Dubravka", "yellows": [],

lingering relegation worries in south London and seemed rather out of keeping with the upturned collars and hunched shoulders of Newcastle supporters filing out of the stadium under an intensifying drizzle and darkening sky.\n\nSuch conditions felt rather emblematic of Tyneside’s collective frustration on an afternoon when Rafael Benítez’s side created the better chances yet came undone on the counterattack and were left ruing DeAndre Yedlin’s rash late foul on the ever streetwise Wilfried Zaha, which led to the decisive penalty.\n\nBurnley move eight points clear of drop zone to ease relegation fears Read more\n\nWhen the final whistle blew home frustration reigned; Newcastle are still not immune from Championship football next season and talks over the potential extension of their manager’s soon to be expired contract appear to be going nowhere.\n\n“We had control of the game, we were doing a lot of good things but we made a mistake,” said Benítez, who reported no updates on a contract impasse almost as frustrating as Brexit. “We’re not too close to an agreement. It’s still the same situation.”\n\nBenítez pitted his 3-4-3 system against Roy Hodgson’s 4-3-3 and, at first, Newcastle found Palace’s configuration extremely difficult to fathom. As Andros Townsend, Zaha and their teammates moved the ball fast and fluently, alarming gaps kept opening up in areas the home side seemed unable to defend but then, almost imperceptibly, the balance of power shifted slightly.\n\nIn the course of a high tempo 10-minute spell Newcastle missed three decent chances while highlighting Vicente Guaita’s goalkeeping vulnerabilities. When Guaita dashed off his line and flapped unconvincingly, Matt Ritchie’s miscued shot was deflected wide. Fabian Schär shot over the bar before Palace’s defence failed to clear a cross and Salomón Rondón bundled the ball home only to be, rightly, flagged offside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Salomón Rondón puts the ball in the net from an offside position. Photograph: Craig Doyle/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nSuitably stung by that disallowed effort, Zaha promptly subdued the Gallowgate End courtesy of some audacious, and electric, defender disorientating skill. Yet bewitching as such cameos were Martin Dubravka was not exactly being stretched in goal and it was Newcastle who continued to create - and miss - the more clearcut chances as Rondón discovered that, for all his unconventional eccentricities, Guaita, who made some good saves, quite possibly had magnetic gloves.\n\nJames Tomkins thought he had scored when, following a corner, his fine low shot squirmed beneath Dubravka’s body but that “goal” was also disallowed for offside - this time, against James McArthur.\n\nIf Palace contested that decision, few Newcastle fans would disagree with the rationale behind their manager’s enduring desire to bring Townsend back to Tyneside. Like Zaha, the winger offers Hodgson’s side real edge and menace, providing an exhaustive test of the defensive resilience instilled by Benítez.\n\nSuch solidity has been augmented by Miguel Almirón’s arrival from Atlanta, with the Paraguayan offering Newcastle a new dimension. Although Almirón’s influence was fitful his darting runs and tricky movement helped ensure Palace never assumed control.\n\nJamie Vardy at the double for Leicester in thrashing of Huddersfield Read more\n\nBenítez’s side would have been ahead had either Yedlin’s eye-catching shot not whizzed fractionally off target or Florian Lejeune not headed straight at Guaita. Shortly afterwards Lejeune was taken off on a stretcher with his left leg in a splint and an oxygen mask clamped to his face. The defender – only recently returned from pioneering fast-track surgery in Italy to repair a ruptured cruciate ligament – injured himself tackling Townsend and immediately fell to the floor, his left knee having apparently given way. He was taken straight to hospital. “Lejeune’s injury seems bad,” said Benítez. “It’s the other knee from before but it’s very disappointing.”\n\nDistracted, Newcastle lost concentration and, cued up by Townsend, Christian Benteke missed a sitter when the ball became entangled in his feet. No one looked more relieved than the Palace substitute when Schär erred and Yedlin’s reckless, intervention sent Zaha – whose provocative dribbling had cleverly invited the foul – crashing to the ground in the area and the impressive Luka Milivojevic converted the penalty, sending Dubravka the wrong way.\n\n“It was a very important, hard-fought game and I’m very, very proud of the players,” said Hodgson. “We’re virtually safe now.”"}, {"date": "05/04/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31797, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Angus Gunn", "yellows":

"report": "If this is to be Liverpool’s year, it may be resilience and an admirable ability to bounce back from setbacks within games, rather than a dazzling forward line or stingy defence, that makes the difference. They were rarely at their best on the south coast and even fretted in arrears for a period but, ruthlessly, they still prevailed.\n\nIn time – particularly if that agonising 29-year wait is finally ended next month – they may reflect on this win as having far more significance than merely serving to re-establish a two-point lead over Manchester City in the run-in. Jürgen Klopp would have attempted to spin a positive riposte, no doubt, but dropping points even at a revitalised Southampton would have felt disastrous, surrendering all momentum to the champions.\n\n‘We play our own football’: Klopp praises Liverpool’s resolve after comeback win Read more\n\nInstead, by rallying in a frantic finale, they retained a psychological edge in this hypnotic tussle at the summit and the German was able to indulge in his customary euphoric fist pumps in front of the away contingent at the final whistle. “In the end it’s brilliant,” said Klopp through that familiar grin. “Southampton are outstanding, really tough to play against, brilliantly organised with good players in all positions. Everyone will come here in the future and feel how difficult it is, so that makes this even more satisfying.”\n\nTheir pursuit has long since taken on a relentless nature – no one can match the 16 points they have secured from losing positions in the top flight this season. Liverpool had conceded first to Burnley at Anfield recently. They also suffered potentially damaging equalisers to Fulham and Spurs but on each occasion found a way to emerge victorious.\n\nThis game, against resilient and resurgent opposition, proved no different even if it did drift into the final 10 minutes with the visitors heaving first to clear a corner and then a follow-up centre, before they sprang decisively on the counterattack. The substitute Jordan Henderson’s header propelled them upfield, though it was Mohamed Salah, running from well inside his own half, who in the end punctured Southampton’s optimism.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shane Long gives Southampton an early lead. Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC via Getty Images\n\nThe Egyptian sprinted mercilessly at a backtracking Ryan Bertrand, exposed and alone guarding his own half, before spurning the chance to supply a galloping Roberto Firmino at his side – “Mo Salah could not pass for his goal, so go, go, go...” said Klopp, reliving the moment in his mind – and instead dispatching a glorious shot beyond Angus Gunn from just inside the home side’s penalty area.\n\nLiverpool recover their composure after Southampton’s stinging start Read more\n\nSalah’s 50th Premier League goal, chalked up in a club-record 69 games, was his first since mid-February, ending what he would have considered an eight-game drought. If their most prolific forward is restored to form for the run-in, it will only add to this team’s belief as they consider those domestic challenges still to come. They have only Chelsea and Wolves, both at Anfield, of the top seven still to play. In truth their final five fixtures do not look terribly daunting.\n\nThere were other quirks for them to celebrate. Naby Keïta, who played under Ralph Hasenhüttl at Red Bull Leipzig, leapt to meet Trent Alexander-Arnold’s fine cross nine minutes from the interval to head a first Liverpool goal through Gunn’s attempt to save at the foot of his post. That was an equaliser to ease the nerves – albeit one which relied on an assistant referee missing Salah’s marginal offside in the buildup – though it took the introduction of older heads in Henderson and James Milner just before the hour for the visitors to impose themselves properly on the game. Late on, once their lead had been established, Henderson even surged upfield and tapped home Firmino’s centre for a first goal since September 2017.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Naby Keita heads in the equaliser, his first goal for Liverpool. Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\nSouthampton left deflated, though they will not be downhearted for long. Their revival under Hasenhüttl, from the ugly mish-mash of a side that loitered near the foot of the table under Mauricio Pellegrino and Mark Hughes, has been remarkable. They are unrecognisable these days. The manner in which they unsettled lofty opponents, particularly in the early exchanges, was a reminder that they have unseated Arsenal and Spurs under the Austrian, and tested all comers.\n\nSouthampton 1-3 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nNathan Redmond and Bertrand threatened to overrun Liverpool down their right. It was no surprise that their early advantage was secured from that flank, Bertrand’s cross from deep arcing over an uncertain Joël Matip for the untracked Pierre-Emile Højbjerg to flick on beyond Virgil van Dijk. There loitered Shane Long, with Andrew Robertson distracted by James Ward-Prowse’s run and Keïta slow to react, to collect and convert only his second league goal of the season.\n\nSouthampton had gone over five hours against these opponents without netting – Sadio Mané had actually been their last scorer in this fixture, three years ago – and, had the Irishman not fluffed a finish from another fine Bertrand centre they might have forced themselves further ahead.\n\n“Maybe we scored a little bit too early,” said Hasenhüttl. “Or, if you go 2-0 up, defending as we did today, then you have a chance.” His own side, disciplined and impressive until that frantic final 10 minutes, will surely soon edge themselves clear of trouble."}, {"date": "03/04/2019", "arena": "Stamford Bridge",

The sight of Callum Hudson-Odoi tormenting his markers on a first top-flight start, or Ruben Loftus-Cheek conjuring a goal of such majesty to smooth comfortable victory, surely make it all worthwhile. “We’ve worked all our lives for this chance, years of hard work, and now we start in a Premier League game together,” Loftus-Cheek said, his younger teammate at his side. “That’s so good for the academy.”\n\nThrow in Andreas Christensen, schooled at Brondby but with Chelsea from the age of 15, helping to snuff out Brighton’s rare glimpses of reward and this club could bask in some homegrown cheer. Maurizio Sarri’s apparent reluctance to blood such youthful talent from the start of games this season has contributed to the sense of exasperation undermining his tenure. Yet he finally deemed the time right and the majority could revel in the injection of wide-eyed enthusiasm, pace, strength and no little quality to ensure there was no repeat of the rancour which rained down at Cardiff at the weekend.\n\nKevin De Bruyne slips into gear and drives Manchester City past Cardiff Read more\n\nThis was no PR exercise for Sarri. He had viewed Brighton’s propensity to defend deep and narrow as an opportunity for Hudson-Odoi to isolate a full-back, while Loftus-Cheek is now recovered from the back problems which have frustrated his progress, even if he did depart early with a twinge of a hamstring.\n\nThe selections clearly raised the collective mood, but they also served to remind that these bright young things are more than ready to energise this team. It ended as Chelsea’s most convincing league performance for a month, albeit against opponents apparently torn between the lingering threat of relegation and thoughts of the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on Saturday.\n\nThe visitors were horribly tentative in their attacking approach throughout, their initial defensive discipline eventually eroded and no hint of a revival forthcoming thereafter. Hudson-Odoi had been carried here on his form from Montenegro and that impressive first start for his country, and duly tormented Gaëtan Bong and Solly March.\n\nWhen the latter retired with a tight calf, which will require treatment before Wembley, the teenager tore eagerly into his replacement, Anthony Knockaert, with all the free-spirited energy and incision this team have lacked too often of late. It was his dart beyond the Frenchman seven minutes from the break, and low centre towards the near post, which Olivier Giroud converted with glee.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eden Hazard celebrates scoring his side’s second goal with Callum Hudson-Odoi and N’golo Kanté. Photograph: Chloe Knott - Danehouse/Getty Images\n\nAll of Chelsea’s best opportunities up to then had come from the teenager’s runs down the right, whether Giroud was being denied by Shane Duffy’s point-blank block or forcing the Irishman to slice just wide of his own post. “We bounced back well,” said Hudson-Odoi, as if Chelsea had succumbed in Cardiff rather than prevailed so late. “The manager told me to go and express myself.”\n\nThat he did to startling effect, even putting in a shift defensively to help thwart Brighton on the counterattack, for all that Sarri ended up pulling his leg in the dressing-room about an air-kick at the far post when the teenager had spied a goal of his own.\n\n“I told him that he missed a very easy goal in the first half,” the head coach said through a chuckle. “He smiled, he’s a good boy, but has to stay with his feet on the floor. Now he can risk stopping to improve, thinking that he is a player at 100%, but that’s not true. It’s impossible to be at the top when you are 18. He needs to improve, he can improve, and I want him to improve. He can become one of the best players in Europe.”\n\nSon Heung-min christens new stadium with first Spurs goal in win over Palace Read more\n\nHe is working with one of the best in the world at present. It would have been tempting to decree this a glimpse of Chelsea’s future had Eden Hazard, a player whose desire to move to Real Madrid is an open secret, not supplied the second with a burst of pace to the edge of the area, a swerve away from Lewis Dunk and a whipped finish into the far corner. Not to be outdone, Loftus-Cheek picked up possession three minutes later and opened up his right foot – shades of Dennis Bergkamp at Roker Park 22 years ago, albeit from further out – to place a shot into the far top corner with Mat Ryan utterly helpless.\n\nThey were flashes of brilliance to warm Stamford Bridge’s lowest league crowd of the season, a rearranged midweek fixture probably as much to blame as recent disaffection with the management.

Of the Frenchman who was filmed on a night out until 3.30am on Saturday Guardiola said: “We’ll see tomorrow how he trains. Danilo [another option], it’s not his natural position. We’ll see the decision we will take for the Cup.”\n\nGuardiola retained only Ederson, Kevin De Bruyne, Aymeric Laporte and Zinchenko from the win at Fulham on Saturday, making seven changes which included handing Phil Foden a debut Premier League start. Neil Warnock went the other way, retaining all but Harry Arter – who was replaced by Joe Ralls – from the defeat against Chelsea on Sunday.\n\nCardiff had been quoted as the longest of long outsiders at 30-1 to win this game and within six minutes City showed why. De Bruyne had already opened up the visitors when crossing from the right – Gabriel Jesus should have scored – as he collected along the left and from the tightest of angles smashed the ball past Neil Etheridge. Cardiff’s goalkeeper may have been disappointed to concede from that position but for De Bruyne there was joy in his first league goal of 2019.\n\nAgainst the champions this was the nightmare start for Warnock’s men and it would have been 2-0 if Jesus had anticipated Leroy Sané’s clever pass. It took out Etheridge but the Brazilian was left sliding along the turf rather than connecting. Jesus last started a league game on 14 January and it was showing. With a little extra sharpness the 22‑year‑old might also have scored when presented with the ball in front of goal; this time he struck over.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phil Foden has a shot blocked by Neil Etheridge, who made a series of saves to deny the youngster.

Jesus did better when he broke at the Cardiff defence only for Riyad Mahrez to take over and run into traffic. Guardiola, as he often does, threw his arms in despair. There was a similar gesture from the manager when Jesus – again – missed from close range following De Bruyne’s pull-back from the byline.\n\nCity were in firm control but still only one ahead as the half hour came and went. Their lack of ruthlessness continued: both Foden and Sané took aim and found their radar awry, their efforts missing wide and high. Foden, though, could be pleased with his creative contribution, alongside De Bruyne in central midfield. The 18-year-old decorated his performance with clever touches, sharp passing, driving runs and a willingness to look forward first. However It was Sané who doubled the lead with a lethal first-time finish after Jesus atoned for his profligacy by chesting the ball into his path.\n\nQuick guide Premier League title race: the remaining fixtures Show Hide Manchester City (86 points) 24 Apr Man Utd (a)\n\n28 Apr Burnley (a)\n\n4 May Leicester (h)\n\n12 May Brighton (a) Liverpool (85 points) 21 Apr Cardiff (a)\n\n26 Apr Huddersfield (h)\n\n5 May Newcastle (a)\n\n12 May Wolves (h)\n\nWhen the second half started the question was whether City would pull away from Cardiff as they often do to visiting teams. Laporte was the first to suggest they might, the centre-back racing along the inside-left channel before finding he lacked support from any teammate. This left Guardiola chuntering at Sané and there was further disappointment when Fernandinho slipped in Foden, although this time Etheridge did at least have to make a save.\n\nRuben Loftus-Cheek adds gloss as Chelsea make light work of Brighton Read more\n\nAnother plus for Guardiola was how sharp De Bruyne looked in his second game back since injury. The Belgian was involved in most of the questions City posed Cardiff, on one occasion swinging a ball on to Fernandinho’s head which the midfielder only just failed to finish. Laporte was next to miss with a header, failing to convert Walker’s diagonal from the right when unmarked.\n\nIf a City man could not find the net maybe a Cardiff one could: when De Bruyne drove a cross from the left Sean Morrison nearly stabbed the ball in at the near post. Mahrez, Sané and Foden lined up to take pot-shots but Etheridge made a series of stunning saves, and his right post did the business from a Foden attempt that careered off his shin.\n\nCardiff – briefly – threatened with an Oumar Niasse shot that drew sarcastic cheers from the away fans.

night when their jaw‑dropping new stadium was unveiled was a win: a tonic to re‑energise their faltering push for a top-four finish.\n\nThe nervous excitement crackled, particularly during a helter-skelter first half, and there were times when Daniel Levy, the “big boss” as Mauricio Pochettino had called him on Tuesday, might have given his £1bn kingdom for a goal. Further dropped points were not a part of his script.\n\nThen it happened. The honour of marking this venue’s first goal went to Son Heung-min and, as the tension was lanced among the majority of the 59,215 in attendance – oddly, it was not a full house – it was easy to think there could have been few more popular scorers. It was Son’s 17th of the season and one that will stand the test of time.\n\nSon and hail: Tottenham's new stadium opens in style Read more\n\nWould the stadium boost Spurs or not? There had been no shades of grey. After four defeats and a draw in their previous five Premier League games, they simply had to beat Crystal Palace. Son’s goal soothed them and Christian Eriksen would add a second. To paraphrase Pochettino, this stadium has to have Champions League football. Spurs feel back on track.\n\nPochettino’s message had been to play the game and not the occasion but it was easier said than done. The club have waited so long for this moment – in Levy’s case, it has been practically the duration of his 18-year chairmanship – and it was always going to be emotional.\n\nTake the opening ceremony, for starters, which featured the students of Gladesmore Community School performing Everybody Dreams. They first produced it in 2012 – one year on from the riots that were sparked in this area – and it is meant to serve as an anthem of hope for the young people of Tottenham.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fireworks are seen during the opening ceremony of the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium prior to Spurs’ victory over Crystal Palace. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nWhen Lanya Matthews, a former Gladesmore student, who appeared on last year’s X Factor, belted out the vocals, she advertised not only her incredible talent but the upscale acoustics inside the bowl. Flags fluttered and there were even fireworks before kick-off.\n\nJames Tomkins, the Palace defender, described the ceremony as “not ideal”. He added: “It goes on a bit and it’s a bit surreal.” Goodness knows what was going through the minds of the Spurs players. No pressure, then.\n\nIt was frenzied at the outset, best summed up by Son winning a corner and then turning to the crowd to whip them up some more. Pochettino’s starting 4-4-2 set-up had a new-build feel, with Dele Alli in a deep central midfield role and Danny Rose at left midfield. Jeffrey Schlupp ran through in the third minute to thrash a shot off target for Palace – a good chance wasted – and, from a Spurs point of view, it was imperative to settle the anxiety.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nPalace have a better record away than at home this season and there were no surprises about how Roy Hodgson set up. He prioritised solidity and keeping the space between the lines to a minimum. His team defended resolutely until Son’s goal. Hodgson complained his players found the pitch a little slippery and he just wished they could have maintained the 0-0 for another 10 minutes or so.\n\nSpurs pressed on to the front foot, adrenaline coursing through their systems, desperate to find the breakthrough. They were too desperate, at times. Witness Jan Vertonghen’s 40-yard shot, which was blocked, after 31 minutes. Harry Kane also grabbed a free-kick on the edge of the area and messed it up; should he have left it for Eriksen?\n\nThe home side camped in the Palace half before the interval and they created chances but too often they snatched at them or made the wrong choices. Rose looked for Kane when he ought to have shot. The closest the hosts came in the first half was when Vicente Guaita saved from Eriksen.\n\n‘Tonight we touched glory’: Pochettino on Spurs’ perfect start at new stadium Read more\n\nOver in one corner of the lower tier, the Palace fans chanted their songs without pause and there were periods when their voices were the only ones that hung in the chilly night air. The home crowd implored and fretted at various times. Where was the goal that they craved?\n\nThey got it on 55 minutes and if Son’s shot from the edge of the area took a helpful deflection off Luka Milivojevic, Spurs were not complaining. Eriksen had started the move when he robbed the Serb. Moments earlier, Michy Batshuayi had bent a shot narrowly wide of Hugo Lloris’s far post but now the occasion was transformed.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nKane curled over from Alli’s pass and the Spurs striker was central to the second goal. Initially, it appeared that he had been fouled by James McArthur – he had not – and everybody stopped. Eriksen did not and swept home.\n\nPalace pushed, with Lloris denying Patrick van Aanholt and Wilfried Zaha, while the substitute Christian Benteke headed wide in between. It was too little, too late. Guaita would deny another substitute, Lucas Moura, at the very end but, by then, Spurs had what they craved.\n\n• The headline on this story was amended on 4 April 2019 to remove an inappropriate use of the word “christen”."}, {"date": "02/04/2019", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 17301, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Masina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ken Sema", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Domingos Quina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Rico", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxime Le Marchand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Ream", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André-Frank Zambo Anguissa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cairney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Joe Bryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Babel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin McDonald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neeskens Kebano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timothy Fosu-Mensah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jean Seri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Another one bites the dust. Three days after Huddersfield’s fate was sealed, Fulham fell to the defeat that means they too will be relegated at the end of the season. For an hour they held their own, threatening to add to the miserable haul of two points with which they have rewarded their away following over the campaign, but after Watford took the lead for the second time with just over an hour played what had been something of a trial for the home side became an exercise in Wembley confidence-boosting.\n\nScott Parker admits Fulham ‘don’t have the nous’ after relegation confirmed Read more\n\nThe catalyst, for Watford’s third home game in a row, was Andre Gray. Having come off the bench to score winning goals against Everton and Leicester, this time he was provider and all-round menace, setting up the third and fourth as Watford threatened to turn what was already a dispiriting occasion for Fulham into a humiliation.\n\nThe result extends Fulham’s run of consecutive defeats to nine and there have been 13 in their last 14 games in all competitions. But for Sergio Rico, who saved well from José Holebas, Abdoulaye Doucouré and Gray himself as Watford searched for a fifth goal, the final score could have been considerably worse.\n\nWatford head into Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final with their morale healthily buoyed – even if their opponents, Wolves, will hardly be dispirited after their victory over Manchester United. But such an outcome looked unlikely during a first half in which the home side’s performance was for the most part lamentable.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fulham fans try to keep their spirits up at Vicarage Road. Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nWithin 10 minutes the away fans were lustily olé-ing every pass as Fulham dominated possession, and suggesting in somewhat crude terms that the fact that Aleksandar Mitrovic, back in the team after a stomach injury, had a headed effort – however wide it went – reflected poorly on their opponents.\n\nBut in this early period, when they needed luck it was absent, and when they needed quality that was missing as well. Ben Foster blasted a clearance into Mitrovic but the ball rebounded to a defender; the same player skewed a weak effort wide after André-Frank Zambo Anguissa had nicely pilfered the ball from an opponent’s toe in midfield; Ryan Sessegnon’s technique failed him when Ryan Babel lifted a lovely pass into his path.\n\nThen Watford scored. The closest they had come had been when Roberto Pereyra’s lovely turn on the edge of the area in the 16th minute allowed him to surge into space before shooting into a defender. The Argentinian was also involved in the goal seven minutes later, letting Will Hughes’s pass run through his legs and giving Doucouré room to burst into the area and drive a left-footed shot into the net.\n\nFulham were not deflated and for the remainder of the half only they truly threatened. The equaliser was a demonstration of all the worst traits the home side were exhibiting in this period: no Watford player so much as contested Foster’s goalkick and, after Zambo Anguissa’s header was worked to Babel, via Mitrovic and Sessegnon, Adrian Mariappa helpfully fell over, allowing the Dutchman to take the ball around Foster and slot into an empty net.\n\nBoos rang out as the players left the field at the interval, with Javi Gracia’s displeasure evident in his decision to instruct Daryl Janmaat and Gray to spend the break warming up before replacing Pereyra and the tricky but ineffective Gerard Deulofeu. It took Janmaat only two minutes to make an impact, though when he did it was to Tom Cairney’s knee; Gray, meanwhile, set about turning the game.\n\nIf Watford did not immediately threaten to dismiss their opponents with overwhelming quality, their passing was at least less risible. Gray added pace and urgency to the attack and for the first time the elementary errors that dogged Fulham’s defeat to Manchester City at the weekend returned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Will Hughes (centre) is congratulated on restoring Watford’s lead. Photograph: Nigel French/PA\n\nWatford had only vaguely threatened another goal, Rico turning Holebas’s deflected cross over the bar before Gray’s long-range drive deflected wide, before they retook the lead. Maxime Le Marchand headed a Watford corner to the edge of the area, where Doucouré and Hughes competed with each other for an unchallenged volley. The Englishman won the duel and smashed an irresistible shot past Rico and into the roof of the net.\n\nFulham’s resolve, which had held up impressively after the first goal, completely crumbled. Gray set up easy finishes for the unmarked Troy Deeney and the insultingly ignored Kiko Femenía – with Doucouré again losing a battle with a teammate for the right to administer the coup de grâce. Watford scored three times in 12 minutes and could have had as many more again, and though Sessegnon and the substitute Jean Michaël Seri had chances, all Fulham got was misery.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nGracia said: “The game was very tough in the first half.

Only 17 days after being dumped out of the FA Cup quarter-finals by Nuno Espírito Santo’s increasingly impressive team, Manchester United suffered a defeat that could have severe ramifications for their hopes of finishing in the top four.\n\nA match that could not have got off to a better start, after Scott McTominay scored in only 13 minutes, ended with a third defeat in four matches and Solskjær’s first since he was appointed the club’s permanent manager. That United were their own worst enemies compounded his sense of frustration.\n\n‘We created our own downfall,’ says Manchester United’s Solskjær Read more\n\nA mistake by Fred gifted Wolves their equaliser, Ashley Young was sent off for two bookable offences – Mike Dean, the referee, wasting no time in brandishing his 100th Premier League red card – and Chris Smalling scored an own goal. Throw in the fact United squandered a host of decent opportunities – Solskjær was not exaggerating when he said they could have been 3-0 up – and this will go down as a match he will want to forget.\n\nWolves, in contrast, will cherish another memorable victory. They have taken 13 points from the top-six clubs this season and this win seemed particularly special given it came hot on the heels of their triumph over the same opponents in the FA Cup last month. “Can we play you every week,” chanted the Wolves supporters.\n\nIt certainly felt like the perfect preparation for Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Watford at Wembley, when the Wolves players will arrive with a spring in their step, in particular Raúl Jiménez and Diogo Jota, who combined for the first goal and are forming quite a double act up front. “The partnership is very good – the more time they spend together, things come out,” Nuno said. “Mutual knowledge is important.”\n\nQuick guide Mike Dean's century of red cards Show Hide Mike Dean’s first Premier League red card was dished out to Newcastle’s Nolberto Solano in their 1-0 defeat to Ipswich in April 2001, and his 100th went to Ashley Young for a second yellow card in the 2-1 loss at Wolves. It was Young’s second Premier League dismissal – his first was also by Dean, for Aston Villa in January 2009. Main offenders In addition to Young, Dean has sent five other players off twice: Andrew Cole (Fulham and Man City), Fernando Torres (Chelsea), Laurent Koscielny (Arsenal), Mike Williamson (Newcastle) and Richard Dunne (Man City). Reds for the blues The teams with the most Mike Dean dismissals are Chelsea and Manchester City, with nine each: Chelsea & Man City 9 Newcastle 7 Arsenal 6 Stoke, Spurs & West Brom 5 Premier League hat-tricks Dean has shown two red cards in 12 different league games, and has twice shown three reds in one match:\n\nWest Brom 1-1 Fulham (Diop, Clement, Cole) Sep 2004\n\nMan City 1-2 Spurs (Fernandes, Dunne, Assou-Ekotto) Nov 2008 In total, Dean has sent 94 players from 33 different teams for an early bath. 51 of his century were straight reds; 49 were for second yellows. 2018-19 has been his busiest season yet, with 10 dismissals. The Wirral official sent off nine players in 2007-08 and 2015-16. Aside from his first two seasons, 2010-11 saw his lowest total with two.

Despite the absence of Marcus Rashford, who was ruled out with an ankle injury, United started superbly, with Jesse Lingard’s attempt to take on the Wolves team straight from kick-off – he skipped past several challenges before shooting tamely at Rui Patrício – a sign of things to come.\n\nMcTominay’s goal was the least they deserved for their dominance in the first 20 minutes. Romelu Lukaku met Diogo Dalot’s right-wing cross with a powerful header from six yards that Patrício kept out with an instinctive save, while Lingard, who seemed to have the freedom of the penalty area, later saw an attempt to nod the ball into the far corner beaten away by the Wolves goalkeeper.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ashley Young caught Diogo Jota with a high challenge to earn a second yellow card. Photograph: Sky Sports\n\nPatrício, however, could do nothing about McTominay’s goal. A clutch of Wolves players were drawn to Fred, expecting him to shoot after Lingard had picked him out in space, but instead the Brazilian smartly offloaded the ball to McTominay and he drilled a low 25 yard-shot that flew through Willy Boly’s legs and into the far corner.\n\nUnited seemed to outwit Wolves tactically during that bright opening. Solskjær had decided to deploy Young as a right-sided centre-half in a three-man defence, and United were controlling the midfield area as well as causing plenty of problems with crosses from wide positions. It was Lukaku’s delivery that picked out Lingard for that gilt-edged chance.\n\nThat was a reprieve for Wolves and one that seemed to spark them into life as the complexion of the game changed midway through the first half. They were beginning to look more menacing just before Fred’s critical error. David de Gea passed out from the back and João Moutinho pounced after a loose first touch by the United midfielder. Leander Dendoncker then shifted the ball on to Jiménez, who played a lovely pass with the outside of his boot to set Jota free. Played onside by Young, Jota beat De Gea with the minimum of fuss. The Portuguese has scored or assisted a goal in his last seven Premier League matches at Molineux.\n\nIn an open and entertaining game, chances came and went at both ends thereafter. Dendoncker wastefully lifted the ball over from the edge of the six-yard box for Wolves, while Lukaku screwed a low shot narrowly wide and McTominay saw a diving header clawed away by Patrício.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nYoung’s dismissal followed shortly after that McTominay chance and the former England international could have no complaints. His studs were showing and the boot was high as he followed through on Jota after initially making contact with the ball.\n\nAlthough United coped reasonably well with their numerical disadvantage for a period, they were undone when they failed to deal with Moutinho’s floated centre. Jiménez challenged Phil Jones, the ball squirted off Dendoncker and with De Gea stranded, Smalling nudged the ball over the line with a hand. Ivan Cavaleiro almost made it 3-1 in injury time when he thundered a shot against the bar."}, {"date": "01/04/2019", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59869, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Bernd Leno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sokratis Papastathopoulos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [59], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [30], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Matteo Guendouzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Denis Suárez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edward Nketiah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Martin Dubravka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Lejeune", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Isaac Hayden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Almirón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoshinori Muto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It does not feel that long ago that Arsenal trailed Tottenham by 10 points. What a turnaround there has been. This was a hard-fought victory over a Newcastle team who made a game of it in the second half but, when the dust had settled, the table showed Unai Emery’s team had leapfrogged two points clear of Spurs and Manchester United into third place.\n\nAaron Ramsey fired Arsenal into a deserved first-half lead and, although Newcastle pushed, they did not threaten Bernd Leno’s goal. Alexandre Lacazette made the points safe with a perfectly executed lob and it added up to a 10th league win in succession at the Emirates Stadium. Not since the 1997-98 title-winning season have Arsenal managed that. “Are you watching Tottenham?” sang the home support.\n\nArsenal 2-0 Newcastle United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nArsenal play five of their remaining seven games away from home where they have been far less impressive but right now the momentum in the top-four battle is with them. In terms of the broader picture in this first season under Emery, one detail screamed for attention. The club have made it to 63 points, which was their final tally under Arsène Wenger last time out. The sense of progress is plain.\n\nRafael Benítez came to contain as he always does in away matches against the top teams. The plan worked in so far as Arsenal did not enjoy the volume of opportunities they might have hoped for. Up until Lacazette’s late goal Newcastle were still in it. There were murmurings of frustration from the Arsenal fans.\n\nThe statistics showed Newcastle managed only one shot on target – from Salomón Rondón in the 32nd minute, which Leno saved with a measure of comfort at the near post. Despite pressing higher up the pitch after half-time they could not prise Arsenal apart. The final pass was routinely missing. Newcastle’s dismal recent record in London continues while Benítez has not won at the Emirates in eight attempts with various clubs.\n\nEmery talked up the collective, as usual. He was without the injured Laurent Koscielny and Granit Xhaka while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was fit enough only for the bench, having struggled with a high temperature. But the manager found the solutions, with Ramsey stepping up to wear the captain’s armband with distinction until he was forced off with cramp. The midfielder will be a loss when he joins Juventus in the summer. Aubameyang, meanwhile, came on as a substitute to create Lacazette’s goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aaron Ramsey slots the ball past Martin Dubravka for Arsenal’s opener. Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images\n\nBenítez commented on how Emery could summon a £56m striker from the bench and what he left unsaid hung heavily in the air. He craves greater backing in the market from the Newcastle owner, Mike Ashley, so he might go toe to toe with the opposition on occasions such as these but there does not seem any prospect of that. And so Benítez plays the percentages; keeping men behind the ball, trying to get something on the break.\n\nRamsey thought he had scored before he actually did. In the 13th minute he swept home at the far post after Sead Kolasinac had flicked on Mesut Özil’s corner only for the whistle to blow. The replays showed Sokratis Papastathopoulos had pulled back Florian Lejeune by the sleeve. File it under soft.\n\nRamsey was not to be denied and he made his own luck for the breakthrough, passing to Lacazette and darting for the return. His teammate could not provide it but the ball broke off DeAndre Yedlin and fell to Ramsey, who threaded a low shot into the far corner.\n\nWacky races, Celtic's surge and the fall of Huddersfield – Football Weekly Read more\n\nArsenal were urged on by Emery’s manic preachings from the technical area and they went close to a second goal in first-half added time. The marauding Kolasinac crossed for Lacazette and, when he pivoted to shoot, Martin Dubravka was beaten. Matt Ritchie, however, headed off the line.\n\nBenítez asked his wide players, Ayoze Pérez and Miguel Almirón, to push a little higher in the second half, to get themselves closer to Rondón, and Newcastle gained a foothold. At 1-0 they knew one moment could change everything. It did not come. Aubameyang was denied by Dubravka but there was nothing the goalkeeper could do to keep out Lacazette, after Jamaal Lascelles had misjudged Aubameyang’s through header to the striker.\n\nEmery reflected on how Arsenal had risen from the depths. “We lost our first two matches of the season to Manchester City and Chelsea and so we started last,” he said.\n\n“Now we are third. Our target is very clear but we know it’s going to be very difficult. We now need to convince everybody we can be consistent away from home.”"}, {"date": "31/03/2019", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 32657, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup":

Yet everything changed in the blink of an eye, first through Azpilicueta’s hugely controversial goal and then, with the game in the first minute of injury-time, via a header from Ruben Loftus-Cheek, the Chelsea substitute. “Soul destroying,” said Warnock afterwards.\n\nChelsea, make no mistake, got out of jail here, especially their manager. Sarri’s side were desperately poor for so much of this game and the mood among the travelling supporters was mutinous. “We want Sarri out” reverberated loud and clear time and again. “Fuck Sarri-ball” was chanted as early as the 33rd minute and that was swiftly followed by “Super Frank Lampard”.\n\nThere was plenty more where that came from and it is no exaggeration to say that before Azpilicueta scored, it felt as though Sarri could be on the brink of being sacked. His decision to rest Eden Hazard, who was brought on shortly after Victor Camarasa had put Cardiff ahead with a lovely first-time volley at the start of the second half, felt like a strange one to say the least and it was another disappointing afternoon for Callum Hudson-Odoi, who never got off the bench.\n\nFew of those who did start the game emerged with any credit and for long periods it was hard to see what Chelsea were trying to do. There was no real pattern to their play, certainly no tempo to it, and it was nigh on impossible to see where a goal was going to come from. Indeed, Chelsea had registered only one short on target before Azpilicueta scored.\n\nEverything felt so slow and pedestrian, in particular in midfield. Jorginho, whose only notable contribution was to pick up a yellow card for a cynical foul on Josh Murphy, was withdrawn and replaced by Loftus-Cheek, and it is still hard to recognise what Mateo Kovacic brings to this Chelsea team. The way things are going, similar questions will soon be asked of Gonzalo Higuaín.\n\nThe patience of the Chelsea fans was stretched to breaking point after Camarasa scored. Harry Arter, who must have covered close to every blade of grass in the centre of the Cardiff midfield, whipped a low cross into the Chelsea area. Stood about 16 yards out, Camarasa connected beautifully with a first-time volley that was still rising as it flew past Kepa Arrizabalaga. It was the Spaniard’s fifth league goal of the season and provided the cue for the Chelsea supporters to call for Sarri to be dismissed.\n\nCardiff felt that they should have had a penalty shortly after that breakthrough. Antonio Rüdiger had hold of Sean Morrison’s arm, but Pawson dismissed the home appeals, just as he did in the first half, when the Cardiff captain appeared to have his shirt pulled by Marcos Alonso. There had also been an earlier incident in the Cardiff penalty area, when Aron Gunnarsson looked to be holding Rüdiger. Once again, Pawson was unmoved.\n\nThe major talking point, though, came late. Willian’s corner was flicked on at the near post by Alonso for Azpilicueta, stood inside the six yard-box and clearly offside, to head past Neil Etheridge. Somehow, the goal was allowed to stand – Eddie Smart, the assistant referee at that end of the pitch is believed to have had his view blocked by Willian – and Chelsea were not finished there. Another Willian cross, this time to the back post, was met by Loftus-Cheek, who nipped in front of Lee Peltier to break Cardiff hearts.\n\nCardiff City v Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Replays showed that César Azpilicueta was in an offside position when scoring the equaliser for Chelsea.

Liverpool were a few minutes of stoppage-time away from a result that – who knows? – could have been a grievous setback. But then the ball was aimed high towards Mohamed Salah at the far post and what happened next, put bluntly, changed everything.\n\nSuddenly it did not seem quite so important that Salah had played so far below his point of maximum expression. Hugo Lloris, who can be surprisingly error-prone for a World Cup-winning goalkeeper, had not been able to hold on to his header. The ball came off his hands, bounced against Toby Alderweireld, the nearest defender, and started trickling towards the goal-line, almost in slow motion.\n\nLiverpool 2-1 Tottenham: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAlderweireld still had the opportunity to save himself but, in his desperation to recover, he managed only to stub his toe into the ground and kick at fresh air. How important might this own goal be for Liverpool in their attempts to see off Manchester City at the top of the Premier League? It was the same goal where Jordan Pickford had presented Liverpool with a stoppage-time goal wrapped in blue ribbons during the Merseyside derby. And, again, it finished with the now-familiar sight of Jürgen Klopp pumping his fists and flashing those expensive-looking teeth in front of the Kop.\n\nEvery team that finishes as champions needs a bit of luck along the way and Liverpool certainly had it here, bearing in mind the additional drama a few minutes earlier when Moussa Sissoko and Son Heung-min sprung a two-on-one breakaway. Fortunately for Liverpool the one they had back was Virgil van Dijk, who concluded it would be better to let Sissoko take aim and blocked out the pass rather than going for the tackle. It was a brilliant decision. Sissoko’s shot was wild and high when, at that stage, another goal for Spurs would have left City with an opportunity to go four points clear by winning their game in hand, at home to Cardiff City, on Wednesday.\n\nQuick guide Five moments that make you think it could be Liverpool's year Show Hide 29 September: Chelsea 1-1 Liverpool Trailing at Stamford Bridge to Eden Hazard’s first-half goal a few days after losing to Maurizio Sarri’s side in the Carabao Cup, substitute Daniel Sturridge curled in from an unlikely angle in the 89th minute to maintain Liverpool’s unbeaten start to the season 7 October: Liverpool 0-0 Manchester City With both sides level on points at the top of the table, City were awarded a penalty in the 84th minute at Anfield after Virgil van Dijk brought down Leroy Sané. But with regular taker Sergio Agüero off the pitch, Riyad Mahrez shrugged off the claims of Gabriel Jesus before sending his spot kick over the bar. 2 December: Liverpool 1-0 Everton The Merseyside derby seemed to be heading for a stalemate until Jordan Pickford’s inexplicable mistake in the 96th minute allowed substitute Divock Origi to bundle the ball over the line. The victory kept Liverpool two points behind leaders Manchester City. 17 January: Liverpool 4-3 Crystal Palace Pegged back to 2-2 by James Tomkins with just 25 minutes to play, Liverpool were grateful for Julián Speroni’s moment of madness as the veteran goalkeeper - making his first Premier League appearance since December 2017 - gifted a goal to Mohamed Salah before Sadio Mané ensured Jürgen Klopp’s side stayed four points clear at the top. 31 March: Liverpool 2-1 Tottenham The visitors had passed up three opportunities to take the lead when a mix-up between Hugo Lloris and Toby Alderweireld in the 90th minute saw the ball trickle over the line off the Belgium defender’s shin – the third time this season a goalkeeping error at the Kop end has contributed to a Liverpool win. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Offside\n\nNo wonder Anfield celebrated as it did when Alderweireld’s misfortune meant a very different scenario: Liverpool two points clear. For Klopp and his players, it was almost imperative they won this second-versus-third encounter. More than that they needed to demonstrate they were in the right frame of mind for whatever comes next. They managed to do that, eventually – but, boy, they toyed with the emotions of their supporters before everything fell into place. Until that point the second half, for Liverpool, was shaping up to become an ordeal.\n\nAs for Salah, the irony is that he, more than anyone, seemed to be afflicted by what this means for Liverpool and the responsibility, perhaps, that falls on himself. Salah has not scored for eight games, which represents his longest drought in Liverpool’s colours by some distance. If anything, he seemed too keen to put that right, meaning there was a hint of desperation about his play, especially in those moments after Lucas Moura had turned in a 70th-minute equaliser for Spurs. As it turned out, Salah still managed to have a decisive role. Once the jubilation subsides, however, the point remains: if Liverpool are to win the league for the first time since 1990, they desperately need him to get whatever is troubling him out of his system.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roberto Firmino heads home Liverpool’s opening goal against Tottenham. Photograph: Alex Dodd - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images\n\nNot that it particularly mattered in the first half when, as Andrew Robertson put it afterwards, Liverpool “blew away” their opponents – not least because Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool’s other full-back, were often operating as auxiliary wingers. It was such a problem for Spurs that Lucas, who was primarily playing as Harry Kane’s strike partner, spent long spells doubling up as a left-sided midfielder to restrict the space for Alexander-Arnold. Still, though, the right-back took it on himself to have a prominent role in Liverpool’s attack while, on the other side, it was Robertson’s inclination to do likewise, 16 minutes in, that led to Roberto Firmino heading in the opening goal.\n\nRobertson’s delivery was so inviting it would have been almost impertinent for the Brazilian to pass up the chance. Lloris was at fault to some degree again with a poorly aimed kick that was intercepted by Georginio Wijnaldum inside the Tottenham half, and Kieran Trippier committed the full-back’s sin of standing off Robertson, allowing the left-back to line up the trajectory of his cross without anybody closing him down. Firmino had found a gap between two of the opposition’s three centre-halves. Robertson’s cross picked him out superbly and Firmino flashed his header past Lloris.\n\nBad as Tottenham’s record is on this ground, with only one win now in the last 25 visits, Mauricio Pochettino’s side needed only a draw to register their best points total from the Premier League era after 31 matches played.\n\nLiverpool 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur: player ratings from Anfield Read more\n\nThey could also be encouraged by some erratic moments from Alisson. Yet it must have been concerning for Pochettino that his players could not do more in the first half to examine the Liverpool goalkeeper. Dele Alli was not influencing the game in the way that would usually be expected of him. The same applied to Christian Eriksen and it was rare to see Harry Kane being so ineffective. Something had to change and Pochettino acted at half-time by instructing Danny Rose to take up a more advanced position, with Jan Vertonghen taking up the left-back role. Pochettino, serving his touchline ban, was in contact with his coaching staff via a mobile telephone from the stand and, if nothing else, he saw a significant improvement from his team. Still, though, this is their worst run of results under his management.\n\nThe equaliser for Spurs came after a quickly taken free-kick from Kane out to Trippier on the right. Trippier played the ball inside to Eriksen, who did the same, albeit with a miscue, for Lucas to run in and score from eight yards.\n\nAfter that Liverpool had to go for a winner, knowing a draw was not enough for their ambitions, and that explains why they were so open at the back during a nerve-shredding finale. Sissoko let them off the hook and then, finally, the ball was aimed towards Salah – and the 18-times league champions had their biggest stroke of luck yet."}, {"date": "30/03/2019", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 25001, "home_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Rico", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timothy Fosu-Mensah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxime Le Marchand", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Floyd Ayité", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "André-Frank Zambo Anguissa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cairney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Babel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin McDonald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neeskens Kebano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Vietto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [5], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arijanet Muric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This felt almost like a box-ticking exercise for a team as sublime as Manchester City. There was never any jeopardy against opponents with all the snarl and knowhow of a sleeping kitten. It was simply a case of getting the job done and moving on to the next one for City, who did not have to do much more than tickle Fulham’s tummy to return to the Premier League’s summit before Liverpool host Tottenham on Sunday afternoon.\n\nFootball’s final furlong: our writers predict how the season will finish Read more\n\nIf there was a concern, it was that Sergio Agüero had to make way for Gabriel Jesus after complaining of a minor injury early in the second half.\n\nYet Pep Guardiola did not sound particularly worried when he said that City’s leading scorer went off only as a precautionary measure. Agüero, who will be assessed on Sunday, had already scored his 29th goal of the season by the time he took his seat on the bench and it spoke volumes that Guardiola devoted more time to discussing the weather, noting that it was strange to see the sun shining for the first time in seven months.\n\nAccording to City’s manager, the warm conditions posed a genuine threat to his side’s chances of moving a point above Liverpool. Yet the champions barely had to break sweat to deal with Fulham, who must rank as one of the worst sides to grace the Premier League.\n\nThe gulf in class was captured by the Cottagers failing to muster a shot on target at home for the first time since 2010. Yet it would be unfair to dwell on Scott Parker becoming the first manager in their history to lose his first four matches. Parker inherited a mess from Claudio Ranieri last month and the west Londoners, who are 16 points below 17th-placed Burnley with six games left, have been destined to return to the Championship for a long time.\n\n“I want the players to show what they can do,” Fulham’s caretaker manager said. “At times we have shown glimpses. It’s a tough season and I’ve been given the reins. It’s difficult.”\n\nFulham, timid and ineffective in their 5-4-1 system, had intended to frustrate Guardiola’s illustrious attack by staying tight and compact. The problem with that ploy, however, was that Parker’s players were riddled with anxiety even on the rare occasions when they had possession and City had to wait only five minutes to puncture the leakiest defence in the division.\n\nUnable to cope with City’s high press, Fulham were punished for trying to play out from the back when Timothy Fosu-Mensah’s errant pass went to Kevin De Bruyne. Bad idea. De Bruyne, playing for the first time since 2 March after shaking off a hamstring injury, found Agüero, who looked right and saw Bernardo Silva. The Portugal midfielder cut inside and fizzed a crisp drive inside the right post from 20 yards.\n\n“The way we started was amazing,” Guardiola said. “The first 15 minutes was incredible. We showed our focus. Seven games left for the Premier League, and it’s easy: we have to win every game to be champions.”\n\nFulham, bereft of belief, were horribly out of their depth in the face of such intensity and desire. They looked like crumbling every time City attacked and were fortunate not to concede a penalty when Fosu-Mensah, who had a shocking game in central defence, clattered into Raheem Sterling in the 30th minute.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernardo Silva celebrates after giving Manchester City a 1-0 lead after five minutes. Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside/Getty Images\n\nKevin Friend’s refusal to point to the spot was only a minor irritation for City given that they had doubled their lead three minutes earlier. Once again Fulham were punished for their sloppiness, Joe Bryan’s miscued pass giving the superb Silva the chance to free Agüero, who swept past the woeful Maxime Le Marchand before lifting a lovely shot over the advancing Sergio Rico.\n\nResigned to their fate, Fulham had no threat without the injured Aleksandar Mitrovic leading their attack. Even a protest about expensive ticket prices in the 55th minute lacked any real spark.\n\nCity might come to regret that their goal difference after an afternoon of total dominance is only eight better than Liverpool’s. De Bruyne scuffed straight at Rico after bursting through what passed for Fulham’s defence. Ilkay Gündogan whipped a venomous effort over. Sterling threatened with a bouncing effort.\n\nYet that was a minor quibble.

going to the plan that Southampton put in place when they appointed the Austrian in December.\n\nThey were a rabble back then, with nine points from their first 14 matches of the season. This win took them closer to safety with a tally of 33 points, the same as Brighton, who, in addition to figuring out a way to get past Manchester City in next Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final, must be wary of slipping into the bottom three.\n\nDwight McNeil strikes to seal crucial Burnley victory over Wolves Read more\n\nHasenhüttl switched from his usual formation with three centre-backs to a back four and his team took charge from the start. Their goal in the 53rd minute could have come straight from a textbook on gegenpressing.\n\nPierre-Emile Højbjerg started the move by winning the ball in midfield, passing it on and charging forward. The impressive Stuart Armstrong fed Nathan Redmond, who slipped it into the path of Højbjerg, who, having darted into the box, poked the ball over the advancing goalkeeper from eight yards.\n\n“When we won the ball it was the perfect opportunity we had been waiting for,” Hasenhüttl said.\n\nSouthampton played as a swarm, buzzing around their opponents in an attacking shape that was as difficult to define as they were to repel. But Brighton under Chris Hughton have never been ashamed to defend in numbers at home and they gave Southampton little room to manoeuvre. The visitors would need to be fast and precise to break through and at first that looked to be beyond them.\n\nBrighton recorded the first shot, Alireza Jahanbakhsh sending a bobbly effort wide from the edge of the area. Too often, however, Brighton’s counterattacks unravelled because one of their players, usually Anthony Knockaert or Dale Stephens, did not release the ball fast enough. Glenn Murray was barely involved.\n\nSouthampton were more incisive, except when it came to making the final cut. Redmond forced a save from Mat Ryan after shuffling his way past Martin Montoya and letting fly. Danny Ings was foiled by a fine block by Bernardo da Silva.\n\nTwo minutes later Knockaert had to make a similar intervention to foil Redmond after a defence-splitting pass by Højbjerg.\n\nHuddersfield relegated after Milivojevic puts Crystal Palace on way to win Read more\n\nSouthampton were starting to stretch their hosts and Lewis Dunk had to make a block from Armstrong, while Redmond fired wide.\n\n“They were the better team in the first half,” said Hughton, who must have been relieved to have his team come in level.\n\nBrighton did not come out any more dynamic or inspired and Southampton did not stop pestering them. So it was no shock when the visitors took the lead in the 53rd minute.\n\n“Unfortunately it took the goal against us to turn our fortunes around with regard to our level of performance,” said Hughton.\n\nBrighton needed to perk up, but instead Southampton caused more alarm with a flowing attack just before the hour, Dunk having to make a panicked clearance off the line.\n\nNot until the last 20 minutes did Brighton show any teeth. In the 70th minute Shane Duffy retrieved a long cross by Knockaert and passed it back to Montoya, whose shot bounced out off the bar. Soon afterwards Brighton appealed in vain for a penalty after Davy Pröpper went down while trying to pounce on a cross spilled by Angus Gunn.\n\nBrighton forced the visitors to defend for the remainder of the match, something Southampton did as if their Premier League lives depended on it.\n\n“We do not feel really safe yet,” said Hasenhüttl. “Other teams are winning too.”"}, {"date":

Wolverhampton, just as his first one had in 2012. As Wolves are no longer the mid-table Championship opponents who turned up seven years ago this victory gave Dyche even more satisfaction, especially as it ended a run of four straight defeats and should go a long way to easing any relegation fears.\n\n“Obviously, my first win was important but I wasn’t flavour of the month back then,” said the manager who now has a pub named after him outside the ground. “We didn’t see a lot of the ball but we did the basics exceptionally well.”\n\nHuddersfield relegated after Milivojevic puts Crystal Palace on way to win Read more\n\nNuno Espírito Santo selected a strong side ahead of next Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final, with only Raúl Jiménez allowed a rest, though the need for concentration in the Premier League did not necessarily transmit itself to the players. Certainly the visitors’ minds seemed to be elsewhere when they fell for a training-ground routine to allow Burnley to go ahead in less than two minutes.\n\nAshley Westwood shaped to take a free-kick but as he placed the ball on the ground Dwight McNeil appeared at his shoulder to launch it into the area. Chris Wood was already moving, getting a start on a static defence before taking one touch to round Rui Patrício and a second to slide the ball towards goal, where it went in via a post and Conor Coady.\n\nThe visitors spent the rest of the first half trying to get back on terms, without finding a way past James Tarkowski, never mind Tom Heaton. Rúben Neves sent a volley wide on the half-hour and Ivan Cavaleiro almost combined neatly with Diogo Jota a few minutes later, only to find Heaton alert to the danger with an interception.\n\nThat meant neither side had managed an attempt on target by the time the interval arrived. Burnley have picked up points in such circumstances before, a couple of own goals allowed them to beat Fulham in January, but Wolves were seeing too much of the ball and playing too high up the pitch for Dyche to be completely happy.\n\nJota opened the second half with a shot from a narrow angle that was a couple of feet wide, before Leander Dendoncker created the best opportunity yet to trouble the goalkeeper by rounding Ben Mee on the right touchline. An unmarked Cavaleiro screamed for the ball in the middle, yet when Dendoncker found him perfectly the striker blasted wastefully high.\n\nPierre-Emile Højbjerg fires Southampton to vital win over Brighton Read more\n\nHeaton was finally forced to make a save in the 75th minute from a Jonny Otto header, yet no sooner had the first accurate attempt arrived than a second turned up two minutes later. This time it was at the opposite end of the pitch and the impressive McNeil did not miss. When Tarkowksi won a header on halfway the Wolves defence fell away, with Romain Saïss in particular failing to close the winger down and practically inviting a shot on goal.\n\nWith all the confidence of a successful first season and a recent call-up to the England camp McNeil was happy to oblige, finding Patrício’s bottom-left corner with an ease that left one wondering what had taken Burnley so long.\n\nThe teenager was given an ovation as he left the field just before the end, though Mee and Tarkowski at the heart of the defence provided the platform for this victory.\n\n“We needed better concentration and communication at the start of the game, but Burnley are very organised and very physical,” Nuno said. “Physical but fair.”"}, {"date": "30/03/2019", "arena": "Selhurst

A penalty from Luka Milivojevic and Patrick van Aanholt’s late goal sealed Huddersfield’s relegation at the ground where their adventure at this level began a little more than 18 months ago with a brilliant 3-0 victory under David Wagner.\n\nYet the end of a story that has already seen the departure of the man who achieved the impossible last season by surviving the club’s first top-flight campaign in more than 40 years was a harsh lesson in the realities of the modern game as Jan Siewert’s side were eventually overwhelmed by superior opponents.\n\nIn truth it could have been even more embarrassing had Palace taken more of their plethora of chances in the second half but Huddersfield, having now lost 17 of their past 19 matches, can have no real complaints at becoming only the second team in Premier League history to be relegated before the end of March.\n\nCareful Huddersfield pay inevitable price but are set up to return | Paul Doyle Read more\n\nAt least Derby’s all-time points low of 11 was surpassed a few weeks ago, although Siewert has also become the first permanent manager to lose his first five Premier League away matches since a certain Ole Gunnar Solskjær did so with Cardiff in 2014. The 36-year-old German has struggled to make an impact since replacing Wagner in January, even if his team had looked intent on putting up a fight in the early stages against opponents who have failed to sparkle in front of their own supporters for most of the season. Palace’s record of only 11 Premier League goals at Selhurst Park before this game was an awful return for a team that has managed 25 on the road by comparison. As if weighed down by that statistic, Roy Hodgson’s side looked ponderous until the 13th minute, when fans paid tribute to the former youth team player Damary Dawkins who, aged 13, died from leukaemia this month and was also honoured by Raheem Sterling in England’s win over Czech Republic last week.\n\nA quick break created by the deftest of touches from Wilfried Zaha finally sparked Palace into life but neither Michy Batshuayi nor Jeffrey Schlupp could test Ben Hamer thanks to some last-ditch defending. The goalkeeper had been preferred to Jonas Lössl, one of last season’s heroes who was left out of the matchday squad entirely after he conceded three goals in the last 15 minutes against West Ham before the international break.\n\nBut it was Hamer’s opposite number, Vicente Guaita, who had to be alert to save from Chris Löwe’s powerful header in the 26th minute after the industrious Alex Pritchard had dispossessed Schlupp on the edge of his own box. The Spaniard then did well to divert Löwe’s shot wide of his post after another Palace error with the ball.\n\n‘We weren’t good enough to stay up’: Huddersfield deflated as they go down Read more\n\nAfter the defeats by Brighton and Watford in their previous two matches the home supporters would have been disappointed to see a lack of endeavour from their side in the first half, especially given that they were still looking nervously over their shoulders in the relegation battle before kick-off. Those fears have been eased, although with Burnley and Southampton both winning to confirm Huddersfield’s fate, Hodgson is aware they are still not quite safe.\n\n“The second-half performance tells me that we don’t have to worry too much about out season flat-lining,” he said. The Palace manager had withdrawn the ineffective Max Meyer at half-time and replaced him with James McArthur, with the change having the desired effect. Van Aanholt tested Hamer from the edge of the box following good work from Zaha before James Tomkins was next to try his luck just as news of Southampton’s goal against Brighton filtered through.\n\nHuddersfield’s Juninho Bacuna could count himself lucky not to be booked after two incidents in the space of a minute in which the Dutchman hauled down Aaron Wan-Bissaka and then take out Batshuayi as the frustration around Selhurst Park grew. But that was nothing compared with the groans when Townsend and Zaha both managed to pass up one-on-one chances within the space of a few minutes, the former somehow missing the target with the goal gaping.\n\n“We’re going down,” sang the Huddersfield fans, acknowledging their likely fate. A few minutes later their prediction was realised when Bacuna clumsily brought down Zaha and Milivojevic made no mistake from the spot, his ninth conversion this season. By the time Van Aanholt made it 2-0 in the dying minutes, their battle was already over."}, {"date": "30/03/2019", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31530, "home_team": {"name":

under Brendan Rodgers.\n\nMorgan proved an able deputy against Burnley two weeks ago following Harry Maguire’s fourth-minute red card, the veteran defender scoring a late winner. Here, with Maguire suspended, the 35-year-old started and he picked up where he left off, getting on the scoresheet again after 11 minutes. Jamie Vardy added a second late on to give Rodgers a third win in his four matches as manager, it also and ensuring Leicester a third successive Premier League win for the first time since May 2017.\n\n“It was a very good performance, especially off the back of an international break,” said Rodgers. “We were very cohesive in the way we played and it was good to see the ideas coming through. The pressing and aggression was outstanding.”\n\nMorgan scored for the second game running when James Maddison floated a corner to the edge of the penalty area for Ben Chilwell. The full-back took a touch to control before firing goalwards, where Morgan instinctively flicked out a leg to divert the ball past a wrong-footed Asmir Begovic.\n\n“The big guy has been brilliant,” said Rodgers. “He’s fit and strong and he played it simple over 10-15 metres and helped the team build the game – and we know already that he’s a brilliant defender. I’m very pleased for him.”\n\nBournemouth should have scored a quick equaliser but Callum Wilson was denied when Kasper Schmeichel made a block right on his goalline. Maddison was a prominent influence and his curling effort had Begovic scrambling across his goal but the ball sailed just wide.\n\nVardy uncharacteristically snatched at a chance and skewed his shot wide, too, before Maddison brought a good save from Begovic after winning the ball back from Nathan Aké in a dangerous position.\n\nThe 61st minute was an emotional moment as Leicester fans united to applaud their former chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who would have celebrated his 61st birthday this week.\n\n“We are here to play a brand of football that’s attacking and aggressive and on a day that’s a special occasion the fans showed their appreciation,” said Rodgers. “The atmosphere here is incredible when the fans have a team that attacks with speed and quality.”\n\nVardy almost made amends for his earlier miss with a smart shot on the turn but Begovic was equal to it. The striker did get his goal with eight minutes remaining, beating Begovic to Youri Tielemans’ cross to head the ball into an unguarded net and seal the win.\n\n“I don’t think we were ourselves today,” said Eddie Howe. “We looked a bit leggy and short of our normal sharpness.\n\n“Some players looked tired, they had been away on international duty but I’m not making excuses.”"}, {"date":

swirled in the Stretford End, and Manchester United claimed victory. This was the perfect way to herald the Norwegian’s full-time appointment as manager and to respond to the last two defeats. It was hardly pretty: United were stuck in second gear, the goals coming some time apart, but as winning while underperforming is a yardstick of a good team it was a satisfactory afternoon, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial the home scorers, with Abdoulaye Doucouré producing Watford’s late response.\n\n“The first 20 minutes we started so slow and sloppy,” said Solskjær. “The second half we started sloppier but at 2-0 I thought we were in control but then they scored.”\n\nSolskjær made four changes from the league defeat at Arsenal, drafting in Ander Herrera, Juan Mata, Martial and most notably Phil Jones for Victor Lindelöf, who was not injured but had “a few things to sort”, according to the manager. He may have been alluding to death threats the Swede received for pulling out of his country’s recent internationals because his wife was expecting. She has since given birth.\n\nWatford’s Javi Gracia brought in the same number: Troy Deeney, Gerard Deulofeu, Will Hughes and Étienne Capoue.\n\nAt the start, a slumbering United rearguard allowed Doucouré time to scuff a shot wide of David de Gea’s right post, as Watford dominated the early exchanges, with Deeney the next to take aim.\n\nHuddersfield relegated after Milivojevic puts Crystal Palace on way to win Read more\n\nA concerned Mike Phelan prowled the United technical area, though he will have been happier when Paul Pogba finally had United moving. His long, arcing pass put Rashford in behind and Watford had to scramble to clear.\n\nWhen Martial went flying inside Daryl Janmaat the latter’s touch took the ball back to Ben Foster; United appealed for a back-pass but Stuart Attwell adjudged it inadvertent. The referee did the same when the influential Martial went down after Miguel Britos touched him in the area: the home crowd were indignant but it would have been harsh.\n\nNow came the game’s supreme moment, from Luke Shaw. He dispossessed Deeney just outside United’s area and then he glanced up and sent a 30-yard pass precisely into Rashford’s path, removing Watford’s defence. From there, the centre-forward did the business, sliding the ball home.\n\nSolskjær believes more is to come from Shaw. “I can’t wait to see him blossom,” he said.\n\nWatford were shellshocked and had their keeper to thank for staying only one behind moments later. Martial was just about celebrating after his close-range effort when Foster’s reflexes saved the visitors.\n\nRashford had equalled his best of 13 in a league season and he soon had a chance for his 14th. He left Foster grounded but instead of pulling the trigger hit a misplaced pass; on the touchline, Phelan spun around in disappointment.\n\nDwight McNeil strikes to seal crucial Burnley victory over Wolves Read more\n\nThe second half started with a Gerard Deulofeu shot that De Gea gathered easily. At the other end Ashley Young’s pass to Martial was hit out for a corner and Watford subsequently escaped. Solskjær had switched his front three around, placing Mata in the No 9 berth, Rashford on the left and Martial on the right. United’s problem was in defence, though, where the second half was begun in soporific manner.\n\nThat allowed Janmaat and Roberto Pereyra to threaten, while Pogba was having an afternoon when he would lose the ball and remonstrate with himself rather than try to win it back.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A banner celebrating Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is displayed in the Stretford End. Photograph: John Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images\n\nAfter Gracia brought on Kiko Femenía for Janmaat, Solskjær introduced Andreas Pereira and Jesse Lingard for Herrera and Mata. Initially, it made scant difference to a contest that had become Watford’s attack versus United’s defence.\n\nThen the hosts finally came alive again – in part due to a comedy of Watford errors. Martial tried a one-two with Rashford and Britos failed to clear. When the ball broke back to the Frenchman from Lingard, Martial forced it past Foster.\n\nSolskjær’s pre-game comments were all about how the hard work had begun now he had been confirmed as the permanent manager. This game was indeed attritional but despite Doucouré’s late strike they managed to win: always the bottom line in football.\n\n“It is difficult to explain because I think we had a good performance,”

three-quarters of West Ham’s supporters, unwilling to cut their team slack after an abrupt halt to an improved run of home form, had long since drifted into the night. Everton’s travelling contingent were far more visible and vocal but the two fanbases might have had one question in common: where, exactly, did that come from?\n\nEverton had not put in a 90-minute performance of this accomplishment since Marco Silva’s arrival last summer but such a slick, dominant display bodes positively for the task ahead. That is to finish seventh, earn the lukewarm best-of-the-rest chalice and see if it squeaks them into the European spots; they are a point away now and, with consecutive league wins to their name, the manager’s buzzword throughout a troubled winter – “consistency” – lies within reach.\n\nWest Ham United 0-2 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“I’m proud of what we did here this afternoon,” Silva said after watching goals from Kurt Zouma and Bernard secure a margin of victory that could have been far higher. “From the first minute we were the best team on the pitch. The general performance was really, really good.”\n\nThey were in total command even before Zouma, taking advantage of Issa Diop’s inability to muster a meaningful challenge, rose to convert Gylfi Sigurdsson’s deep corner with a bouncing header in the fifth minute. By the 13th they could have been three or four goals up, Lukasz Fabianski saving from Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Sigurdsson and Lucas Digne. It is far from uncommon for teams to begin sluggishly after an international break but West Ham never came close to clearing their heads.\n\nIt was a pitiful, bloodless display from Manuel Pellegrini’s team and comfortably among the worst since their move to the London Stadium. Competition for that title is stiff but the mystery was that, in seven unbeaten games here before this, they had struck a vein of form. While Silva eulogised, Pellegrini could only accept his players had plumbed depths uncharted this season.\n\n“Not only the worst home performance: the worst performance of the year, away or at home,” he said. “We played very badly in both boxes and Everton also had chances to score more. It was one of those bad days.”\n\nHuddersfield relegated after Milivojevic puts Crystal Palace on way to win Read more\n\nWest Ham barely created a chance, Marko Arnautovic stumbling when given space to run at Michael Keane early in the first half and snatching at a tame effort from range later on. Pellegrini’s decision to partner him in a 4-4-2 with Lucas Pérez, who was far from alone in performing lamentably, never looked like bearing fruit. Pérez was replaced at half-time and the boos rang out for Arnautovic when, midway through the second half, he made way for Grady Diangana. Arnautovic flung down a water bottle as he took his seat on the bench; Pellegrini observed afterwards that nobody could be blamed individually for the defeat but any truce that developed since the forward’s abortive move to China appears wafer-thin.\n\nSet in this context it is hard to gauge exactly how good Everton were. They were certainly surgical when it mattered, Bernard scoring their second goal shortly after the half-hour, when the latest of many smart moves down the right released Séamus Coleman to cross. It was the Brazilian’s first league goal for Everton and felt like overdue reward for a season’s perspiration.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWest Ham showed marginally more spine early in the second half but Everton always posed the greater threat. Calvert-Lewin shot wide from an angle and Richarlison, heading against the bar with the number on hand to bear witness dwindling fast, could have made things worse.\n\n“What I worry about is that it’s not the first time we have had the opportunity to be seventh,” Pellegrini said of his side’s failure to seize that spot. “We must find a way of thinking and playing as a big team.” For one evening at least, Silva and Everton set a compelling example."}, {"date": "17/03/2019", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 25043, "home_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Rico",

"report": "Liverpool flirted with disaster here, though in the end it was the manner in which they dealt with the prospect of failure that bodes well for the months ahead. Pegged back from nowhere, their dominance undone by sloppiness, they might have frozen and found their title challenge critically undermined. Instead adversity merely re-set the focus and they emerged victorious, restored to the summit and with belief bolstered that the title will be theirs.\n\nJürgen Klopp had surveyed the scene in the period immediately after Fulham’s equaliser and, from his vantage point on the sidelines, taken heart at the resolve on display. There was no panic despite the dreadfully careless nature of Fulham’s goal, from James Milner’s slice via Virgil van Dijk’s marginally underhit header to Alisson’s inability to smother the ball at Ryan Babel’s feet. It was a goal that came out of nothing, with touches from three Liverpool players between Aleksandar Mitrovic’s flick near the half-way line to Babel’s burst through the goalkeeper’s attempt at a block and almost apologetic tap into the net.\n\nFulham 1-2 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nOther teams might have wilted at the mess of it all, infuriated to have handed opponents long since resigned to relegation an unlikely route back into the game. The gravity of shedding points at Craven Cottage had always been clear.\n\nYet Liverpool, far from wildly pursuing a riposte, retained composure and restored their lead. Within six minutes Mohamed Salah had collected Milner’s cross at the far post and fired in a shot which Sergio Rico should have gathered. Instead the Spaniard, perhaps unnerved with opponents in his eyeline, spilled the effort and, unnerved, wrapped an arm round Sadio Mané as he sought to reach the rebound. The Senegalese’s tumble was unnecessarily dramatic but the offence was still clear.\n\nMilner, whose first involvement had been the misplaced pass in the build-up to Babel’s goal, retained his nerve to thump in the resultant spot-kick. “The gaffer had told me to come on and calm it down, and the first thing I do is slice it over the top and put Virgil under pressure, which wasn’t ideal,” said the midfielder. “So it was important to put the penalty away and make up for their goal, which was my fault.” Van Dijk admitted he should still have dealt with the ball more effectively, laughing off Babel’s mischievous suggestion that he had been aware of the centre-half’s weakness, but his had been an uncharacteristic error. That Mitrovic offered little to no real threat was down to his imposing display.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nTheir advantage from City stands at two points, another win having been eked out on the back of midweek Champions League endeavours. They can bask at the top over the forthcoming international break having already secured as many points, 76, as in either of Klopp’s two previous full seasons in charge. The perfectionist in Klopp bemoaned a lack of rhythm to much of their play, though they had still exerted a control on proceedings until carelessness crept in the moments before Fulham’s equaliser. Their full-backs, marauding forward at will, had been a constant menace down either flank.\n\nHad their front three been at their slick best, then this would have been comfortable long before the end. Yet, for all that the trio have contributed 45 league goals between them (only five down on the same stage last year), there is anxiety in Salah’s play, in particular, at present. The Egyptian now has only one goal in 11 matches, his clearest opening coming in the aftermath of Milner’s penalty when he could finally gallop on the counter, only for Rico to deny him from close-range. He could do with personal reward for reassurance.\n\nOdsonne Edouard's 96th-minute goal gives Celtic victory over Dundee Read more\n\nIt is to Liverpool’s relief that the slack has been taken up by others of late. Mané’s 11th goal in as many games had eased them into the lead, the visitors flicking a switch to snap out of the initial plod in central midfield and slice through at pace. Andrew Robertson had fed the Senegalese whose burst of speed took him into the penalty area with Fulham suddenly flustered. Roberto Firmino took up possession with André-Frank Zambo Anguissa failing to track Mane’s dart inside, and the forward was unmarked to meet his team-mate’s pull-back and to convert crisply beyond Rico.\n\nMané has now reached 20 goals this season and, before Fulham’s equaliser, flicked a header on to the crossbar. Had that effort been guided in, then Liverpool might have coasted through to success without incident, though Fulham’s dogged approach merited making this far more uncomfortable for the visitors. Anguissa, that early error aside, arguably delivered his most persuasive display yet as a Premier League player, while there was industry and discipline where, under previous managers, this team’s defence have all but hoisted the white flag. The frustration for the caretaker, Scott Parker, was that Rico’s rush of blood still condemned the team to another defeat.\n\nThey confront City in their next match. “There were positives to take into that match,” said Parker. “We were playing against arguably the best counter-attacking team in Europe, with a front three who are pretty deadly, so we set about trying to stay in the game. We did that in the first half and were much more on the front foot after the break. It was just a shame we couldn’t hold on.” Their grip on a place in the top flight has long since been loosened.

They dominated for much of the game without being able to come up with an end product, eventually conceding from the almost inevitable set piece to send Everton on the way to their first home win since mid-January.\n\nChelsea’s Maurizio Sarri admits top-four worry after damning defeat at Everton Read more\n\nIt just is not happening for Maurizio Sarri and his players at the moment, not in front of goal at any rate. Eden Hazard is becoming anonymous, something difficult to envisage at the start of the season, Gonzalo Higuaín is not intimidating defences and an inventive and industrious midfield is still failing to provide backup in the form of a goal threat. Chelsea could have been out of sight by the interval yet Everton were practically invited to come back into the game, which they did through second-half goals from Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\n“We showed great attitude and character in the second half, but we could have been behind at half-time but for Jordan Pickford,” Marco Silva said. “He was fantastic, he kept us in the game.” Sarri did not disagree. “We could have scored four or five goals in the first half but in the second half we stopped defending,” the Chelsea manager said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Richarlison reacts the fastest to pounce on a rebound and give Everton the lead. Photograph: James Speakman/Mercury Press/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nPickford has had his ups and down in recent weeks but the Everton goalkeeper came to his side’s rescue as early as the sixth minute, getting down low at his near post to keep out a shot from Hazard after Marcos Alonso had played the forward into the area. That was already an ominous sign for the home side, and when Hazard hit the post a minute later, quickly followed by Michael Keane having to clear up on the line from Higuaín, the Goodison crowd began to express disapproval. By that stage in the game Everton had barely been out of their own half.\n\nA patch of blue emerges through the grey skies over Goodison Park | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nRoss Barkley’s every touch was booed on his first return to his former club, and when the England player deftly outsmarted Everton’s cover in the area to open up the possibility of a shot from a narrow angle he rather spoiled the effect by blasting the ball wastefully across the face of goal. Barkley managed a little better a few minutes later, bringing a routine save from Pickford from the edge of the area, as did Jorginho when he arrived at speed to take a short pass from Higuaín, only to shoot straight at the goalkeeper.\n\nEverton had advanced over the halfway line a couple of times by the mid-point of the first half – though apart from Dominic Calvert-Lewin shooting too high, only a low drive by André Gomes managed to bring Kepa Arrizabalaga into action. Chelsea looked the side most likely to break the deadlock, and Pedro should have managed it on the half hour from Alonso’s return pass, instead of missing the target by a distance with a clear sight of goal.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWith Hazard operating mostly wide on the left to only limited effect, Pedro looked the player most likely to create something from nothing, even if his finishing left something to be desired. Towards the end of the first half he picked his way deftly through a clutch of defenders to give himself room for a shot from the edge of the area, only to see his effort fly harmlessly. Despite being outplayed for most of the first half the home side would still have been annoyed with themselves at the interval, for when a chance arrived to score from a set piece – realistically Everton’s best hope of going ahead – they squandered it. There was nothing wrong with Sigurdsson’s well-flighted free-kick, and nothing to fault in the way Calvert-Lewin reached the ball ahead of the Chelsea defence, but having earned himself a free header from eight yards out he put it too high.\n\nLiverpool go back to the top after James Milner converts late penalty at Fulham Read more\n\nAlthough Everton started the second half with a declaration of intent when a rasping shot from Gomes brought a decent save from Arrizabalaga, when the home side made a mockery of what had gone before by taking the lead within four minutes of the restart it was in fact from a set piece and it again involved Sigurdsson and Calvert-Lewin. The latter climbed highest to meet the former’s corner, and though his downward header was saved on the line the ball sat up invitingly for Richarlison to tuck away for his first Everton goal against top six opponents. Everton would have been happy with that, but just after Sarri had made his second-half substitutions – Barkley’s number going up was greeted by a roar of delight – Alonso stepped on Richarlison’s foot in the area and Sigurdsson accepted the opportunity to make it two.\n\nThough Arrizabalaga saved the initial penalty, he only pushed the ball back to let Sigurdsson score at the second attempt. Just about the only bright spot for Chelsea in the whole of the second half was a rising drive by Callum Hudson-Odoi that Pickford needed to tip over.

A statistical rarity represented something special for Brendan Rodgers. Summoned in the sixth minute, after Harry Maguire got the Premier League’s earliest red card since 2015, Wes Morgan capped an unexpectedly lengthy contribution with the goal that gave Leicester a victory forged in adversity.\n\nWhen Rodgers briefed Morgan on Friday, he told him to get ready when Peter Crouch was preparing to come on. Instead Leicester’s title-winning captain was introduced 64 minutes before the man he was primed to stop and turned scorer himself, meeting Youri Tielemans’ cross with an emphatic header. “He got a round of applause in the changing room, which he deserved as it was a fantastic header,” Rodgers said. “He is a symbol of the dressing room. His history at Leicester is incredible.” Rodgers hopes to extend it by persuading Morgan, whose current contract expires in the summer, to sign a new deal, though he warned: “He won’t play as much.”\n\nJavier Hernández the hero as West Ham beat Huddersfield in seven-goal thriller Read more\n\nDropped after Rodgers’ first game in charge, Morgan was not the only finisher to prove a point. James Maddison, omitted from the England squad despite creating the most chances in the Premier League this season, conjured an eloquent answer with a lovely goal.\n\nAfter a decidedly mixed day for Leicester’s English contingent, one of Gareth Southgate’s automatic choices, Maguire, should report for international duty rather fresher than anticipated. He came and went in 191 seconds, which underlines the scale of the missed opportunity for Burnley as they equalled their worst Premier League run. A fourth consecutive defeat contained a 10th last-minute goal they have conceded this season. “When it costs you, that is not enjoyable,” said Sean Dyche.\n\nYet their start offered a rare chance. Dyche’s decision to recall Johann Berg Gudmundsson was immediately justified as Jack Cork sent the Icelander scurrying in behind the Leicester defence. Maguire clipped his heels and was duly dismissed for the first time in six years. Kasper Schmeichel spared Leicester further damage, excelling to tip Gudmundsson’s free-kick over the bar.\n\nMatt Ritchie stuns old club with stoppage-time equaliser for Newcastle Read more\n\n“When we were down to 10 men, it was about having that energy and positive attitude,” said Rodgers. His side led with a free-kick won and converted by Maddison. It came at the expense of two of those Southgate did select. James Tarkowski, with a clumsy barge, conceded the set-piece. Tom Heaton was left clawing at thin air as Maddison bent it beyond his reach.\n\nBurnley trailed for only six minutes. If Gudmundsson was the catalyst early on, thereafter Dwight McNeil posed the major threat. He levelled with an angled drive. “He was a shining light today,” said Dyche. Others offered more of a grim darkness. “We didn’t find the really good moments of quality to win the game,” the manager added. “It can play with you psychologically when someone gets sent off so early.”\n\nThe concern for Burnley, whose final four fixtures are intimidating, is that they lacked the wit and craft to unlock Leicester’s disciplined defence. They were vigorously shielded by the ubiquitous Wilfred Ndidi, though Dyche claimed a penalty for the Nigerian’s challenge on Charlie Taylor. “They carried it out tactically very well with 10 men,” said Rodgers. “We have resilience and spirit in this squad. When you come to Burnley, style alone won’t get you points. You need to have steel. You have to have personality. You don’t win a league if you are shrinking violets.”\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAnd it was Morgan, the man who lifted the Premier League trophy, who rose highest at

Huddersfield, bottom of the Premier League and all but doomed, were heading towards only their fourth win of the season when they led 3-1 through Juninho Bacuna and a double from Karlan Grant. But Hernández came off the bench to score twice and push Huddersfield another step closer to the Championship.\n\nMatt Ritchie stuns old club with stoppage-time equaliser for Newcastle Read more\n\n“I hate it when my team play badly,” Manuel Pellegrini said. “I think everyone was disappointed when we were 3-1 down but we did well to come back. The victory is very good for the fans, especially when you are losing 3-1 and you don’t give up. That reflects the character of the team. It’s good for everyone. For the fans, for me, the players. It’s good for everyone except Huddersfield.”\n\nHuddersfield had scored only eight away goals before they showed up at the London Stadium. By half-time that tally had reached double figures and just after an hour they made it 11 with West Ham looking every bit a set of players who have already clocked off for the summer.\n\nMark Noble’s early penalty gave West Ham a false sense of security and Huddersfield had hit three goals before Angelo Ogbonna made it 3-2 with 15 minutes left. Hernández then took over to earn West Ham a third successive home Premier League win for the first time since they moved to the former Olympic Stadium.\n\nThey had been gifted the lead after a quarter of an hour when the 18-year-old Aaron Rowe, making his full debut, tripped Manuel Lanzini in the area and Noble did the honours. Yet two minutes later Huddersfield, who had not scored a goal away from home since Boxing Day, were level. Michail Antonio lost Bacuna at Aaron Mooy’s corner, leaving Bacuna with a free header to open his account for the club.\n\nWorse was to follow when Alex Pritchard played a short free-kick out wide to Chris Löwe. The Huddersfield full-back drove the ball low into a crowded area and Grant was on hand to steer it home from six yards out.\n\nWest Ham trooped off at half-time with boos ringing in their ears and Pellegrini sent on Hernández for Antonio. Marko Arnautovic, summoned from the naughty step for a first start since January when the striker declared he wanted to move to China, should have equalised after a jinking run from Felipe Anderson but shot too close to the goalkeeper Jonas Lössl.\n\nMoments later Huddersfield had their third, Grant bullying Issa Diop off the ball and cutting inside Ogbonna’s feeble challenge before curling into the top corner.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nArnautovic was substituted to the sound of more jeers, illustrating that all is not yet forgiven for the former crowd favourite. Yet his departure may have galvanised West Ham as, with 15 minutes remaining, they halved the deficit, Ogbonna scoring with a powerful downward header from Aaron Cresswell’s corner.\n\nWes Morgan snatches last-minute win for 10-man Leicester at Burnley Read more\n\nIn the 84th minute the substitute Samir Nasri sent over an inviting diagonal cross that Hernández buried at the far post with a diving header. Even then Huddersfield could have won it, only for Philip Billing to hook a glorious chance over from eight yards out. So there was an air of inevitability when, in stoppage time, Felipe Anderson lofted the ball into the area and Hernández guided it home to cap a barmy match.\n\n“Javier’s an important player,” Pellegrini said. “Every time he’s inside the box he is dangerous. He started on the bench so did not have so much pressure. I always say to players that subs are so important, they must have their minds on the game.”\n\nIt was hard not to sorry feel for Huddersfield, destined for the drop but so close to securing only a fourth win of the season. Their crestfallen manager, Jan Siewert, said: “I can’t describe my feelings right now. Look at my face.\n\n“We scored three goals, we haven’t done that all year, so the match plan worked.

Jürgen Klopp’s contenders have been doing that since the first day of this enthralling title race.

Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané both scored twice to lift Liverpool to 73 points from 30 games for only the third time in their illustrious history – the previous two occasions ended with the title at Anfield – and serve as ideal preparation for Wednesday’s Champions League trip to Bayern Munich. Burnley scored with two of their three shots on target yet were more prolific at shooting themselves in the foot. Their defending was dreadful, undermining an otherwise encouraging away display, and explains why they stand only two points above the relegation zone.\n\nBurnley made Liverpool fight all the way for a victory that was imperative with City moving four points clear at the summit on Saturday. The conditions were awkward too although Klopp had no cause to lament the weather on this occasion with his team displaying the character and the cutting edge demanded.\n\nPlay Video 1:05 'Nobody gets rid of us': Jürgen Klopp issues warning to Manchester City – video\n\nThe challenge for the title chasers began before Anfield had truly roused itself for the noon kick off. Joël Matip conceded a cheap early corner with a wayward header under minimal pressure. Ashley Westwood swung the resulting set-piece into a crowded six-yard area and directly into the far corner of Liverpool’s net. The small pocket of Burnley supporters erupted and so did Alisson, who had been sandwiched between Jack Cork and James Tarkowski as the ball entered his domain and unable to leap with a six foot one inch defender on his back. Liverpool waited for referee Andre Marriner to penalise a clear foul. He pointed to the centre circle instead, sending the Brazilian goalkeeper apoplectic and into the notebook for dissent.\n\nDyche, channelling the spirit of Nat Lofthouse, described it as a “tough call” for the referee. It was a bad and potentially loaded call against Klopp’s team, though it gave them a minimum of 84 minutes to channel their grievance in the most appropriate way. Burnley helped them along the way with several defensive lapses that squandered the major decision in their favour. Tom Heaton was the chief culprit on an afternoon to forget for the England international.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nLiverpool levelled when the visiting keeper failed to intercept Mohamed Salah’s low cross from the byline, flapping at the ball and diverting it away from Tarkowski with the defender primed to clear. Firmino gratefully converted the gift at close range for his tenth Premier League goal of the campaign. The hosts, commanding from the moment they fell behind, benefited from another error to edge ahead. Jeff Hendrick was the guilty party with a weak touch on an Ashley Barnes’ header that played Phil Bardsley into trouble. Adam Lallana launched himself into the full back’s clearance, diverting it to Salah inside the penalty area. Charlie Taylor reacted with a sharp challenge but the ball broke for Mané who curled an emphatic finish inside Heaton’s far post to overturn Burnley’s controversial advantage.\n\nKlopp sees fiery forward response from draws that threatened title tilt | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nLallana’s inclusion ahead of Xherdan Shaqiri and Naby Keita was met with heavy scepticism before kick off yet he provided the creativity and bite that Liverpool’s midfield has lacked in recent away fixtures. It was Lallana’s cross-field ball to Salah that enabled the Egypt international to exchange passes with Georginio Wijnaldum before crossing for Firmino’s equaliser. His challenge on Bardsley proved a key moment. “The game-changer,” as Klopp put it.\n\nThe wind, yes that again, was an added complication for both sides on a wild Merseyside day of sun, blizzards and gales in the course of 90 minutes. One raking pass from Virgil van Dijk appeared destined for touch only to blow back into the path of Salah. The Egyptian was prominent but again without reward in front of goal, failing to score for the fifth consecutive game. A first in his Liverpool career. Heaton made sure that mini-drought continued with a fine save from Salah’s first time flick late on.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBy then Liverpool had the cushion of a third goal courtesy of another mistake from the Burnley keeper. A weak goal kick by Heaton, perhaps caught up in the wind, sailed straight to Salah who raced through on goal only to be halted by Taylor’s precise tackle. The ball broke into Firmino’s path who prodded home his second gift-wrapped invitation of the game.\n\nBurnley made a fight of the contest throughout with Dwight McNeil enjoying a fine, polished game on the left of midfield. Barnes was a consistent thorn too and the visitors set up what may have been a nervous finale when Johann Berg Gudmundsson converted a pass from fellow substitute Matej Vydra from close range. Burnley’s hopes of a dramatic recovery were dashed within seconds. Liverpool sub Daniel Sturridge released Mané through an open visiting defence and the Senegal striker rounded Heaton to seal a hard-fought but invaluable victory."}, {"date": "10/03/2019", "arena":

penalty area as two Wolverhampton Wanderers players closed in, glimpsed a route to goal through the clutter of bodies and fizzed home the most pinpoint of equalisers. It was a moment of jaw-dropping genius, a reminder of the quality that sets the Belgian apart, and the kind of timely intervention that can distort the prevailing mood.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read more\n\nThe reality is the late drama which spared Chelsea’s blushes here should not detract from the inadequacies that have undermined the team’s pursuit of the top four. This, as Maurizio Sarri went on to acknowledge, was a missed opportunity given Tottenham Hotspur’s latest stumble and the subsequent meeting of the sides immediately above. Yet it ended a rather fraught occasion, threatening to shatter the fragile truce in these parts. Had Hazard not prised wonderfully disciplined and organised opponents apart at the last, denying Wolves a first win here in four decades, then a mood of mutiny might have returned.\n\nAs it was, the home support pinpointed familiar culprits for the plod of it all. The substitution of Jorginho 18 minutes from time had prompted cheers from a significant proportion, the Italy midfielder suffering yet again as the personification of a philosophy that too often has simply not clicked. From the outside looking in his passing can appear ineffective, lacking penetration. Chelsea had spent the first half of this game camped on the edge of the Wolves penalty area without ever really hinting at opening up stubborn opposition. The constant shuffling of the ball inflates the passing statistics but the visitors were content. They did not even need to close Jorginho down at source to wreck Chelsea’s game-plan.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSarri, defending his player, pointed out the 27-year-old needs clever movement around him if he is to flourish, which was a valid criticism of a collective lack of spark in the face of blanket defence. Chelsea had been flummoxed too easily. “If the other players don’t move without the ball, Jorginho is in trouble,” he said. “He is really very able to play at one touch but, if you want to play one touch, you need movements from the other players. He is a very strong character and a professional player, and he has to play in every condition. Taking him off was a consequence of a change of system, not the performance. But I know him very well. He can go in trouble if all the rest of the team are not moving.”\n\nYet the reality was that Chelsea disrupted Wolves’ resolve only when, for the first time this season, they abandoned the predictability of 4-3-3 and switched formation. Sarri claimed they played that last quarter in something akin to a 4-2-3-1 but, in practice, N’Golo Kanté loitered as a lone midfielder while a quintet of forward thinkers, driven on by the youthful energy and aggression of the substitutes Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi, finally dragged markers out of their comfort zone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raúl Jiménez’s 56th-minute goal was his 14th for Wolves in all competitions this season. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nUp to then the outstanding England hopeful Conor Coady and his fellow centre-halves had repelled almost everything thrown at them, while a trio of midfielders and pair of workaholic full-backs presented a barrier upon which Chelsea broke. “If there are no spaces, it’s very difficult to score if you play five or six touches against a very physical team with 11 players in the last 20m,” said Sarri. “Hazard is a great player who can solve the situation in any moment but during the match he was like the other players. He needs more movement without the ball, not only when he has it at his feet.”\n\nQuick guide Premier League top-four race: remaining fixtures Show Hide The four-way sprint for the third and fourth Champions League places Tottenham\n\n20 Apr Man City (A)\n\n23 Apr Brighton (h)\n\n27 Apr West Ham (H)\n\n6 May Bournemouth (A)\n\n12 May Everton (H) Arsenal 21 Apr Crystal Palace (H)\n\n24 Apr Wolves (A)\n\n29 Apr Leicester (A)\n\n4 May Brighton (H)\n\n12 May Burnley (A) Manchester United 21 Apr Everton (A)\n\n24 Apr Man City (H)\n\n28 Apr Chelsea (H)\n\n5 May Huddersfield (A)\n\n12 May Cardiff (H) Chelsea 22 Apr Burnley (H)\n\n28 Apr Man Utd (A)\n\n4 May Watford (H)\n\n12 May Leicester (A)\n\n\n\n\n\nWolves had revelled in the frustration their obstinacy prompted.

As it was, a hooked clearance from Willy Boly served to spin Chelsea on their heels. Jota and Jiménez exchanged passes with opponents flustered in full-scale retreat and César Azpilicueta’s dart across on the cover succeeded only in flicking Jiménez’s shot over the on-rushing Kepa Arrizabalaga, with the ball dribbling over the line.

It was not a vintage display but one in which they laboured for clear-cut chances and were grateful, at times, to the goalkeeper, Bernd Leno. But a Granit Xhaka goal – assisted by a rare David de Gea misjudgment – and a generously awarded Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang penalty were enough to lift them above United into fourth place.\n\nArsenal are now one point behind third-placed Tottenham and, to paraphrase their supporters in stoppage time, they are coming for their local rivals. Their run-in features no more fixtures against teams from the top six but five away matches – none of which look straightforward. Arsenal have won only five times away from home in the league this season. Their fate will surely be determined on the road and it is anybody’s guess which Arsenal will show up on those occasions.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nThe stain on the afternoon was provided by the fan who ran on to the pitch after Aubameyang’s penalty conversion to celebrate with the Arsenal striker. As he sprinted past the United defender Chris Smalling, he appeared to shove him and it was one of those moments when one wondered what was going through the man’s head (probably not very much) and was thankful that nothing serious happened.\n\nUnited had arrived fresh from their 3-1 Champions League miracle at Paris St-Germain, which got them into the quarter-finals and boasting a record of nine away wins from nine matches in all competitions under Solskjær. They created the chances to have taken something here but they were strangely out of sync in front of goal. As a former striker, Solskjær knows it can happen. That said, his team – specifically Romelu Lukaku and Fred – were unlucky to be kept out twice by the woodwork.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka scores his side’s first goal of the game. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nUnai Emery rolled the dice with his Arsenal line-up, starting with Aaron Ramsey and Mesut Özil for the first time since 29 September, not to mention Alexandre Lacazette and Aubameyang up front. He wanted to fight fire with fire and he enjoyed an early tonic when Xhaka scored his fourth of the season, although that told only a part of the story.\n\nThe midfielder tried his luck from 25 yards, cutting across the ball with the outside of his left boot and summoning surprising power with the technique. It was the swerve, though, that did for De Gea. He did not see it coming. In fact, he was leaning towards his left and, when the ball began to fizz the other way, he could not react. Solskjær suggested “Xhaka must be Brazilian,” such was the movement he got on the shot.\n\nQuick guide Premier League top-four race: remaining fixtures Show Hide The four-way sprint for the third and fourth Champions League places Tottenham\n\n20 Apr Man City (A)\n\n23 Apr Brighton (h)\n\n27 Apr West Ham (H)\n\n6 May Bournemouth (A)\n\n12 May Everton (H) Arsenal 21 Apr Crystal Palace (H)\n\n24 Apr Wolves (A)\n\n29 Apr Leicester (A)\n\n4 May Brighton (H)\n\n12 May Burnley (A) Manchester United 21 Apr Everton (A)\n\n24 Apr Man City (H)\n\n28 Apr Chelsea (H)\n\n5 May Huddersfield (A)\n\n12 May Cardiff (H) Chelsea 22 Apr Burnley (H)\n\n28 Apr Man Utd (A)\n\n4 May Watford (H)\n\n12 May Leicester (A)\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited’s first effort that came back off the woodwork felt like a wasted opportunity, not least because it denied them the chance to gain control. Lukaku diverted Luke Shaw’s ninth-minute cross down and up against the crossbar and he really ought to have scored. Fred’s near miss came on 19 minutes when he took aim with a low curler from outside the area. It kissed the outside of the post.\n\nMarcus Rashford had two first-half chances – Xhaka blocked the second with an excellent challenge – but it was Lukaku who blew another clear one after he rounded Leno on 36 minutes. The goalkeeper snaked an arm back to thwart him.\n\nArsenal v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nLacazette had two nice moments at the other end in the first half and it was a measure of his threat that Smalling stood off him on the first one. Both were blocked by last-ditch challenges.\n\nSolskjær said he was happy with the overall United performance and they continued to push after the interval. Once again they created an opening for Lukaku and once again Leno saved. Fred played in the striker and he got his shot away under pressure only for Leno, who had left his line quickly, to block. Leno caught Laurent Koscielny with his follow-through and the defender was left with a deep cut to his leg. He played on through the pain, epitomising the Arsenal resilience.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nArsenal flickered around the hour mark, with Aubameyang and Xhaka having sightings of goal, before the penalty changed the complexion of the game. Lacazette had the position on Fred as he surged into the area and, when the United man leaned into him, there was some contact, although not a lot. Lacazette went down and the referee, Jon Moss, angered Solskjær by pointing to the spot.

The Brighton defender ended his charge in front of the travelling supporters, who savoured every moment after seeing their side battle to their first double over their fiercest rivals since the 1983-84 season, and then the celebrations could really begin.\n\nSoon Dunk was bumping chests with Shane Duffy, his gnarled partner in central defence, and then there was the sight of Anthony Knockaert, a picture of pure elation, tearing off the bench to join in with his triumphant teammates.\n\nJames Ward-Prowse free-kick caps Saints comeback against Tottenham Read more\n\nKnockaert’s screamer kept the visitors five points above the bottom three with nine games left and it was also a day to remember for Glenn Murray, who emulated Tommy Cook by notching his 100th league goal for Brighton.\n\nMurray started because Florin Andone suffered a thigh injury during the warm-up, summing up how everything fell neatly into place for the visitors. Hughton admitted he was about to remove Knockaert just before the Frenchman’s bending strike left Vicente Guaita grasping at thin air in the 74th minute, while Palace were entitled to argue the matchwinner should have been sent off for an ugly foul on Luka Milivojevic inside the first minute.\n\n“It was over the ball,” Roy Hodgson said. “It was a bad foul but I presume the referee gave him the benefit of the doubt.” Palace’s manager did not want to dwell on Craig Pawson’s decision to book Knockaert. He was more concerned about a laboured performance from his team, who are above Brighton on goal difference after one win in their past seven home games. Wilfried Zaha was subdued, Michy Batshuayi isolated and the volume in the stands dipped when the visitors snatched an early lead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Glenn Murray opens the scoring.

In different circumstances they might have been pleased that their opponents had to turn to an out-of-form 35-year-old when Andone, who scored the winner against Huddersfield last Saturday, dropped out. Yet the locals knew what to expect from Murray, even though Hughton had dropped the former Palace striker after a run of four goals in 15 matches.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nMurray had scored in his past three appearances against Palace and another chance to hurt his former employers arrived when a long punt from the outstanding Dunk turned into a defence-splitting pass. James Tomkins misread the flight of the ball in the wind, leaving Brighton’s leading scorer free to grab his 11th goal of the season with an angled shot.\n\nBrighton have kept one clean sheet away from home this season and they pressed the self-destruct button in the 50th minute, when Davy Pröpper’s foul on Andros Townsend gave Milivojevic the chance, coolly taken, to equalise from the penalty spot.\n\nBrighton secured their second consecutive victory when Knockaert collected possession on the right, ran at Patrick van Aanholt and used his left foot to curl a stunning shot beyond Guaita from 20 yards.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brighton’s Anthony Knockaert scores the winner.

Reeling from three consecutive defeats and a week that their manager, Neil Warnock, described as their worst in the Premier League, Cardiff produced a performance full of endeavour and grit to lift the doom and gloom and revive their survival hopes.\n\nWith Southampton beating Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton winning at Crystal Palace, results elsewhere did not go in Cardiff’s favour but in many ways that made this victory all the more important. They remain 18th in the table but are now only two points behind Burnley as well as Southampton and, in the words of Warnock, have “brought a few more back into the pack”.\n\nAyoze Pérez and Newcastle stun Everton with three-goal comeback Read more\n\nIt was a particularly good afternoon for Junior Hoilett, who justified his return to the side by scoring the first and also having a hand in the second, which was stabbed over the line by the excellent Victor Camarasa. Oumar Niasse could and should have added a third before the hour mark as West Ham became more and more ragged.\n\nWith Cardiff losing their previous two home games against Watford and Everton, Warnock claimed this was their biggest win of the season. He also took pleasure in highlighting the spirit and togetherness that was on show in the wake of claims from a couple of former players that the players were losing faith with his management.\n\n“That’s the only way you can answer [the critics] really,” Warnock said. “You don’t get a performance like that from a split camp. We wanted to have a go at them from the start and not sit back like we did against Watford. The only disappointment was we didn’t score another two or three in the second half when we had some fabulous opportunities.”\n\nAnthony Knockaert’s screamer gives Brighton victory at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nFrom West Ham’s point of view it was a hugely disappointing result and in keeping with a worrying trend away from home that has seen them lose five of their past six league matches on the road and fail to score in each defeat. Toothless and flat for long periods, West Ham looked and played like a team that are comfortable in mid-table.\n\nAsked about their away form, Manuel Pellegrini, West Ham’s manager, said: “It’s not normal. We need to talk with the players in the week.”\n\nDespite having 71% possession, West Ham registered only two shots on target and one of those was a 45-yard effort from Mark Noble. Felipe Anderson was withdrawn at half-time after another ineffective display and Javier Hernández was booked for diving. It was that sort of day for West Ham, who never carried any sort of threat until 20 minutes from time, when Declan Rice hit the upright and Marko Arnautovic, on for Anderson, forced Neil Etheridge into a save.\n\nCardiff were coasting by that stage. Hoilett, totally unmarked in the six-yard box, neatly converted Josh Murphy’s low centre to give the home team the lead after some lovely play by Camarasa and the same three players were involved in the second goal. Hoilett crossed from the left, Murphy intelligently headed back across goal and there was Camarasa, no more than a couple of yards out, to prod home. Only the combination of Niasse’s profligacy and a fine save from Lukasz Fabianski denied Cardiff a third."}, {"date": "09/03/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 22304,

Brendan Rodgers’s first home match in charge was not perfect – his team were flummoxed for a while in the second half after Floyd Ayité cancelled out Youri Tielemans’s goal – but the hosts deserved their win, confirmed by two goals by Jamie Vardy, who already seems more happy under the new manager than he was under Claude Puel.\n\nVardy often seemed marooned up front under the Frenchman but here he was at the point of a very proactive unit. The first discernible difference between this Leicester and the one most commonly seen under Puel boiled down to personality. Here they played with aggression and flair. They pressed high and hard to win the ball and showed speed and wit once they got it. They were helped at times by Fulham’s staggering inadequacy.\n\nThe lingering concern for the home side was that when the visitors showed some mettle in the second, Leicester’s vulnerability appeared with surprising ease. But they regained the initiative and won.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jonny Evans of Leicester City with Aleksandar Mitrovic. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City via Getty Images\n\nRodgers’s emphasis here was on attack, with a quartet of nimble creators deployed just behind Vardy. When out of possession, all four helped the excellent Wilfried Ndidi to regain it before the opponents even reached the home side’s half. In a first period dominated by the hosts, Fulham did not manage a shot, while Leicester unloaded over a dozen.\n\nSome of the interplay between Leicester’s attackers was a delight, with flicks and canny passes by Tielemans, Harvey Barnes and James Maddison. The breakthrough that had been looking inevitable arrived in the 21st minute, when Ndidi burgled the ball off Kevin McDonald in midfield and threaded it through to Vardy, who drew out the goalkeeper before offering Tielemans an easy finish.\n\nAyoze Pérez and Newcastle stun Everton with three-goal comeback Read more\n\nDuring the break Fulham’s manager, Scott Parker, made a change that helped knock Leicester out of their stride. He replaced Ryan Sessegnon with Ayité. The substitute scored within six minutes, taking down a long pass by Håvard Nordtveit before dashing past two defenders and beating Schmeichel.\n\nNow Leicester were in a contest. “That’s when you have a chance to show spirit and resilience,” said Rodgers. But Leicester lost control of midfield and some of their confidence subsided, although Sergio Rico had to make a superb save to prevent Barnes from curling into the net from 18 yards. Moments later it was Schmeichel’s turn to make a fingertip stop to turn away a header by Aleksandar Mitrovic.\n\nBut then Maddison would pounce on a loose pass by Nordtveit and release Vardy, who rammed the ball into the net. That was his 100th goal for Leicester if you include the one he scored against Manchester United in the 2016 Community Shield – Leicester, however, say they do not count that as a competitive fixture. Vardy made sure he reached the milestone anyway by scoring again via another smart finish after strong work down the left by Barnes.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“We were very good but we need a lot more improvement,” said Rodgers. “What was pleasing was they are trying to implement my ideas in terms of pressing and intensity.

This was some afternoon at St James’ Park. At its end Newcastle had maintained their hopes of Premier League football next season with a comeback from 2-0 down that shredded the nerves of both their fans and Everton’s defenders.\n\nThat Salomón Rondón looked offside as he teed up Ayoze Pérez for the 84th-minute winner was one detail of a hundred in a game that crackled with intensity from kick-off.\n\nCallum Wilson strikes for Bournemouth to add to Huddersfield’s woes Read more\n\nThe facts are that Dominic Calvert-Lewin gave Everton an early lead and that Richarlison made it 2-0 to the visitors just past the half hour. Rondón pulled one back midway through the second half before Pérez struck twice in the last nine minutes. It meant Newcastle had a fifth straight league win for the first time in 15 years.\n\nYet this was hardly the whole story. The goals will be recalled, of course, but there was drama all over the pitch and all through the 95 minutes as Lee Mason let numerous tough challenges go unpunished, as well as choosing to not even book Pickford for his 29th-minute lunge at Rondón, which brought Newcastle a penalty.\n\nWhen it was missed Matt Ritchie and Everton went up the other end to make it 2-0, it seemed to be the day’s defining moment. But Newcastle refused to accept as much, and kept playing. Pérez and Miguel Almirón, supposedly lightweight talents, dug in.\n\nIt was Pérez’s cute 65th-minute chip to Rondón that initiated the fightback, the Venezuelan lashing in a volley past Pickford that may have taken a slight deflection off Jonjoe Kenny. Rafael Benítez, not normally a man for exaggeration, compared Pérez’s pass to the output of Lionel Messi and Rondón’s finish to that of Alan Shearer.\n\n“Once we scored,” Benítez said, “everyone started believing we could score again.”\n\nFour minutes after that the substitute Paul Dummett almost snatched an equaliser, but it was not until minute 81 that it came.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everton’s Jordan Pickford brings down Newcastle’s Salomón Rondón – before saving the resulting penalty. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\nPickford, who had an upside-down afternoon, was rocked back by a 30-yard drive from Almirón. The ball ricocheted to Pérez, who hit the rebound under Pickford.\n\nSt James’ was now in a fever and three minutes later Isaac Hayden lofted an Everton clearing header back over the defence as it moved out. The lob dropped to Rondón and with a touch of his thigh, the ball was with Pérez six yards out and he battered a volley past the exposed Pickford.\n\nAs the ground erupted, Silva claimed offside, then confronted Mason as he left the pitch. “The third goal is a big mistake by the assistant. It was clear offside – not just one player, not two, but five. It’s not in doubt.” Replays showed he was correct, though that will be of zero consolation.\n\nJamie Vardy brings up century with double to finish Fulham resistance Read more\n\n“It’s a big frustration because for 45 minutes we were really good, aggressive,” Silva added. “But at half-time I said the game is not finished, we have to do the same again. We should have killed the match.”\n\nIt had started so well, Everton’s ploy of attacking Newcastle’s left leading to a hasty Ritchie clearance 18 minutes in. Lucas Digne collected it, exchanged passes with Bernard and then floated a lovely cross that Calvert-Lewin guided beyond Martin Dubravka with his head.\n\nRitchie atoned by supplying the centre Pickford fluffed prior to the penalty. Pickford deliberately pulled down Rondón as the keeper realised his error. Perhaps the position of Kurt Zouma persuaded Mason not to show Pickford a red card. The Sunderland-born man then relished saving Ritchie’s kick.\n\nAlmost immediately André Gomes broke into the Newcastle box and rattled Dubravka with a fierce low cross. The keeper could only parry the ball away but it was directly to Richarlison.\n\nIt was 2-0 to Everton and Newcastle had a small mountain to climb.

How else to explain what took place on a wild afternoon on the south coast as Southampton staged a remarkable comeback to clinch a victory that will be spoken about in these parts for some time and has surely injected Ralph Husenhüttl’s side with the belief they can, and will, avoid relegation.\n\nThat much could be taken from the scenes at the final whistle. The home crowd were on their feet in rapturous applause as Southampton’s players formed a huddle. They looked like men who had just gone to war and, to some extent, they had. Battered by Tottenham during a one-sided first period, the hosts played the second half with a relentless determination to cancel out Harry Kane’s goal on 26 minutes.\n\nMauricio Pochettino accuses Tottenham of ‘arrogance’ and ‘complacency’ Read more\n\nAnd ultimately they were successful as Yan Valery equalised and James Ward-Prowse struck the winner with a curling free-kick nine minutes from full time.\n\nCue bedlam in the stands and, in the directors’ box, a sense of shock and fury within the Argentinian who used to be the main man here. Serving the first instalment of a two-game touchline ban for improper conduct, Mauricio Pochettino could only look on as his current club wilted against his former one. He later accused his players of arrogance and the bigger picture is that, having qualified for the quarter-finals of the Champions League with victory over Borussia Dortmund, Spurs may not qualify for next season’s edition of the competition via their league position. They remain third but are now only three points ahead of Manchester United in fourth and four ahead of Arsenal in fifth, before their meeting on Sunday, and have played a game more than both sides.\n\n“A lot of people will now realise our real level,” said Pochettino, but the truth is nobody really does. After all, this is a team that can deliver two incredibly impressive displays against the leaders of the Bundesliga and, within the same period, lose at Burnley and Southampton. It must be a maddening state of affairs for those who filled the away end here.\n\nPlay Video 2:20 Pochettino on Spurs' defeat: 'It was about complacency and arrogance' – video\n\nBy the end it felt like a trick of the mind to remember just how Tottenham dominated territory and possession in the first half via assured movement and incisive passing. Their defence were rarely troubled while in midfield Dele Alli simply picked up from where he had left off in his first appearance since sustaining a hamstring injury in late January.\n\nIn attack Kane was a constant menace and scored his 200th career goal with a composed finish following a slick exchange of passes with Alli, albeit the England captain appeared to be marginally offside when he struck.\n\nIt was comfortable for the visitors and while Pochettino stayed in text-message contact with his coaching staff below, led by assistant Jesus Perez, there was little to worry him. In truth the 47-year-old could have kept his phone in his pocket.\n\nSouthampton ended the first half not having had a single shot on target. They looked beaten. But then came the break and a crucial double substitution by Hasenhüttl. On came Shane Long and Josh Sims for Oriol Romeu and Charlie Austin and suddenly the hosts were playing with more drive and energy, causing panic in Tottenham’s defensive ranks.\n\nAnd it was that panic, allied to a general drop in intensity by the visitors, that led to Southampton’s equaliser. Stuart Armstong, on as a 73rd-minute substitute for Long after the striker sustained a hamstring injury, delivered a low cross that Davinson Sánchez and Jan Vertonghen both missed and Danny Rose allowed to run between his legs in the belief that nobody was behind him.\n\nBut someone was – Valery, who struck from close range to secure his second goal in two games following his stunning strike against Manchester United last week.\n\nJunior Hoilett strike inspires Cardiff to crucial victory over West Ham Read more\n\nTottenham were increasingly out of ideas in attack and all over the place in defence, summed up by the moment Kyle Walker-Peters clipped Armstrong as he drove forward.

He had scored his 16th, 17th and 18th goals of the season, all in the space of a 13-minute blitz, and played the starring role in a victory that strengthens Manchester City’s position at the top of the Premier League. No wonder their supporters gave him such an ovation when he was substituted shortly after securing the match-ball as a souvenir.\n\nThe only surprise, perhaps, was that the person who had ordered his removal seemed a little reluctant to join in with the praise. “He can do better,” was Pep Guardiola’s verdict, repeated more than once. Sterling, according to his manager, had been a touch careless with some of his passes and not helped out enough in defence during the first half. Which was an unusual complaint given that one of the more telling statistics from the opening 45 minutes was that Watford had managed a grand total of six passes in the final third of the pitch.\n\nManchester City 3-1 Watford: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIt must be hard trying to please a perfectionist but Sterling can still reflect on a satisfying day’s work and deep down Guardiola must be happy too, now his team are four points clear in the position that until recently Liverpool were occupying. This was City’s sixth league win in a row. They have all the momentum, albeit having played a game more than Liverpool, and it is difficult to imagine they will care too greatly that their latest victory, just like the previous one against West Ham, had a sizeable amount of controversy attached to it.\n\nIt was certainly another complicated day in the life of football’s offside rule bearing in mind Sterling’s first goal had initially been ruled out by a linesman’s flag. Ilkay Gündogan had chipped the ball into the penalty area, Sergio Agüero had applied the next touch and Sterling had strayed a yard or so behind the home defence. Offside? Most people would have presumed so. Not, however, the referee, Paul Tierney, who noted that Daryl Janmaat, the nearest defender, had slid in to get his toe to the ball before it ricocheted off Sterling’s left knee and looped flukily into the net.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raheem Sterling puts Manchester City ahead after the referee and linesman decided he was not offside. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nJanmaat’s involvement did not change some basic facts, namely that Sterling had been offside from Agüero’s flick-on and was going for the ball, prominently involved in play. Yet Tierney came away from a lengthy discussion with his assistant, Adrian Holmes, by deciding to overrule the original decision and declare Sterling was, in fact, onside. Confused? Well, join the club. Javi Gracia, the Watford manager, tries not to be a critic of referees and showed commendable restraint afterwards, noting only his belief it was very much the wrong decision. As for Guardiola, he pointed out that English football should have had VAR in place long before now.\n\nUntil that point City had found it surprisingly difficult to find a way through Watford’s congested defence. Indeed, the home side’s first-half display was by their standards a bit of a stinker. Yet the goal settled them down.\n\nSterling’s second goal came four minutes later and, after that, it was an exercise in damage limitation for Watford, whose team selection strongly indicated that Gracia was prioritising the FA Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace next weekend. Gracia made seven changes and for long spells the sum total of his team’s ambitions seemed to be to avoid the hiding they encountered against Liverpool in their previous away fixture, losing 5-0. It was little surprise, with so many alterations, that Watford went down to their 13th successive defeat against a top-six opponent, a run that stretches back to January 2017.\n\nJürgen Klopp must ease tensions not feed them to write Liverpool history | Daniel Taylor Read more\n\nCity, of course, are used to coming up against opponents with limited ambitions. The trick for the reigning champions is to remain patient and wear down the opposition with the quick, incisive passing for which Guardiola’s teams are renowned. It took a while here before they found their usual routine and started to open up Watford with the kind of passing exchange that led to Sterling turning in the second goal.\n\nSterling might not have pleased his manager with every aspect of his play but he has a wonderful knack of popping up inside the six-yard area to make himself available in a scoring position. For a player whose starting position is on the wing with instructions to stretch the play, it makes him a highly effective attacker. Riyad Mahrez supplied the pass, having been picked out by David Silva, and Sterling was left with a relatively simple finish.\n\nSilva was involved again when Sterling jinked into the penalty area to finish his hat-trick by clipping a shot over Ben Foster. That was the best goal of the match and, with more than half an hour to play, the home crowd might have expected their team to add some extra sheen to their goal-difference column.\n\nInstead the league leaders were denied a fifth successive clean sheet when two of Watford’s substitutes combined for the next goal.

Watford provided an instant crash course in the perpetual uncertainty of the Premier League’s middle third and, when the substitute Andre Gray ran through in added time to send a charged-up Vicarage Road into raptures, it felt like enough to stop even the most incorrigible optimist in their tracks.\n\nPositivity, delusion, call it what you will, Rodgers’s outlook may reap rewards in the long run but this was an early reminder that his new challenge will come with its share of bruises.\n\nWatford v Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThat was the case here in a literal sense, Javi Gracia’s supremely drilled Watford team setting about Leicester with the best version of their dynamic, physical approach to knock them off their stride for long periods after Troy Deeney’s early goal. When Jamie Vardy equalised 15 minutes from time a draw seemed about right but, moments after Wes Morgan had missed a glorious chance to give Rodgers a flying start, they were left reeling.\n\n“We’re obviously disappointed to lose when it looked like we were the team that was going to win it,” Rodgers said. Leicester had wrested control in the latter stages but were lightly staffed at the back when Kasper Schmeichel, looking to launch the ball upfield for another assault on Watford’s goal, cleared poorly and saw Étienne Capoue return it with interest. Deeney, whose all-round performance was exemplary, had the presence of mind to send Gray away with a reverse pass and the calm finish that followed left the home support feeling vindicated.\n\nThe noise had been ramped up after what they perceived to be a succession of poor decisions from the referee, Jonathan Moss, who booked five of their players and was engaged in discussion by Gracia at the end. The presence of Rodgers, greeted dutifully by boos at the start on account of his short-lived tenure here a decade ago, drew little ire in comparison although the chants at full time of “Javi Gracia, he’s better than you” gave the impression of a score being settled to some degree.\n\nBefore Celtic fans damn Brendan Rodgers they should look at their club’s behaviour | Kevin McKenna Read more\n\n“I didn’t hear so much, to be honest,” Rodgers said of any opprobrium from the stands. Watford’s fans had been able to exercise themselves for different reasons within five minutes of kick-off. Schmeichel had already saved from Adrian Mariappa after Leicester had not dealt with a right‑sided free‑kick, Morgan blocking Gerard Deulofeu’s attempt on the rebound, when they were punished from the other flank. Deulofeu produced the kind of whipped, venomous delivery that renders defences almost helpless; it only needed a touch and Deeney applied it, the faintest of flicks carrying the ball at speed beyond Schmeichel. Replays suggested he had been offside by a shoulder’s width but, in a VAR‑free environment, it is no shame that decisions this marginal should favour the attacker.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nIt was, as Rodgers later pointed out, a characteristically slow start but Leicester straightened up and steadily improved. He had recalled Morgan and set them up with a back three to combat Watford’s power; his predecessor, Claude Puel, had employed that system only once and it was little surprise that their opponents, secure in their 4-4-2, looked the more certain. Clear chances were rare in the first half but Rodgers was pleased to see them take on board his interval instructions to speed things up.\n\n“In the second half they didn’t think so much, they were just passing freely and pushing them deep,” he said. “There were lots of good elements to our play and it was very encouraging.” Leicester looked fluent whenever Youri Tielemans could find space to play forward to James Maddison. Both are delightful to watch and it was the former who created Vardy’s leveller with a well-weighted through ball that the striker teased past Ben Foster.\n\nVardy departed soon after, still feeling the effects of a first-half collision with the Watford keeper that had seen both players require extensive treatment.\n\nHad he, rather than Morgan, been around to get his head on Maddison’s cross in the final minute of normal time, the turnaround might have been complete. “We know we need to improve,” Rodgers said. “There’s lots of areas we need to be better in but there’s lots of potential in there. It’s the second-youngest team in the Premier League.”\n\nIn the end they paid the price for letting the experienced right foot of Deeney give Gray his shot at heroism. “The feelings I can see in my players [are that] all of them want more and more, they are very ambitious,” Gracia said of his team, who drew level on points with seventh-placed Wolves.

The cross was met with a slap from Aleksandar Mitrovic’s forehead only for Arrizabalaga to leap to his left and push away the Serbian’s effort at full stretch, preserve a vital win in the process.\n\nThe Spaniard had learned of his recall in the team’s technical meeting only two hours before kick-off, and Sarri suggested post-match that others might have been cast aside for far longer had they committed a similar offence to the goalkeeper’s at Wembley. “There was another way [to react]: to put him out of the squad for the rest of the season,” the Italian said. “I could have killed him. But, considering the man, that was not an option. I know him very well and spoke with him during this week and he understood. His behaviour during the week and reaction today were really very good.

As a club they, too, could look back at the events of the last few days as the moment the tide turned – perhaps not in terms of this season, with their predicament more desperate by the week, but certainly when it comes to longer-term planning.\n\nScott Parker’s appointment as caretaker manager following Claudio Ranieri’s departure has clearly breathed new life into Fulham’s forward ranks. Tom Cairney and Ryan Sessegnon, mainstays of the team promoted last May, looked more their old selves here, as if liberated from the burden of a club’s toils, and Fulham’s slippery movement and relentless running rendered what had initially seemed a comfortable Chelsea success appear distinctly precarious.\n\nParker’s involvement should help heal some of the self-inflicted wounds this club has endured over an anticlimax of a campaign. “There was a brand and identity to Fulham that everyone understood: a passing team at a lovely, family football club,” he said. “But have those same words come to people’s minds this season? I don’t think so. I wanted to bring the fans back and I feel like we did today.”\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nHe had sought to free up the likes of Sessegnon, who had “had the weight of the world on his shoulders, and hadn’t been playing well”, and the teenager was a threat once again. Parker may not be able to keep Fulham up but he should restore the faith at the club before their almost certain return to the Championship.\n\nTheir only reward here briefly restored parity, an unmarked Calum Chambers volleying in as Chelsea dawdled at a short corner, though the visitors should have established an unassailable lead back when they boasted energy and invention in their approach. Gonzalo Higuaín might have had a hat-trick before the interval, the Argentinian benefiting from Jorginho’s subtle delivery and the pace and incision of runners down either flank. It had been his emphatic finish from César Azpilicueta’s centre, which put the visitors ahead and registered their first away league goal of the calendar year.\n\nSergio Rico denied Higuaín and Eden Hazard before, moments after Chambers’ goal, the Belgian cut into the penalty area and, rather than shooting, slid a pass to an untracked Jorginho on the edge of the penalty area. The Italy midfielder’s finish was pinpoint and precise, whipped into the top corner. “It’s not been easy for him this season,” Sarri said. The same could apply to the coach himself, as well as Fulham.

Everton’s long wait for victory in a Merseyside derby goes on but they found ample compensation in damaging their rivals’ bid for the Premier League title.\n\nOn a local level the 233rd Merseyside derby brought Liverpool closer to the nine-year anniversary of their last defeat by Everton and extended their unbeaten run to a record 17 matches. But Liverpool are not competing on a local level this season, not when a first league championship since 1990 stands tantalisingly on the horizon. By that rarefied standard this represented a fairly dispiriting trip across Stanley Park for Klopp. The comfort belonged mainly to Marco Silva and his committed team who, as the noise levels that greeted an otherwise forgettable goalless draw testified, departed the happier by far.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mohamed Salah reacts as another chances goes begging for Liverpool against Everton at Goodison Park. Photograph: Magi Haroun/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nFor the first time since 7 December Liverpool find themselves playing catch-up to Manchester City in the title race, having played an identical number of games. Their manager’s defiant message to the away support afterwards spoke of resilience and belief, and neither should be undermined by a one-point gap, but a fourth draw in six league outings reflects the lack of conviction that has afflicted Liverpool too often in 2019. They created the clearest openings at Goodison with Mohamed Salah clean through on goal twice and Fabinho presented with a golden opportunity at close range. None were taken thanks to interventions that reflected Everton’s wholehearted display through Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane and Lucas Digne respectively.\n\nEverton were certainly up for the 200th league edition of the most played derby in English football, crowd and players alike. Goodison was a febrile old place before kick-off as it produced its finest atmosphere of the season for a fixture that offered Silva’s side an opportunity to connect with an exasperated fanbase. Tony Bellew, the former world champion boxer and vocal Evertonian, said a few prayers when the game began and within seconds a pumped-up Seamus Coleman clattered into Divock Origi, Liverpool’s 96th-minute hero when the rivals met in December. Theo Walcott of all people collected the first booking for a foul on the same player after merely seven minutes.\n\nLiverpool needed time to find their rhythm in the face of a quick and aggressive Everton display. Dominic Calvert-Lewin refused to be intimidated by the power and height in Liverpool’s central defence and worked ferociously across the front line, though he was too often left isolated when Pickford pinged wasteful clearances in the young Everton striker’s direction.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nThe England goalkeeper’s distribution was erratic at best but his shot-stopping could not be faulted when Liverpool created the only clear chance of a frenetic first half. Everton’s shape was occasionally ragged and the space between their central defenders and midfielders would have been manna from heaven for Roberto Firmino. Unfortunately for Klopp his influential Brazilian was fit enough for only the final 27 minutes from the bench having injured an ankle at Manchester United last Sunday.\n\nA mistake by Morgan Schneiderlin presented Liverpool with their first opening. His failure to control a short pass enabled Fabinho to release Salah with a perfectly weighted pass. Salah sprinted in from the right, Pickford stood his ground and made a fine stop to his right. Coleman threw himself in the way of Jordan Henderson’s shot from the rebound and Everton escaped.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland captain was alert to stop Salah latching on to a superb ball over the Everton defence by Henderson as Liverpool, with their breathtaking speed and numbers on the break, carried the greater threat.An end product, a touch of composure and quality on the ball were lacking in both teams, however. This was another in the lengthy list of Merseyside derbies that resembled a scrap more than a spectacle.\n\nAlisson was forced into his first save of the game early in an improved second half when Calvert-Lewin met Digne’s corner with a glancing header. Pickford, his clearances sailing out of play or on to a Liverpool player’s head with alarming regularity, saved comfortably from a Trent Alexander-Arnold free-kick.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSalah was given another clear run at Pickford’s goal when Joël Matip ghosted beyond Schneiderlin and put the forward through via a deflection off Kurt Zouma. Liverpool’s leading marksman seemed poised to convert when Keane launched himself into an excellent and vital interception. Another last-ditch tackle, this time from Digne, denied Fabinho as the Brazilian midfielder was about to bury a Virgil Van Dijk header across goal at close range.\n\nWith Firmino and James Milner entering the fray courtesy of a double substitution by Klopp, who withdrew the subdued Georginio Wijnaldum and Origi respectively, the visitors had several openings to punish Everton on the counter-attack late on but failed to capitalise. Matip and Van Dijk were both wayward with presentable headers.\n\nThe hosts, too, had their glimmers of opportunity in a more open second half with Richarlison improving their approach down the right. Bernard was millimetres away from connecting with the winger’s low cross and was also foiled by a fine Van Dijk tackle as he sought to weave his way into the area. Klopp’s team could not repeat their habit of punishing Everton at the frantic end this time and it is advantage Manchester City, albeit a slim one."}, {"date": "02/03/2019", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 81332, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Moura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver Skipp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Bernd Leno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sokratis Papastathopoulos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Guendouzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Torreira", "yellows": [], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [90], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Denis Suárez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "On the finest of margins can matches – and even seasons – turn. Tottenham were labouring against their bitter rivals, seemingly out of ideas against an Arsenal team that led through Aaron Ramsey and had executed Unai Emery’s gameplan to the letter.\n\nSpurs were staring at a third consecutive Premier League defeat and the last time that happened was in 2012. The implications were grave. Mauricio Pochettino had conceded that the title was out of reach for his team after the losses at Burnley and Chelsea but another reverse would have imperilled their top-four hopes while simultaneously encouraging those of Arsenal.\n\nBournemouth v Man City, Manchester United v Southampton and more – live! Read more\n\nThen Christian Eriksen floated in a 73rd-minute free-kick and everything changed. Harry Kane was in an offside position but, contentiously, it was not spotted. If the Spurs striker had not been ahead of the line, perhaps Shkodran Mustafi would not have felt the need to barge him. But he did and when the penalty was awarded Kane duly converted for his ninth goal in nine north London derbies.\n\nSpurs had their reprieve. Or did they? There was still time for another twist, another drama, after another penalty controversy. This time it was for Arsenal and in the 89th minute. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the substitute, had the position on Davinson Sánchez and, as the Spurs defender leaned in on him, there was a tussle.\n\nIt was difficult to see what sent Aubameyang tumbling but the referee, Anthony Taylor, spotted something and he stunned the majority of the 81,332 crowd by pointing to the spot. Aubameyang addressed the kick and it stood to give Arsenal a sixth win in seven league games but, agonisingly for him, Hugo Lloris read his intentions and dived low to save. Lloris had made mistakes in the Chelsea defeat. Now he was the hero.\n\nThere was more. When Alex Iwobi crossed from the rebound, Aubameyang looked set to tap into the empty net only for Jan Vertonghen to make a last-ditch slide challenge. Vertonghen had encroached deeply into the area on the penalty but he got away with it. Without that, would he have been able to make the tackle?\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nIt ended up as a hard luck story for Arsenal, who had felt that a first away league win over a big-six rival since January 2015 at Manchester City was on. Emery had asked his players to sit deep, stay behind the ball and tackle with everything they had, which they did – even if another substitute, Lucas Torreira, overstepped the mark at the very end. He was high and out of control when he crashed into Danny Rose to receive a straight red card.\n\nThen again, Rose had clattered into the Arsenal goalkeeper, Bernd Leno, on 68 minutes as he stretched for the ball inside the area with his studs up. He was given a yellow card. At the very end, Sánchez appeared to kick out at Laurent Koscielny. It was a game in which Taylor’s decisions came under an unforgiving spotlight and one that, in Emery’s opinion, showed why VAR will be introduced next season.\n\n“Today’s referees have big personality but it’s not enough to make the best decisions in the difficult actions in the box,” Emery said. “VAR is coming to help them. It’s positive for English football.”\n\nArsenal’s run-in continues at home to Manchester United next Sunday but, that apart, it appears relatively kind. How different their situation would have looked with a victory here. The relief belonged to Spurs, who had started nervously and fallen behind to Ramsey’s goal.\n\nPochettino drew attention to a cynical 12th-minute tackle from Granit Xhaka on Kane, which cut down the striker as he broke and was clearly worth a booking. Pochettino suggested that it could have been a red card and was the “turning point” of the game. That felt like a stretch.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Kane got up to equalise from the spot for Spurs but he had been offside before being fouled. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Observer\n\nWhat shaped the game was Ramsey’s burst and finish on 15 minutes. Sánchez overcommitted to reaching a ball out of the Arsenal defence in front of Alexandre Lacazette and, when he missed it, his opponent sent Ramsey away. The Juventus-bound midfielder had the entire Spurs half into which to sprint and he rounded Lloris, held off Victor Wanyama and rolled home.\n\nLacazette had snatched at a second-minute chance – he looked offside, although there was no flag – and there was a vulnerability about Spurs as they pressed high and left spaces in behind. Iwobi almost made them pay in the 42nd minute when he ran and curled for the far corner, but Lloris saved.\n\nSpurs made attacking inroads in the second half of the first period and they would have been level at the interval but for Leno’s marvellous double save from Eriksen and Moussa Sissoko. Kane had seen a header correctly ruled out for offside but Arsenal defended well both as a unit and in the one-on-ones. Sokratis Papastathopoulos was particularly impressive, and the clear man of the match.\n\nEmery made bold decisions, chiefly the switch to a back four and the omissions of Mesut Özil and Aubameyang from the starting lineup. He was vindicated. “I’m proud of the players,” Emery said. “It was about playing like a team, feeling together. We could have won.”\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nSpurs had too many players who were below their best. Kieran Trippier sank to his knees after overcooking one cross for Son Heung-min while at the other end, he struggled to contain the impressive Iwobi.

A fifth straight league victory for Manchester City, courtesy of Riyad Mahrez’s second-half goal, means that Pep Guardiola’s side can enjoy the view from the top of the table while cranking up the pressure on their rivals. Liverpool face Everton at Goodison Park and will need to win if they want to regain top spot in a title race where there is so little margin for error.\n\nIt may have been a scrappy goal that settled this contest but the gulf in class was huge. To put the game into perspective, Bournemouth failed to register an attempt on goal of any description and never even managed to win a corner. Eddie Howe’s team had only 18% of possession and City were so dominant that it actually felt strange to see Bournemouth stray into the opposition half on the odd occasion.\n\nAubameyang fluffs late Arsenal penalty to hand Spurs controversial draw Read more\n\nThat is more of a compliment to City than a criticism of Bournemouth. Guardiola’s side passed the ball to death and were in so much control that it is no exaggeration to say it seemed as though they had an extra two players on the pitch for much of the afternoon. “We played incredible, one of the best performances we’ve ever played,” Guardiola said.\n\n“We didn’t concede one shot on target. Every time we lost the ball we had three or four guys going to recover it. Bournemouth are incredibly well organised, with 11 players in the box, so there’s really no spaces – but we found them. We created a lot of chances. I don’t know what’s going to happen at the end of the season but these players deserve all my admiration and respect. Today was a special moment for all of us.”\n\nThe only sour note for Manchester City was the sight of Kevin De Bruyne pulling up with a hamstring injury towards the end of the first half. De Bruyne knew immediately he had a problem and walked straight off the pitch before Mahrez, his replacement, had time to get his shirt on. “Kevin felt something in the hamstring. It’s normal, we’ve played 25 games in 93 days,” said Guardiola, who confirmed that his decision to withdraw John Stones early in the second half was more of a precaution because the defender felt a little bit of discomfort with the groin injury that has been troubling him recently.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nGuardiola acknowledged that the decisive goal was important for Mahrez as well as City. It was the club-record signing’s first in the league in almost three months and came on the back of a disappointing performance against West Ham in midweek, when he looked short of confidence and was substituted early in the second half.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riyad Mahrez fires home the only goal. Photograph: Sean Ryan/IPS/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n“His time is going to come because there are a lot of games,” Guardiola said. “I don’t have any doubts about his quality. I know his mentality is aggressive but he has to understand where he is, and where he is is a team who got 100 points [last season] and in every single game fight and run and play. The people in front are Leroy [Sané], who last season was one of the most important players we had, Bernardo [Silva], who is the best player in the league, and Raheem [Sterling], so they are incredible players.”\n\nAs with the 1-0 win over West Ham in midweek, this was a day when City needed to be patient, and that approach paid off 10 minutes into the second half.\n\nOleksandr Zinchenko and David Silva swapped passes and then City got a little bit of luck when the ball fell kindly to the Spaniard after Charlie Daniels tried to make a challenge. David Silva shifted the ball on to Mahrez and the winger stabbed a low right-foot shot inside Artur Boruc’s near post.\n\nUnderworked up until that stage, Boruc was about to get busy. Sterling was denied on a couple of occasions by the Bournemouth goalkeeper, who also pushed Sergio Agüero’s cross on to the bar and repelled Mahrez’s far-post header.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian

overall,” Howe said. “The only disappointment for me would be that their goal is probably the ugliest they will score this season.”"}, {"date": "02/03/2019", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance":

the result was all that mattered as far as Brighton & Hove Albion were concerned. Teams in their position have to take whatever they can get at this stage of the season and the relief was immense after Chris Hughton’s side eased their relegation fears with their first league victory of 2019.\n\nThis had threatened to be another frustrating day for Brighton. Yet they kept plugging away, breaking Huddersfield’s resistance thanks to a late header from Florin Andone, and will feel that they have turned a corner after rising five points above Cardiff in 18th place. “It does feel like a big win,” Hughton said.\n\nRomelu Lukaku strikes twice as Manchester United beat Southampton Read more\n\nA visit from the division’s bottom side came at a good time for Brighton, who had slid away from mid-table obscurity after seven games without a win, although they struggled to seize the initiative during a dismal first half.\n\nAs a measure of how bad it was as a spectacle, it took until the 32nd minute for either team to have a shot. It would have gone down as a goalkeeping error if Mat Ryan had allowed Alex Pritchard’s powerful effort to beat him, however, and it was difficult to think of many moments when Huddersfield looked like scoring. Their lack of conviction frustrated Jan Siewert, who refused to discuss reports that he dropped Jason Puncheon following an argument with the winger after last weekend’s defeat at Newcastle.\n\nThe better openings fell to Brighton, who almost lifted the tension when Alireza Jahanbakhsh struck the bar with a dipping effort just before the interval. Yet they could not complain about being booed off at half-time and Hughton had some stern words for his players during the interval.\n\n“It had to be a balance of getting into the players and telling them what I thought and making sure they didn’t lose control in the second half,” the Brighton manager said. “We don’t have to score in the first five minutes – that was the message. But we expect more.”\n\nBrighton played with more urgency during the second half. Juninho Bacuna denied Glenn Murray with a brilliant saving challenge and Jahanbakhsh threatened again after breaking clear on the left, only for Jonas Lössl to save the winger’s bending shot. Andone, on for the lethargic Murray, would also test Huddersfield’s goalkeeper.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSiewert rued the moment when Huddersfield, who are 13 points below 17th-placed Southampton with nine games left, switched off at a free-kick in the 79th minute. Brighton took it quickly, Anthony Knockaert had time to chip a cross into the middle from the left and Andone was more alert than anyone else, darting into the six-yard box to glance a clever header past Lössl.\n\n“In one situation we were not switched on,” the Huddersfield manager said. “I am angry. Look how many supporters came from miles away. And we go away with nothing. This is hard.

to overcome spirited resistance when Southampton fought back to 2-2 late in the second half – but two goals from a rejuvenated Romelu Lukaku kept their revival on the road.\n\nPaul Pogba missed the chance to give the scoreline a flattering gloss when he saw a stoppage-time penalty saved, though going down to four goals would have been very hard on a spirited Southampton. “Romelu is a quality striker with a goalscorer’s instincts,” Solskjær said. “He knows what he wants to do and he has the ability to deliver it.”\n\nManchester City go top after Riyad Mahrez goal sinks Bournemouth Read more\n\nLukaku nevertheless needed time to warm up. United began as if they intended to have the game wrapped up by half-time and Southampton were indebted to Angus Gunn for three saves in the first six minutes that prevented the home side taking an early lead. The Saints goalkeeper tipped a Lukaku shot round a post, did well to react to a cheeky attempt from distance by Andreas Pereira and then saved at close range from Lukaku again when the striker should really have scored.\n\nAfter surviving that initial onslaught Southampton began to push their opponents back and grow into the game, gradually asserting authority over a fairly callow United midfield. They could have taken the lead after 12 minutes when Jannik Vestergaard climbed unchallenged to meet a James Ward-Prowse corner and headed wastefully over the bar, and might have had a penalty when Chris Smalling got away with a blatant tug on Ryan Bertrand’s shirt.\n\nIn an effort to break the Southampton press Paul Pogba made a length-of-the-field break up the left, helped by Lukaku on the halfway line, but held on to the ball a fraction too long for his intended target Marcus Rashford to stay onside. Pogba was possibly at fault, however, when Southampton took the lead a few minutes later – at least, there was no one in his position on the left side of midfield when Charlie Austin found Valery in miles of space.\n\nTaking advantage of Luke Shaw backing off with his hands behind his back, the Southampton wing-back advanced a couple of paces before unleashing a ferocious shot that beat David de Gea from a good five yards outside the area. The goalkeeper managed to get hands to the ball but could not keep it out, only succeeding in pushing it into his top-left corner. It was the 20-year-old’s first goal in English football and he is unlikely to ever score a better one.\n\nWhen the already ineffective Alexis Sánchez departed injured five minutes into the second half it appeared United might be struggling for an attacking replacement when the full-back Diogo Dalot took his place. The opposite proved to be the case. With his first touch of the afternoon Dalot produced a cross to the far post from which Rashford should have hit the target, and with his second he teed up Pereira for the game’s second goal-of-the-month contender.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andreas Pereira curls home United’s equaliser to make it 1-1. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe midfielder made the most of the space he was given to beat Gunn with a rising shot from just outside the area for his first Premier League goal, but what was noticeable was that Dalot had produced more in a couple of minutes than the laboured Sánchez had managed in almost an hour. Certainly either the equaliser or the substitution seemed to perk up the home side, for in another five minutes they were in front, Lukaku neatly eluding Jan Bednarek in the area to give himself room for a low shot beyond Gunn.\n\nJust for a moment it appeared United might overrun Southampton as the chances began to pile up at the Stretford End, but though they were stretched the visiting defence held out until the next spectacular goal arrived, courtesy of Ward-Prowse. There might have been some doubt over whether Ashley Young actually fouled Stuart Armstrong to give away a free-kick – it was more of a collision that left both players on the floor – but there was no debating the accuracy and power summoned by Ward-Prowse to beat De Gea from outside the area for a second time.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nWere points awarded for the quality of goals Southampton might not have left Old Trafford empty handed, though in reality United are always dangerous in the closing minutes of a game and the visitors paid the penalty for a late lapse of concentration when Lukaku was allowed to turn on the edge of the area to take a short pass from Fred. Though Gunn was beaten for a third time, he did manage to keep out Pogba’s penalty, awarded after Armstrong had fouled Rashford.

outclassed Cardiff City from start to finish here suggests these teams are heading in markedly different directions.\n\nDiogo Jota and Raúl Jiménez, a neatly blossoming strike partnership, led this Wolves destruction, with both scoring slick goals as Warnock’s side slipped to a third consecutive defeat. As for Wolves, by moving on to 43 points for the season they have accrued their highest all-time Premier League points total.\n\nFlorin Andone’s late header gives Brighton vital win over Huddersfield Read more\n\nBut for the Cardiff keeper Neil Etheridge, Wolves would have scored five or six. At the other end, Nuno outlined that John Ruddy would make his first league start of the season to build match sharpness before their FA Cup quarter-final date with Manchester United in two weeks’ time. But, other than fumbling Aron Gunnarsson’s early chance and collecting Sean Morrison’s free header, the Wolves goalkeeper was untroubled as the hosts repeatedly poured forward.\n\nMoments before opening the scoring, Jota had raced to the byline, comfortably bypassing Morrison, the Cardiff captain, and it was Wolves’ quick-thinking that gave them an early advantage. A dizzying spider’s web of intricate passes on the edge of the box between Jota, Jiménez and Morgan Gibbs-White, the talented 19-year-old, sent the visitors in a spin and culminated with the former coolly slotting beyond Etheridge.\n\nThings went from bad to worse for Cardiff little more than 60 seconds later, with Wolves wrapping up victory inside 18 minutes, as the strikers combined to deadly effect once more. This time, Cardiff cheaply surrendered possession inside their own half when Morrison missed a header. Despite swivelling away from Jota to momentarily escape trouble, Sol Bamba ran into trouble in the shape of Jiménez, who powered towards the box.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe Mexican unselfishly searched out Jota, who peeled off to the back post, with a wonderful hoisted pass only for his strike partner to return the favour, nudging the ball into his path and allowing Jiménez to hammer home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raul Jiménez hammers home. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n“We’re not scoring goals and conceding silly ones,” said Warnock. “We have to get a goal in front for a change.”\n\nWolves should have sailed away with it, but Etheridge pulled out a string of magnificent stops. Before the interval he deflected Leander Dendoncker’s strike out for a corner after the Belgium midfielder rattled the woodwork, and, in the second half, he palmed away Rúben Vinagre’s powerful drive. But Etheridge saved his best stop until last, superbly denying Jiménez a second with a strong right hand after the forward checked inside Bruno Manga.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nAdama Traoré proved a handful on his first league start since December, continually driving through the Cardiff spine to leave their defenders panting in his wake time and again; his blistering pace plunged Bamba into trouble too, with the Cardiff defender carried off on a stretcher injured after hauling down the Wolves winger on halfway. Warnock said Bamba will miss the rest of the season if initial fears are founded.\n\nAs for Nuno, his decision to give some of his key men, namely Rúben Neves, a breather looked justified.\n\n“It is a very small squad, 16 players and the goalkeepers,” Nuno said. “When you have a tough cycle of games in a week, the third one is the one that we believe requires some attention.”"}, {"date":

to Billy Bonds, around 20,000 of them taking their seats in the stand that adopted his name in a stirring ceremony before kick-off. They left lauding heroes present and future too and, for one night at least, the club’s modern existence sat in perfect harmony with its past.\n\nTaking the emotion out of it, this was a functional and largely sterile win over a dreary Newcastle side. West Ham did what they had to do; they just could not have found two more appropriate men to do it.\n\nDeclan Rice is the most exciting player to come through their system in over a decade and set West Ham on their way with a header his feted predecessor would have appreciated. Mark Noble is a captain who strives to mould himself in Bonds’s image and his 42nd-minute penalty put the seal on a victory that the feeling around the London Stadium had demanded.\n\nRomelu Lukaku strikes twice as Manchester United beat Southampton Read more\n\n“You could feel the atmosphere before the game, the crowd was extra loud,” Noble said. “I know Billy Bonds quite well and he is a fantastic person and was a fantastic player. Everyone can look to him as an example for the football club.”\n\nA visibly emotional Bonds had made his entrance to a rapturous reception, flanked by a guard of honour comprising 25 of his former teammates. He represented West Ham for a quarter of a century, including four and a half years as manager in the early 1990s, and they had put on some show to mark the occasion. The sense of affection as he cut the ribbon in front of the Billy Bonds Stand, the stadium’s eastern flank, was genuinely uplifting and the current crop duly fed from it.\n\n“Six foot two, eyes of blue” was Bonds’s old terrace chant. Rice is just an inch shorter than that and when he rose to thud Robert Snodgrass’s corner past Martin Dubravka after losing Fabian Schär a little too easily, West Ham were ahead within seven minutes. They contained Newcastle for the rest of a stop-start half that was held up for several minutes by a bloody clash of heads between Aaron Cresswell and Javier Manquillo. The latter carried on, heavily bandaged, while Cresswell would depart before the break with what seemed an unrelated problem.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nIt did not derail West Ham, who could enjoy an energetic first start since May for the fit-again Manuel Lanzini. Shortly before the interval an overzealous challenge on Snodgrass from Sean Longstaff, a midfield tyro who has drawn somewhat excitable comparisons to Rice in some quarters, brought a free-kick that found Javier Hernández beyond the far post. He was clumsily clipped by Florian Lejeune as he manoeuvred towards the byline. It was indisputably a spot-kick and Noble converted emphatically.\n\nLongstaff was replaced by Mohamed Diamé at half-time and could later be seen leaving the stadium on crutches. It epitomised a dispiriting affair for Newcastle, who caused a few flutters towards the end but never came closer than a Salomón Rondón free-kick that hit the post. “I’m not annoyed, I’m disappointed,” said Rafael Benítez, in a choice of words that is unlikely to have made anyone feel better. “We’re still in a relegation battle.”\n\nThey need another couple of wins before Benítez will entertain thoughts of discussing a new contract. West Ham, who threatened only sporadically in the second half but emitted an air of rare control, pleased Manuel Pellegrini by looking like “a solid team” and, sitting in ninth, can now look firmly upwards.\n\nLike his skipper, Pellegrini noted how the tribute to Bonds had raised the noise levels.

Under the gleam of the lights, finding space and time on a football pitch, his talent unfurled again. Arsenal’s enigmatic playmaker, who has looked like Unai Emery’s type all too infrequently during this problematic season, illuminated this match with an exhibition of golden touches.\n\nYes, there is the caveat that Bournemouth are on a painful losing run away from home. It’s pretty unlikely he will be trusted with the intensity of Tottenham away on Saturday but even Emery must have gone home scratching his head at how the player who has been his biggest battle this season could also look like such a blessing.\n\nPedro strike and Trippier howler lift Sarri and give Chelsea win over Spurs Read more\n\nÖzil scored, assisted, and generally shone. As did another of Arsenal’s erratic creators, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, whose passing and finishing was also on song. All in all Arsenal seized the opportunity to express themselves against a team who shared their trait for looking like they could concede a chance at any time – only more so. With a testing week coming up with matches against Tottenham, Rennes and Manchester United, this booster came at a convenient time. Emery spoke afterwards about his desire to show “a complete match” at the Emirates for a while, and this one delivered that.\n\nEmery was reluctant to wax lyrically about the scintillating performances of Özil and Mkhitaryan. He responded to the question as to whether they made themselves hard to drop with the play-safe generalisations he prefers. “I am going to watch this match for the analysis. And I am going to watch Tottenham. Then I will decide our plan against them. We need big commitment from every player to help us.”\n\nThere wasn’t much of a deadlock for Arsenal to unpick and they were ahead in the fourth minute when Özil was found in such ample space that even a man of his fondness for assists could not turn down the invitation to shoot. He dinked the ball with his heel and a hint of backspin and it floated sweetly. Özil was engulfed in a group hug.\n\nPlay Video 1:20 'We weren't good in any aspect': Eddie Howe on Bournemouth's thrashing at Arsenal – video\n\nThe attacking combinations created a second goal which was beautiful in its simplicity. Mkhitaryan captured the ball and slid the ball to Özil, whose return pass was guided to land so Mkhitaryan did not have to break stride to score. Özil’s name rang freely around the Emirates.\n\nBut Bournemouth rallied and found a route back into the game, showing determination to claw back a goal. Dan Gosling’s pressing as the home team tried to play out from the back reaped its reward. The midfielder snaffled the ball off Matteo Guendouzi, who was badly punished for dallying, and centred for Lys Mousset to tap home.\n\nAfter that encouragement, Eddie Howe’s frustration was laid bare as he watched his team shudder at the beginning of the second half just as they had the first. Arsenal’s cushion was restored early in the second half as Mkhitaryan drove in a cross and Laurent Koscielny’s deflected shot bounced off the post too awkwardly for Artur Boruc.\n\nWard-Prowse helps Southampton to comfortable win over lifeless Fulham Read more\n\nBack came Bournemouth through the energetic Fraser, and the Scot was kept out with a solid save from Bernd Leno, before Gosling whacked a dipping shot against the crossbar. But Arsenal eased further in front when Mkhitaryan’s pass encouraged Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to switch on the afterburners. The striker jinked past the onrushing Boruc and steered in unerringly. Substitute Alex Lacazette iced the cake with a superb free-kick.\n\nBournemouth are stuck in a rut away from home and Howe’s disappointment was obvious. “We have to be very clear that we can play a lot better than that. We must not kid ourselves that today was acceptable. Obviously we made mistakes that contributed to our own downfall. A lot of things hurt us. We need to perform better. We need to make that change ourselves. We need to give everything.”\n\nTheir next away game, at Huddersfield, is as good an opportunity as any to turn the tide.\n\nFor Emery the next stop is the north-London derby and the incentive to try to get to within a point of Tottenham. “It is,” he mused, “a huge motivation.”"}, {"date": "27/02/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 27597, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup":

coasted to a rare routine victory. Even the eternal optimist, Claudio Ranieri, who headed straight down the tunnel at the final whistle after watching his lifeless team succumb to an eighth defeat in nine matches, is battling to put on a brave face. Fulham, who are 10 points from safety, need a miracle, and fast, if they are to avoid an instant return to the Championship.\n\nAs for Fulham’s disenchanted supporters, who sorely miss the swagger with which they won promotion, they are resigned to their fate and have already raised the white flag. To make matters worse, they face Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City in three of their next four matches. After their recent run the damage those sides could inflict does not bear thinking about.\n\nSadio Mané and Virgil van Dijk lead rampant Liverpool past Watford Read more\n\nFulham proved their own worst enemy here, typified by another erratic display by Sergio Rico in the Fulham goal; his poor clearance teed up Oriol Romeu to rifle home before he allowed James Ward-Prowse to add a second; Fulham have shipped a league-high 63 goals.\n\nRanieri, who trumpeted his belief that his players can still steer clear of the drop, shrugged his shoulders at the notion his job may not be safe. “I am used to believing,” he said. “Something could happen. If you don’t believe, it’s done. You have to believe, you have to fight. If you don’t fight, you’ve already lost. Always in my career, I am used to working hard. It is very difficult but until it is mathematically impossible, we continue to fight.”\n\nThe Italian’s substitutions midway through the second half gave the travelling supporters the chance to vent their frustrations. They unfurled a banner with the words “Risk free? Are you watching Tony Khan?” – a dig at comments made by Khan’s father, Shahid, the Fulham owner, after his appointment in November. The belated arrival of Ryan Sessegnon, their standout performer last season, prompted chants of “You don’t know what you’re doing”. Given how Fulham’s aggressive recruitment drive has spectacularly backfired – typified by Rico’s form – the old adage that, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, springs to mind. Fulham offered little, though Ryan Babel, a surprise January signing, came closest to giving the visitors an unlikely lifeline, rattling the bar late on.\n\nMesut Özil shows his class as Arsenal hit five past Bournemouth Read more\n\nRalph Hasenhüttl, the Southampton manager, described this game as a “should-win” as opposed to a “must-win” encounter and there was never any doubt that his side would prosper and record a victory that hoists them out of the relegation zone. A warm glow has surrounded Hasenhüttl since his arrival in December but there was no hiding from the fact that they needed a fillip, with the same old issues that beset his predecessors – bluntness in attack and an evident brittleness at the back – continuing to blight Saints of late.\n\nRico played Fulham into trouble early on, making a total mess of things when Håvard Nordtveit spooned an aimless ball into the box by Yan Valery high into the air. After the ball returned to earth Rico failed to claim it, instead clambering around Charlie Austin, who eventually hooked the ball into an unguarded net, only for the referee, Anthony Taylor, to blow for an extremely soft foul by the Southampton striker. Fulham were off the hook but, when Rico flapped at a Bertrand corner, this time the damage was lasting. Rico rose above André-Frank Zambo Anguissa to clear the ball but his powder-puff punch landed at the feet of Romeu on the edge of the box, with the midfielder smacking home beyond a sea of Fulham bodies.\n\nSouthampton doubled their lead four minutes before the interval after more kamikaze Fulham defending. Rico’s hopeful pass out from the back kick-started a horrible chain of events for Fulham, as some head tennis in midfield ensued before Austin fed Nathan Redmond to take aim. But it was Rico’s error when parrying Redmond’s curled shot that proved fatal, with the goalkeeper spilling his effort, allowing Ward-Prowse to bury the rebound. Southampton, who face Manchester United and Tottenham next, are unlikely to have it this easy again for a while. “It was a big step for us – only one – but a very important one,” Hasenhüttl said. “We were very clinical, professional.”"}, {"date": "27/02/2019", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 40542, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [],

months gave way to newfound belief in the Italian’s methods. That, at least, must be the long-term hope. For now he can bask in a timely win over bitter rivals which has earned him significant respite after a desperate few weeks.\n\nTottenham, their display as troublingly disjointed as in defeat at Burnley a few days previously and with Saturday’s derby against Arsenal looming ever larger, ended embarrassed here with Kieran Trippier inexplicably placing a back pass wide of an on-rushing Hugo Lloris six minutes from time. The ball trickled unaided over the line with Willian in hot pursuit and those in the Matthew Harding stand already bouncing gleefully in celebration.

It was as if Chelsea tapped into that insecurity, sensing vulnerability and exploiting it ruthlessly, all while the world’s most expensive goalkeeper twiddled his thumbs among the home side’s substitutes.\n\nWhat had initially been dismissed in public as an innocent “misunderstanding” back at Wembley on Sunday, when Kepa Arrizabalaga had refused to be substituted by a head coach on the brink, had actually left the Spaniard £190,000 out of pocket and dropped. Yet that show of strength from Sarri, a decision made “for the good of the group” as a reminder that the priority must always be the collective, ended up feeling cathartic. Kepa’s name had drawn some boos when read out over the Tannoy before kick-off but Chelsea were a team united, galvanised by a collision with local rivals and rallying behind Willy Caballero on his first Premier League start since last May. They ended with the relationship between squad and crowd – so strained at times of late – audibly reinforced.\n\nPlay Video 2:15 Sarri addresses Arrizabalaga row after Chelsea's win against Spurs – video\n\nThe restoration of spirit was epitomised by David Luiz, Antonio Rüdiger and the excellent Pedro sprinting to Caballero at the final whistle to celebrate.

Maybe we are not able to win 10 matches in a row but we’ll be able to fight.” They make the short journey to Fulham on Sunday with faith apparently restored and their head coach, whose position had felt terminally undermined even before Kepa’s show of petulance publicly belittled his authority, suddenly spying light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nTottenham, in contrast, might have entered the gloom. They barely tested Caballero, a mere spectator until he punched away Trippier’s free-kick just before the half-hour mark and, even if Harry Winks battered a shot on to the crossbar from distance, did not muster a shot on target for the first time under Mauricio Pochettino’s stewardship in a Premier League game, though Chelsea themselves managed only one. They were marginally off kilter all night, forever slightly off the pace with Christian Eriksen’s promptings suffocated and Harry Kane frustrated and infuriated.\n\nWilly Caballero finally gets part to play in rolling soap opera at Chelsea | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThe England captain had squared up to David Luiz and Azpilicueta in the first half – there was a hint of a headbutt at one point – and there were further flashpoints near the end, by which time Spurs’ cause felt hopeless.\n\nGonzalo Higuaín had struck an upright long before Pedro, fed by Azpilicueta’s pass beyond Ben Davies, had edged the hosts ahead, turning inside Toby Alderweireld before spitting a shot through Lloris’s legs at the near post. Chelsea suggested they would probably see out the win with that lead still slender before Trippier’s wayward pass and Lloris’s rush of blood further punctured the visitors late on.\n\nSpurs’ lead from fourth-placed Arsenal has been trimmed to four points before Saturday’s meeting at Wembley. “But at the beginning of the season everyone would have been satisfied to be going into this game with that gap,” said Pochettino. “The pressure is on them, not only us. Them too, surely.”\n\nThe Argentinian has spent the last few months looking up towards Liverpool and Manchester City, rather than fretting over who is hovering at Tottenham’s shoulders. “Why should we be careful [about a top-four finish]? I am not afraid. I have freedom in my mind, the same feeling I had before. It’s not a drama, eh? It’s about being calm.

Manchester United were in the midst of an injury crisis and it was incumbent on a big player to step up from the fringes to save them. The caretaker manager named names, too. He wanted to see Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sánchez play to their potential.\n\nIt was Lukaku who delivered. The striker blew a glorious chance in the eighth minute but he did not go into his shell, far from it. He put United in control with two excellent finishes, one with either foot – the first from the edge of the penalty area – and, although Crystal Palace fought back to score through Joel Ward, it was Lukaku who helped to ensure that his team had the final word.\n\nSadio Mané and Virgil van Dijk lead rampant Liverpool past Watford Read more\n\nLukaku combined with Paul Pogba before the latter played in Ashley Young and the United captain angled home a powerful drive. Palace had fought from the first whistle but, at last, they were deflated. Down on the touchline Solskjær pumped his fists in a familiar show of contentedness.\n\nAnd so it goes on. Solskjær remains unbeaten in the Premier League since he stepped in to replace José Mourinho in mid-December – he has won nine and drawn two of 11 matches – and it now feels as though it is a question of when rather than if he is confirmed by the club as the next permanent manager.\n\nUnited want a leader to instil a fast and exciting style, to reacquaint the fans with a sense of enjoyment. They want somebody who understands the club’s traditions. And they would not mind if results came along, as well. Quite simply Solskjær has come to tick every box.\n\nPalace have never beaten United in the Premier League and they have now tried and failed on 20 occasions. This was a 16th defeat. They rattled United at times in the first half and, when Ward dived to head home, the grandstand finale was on.\n\nThe home crowd bellowed their encouragement and there were flickers from their team. The substitute Max Meyer forced David de Gea into a save and Andros Townsend saw a shot charged down. But United held firm – their work rate and organisation were praised by Roy Hodgson – and after Young’s goal, there was even time for Solskjær to introduce the 17-year-old central midfielder James Garner for his debut.\n\n“We’ve got great faith in James as the next Michael Carrick,” Solskjær said. “I know it’s not fair on kids to compare them to great players like Michael was but he’s in the same mould. I know it’s pressure but you’re at Man United. Michael had the pressure of coming in after Roy Keane, so that’s just the way it is at Man United.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ashley Young celebrates after clinching the points. Photograph: Chloe Knott - Danehouse/Getty Images\n\nSolskjær radiated confidence even though he was without eight senior players because of injury. Marcus Rashford, who had been a doubt with an ankle problem, was fit enough to make a 77th-minute appearance off the bench. Solskjær could include only Pogba from his first-choice front six and he improvised by starting the full-back Diogo Dalot on the right wing, which worked well. Dalot had previously played there for Porto.\n\nAll eyes were on Lukaku and Sánchez, not to mention the midfielder Fred, who made his first appearance since early January. Sánchez was a disappointment, unable to create anything and going to ground a little too easily, while Fred’s evening was a mixed bag.\n\nIn the absence of Rashford, Solskjær started Lukaku through the middle and he responded with his first goals in 10 appearances, although he had to taste a low before the highs. In the early running he found himself all alone and centrally placed, eight yards out, from the excellent Luke Shaw’s corner – only to sky the volley.\n\nLukaku’s opening goal came from a much more difficult opportunity, following a burst from Shaw. The Belgian took a touch to set himself before curling a low right-foot shot into the far corner.\n\nPedro strike and Trippier howler lift Sarri and give Chelsea win over Spurs Read more\n\nTownsend had blown a clearcut 11th-minute chance from James McArthur’s cross and had fizzed a low drive past the post.

United won two headers inside the area following Young’s corner, firstly through Chris Smalling and then Victor Lindelöf, and Lukaku hooked the bouncing ball into the far corner.\n\nWard’s goal from Schlupp’s cross was his first of the season.

They have faltered recently and lost their attacking verve along the route but, far from feeling the pressure of the title race, they revelled in it against Watford on Wednesday night. The Premier League leaders were insatiable, unstoppable and clinical as they recorded the biggest victory of what Jürgen Klopp hopes will be the breakthrough season for his club.\n\nKlopp says Liverpool played ‘football as it should look’ in win against Watford Read more\n\nThe Liverpool manager gave an Oscar-winner’s speech, eulogising all those who had made the victory possible and acknowledging he may have forgotten somebody. It was a lengthy list. Mohamed Salah was “unplayable” according to Klopp. Trent Alexander‑Arnold “brilliant” as he returned to the side with vengeance plus a hat-trick of inch-perfect assists. Fabinho appeared to run central midfield single-handedly, although that does a disservice to those around him. Sadio Mané scored twice, the second an audacious and glorious finish, as did Virgil van Dijk with two towering late headers. Divock Origi chipped in with a fine goal as he replaced Roberto Firmino.\n\nStrength in depth, a clean sheet and a rampant team brushing aside a side in “best of the rest” territory before kick-off. It was a result and performance that blew away creeping suspicions about Liverpool losing their edge and composure just as the season enters its critical phase. It was a result and performance that told Manchester City they will be difficult to dislodge. And it was needed. Three draws in the previous four league games demanded a reaction, despite Klopp’s claim it is growing expectation that afflicts Liverpool, and another heavy defeat of Watford – who have lost here 5-0, 5-0 and 6-1 on their past three visits – was timed as perfectly as it was executed.\n\nKlopp sowed doubt in Watford from the start by stationing Origi on the left and handing Mané opportunity to wreak havoc through the centre. It was an invitation he devoured. Other changes from Manchester United on Sunday, James Milner returning to midfield and Alexander-Arnold recalled at right-back, were also key in extending Liverpool’s unbeaten league run here to a commanding 35 games.\n\nQuick guide Premier League title race: the remaining fixtures Show Hide Manchester City (86 points) 24 Apr Man Utd (a)\n\n28 Apr Burnley (a)\n\n4 May Leicester (h)\n\n12 May Brighton (a) Liverpool (85 points) 21 Apr Cardiff (a)\n\n26 Apr Huddersfield (h)\n\n5 May Newcastle (a)\n\n12 May Wolves (h)\n\nMilner signalled the kind of night that lay in store for the visitors when he charged down an early clearance from Ben Foster.

Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\nHe was involved at the start of the move with a lay-off to Milner on the edge of the area. By the time the ball arrived in the box via an immaculate first time cross from Alexander-Arnold, the Senegal international had peeled into space between Watford’s central defenders. Foster was left waving at thin air as Mané’s powerful header flew into the top corner.\n\nQuality deliveries from Alexander-Arnold were a feature of Liverpool’s first-half dominance as the defender showed his manager what was lacking at Old Trafford. Salah’s tormenting of Adam Masina and Craig Cathcart was another. Both played their part in a second goal of impudent class from Mané.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nA strong run from Salah was halted inside the area but Liverpool remained in possession through Georginio Wijnaldum. He teed up Alexander-Arnold for another precision cross into Mané whose first touch shifted the ball away from goal. No bother. He simply back-heeled his second touch up and over the advancing Foster and into an empty net. The gasp that preceded the roar around the ground said everything about the finish.\n\nSergio Agüero’s contentious penalty takes Manchester City past West Ham Read more\n\nFear stalked the Watford defence each time Salah received the ball in space, a lesson they failed to heed from United’s approach at Old Trafford. The paucity of the visitors’ attacking display was summed up by Javi Gracia withdrawing both of his forwards, Troy Deeney and the erratic Gerard Deulofeu, in a double substitution.\n\nInevitably, it was Liverpool who struck again when Origi capped a promising return to the starting line-up with a fine finish. Andy Robertson found the striker lurking unmarked on the left wing with Watford defending deep and in numbers. Undeterred, the Belgium international darted into the area and away from two defenders before cutting a low and emphatic shot back inside Foster’s near post.\n\nVan Dijk made it four when he powered home a close range header from Alexander-Arnold’s free-kick. He celebrated his second goal at Anfield with a fist-pumping celebration in front of the Kop and followed that up with a glancing header past Foster from Robertson’s cross three minutes later."},

No other side has managed that kind of record over a 15-game period in the top division since Tottenham in 1965 and, in the case of Pep Guardiola’s team, their previous assignment here was a 6-0 rampage against Chelsea.\n\nSadio Mané and Virgil van Dijk lead rampant Liverpool past Watford Read more\n\nAt this stage of the season, however, they will not mind too much that their latest victory was a more prosaic affair featuring a penalty decision that must have hurt their opponents. On the balance of play, there could be no doubt City were the superior team, particularly when Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling added some much-needed impetus during the second half. All the same their former manager, Manuel Pellegrini, could conceivably have seen his current team emerge with a battling draw but for the contentious moment just before the hour mark when Silva went down under Felipe Anderson’s largely innocuous challenge and Sergio Agüero was handed the chance to continue his scoring run.\n\nThat was Agüero’s 25th goal of the season and, more importantly, it ensured City kept up the pressure on Liverpool at the top of the table. Yet it was a struggle at times for the reigning champions, epitomised by Guardiola replacing his leading scorer towards the end with a midfielder, Phil Foden, and the unusual sight of Kevin De Bruyne trying to waste a few seconds in stoppage time by running the ball towards the corner flag.\n\nQuick guide Premier League title race: the remaining fixtures Show Hide Manchester City (86 points) 24 Apr Man Utd (a)\n\n28 Apr Burnley (a)\n\n4 May Leicester (h)\n\n12 May Brighton (a) Liverpool (85 points) 21 Apr Cardiff (a)\n\n26 Apr Huddersfield (h)\n\n5 May Newcastle (a)\n\n12 May Wolves (h)\n\nAs Pellegrini said afterwards of the penalty: “To be generous, it was a little soft. But that would be too generous. In the other box [the West Ham substitute] Manuel Lanzini had the same play but did not throw himself to the floor. If we lost this game from another action, we could accept it but it was not a penalty.”\n\nA single-goal victory, settled by a moment of controversy, was certainly not what many City fans might have anticipated when, to put it into context, Guardiola had won all six of his previous encounters against these opponents, with an aggregate score of 22-3. On that basis West Ham ought to be reasonably encouraged, particularly as Marko Arnautovic was absent with a virus and Ben Johnson was making his first Premier League start. As the cousin of Ledley King and nephew of Paul Parker, Johnson, a 19-year-old full-back, comes from a family that clearly places great importance on the art of defence, and that was probably just as well given the amount of time West Ham had to spend in retreat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernardo Silva goes down under the challenge of Felipe Anderson. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNot that City had it all their own way. Guardiola’s body language was telling at times, staring out anxiously from the dugout or moving to the edge of the pitch, arms folded or hands shoved into his pockets. He claimed afterwards he was “delighted” that his team had played “so good.” During the game, however, he looked dissatisfied and at times the crowd sounded it, too, particularly when Riyad Mahrez was straying offside or misplacing passes. This was Mahrez’s first start in a league match since 30 December and, though Sterling and Silva were entitled to a rest, it was not a good night for the club’s record signing, looking conspicuously low on confidence and substituted early in the second half.\n\nThe same could be said for Samir Nasri, who was barely involved for West Ham on the night he returned to face his former club. Pellegrini replaced him with Lanzini at the break and, five minutes after the restart, the substitute set up Andy Carroll for West Ham’s first chance of the night. It was a splendid chance, too – by far the clearest opportunity until that stage. Carroll was at full stretch when he connected with Lanzini’s cross but Ederson’s flying save spared City from going behind.\n\nManchester United roll on as Romelu Lukaku seizes chance at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nFor West Ham it was a costly save. Silva, a 58th-minute replacement for Leroy Sané, had been on the pitch only a minute when he tried to get past Anderson in the penalty area. Declan Rice, who was being watched by the England manager, Gareth Southgate, was also tracking the City player and it was a questionable decision from the referee, Stuart Attwell.\n\nSilva appeared to stumble rather than actually being fouled, and the sight of him punching the air at the award of the penalty will not have lessened West Ham’s feelings of injustice. Agüero put the penalty to the left of Lukasz Fabianski and, after that, West Ham were indebted to their goalkeeper, particularly for a one-handed save from Sterling that prevented it becoming the kind of scoreline to which City are accustomed at their own ground."}, {"date": "26/02/2019", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 31849, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name":

test with flying colours, in the end they comfortably ousted Cardiff courtesy of an ice-cool double by Gylfi Sigurdsson and a stoppage-time strike by Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nIt is almost three years since the majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, acquired his first stake and, though a first victory in four matches lifts the immediate doom and gloom around Silva, the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Sunday will provide a clearer marker of the progress of a team into which the British-Iranian billionaire has pumped in excess of £300m.\n\nSean Longstaff on target as Newcastle end Burnley’s good run Read more\n\nThe reality is that Everton have still only beaten Lincoln, Bournemouth, Huddersfield and now Cardiff since the turn of the year. But there were a few encouraging signs here, namely the grace with which Sigurdsson performed throughout. Is the tide turning? “We hope, we hope,” said Silva. “It’s a really important game, it was important that we won the game to get that confidence that we need as a team.\n\n“It will be a different game at home with our fans [against Liverpool] and we expect a fantastic atmosphere in our stadium to push us on. One of the problems we have had this season was missing some consistency. We had two or three months very, very good and then after some bad results we are losing confidence. We have been up and down many times and it was an important win with a clean sheet.”\n\nSigurdsson left the field to a standing ovation from the away supporters, though perhaps a little disappointed at failing to register the perfect hat-trick after hitting sweet strikes with his left and right feet. In doing so, he became the leading Icelandic goalscorer in Premier League history, surpassing Eidur Gudjohnsen’s tally of 55.\n\n“You are seeing a different Gylfi Sigurdsson this season – he deserved his goals,” Silva added. “I’m sure next match we will see Gylfi playing with more confidence, apart from his qualities he is always giving everything to the team. This season we have given him a different role.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Calvert-Lewin lifts the ball beyond Neil Etheridge for Everton’s third goal. Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images via Reuters\n\nCardiff remain one place and one point above the relegation zone. Their starting lineup consisted of 11 footballers who played in the second tier last season and the side badly lacked bite. “We had a great opportunity to take the lead and then we made elementary mistakes to concede the goals,” said Neil Warnock. “I know he’s cost £50m but Sigurdsson does not need more than one chance to score, whereas we huffed and puffed around goal. That is the difference, isn’t it? As disappointing as it was, we are not going to throw the towel in now.”\n\nLeicester impress Brendan Rodgers with determined win over Brighton Read more\n\nSilva said victory here was non-negotiable after they had lost eight of their previous 11 league games. Everton travelled to south Wales on the back of a 17-day break from their last match, a defeat to Watford, but did not showcase any noticeable strides made on the training ground until four minutes before the interval. It had the whiff of a simple training-ground move, from an incisive pass by Morgan Schneiderlin – impressive on his first start since October and one of five changes made by Silva – to slip in Séamus Coleman down the right flank, to Sigurdsson’s sweeping finish beyond Neil Etheridge in the Cardiff goal.\n\nStrangled by expectation in recent weeks, Everton found some refreshing freedom after Sigurdsson’s opener and, when Silva introduced Bernard on the hour mark, they quickly set about doubling their lead.\n\nIdrissa Gueye, an authoritative figure again in midfield, fed the Brazilian, who drove down the left flank with purpose, forcing Etheridge to palm away. The ball fell at the feet of Sigurdsson, who lashed the ball home with his left foot. By that point, Cardiff supporters had seen enough, though Everton were not finished, with Calvert-Lewin striking as any clouds hovering over Silva evaporated."}, {"date": "26/02/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 22714, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demeaco Duhaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Terence Kongolo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Durm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Stankovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philip Billing", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Karlan Ahearne-Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Juninho Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Elias Kachunga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Conor Coady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Boly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Doherty", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leander Dendoncker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rúben Neves", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "João Moutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Jonny Otto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raúl Jiménez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Diogo Jota", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ivan Cavaleiro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hélder Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Gibbs-White", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romain Saiss", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Vinagre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "At last Huddersfield have lift-off. Not from the foot of the table, naturally, but a first win in three months and the first points gained since David Wagner’s departure were secured through a stoppage-time goal from Steve Mounié, just as a forgettable game seemed to be drifting towards a scoreless draw.\n\n“I’m so proud,” Jan Siewert said. “The players deserved it so much because you couldn’t believe how they have suffered in recent weeks, they have been so unlucky but still they work and fight.”\n\nThe victory takes Huddersfield to 14 points, still an unlikely platform for survival but at least they will now avoid the ignominy of sharing the record low of 11 set by Derby in 2007-08. Plus the Terriers can hold their heads high in the company of Wolves, who may be on the fringes of Europe but have somehow been responsible for donating six points to the Huddersfield cause. “It was not one of our best performances,” Nuno Espírito Santo said. “We didn’t create enough and we need to work harder.”\n\nIndeed, an evening low on quality and incident barely deserved its rousing finale. While Huddersfield have appeared resigned to their fate for some time, Wolves were unusually tepid, hardly managing an attempt at goal let alone a shot on target.\n\nThe home side were predictably lacking in that respect, too, but when the substitute Aaron Mooy launched one last attack with a cross from the right, Willy Boly’s deflection allowed Karlan Grant to shoot at Rui Patrício. The goalkeeper saved with his legs but even though Mounié was on his knees he was still able to sweep the loose ball over the line.\n\nAfter losing all four matches of his tenure to date Siewert had decided it was time for drastic action, with no fewer than eight of the side who lost against Newcastle at the weekend dropping out of the starting lineup. Initially the effect was oddly the same. Huddersfield continued to pass the ball around crisply and confidently in midfield, as they have done all season, without offering anything remotely threatening in the final third.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWolves were guilty of much the same thing though they squandered a great chance to go ahead when Diogo Jota made his way to the goalline and crossed to Matt Doherty at the far post, who had a clear sight of goal but appeared not to be expecting the ball.\n\nSadly that was just about the highlight of the first half until Alex Pritchard produced a clever cross for Grant to acrobatically slice wide. Huddersfield deserved something from the attack since Jon Stankovic’s spirited attempt to set up a length-of-the-field breakaway from a Wolves corner had been cynically halted on the edge of the visitors’ area by the chasing Ryan Bennett. The referee allowed play to continue while Huddersfield had the ball in a dangerous area, though once Grant had failed to take advantage he booked the Wolves defender.\n\nThose mild frissons of excitement apart, the most memorable aspect of a disappointing first half had been the two sets of supporters winding each other up. When the travelling fans chanted about the possibility of Town going down the home fans hit back with a reminder that their last league victory, way back in November, had come at Molineux. “How crap must you be, we beat you two-nil.”\n\nThe second half opened more promisingly, with Boly getting in the way of a goal-bound shot from Mounié and Stankovic having a header saved by Patrício from the resulting corner. At the other end Jonas Lössl came out to save at the feet of Jota after he had been played through by Raúl Jiménez. A clear chance arrived just before the hour when a Juninho Bacuna cross eluded Terence Kongolo in the area but sat up nicely at the far post for Mounié, who could only find the side-netting with a close-range header.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jan Siewert celebrates Steve Mounié’s last-minute winner against Wolves, which secured the first points Huddersfield have achieved under their new manager.

Leicester’s manager ran the rule over his new charges as they secured their first home win since Boxing Day thanks to goals by Demarai Gray and Jamie Vardy.\n\nDavy Pröpper pulled one back but, if Leicester are looking up again, Brighton cannot be comfortable about being only three points above Southampton, who occupy 18th place.\n\nWhile it would be easy to claim Leicester were inspired by Rodgers’s presence, gifts from Brighton were a major factor. Chris Hughton’s side started limply and, after rallying, finished badly, with Glen Murray guilty of two uncharacteristic misses.\n\nLeicester City appoint Brendan Rodgers as Neil Lennon returns to Celtic Read more\n\nStill, there is no doubt the arrival of Rodgers has raised the mood at Leicester. He watched from the directors’ box from where he beamed and waved when given a rapturous greeting from the crowd before the kick-off.\n\nApparently the players are similarly enthused by his appointment. “He came into the dressing room after the game and he was very positive,” said Mike Stowell, who, along with Adam Sadler, was in temporary charge for this match. “The lads were in awe listening to him,” Stowell continued. “He said: ‘I’ve only left Celtic to come here for one reason and that’s to work with this group of players.’ That speaks volumes for this young group.”\n\nHarry Maguire said: “It’s an exciting time for the club. We all know his profile and what he’s done. We’re all looking forward to working with him. Celtic are a massive club, so it shows how big Leicester are getting and our ambitions.”\n\nLeicester’s ambition before taking on Brighton was to end a series of four straight defeats. Having spoken of his desire to create a “really aggressive” side, Rodgers must have appreciated the way the hosts got stuck in. Then again, they could hardly have asked for more obliging visitors, as Brighton began with a timidity that showed why they are among the Premier League’s worst travellers, without an away win since a narrow victory at Huddersfield in early December.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Vardy and James Maddison celebrate after Vardy scored what proved to be the winner. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City via Getty Images\n\nScoring the opening goal, which Leicester repeatedly failed to do under Puel, was an ideal way to greet a new dawn. Vardy, one of the player’s hoping to benefit most from Puel’s departure, had a chance to land the first blow when James Maddison pulled the ball back to him in the fifth minute but Shane Duffy threw himself in front of the striker’s shot from the edge of the six-yard box.\n\nLeicester were not denied, merely delayed. Five minutes later they made the breakthrough thanks to Gray. Hughton must have been aghast at how feebly his team defended after Harvey Barnes dispossessed Anthony Knockaert near halfway. Youri Tielemans ran free from midfield before slipping a pass through to Gray, who was free to fire low into the net from 15 yards.\n\nHe nearly doubled his tally four minutes later after Barnes again made gains down the left. Mat Ryan got down well to save.\n\nSean Longstaff on target as Newcastle end Burnley’s good run Read more\n\nAs Brighton pulled themselves together, Leicester became a little dishevelled. Kasper Schmeichel made two important saves, first from Pascal Gross and then an excellent one-handed stop to thwart Knockaert.\n\nLeicester should have been punished early in the second half when Maddison was caught in possession but, after a lovely move involving Knockaert and a back‑heeled pass by Gross, Murray lifted the ball over from eight yards. Worse, Gross suffered a hamstring injury when performing his nifty tee-up.\n\nMoments later Leicester eased their anxiety with a classy goal. Advancing nimbly from midfield they cut through Brighton, Vardy applying the finish by running on to a clever pass by Maddison and ramming the ball past Ryan from 10 yards.\n\nLeicester were not comfortable for long. Three minutes later Pröpper cut their lead in half, firing low into the net from edge of the box after Knockaert’s cross from the right was deflected into his path by Ben Chilwell.\n\nBarnes had a brilliant game on the left wing but missed two decent chances on the counterattack. Brighton’s best chance to equalise fell to Murray in the 87th minute but the normally trusty striker again misfired, blasting wide from seven yards.\n\n“At the moment we’re not putting away opportunities and so we have to make sure we’re not conceding,” Hughton said. “Those small margins are not going for us at the moment and it’s only us that can do something about it.”"}, {"date":

an advertising campaign promoting the restorative powers of winter breaks in southern Spain.\n\nAnnual trips to Rafael Benítez’s preferred bolthole near Alicante certainly seem to help immunise the Tyneside club against relegation. After in effect securing their Premier League status courtesy of three straight wins following last year’s mini-break, Newcastle have returned from their latest visit to the Costa Blanca and promptly taken six vital points, from Huddersfield and now Burnley.\n\nHuddersfield’s Steve Mounié finds reward at the last to see off tame Wolves Read more\n\nWhile goals from Fabian Schär – with an outstanding strike – and the excellent Sean Longstaff lifted Newcastle into the sunlit uplands of 13th place they also reminded Sean Dyche that all good things must come to an end.\n\nBurnley’s manager had never previously lost a Premier League match on a Tuesday and his team arrived unbeaten in the league in 2019 and on a run of eight league games without defeat, their best top-tier run for 53 years. “Credit to Newcastle, they were better than us,” Dyche said. “They deserved to win.”\n\nBenítez was delighted by his side’s ability in the face of Burnley’s physicality. “There were a lot of positives,” said a manager whose demeanour hints he may extend a contract that expires in May. “We trained really hard in Spain and I was confident we could finish stronger. Now we have to be confident we have a project and ambition to be a top Premier League side. We can do it.”\n\nAlthough configured in a fluidly attacking 3-4-3 formation Newcastle started slowly. Bar one gorgeous raking diagonal pass from Longstaff – a young midfielder set to be called up to the England Under-21s before possibly joining the fast track to Gareth Southgate’s seniors – and a first-time Matt Ritchie cross that narrowly failed to find Salomón Rondón, the hosts created little of note.\n\nOr at least not until the 24th minute. With a single swipe of his foot, Schär changed the game. After collecting the ball from Javier Manquillo the central defender found himself around 30 yards out and took aim. The resultant angled shot swerved wickedly away from Tom Heaton, the visiting goalkeeper helpless as it came off the inside of a post before dropping into the net. Even Dyche seemed nonplussed.\n\nBurnley’s manager had cut a vocal, demonstrative presence in the technical area but his game plan was soon to go further awry as Longstaff scored his first senior goal. It arrived courtesy of a fabulous cross from Ritchie – outstanding at left wing-back – with which Rondón could not quite connect, leaving the ball to drop for the academy graduate from North Shields. All that remained was for Longstaff to swivel smartly before driving an angled volley into the bottom corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest It was a long night for Sean Dyche as Burnley’s improved recent form deserted them. Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport via Getty Images\n\nAs he was serenaded with “one of our own” choruses, Dyche complained about Craig Pawson’s failure to award his side a free-kick for what he saw to be a foul on Jack Cork in the buildup.\n\nLeicester impress Brendan Rodgers with determined win over Brighton Read more\n\nWith Burnley’s recently dependable defence increasingly destabilised by Miguel Almirón’s searing change of pace and the energy of the unwell Ashley Westwood much missed in their midfield, the visitors’ unbeaten run looked in severe jeopardy. Even so they could and should have reduced the deficit as half-time neared when the ball fell kindly for James Tarkowski about six yards out. Showing why he is a centre-half rather than a centre-forward, he volleyed wildly off-target.\n\nDwight McNeil has been a key figure in Burnley’s recent renaissance but struggled here and was replaced on the left of midfield by Robbie Brady at the interval. Dyche’s players subsequently improved slightly but not sufficiently and could have fallen further behind when Heaton saved smartly from Almirón with his legs.\n\nBurnley’s manager replaced the well-marshalled Ashley Barnes with Peter Crouch but the incoming striker’s most notable achievements were to collect a booking for catching Schär on a shin and then leaving Mo Diamé with a bandaged head after accidentally elbowing him above an eye.\n\n“Some of our quality was lacking,” said Dyche, whose side are 15th and remain within touching distance of safety. “But we’ll be back.”"}, {"date":

top-four finish. Having won at Huddersfield in their previous Premier League match, the London club can now sense the opportunity to construct the platform for a push.\n\n‘Everything hurts’: Arsenal Women aim to avenge final defeat with league glory Read more\n\nNext up for them are Bournemouth at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night and their home form has been extremely good. It has tended to be what happens on the road that has let them down. After Bournemouth, Arsenal face Tottenham away and Manchester United at home – and it is not difficult to paint the coming sequence as pivotal.\n\nThis game was settled in the opening 17 minutes, with Southampton once again guilty of shocking defensive lapses and, ultimately, unable to answer the goals from Alexandre Lacazette and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. The bonus came from Old Trafford, where United played out a stalemate with Liverpool, meaning Arsenal jumped into fourth place.\n\n“It is a positive for us to be in the top four but it does not change our way, which is to go game by game,” Emery said. “Wednesday is very important against Bournemouth and we are feeling strong at home.”\n\nSouthampton had ended Arsenal’s 22-match unbeaten run in the reverse fixture at St Mary’s on 16 December but there was never any prospect of a repeat performance after the early goals that had Ralph Hasenhüttl boiling with rage.\n\nThe visiting manager and his players had stewed on their previous result for two weeks – the disastrous last‑gasp home defeat against Cardiff – and they had been determined to show greater solidity and ruthlessness. They did neither and must consider the visit of Fulham on Wednesday as must-win. After that they play United and Tottenham. They remain third from bottom.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsenal fans shield their eyes as Alexandre Lacazette runs past. Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe tone might have been different had Nathan Redmond been able to capitalise after he ran clean through the inside right channel in the fifth minute. He jinked and saw his low shot blocked by Bernd Leno but a cutback for Stuart Armstrong in the centre may have been a better option.\n\nArsenal went straight to the other end to score and it was a goal marked by hesitation and slackness from a Southampton point of view. Jack Stephens appeared to have bundled over Lucas Torreira inside the area from Alex Iwobi’s cross and, as Southampton stopped, the referee Graham Scott allowed play to continue. Mkhitaryan took aim only to slice his shot but with Jan Bednarek slow to step up, Lacazette was onside in the middle and he flicked past Angus Gunn.\n\nThe second goal followed more Southampton sloppiness. Stephens’s backpass was errant; it put undue pressure on Gunn and he skewed the subsequent clearance to Iwobi, who ran back towards the area and crossed low. The ball broke for Mkhitaryan and he steered a shot into the near corner.\n\n“If you want to be successful against a team like Arsenal, you can’t give the goals away so easily,” Hasenhüttl said. “These kind of mistakes are still part of our game. Believe me, we do everything to stop them.”\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nMatt Targett had extended Leno at 1-0 but Southampton were fortunate that the half-time damage was not heavier, with Lacazette missing a handful of chances, most glaringly from five yards out on 40 minutes.\n\nHasenhüttl left Shane Long out of his squad and started with Redmond and Armstrong as the strikers in his 5-3-2 system. It did not work and so he changed things at half-time, withdrawing the hapless Stephens, going to a back four and bringing on two purer strikers in Charlie Austin and Michael Obafemi. Unfortunately for Obafemi, he would be forced off 20 minutes later with a hamstring injury.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nSouthampton pressed and they strained for a lifeline.

This game in hand over Manchester City featured an under-par performance that will hearten Pep Guardiola’s men, though the point does leave the Merseyside club leaders by a point with 11 matches left.\n\nManchester United 0-0 Liverpool: player ratings from Old Trafford Read more\n\nThe draw suits Manchester United far better and given how Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s XI were hindered by three injury-enforced substitutions, all before the interval, the result is a particular morale-booster.\n\nThe Norwegian may have overhyped United’s second-half display as “magnificent” but they certainly outplayed Liverpool then and though Jürgen Klopp played down his disappointment, he will be concerned that his team failed to fire.\n\nThe sight of Klopp appearing near-furious throughout – “animated” was his description – and choosing to take off his star turn Mohamed Salah with 11 minutes remaining summed up how Liverpool stuttered.\n\nSolskjær made two changes from Monday’s FA Cup win at Chelsea. Sergio Romero returned to the bench and Nemanja Matic was injured so in came David de Gea and Scott McTominay. Jesse Lingard’s recovery from a hamstring problem was advanced enough for him to sit on the bench but Anthony Martial was absent because of his groin injury. Klopp also changed two from Tuesday’s Champions League draw with Bayern Munich; James Milner and Virgil van Dijk for Trent Alexander-Arnold and Naby Keïta.\n\nPlay Video 1:22 'It feels like we should have won': Jürgen Klopp reacts to Liverpool draw – video\n\nIn what would end as a dire, injury-blighted 45 minutes, Liverpool rattled United instantly from kick-off. Ashley Young’s back-pass left De Gea short and in desperation the goalkeeper handled the ball. The referee gave the indirect free-kick outside the six-yard area to the right. A short routine ended with a Milner pot-shot hitting the wall and United escaped.\n\nMuch of Liverpool’s possession was down to United errors. The next meant Joël Matip received the ball and ran through the home side, causing Ander Herrera to shove him over inside the D, and United were relieved to see Salah spoon the free-kick over. Herrera’s act might have been the reason he was forced off on 21 minutes – the Spaniard replaced by Andreas Pereira.\n\nGiven Matic’s absence this meant United now had a third-choice in midfield alongside the second-choice McTominay, Paul Pogba being the only automatic selection left on the field in that position.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Virgil van Dijk of Liverpool beats Alexis Sanchez of Manchester United to the ball. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nFurther injury problems occurred moments later when Juan Mata had to come off, though Lingard’s entrance meant United were arguably strengthened. All this disrupted any rhythm the contest had – a point Klopp used to explain his team’s performance.\n\nAnd there was more: just after the half-hour Roberto Firmino became the match’s third substitution because of a sore ankle that brought Daniel Sturridge on. Sturridge’s first contribution was a 30-yard pea-roller though this was, at least, some form of attacking act; it would prove Liverpool’s sole attempt on target.\n\nAs the interval neared United moved up a gear, putting together the contest’s best move. Pereira intercepted in his half and found Romelu Lukaku. He played in Pogba down the left, who ran on before returning the ball to the No 9. Lukaku paused, slid a clever pass to Lingard but when the substitute tried to beat Alisson, the keeper grabbed the ball.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nThis proved too much for Lingard, though. Having been spied clutching a hamstring earlier he became United’s third casualty. Solskjær stated all three were caused by the same problem and that he may have to assess why.\n\nLingard had lasted 18 minutes. Alexis Sánchez entered and when the Chilean turned inside from the left and hit an errant pass this was the first half in a microcosm.\n\nKlopp says Liverpool must learn to adapt after Manchester United draw Read more\n\nThe hope was for a higher quality second half but the start hardly augured well. Balls bounced off Sánchez – as they tend to do – and when United moved up-field via Luke Shaw and McTominay it petered out. Young took two free-kicks, from the right and left, and first Pogba, then Sánchez, were offside.\n\nLiverpool, finally, posed a serious question. Jordan Henderson broke along the right and aimed a cross at Sadio Mané but Pereira, not for the first time, blocked. The crowd were vocal and the contest, too, had livened up. When Young pinged a ball on to Marcus Rashford’s toes the No 10 required a slicker touch than that which allowed Alisson to clean up. United were in the ascendancy and Klopp was in a perma-rage, unhappy at his side’s sluggishness.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nPogba was next to threaten but slipped when crossing and Alisson, again, gratefully collected.\n\nLiverpool, perhaps remembering this was their match in hand, did now pin United back. Henderson looked to play in Salah but Shaw stymied this with his head. Young did the same to a Milner ball and Georginio Wijnaldum’s cut inside was followed by a wild effort.\n\nThe first tactical substitution came on 72 minutes, Klopp replacing the disappointing Henderson with Xherdan Shaqiri. The German continued to be upset – taking aim at the substitute for lax defending – while having the countenance of a man baffled at what he witnessed. At the close Chris Smalling had a golden chance to convert Lukaku’s cross but there was no grandstand finish."}, {"date": "23/02/2019", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21338, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight McNeil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [57], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Foyth", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Moura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Perhaps Mauricio Pochettino should have been wary about describing this game as a cup final for his players.

The Spurs manager admitted as much and is likely to face an FA charge after venting his fury at the referee at the final whistle.\n\nSpurs did not look much like title contenders, unable to convert 70% of possession into clear threats on goal and short of inspiration when tasked with breaking down Burnley’s dogged lines of defence. Harry Kane played and scored but with limited chances the home side finished better and deservedly took the points with goals from Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes.\n\nPochettino claimed his altercation with Mike Dean was simply an outpouring of emotion at a disappointing result and said he intended to apologise to the official. “We made mistakes on the pitch and I made one at the end,” he said. “I needed to calm down, I wanted to find someone to blame, because we cannot think now of being a real contender.\n\nBurnley 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – live!

Burnley were better than us and I am massively disappointed because we wanted to put pressure on the teams above us.”\n\nThe game was a bit of a slow-burner, which might have had something to do with Tottenham’s team bus arriving with an hour to spare after being delayed in traffic.\n\nThe visitors spent the first quarter playing themselves into the game at a leisurely pace with Burnley content to let them, though by half-time Tottenham had stepped up their efforts and produced a few half-chances. Christian Eriksen saw a shot saved then lofted a perfectly weighted pass to pick out Kane’s run into the area, only for the forward to show too much of the ball to Tom Heaton.\n\nIt was not all Spurs, Barnes possibly came closest to a first-half goal with a shot that fizzed narrowly over after Jeff Hendrick had got the better of Jan Vertonghen near the right corner flag but Burnley were playing most of the game on the edge of their own penalty area.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mike Dean is surrounded by Tottenham’s coaching staff after the final whistle. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nKane opened the second half with a languid though deceptively well-struck right-foot curler from 25 yards that Heaton did well to keep out, yet just before the hour and totally against the run of play Burnley took the lead from a set piece. Dwight McNeil deserved credit for a well-flighted corner that allowed Wood to score with his head from the six-yard line, though as the young winger’s stunning turn in the middle of the pitch helped win the corner in the first place he played a considerable part in breaking the deadlock.\n\nVertonghen felt the ball came off Hendrick last and a corner should not have been given but it was impossible to spot.\n\nIt was now up to Spurs to respond and they did so nine minutes later, when Danny Rose pinched a few yards at a throw-in to give Kane a start on the Burnley defence, allowing him to cut into the area from the left and slide a low shot into Heaton’s far corner.\n\nQuick guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Hide Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe\n\nThe contest was open and entertaining now, with Juan Foyth and Phil Bardsley picking up cautions for over-enthusiastic challenges and Hendrick almost restoring Burnley’s lead with a shot that rolled narrowly wide.\n\nMcNeil’s shot was stopped on the line by Hugo Lloris before increased Burnley pressure paid off, when the substitute Johann Berg Gudmundsson’s hopeful cross-cum-shot reached Barnes at the far post for an easy tap-in. Eriksen had a chance to snatch an equaliser but headed straight at Heaton.\n\n“We were effective,” Sean Dyche said after Burnley extended their unbeaten run to eight. “Spurs are a top side but we

Raúl Jiménez earned the visitors a share of the points by calmly converting the second penalty of the afternoon with seven minutes remaining.\n\nBoth of Bournemouth’s penalties appeared to be fortunate, with the first awarded after King went down under minimal contact from João Moutinho.

After making the most of Moutinho’s dangled leg, King picked himself up to slot his ninth goal of the campaign into the bottom right corner from the spot.\n\nThe visitors’ sense of injustice increased six minutes later when they were denied a penalty of their own. In an attempt to clear the ball Mepham inadvertently headed the ball on to his right arm but the referee, Roger East, opted to award a corner and then book Diogo Jota for protesting.\n\nEast again prompted additional anger from the travelling fans when Jefferson Lerma escaped with only a yellow card – his 10th of the season – after appearing to catch Moutinho with an elbow.\n\n“João Moutinho is bleeding heavily from his mouth,” added Nuno. “He was not happy and, when a short man is angry, it’s tough.”\n\nMatt Doherty was wiped out in the area by Adam Smith after scuffing a shot wide, allowing Jiménez to beat Artur Boruc confidently from the spot with seven minutes left.\n\nBournemouth then had the chance to go back ahead two minutes later when Fraser was felled by the substitute Cavaleiro but this time King stuck his penalty against the woodwork.\n\n“My initial reaction to the first one was that it was a penalty,” Bournemouth’s manager, Eddie Howe, said. “You’re always slightly biased but I thought theirs was harsh on us. The player got his shot away and you don’t see players penalised for the follow-through in that scenario very often.\n\n“The third one, there is a debate over whether it is inside the box. I haven’t seen it again. We should score and win. King has been a reliable taker for us – but it wasn’t to be.”"}, {"date": "23/02/2019", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52174, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Martin Dubravka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Schär", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Lejeune", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [52], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Hayden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Longstaff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Almirón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [46], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}], "subs": [{"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Freddie Woodman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [20], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juninho Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [24]}, {"name": "Elias Kachunga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Terence Kongolo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philip Billing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karlan Ahearne-Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Stankovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [24], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When the floodlights were turned on in the second half it seemed almost unnecessary. This was less to do with dusk still being some way off than the sense that Miguel Almirón already appeared to have flicked a switch and illuminated the entire stadium.\n\nAdmittedly, he missed a few chances and Huddersfield did play most of the match with 10 men but the Paraguay playmaker’s home debut proved little short of electrifying. When he was replaced by Christian Atsu in the 80th minute it was to a standing ovation with Atsu’s enthusiastic clapping as he waited to come on amusing the fourth official, Martin Atkinson.\n\nBournemouth’s Josh King misses penalty to let Wolves off the hook Read more\n\nIf everyone could see why Rafael Benítez was so anxious to transport Almirón from Atlanta and make him a club-record £21m signing, Salomón Rondón arguably enjoyed an even better afternoon. The Venezuela centre-forward, borrowed from West Brom, was simply superb, unhinging Huddersfield’s defence and exacerbating Jan Siewert’s already intense relegation worries as he reduced Newcastle’s own fears of the drop by scoring their first goal and helping create the second for Ayoze Pérez.\n\n“We needed to win and I’m very pleased with the performance,” said Benítez. “Almirón did well. He was very dynamic, he plays between the lines and he will get better.”\n\nThe man of the moment had begun by bewitching Newcastle fans and bewildering Huddersfield in almost equal measure. In the course of one early cameo his quick feet and even faster brain swept him beyond a clutch of markers before he audaciously dinked the ball over the advancing Jonas Lössl and on to the post. From the rebound, Rondón also struck the woodwork.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Salomón Rondón celebrates after giving Newcastle the lead early in the second half. Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters\n\nDeployed on the left of Benítez’s 5-4-1 formation, Almirón was impressing. In a crude attempt to recalibrate the power balance, Tommy Smith reacted to the new boy toeing the ball away by lunging into a reckless, potentially leg-breaking challenge that Huddersfield’s captain had no hope of winning.\n\nWith Almirón left crumpled and motionless on the turf, Kevin Friend had no hesitation in showing the right-back a red card and, with 20 minutes gone, the visitors were very much up against it.\n\nAs Smith headed down the tunnel, Newcastle’s record signing rose, gingerly but mercifully intact, from the ground following prolonged treatment.\n\nIf the home fans – not to mention Benítez – feared a clattering that left Almirón’s sock torn by the defender’s studs might send this deceptively frail looking figure retreating into his shell, they were very wrong. Instead, there was zero indication of the already hallmark rapid change of pace, sublime left foot and repertoire of tricks being inhibited by intimidation.\n\nBurnley’s Ashley Barnes sinks Spurs then Pochettino confronts referee Read more\n\nChris Löwe rescued Lössl courtesy of a late interception after the goalkeeper seemed to have saved Almirón’s low, angled drive – dispatched after a smart swivel had wrong-footed two defenders – only to allow the ball to escape his grasp and very nearly trickle over the line.\n\nLössl atoned by expertly pushing Pérez’s shot over the bar before watching, relieved, as Rondón headed Sean Longstaff’s cross over the bar.\n\nA local academy graduate, Longstaff’s tall, straight-backed running style is almost uncannily reminiscent of fellow Geordie Michael Carrick’s and the similarity does not end there. The accuracy, vision and efficiency of the 21 year-old’s passing explain why Longstaff – who hit the bar with a late, curving 25-yard shot – kept Jonjo Shelvey out of the team.\n\nShelvey would have relished delivering the long diagonal crossfield pass from Florian Lejeune that switched play and prompted Rondón’s 46th-minute goal.\n\nWith Huddersfield’s backline bamboozled, DeAndre Yedlin and Isaac Hayden – excellent alongside Longstaff in central midfield where that pair ensured Newcastle controlled the tempo – combined to cue up Rondón to nutmeg Lössl, the striker shooting through the keeper’s legs from eight yards.\n\nAlmirón (who else?) supplied the crucial left-wing, volleyed cross that prefaced the doubling of that advantage. As the ball arced into the area it was headed on by Yedlin, with Rondón getting a subsequent touch before Pérez’s right foot did the rest.\n\n“The sending-off changed everything,” said a subdued Siewert whose side have collected one point from the last 14 games. “Almirón had a good game but we have to defend better.”"}, {"date": "23/02/2019", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance":

to take charge of a team in the Premier League, his side won a contest that left many Leicester fans believing Claude Puel’s reign has gone on too long.\n\nThis result was a vital boost in Crystal Palace’s fight against relegation and exposed Leicester’s manager to more flak. Boos at the final whistle confirmed as much. This time two years ago Leicester were making their way back from a Champions League knockout tie at Sevilla, now they appear to be heading nowhere fast. Seven defeats in nine matches is no kind of haul for a club who aspire to returning to Europe. Puel insisted his team deserved better and pleaded with fans to keep faith.\n\n“It is a difficult moment for my team with all these young players,” he said. “They have the feeling they are not getting fair results for all their work but it is important they keep going. They need to show character and personality. We have a game against Brighton on Tuesday and it’s a good thing to have the possibility to show the right reaction.”\n\nBurnley’s Ashley Barnes sinks Spurs then Pochettino confronts referee Read more\n\nLeicester began strongly but still wound up falling behind to Michy Batshuayi’s instinctive strike just before half-time. That represented the 19th time in 27 league matches Leicester have conceded first. Jonny Evans equalised in the second half, but rather than complete the turnaround, they unravelled, each goal more damning than the previous.\n\nHodgson was more interested in accentuating positives. His team saw Burnley and Newcastle win earlier in the day and they responded with style to pull six points clear of 18th-place Southampton. Hodgson, aged 71 years and 198 days, said he takes inspiration from Sir David Attenborough, who is still making documentaries at 92. The momentum his team have gathered – with eight points from the last 12 available – should help them to survive in the Premier League jungle.\n\n“This victory will give us a lot of heart,” Hodgson said. “If we’re capable of coming to a team like Leicester and getting a win, and winning at Manchester City, then I’ve got to believe in this team.”\n\nLeicester have also beaten Manchester City but that was on Boxing Day and they have not won at the King Power Stadium since, instead falling to lowly outfits such as Cardiff, Southampton and now Palace. They have not won anywhere since victory at Everton on New Year’s Day. A lot of fine play is being undone by errant finishing and sloppy defending.\n\nTheir bright start spawned hope. Youri Tielemans, making his home debut, unloaded a shot from long-range in the second minute but Vicente Guaita saved easily.\n\nJamie Vardy headed over the bar from a cross by Harvey Barnes, and moments later Mamadou Sakho hurled himself in front of a shot by James Maddison from the edge of the area. Maddison had another go with a free-kick from 25 yards on the half hour but fired into the wall without the referee spotting that Batshuayi made the block with his arms.\n\nPalace grabbed the lead with their first notable attack. James McArthur let fly with a hopeful shot from long range that Kasper Schmeichel would surely have gathered if Batshuayi had not thrown out a leg to divert it into the net.\n\nIt took a defender to breach Palace’s rearguard in the 64th minute. The visitors failed to cope properly with a long throw-in by Christian Fuchs, and when Barnes banged the ball towards the six-yard box from the edge of the area, Evans swivelled to send a first-time shot into the net.\n\nNo sooner had they levelled than Leicester nodded off. McArthur duped two defenders with a feint on the left before chipping a cross towards the far post. While Harry Maguire signalled offside against Batshuayi, Wilfried Zaha snuck in behind the England defender to steer a volley into the net.\n\nPalace looked comfortable after that. Luka Milivojevic converted a penalty after Evans clunked into Batshuayi. Leicester got worse. Maguire was robbed by Jordan Ayew on halfway in stoppage time, and the Ghanaian released Zaha, who rammed a shot past Schmeichel at the near post."}, {"date": "22/02/2019", "arena": "Cardiff City

that; he was very generous to assist Troy [for his first goal],” said Gracia of Deulofeu. “All these details are so important because all the players are pulling in the same direction and helping each other, which is great for us.\n\n“I’m happy with the way he is playing, we are competing in all the games and, with this ambition, we can achieve something special this season.”\n\nAs both sets of players arrived here, news broke of Watford reaching a £4m settlement with Everton over the departure of Marco Silva last year. Gracia’s successful start to life as manager has allowed Watford fans to say good riddance to Silva.\n\nIt took Deulofeu 18 minutes to put himself on the path to become Watford’s first hat-trick hero since Mark Falco in 1986. Cardiff’s returning captain, Sean Morrison, Bruno Manga and Joe Bennett all tried and failed to wrest the ball off Deeney on the edge of the area before he laid it off for the Spanish forward to find the bottom corner with pin-point accuracy.\n\nNeil Warnock’s men were second best but should have had an opportunity to equalise after Daryl Janmaat got the wrong side of Josh Murphy and brought him down with a clumsy challenge in the box. The referee, Simon Hooper, waved away the protests to the disgust of the Cardiff fans and manager before he blew for half-time.\n\nDeulofeu had not scored for eight matches but looked as if he was back playing for Barcelona as he ran riot in the second half. Abdoulaye Doucoure headed Bennett’s free-kick clear and into the path of the former Everton player, who knocked the ball past Manga on the halfway line, before taking it round Neil Etheridge and slotting home his fifth goal of the season.\n\nDeulofeu completed his first hat-trick in English football on 63 minutes after Etienne Capoue robbed Harry Arter of possession and slipped him in behind the defence for him to lift the ball over Etheridge.\n\nDeulofeu danced past the defence and set up Deeney for an easy tap-in after 73 minutes. There was still time for Bamba to bundle home but Deeney wrapped up the 5-1 thumping from close range.\n\n“It was bizarre, the referee said he seen it and he had made a mistake,” fumed Warnock about the penalty decision. “Mistakes shouldn’t be made at this level.\n\n“Deeney and all of them were telling me it was a stonewall penalty and it would have been different if we’d gone in 1-1 with our tails up.”"}, {"date": "22/02/2019", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 59950, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

their season, confused decision-making and erratic management probably sending them straight back to the Championship. But on this one occasion they can feel genuinely aggrieved that their fate was unfairly decided by someone else.\n\nThey were ahead and playing well against West Ham, when Javier Hernández punched home a goal and changed the course of a game that ended in defeat for Claudio Ranieri’s side.\n\nRanieri was furious at the time but later was more sanguine about Lee Mason’s failure to spot the offence. “It’s too easy to say yes,” he said, when asked if the handball had affected the outcome. “After the equaliser West Ham increased their confidence, and we were a little scared. It was a big pity the referee was covered [unsighted].”\n\nWatford in seventh heaven as Gerard Deulofeu hat-trick sinks Cardiff Read more\n\nReplays seemed to show Mason had a good view of the incident but the referee was far from the only one to miss it: only a couple of Fulham players protested and it did take four or five replays to be 100% sure the touch came from hand rather than head. Still, perhaps the forward’s guilty glance like a child with his hand in the sweet tin might have been proof enough. “Only he knows the truth,” said Ranieri, smiling ruefully.\n\nIt had all started so well. Ryan Babel gave Fulham the lead in the third minute, sweeping home after a low Ryan Sessegnon cross fell perfectly in the six-yard box, and for about 20 minutes Fulham were purposeful, strong and in control. It felt strange. It felt like it could not last, although legally speaking it should have. The controversial equaliser came from a Robert Snodgrass corner, improperly cleared and turned in at the far post. Just before the break West Ham were ahead, again from a Snodgrass corner but this time it was fair, Issa Diop given all the time and space he needed to batter a close-ranger header past Sergio Rico.\n\nFulham were slightly the better team after half-time but as Ranieri said that did not translate into many real chances. The home crowd was roused first by the return of Manuel Lanzini, on as a substitute after missing the season to date with a cruciate ligament injury, and then West Ham’s third goalin the final moments, Michail Antonio bouncing a header in from a Marko Arnautovic cross.\n\nIt was West Ham’s first win in six weeks, gratefully received even if the performance was not dazzling. “After those 10 strange minutes [at the start] we dominated the game,” Manuel Pellegrini said. “It was a good performance.”\n\nFor Ranieri and Fulham, who are eight points from safety, time is running out. “It’ll be a miracle [to survive] but we must fight together,” he said. “I believe in my players.

Just as Matt Doherty had headed a winner in the 94th minute at St James’ Park in December, so Newcastle United were again undone by a last-gasp goal as Willy Boly headed in Adama Traoré’s deep cross in the 95th.\n\nBoly was able to head beyond a flapping Martin Dubravka in an aerial duel at the back post but once Benítez had moved beyond his disappointment, the Newcastle manager should still take great heart from the resolve his side displayed as Isaac Hayden’s rare goal earned United the draw that lifts them a point above the relegation zone.\n\nBenítez initially said his goalkeeper should have defended Traoré’s high cross better before revealing his true feelings. “In England they don’t understand the rules,” he said. “It was already the 94th minute so you can say too many things that won’t change what happened, like we couldn’t change in the first game. I’m obviously disappointed but very happy with the performance of the team.”\n\nMaurizio Sarri has a month to save his job as Chelsea prepare for Malmö trip Read more\n\nAsked to clarify if he believed the referee, Graham Scott, had made a mistake, he added: “The six-yard box is there to protect the keeper. You have to protect the keeper. We have been here for years and it’s still very difficult to explain that.”\n\nThe concession of the late goal added insult to injury for Benítez, clearly still holding a grudge for the events at St James’s where he believed Boly should have been dismissed for elbowing Ayoze Pérez in Wolves’ penalty area. “I think we have to be really disappointed with the way we concede in both games against this team,” he added. “After an elbow in the face of my player and a penalty not given and then we concede today, you can analyse it. But I’m really disappointed to concede this way against a good team.”\n\nCertainly Wolves refuse to admit when they are beaten. They have now scored 14 goals after the 80th minute this thrilling season, six of those coming in added time. There is a resilience that comes with belief. “Yes that we have until the last minute,” Nuno Espírito Santo, the Wolves head coach, said. “Till the last second the referee whistles to finish, we keep going. For that I am really pleased because it one of the things we must keep on doing, [showing] character and believing.

Not only has the manager been able to find a formula that has also brought victories over Cardiff City and Manchester City, he has also been able to introduce a £21m attacking presence and Miguel Almirón came off the bench to applause almost as rapturous as that greeting Hayden’s first goal since October 2017. Benítez has made it plain that talk of his Newcastle future must wait till the summer. But at least a thaw seems to be in evidence.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWolves, with five wins from their previous seven games, were the dominant team in the first period, with Raúl Jiménez, eight goals from his last 11 starts, doing everything but score. The manner in which he took the long route to get past DeAndre Yedlin and Fabian Schär before unleashing a shot that Dubravka was happy to save was indicative of his soaring confidence.\n\nNewcastle finished the half the stronger, however, Salomón Rondón running on to Pérez’s clever angled pass and managing a shot that only went wide after Conor Coady’s tackle. Eleven minutes after the restart, it was a similar through ball that set up their goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Ritchie in action under the Molineux lights.

say the scene was set for Jamie Vardy was one of the understatements of the season. Dropped to the Leicester bench by Claude Puel despite his fine scoring record against big-six opposition, the striker was introduced in the 59th minute with his team trailing to Dávinson Sánchez’s first-half header but having just been awarded the softest of penalties.\n\nSurely Vardy would not run straight on to take the kick? He did and the Wembley crowd held its breath. In 51 previous Premier League appearances against the big six Vardy had scored 28 goals. Thirteen of them had come since the beginning of last season but, on this occasion, his sights were awry. Hugo Lloris, the game’s outstanding performer, went the right way to save and that seemed even more important moments later when Christian Eriksen scored at the other end for 2-0.\n\nTottenham Hotspur v Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nVardy would get his goal on 76 minutes, a brave close-range finish, and Leicester pushed hard for the equaliser. It would have been the least they deserved on the balance of play and chances created. But it did not come and, when Son Heung-min sprinted clear in stoppage time to beat Kasper Schmeichel for his 15th goal of the season, it added up to relief for Spurs and frustration for the visitors.\n\nIt was Spurs’ fourth league win on the spin and another occasion when, in the absence of the injured Harry Kane and Dele Alli, they were not at their fluent best. Yet they found a way to get the result and it kept them within striking distance of Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the table. Next up for them is the Champions League last-16 tie against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on Wednesday.\n\nIn the absence of Vardy at the outset Puel experimented with the winger Demarai Gray at the tip of his 4-1-4-1 formation. Gray was pacy and willing but he lacked end product. Not that he was alone. Leicester, in general, were easy on the eye with their passing and build-up play but wasteful when it mattered most – with the 21-year-old Harvey Barnes the biggest culprit. As such they flattered to deceive and have now taken only one point from an available 15.\n\nQuick guide Premier League title race: the remaining fixtures Show Hide Manchester City (86 points) 24 Apr Man Utd (a)\n\n28 Apr Burnley (a)\n\n4 May Leicester (h)\n\n12 May Brighton (a) Liverpool (85 points) 21 Apr Cardiff (a)\n\n26 Apr Huddersfield (h)\n\n5 May Newcastle (a)\n\n12 May Wolves (h)\n\n“We finish with big regrets,” Puel said. “It was not a fair result but it was our fault. We have to find a clinical edge.”\n\nIt was open and entertaining from the first whistle and Leicester were aggrieved to trail at half-time. Harry Maguire worked Lloris with an early header while Barnes dragged shots wide of the far and near posts when well placed. Puel gave the loan signing, Youri Tielemans, his debut in midfield and the Belgian impressed with his technique and vision.\n\nThe first flashpoint came on 15 minutes when Maguire lunged in on Son inside the area. There was contact, though possibly not enough to send the forward tumbling to the ground. Michael Oliver did not give the penalty and he booked Son for diving.\n\nPochettino later described the decision as unbelievable, when he also mentioned Oliver had denied Son a last-gasp penalty against Liverpool in September when Spurs were 2-1 down. “It was so clear,” Pochettino said. “Do you think we are a team trying to cheat the referee?

One by one they have been ticked off: first Arsenal, then Everton and finally a Chelsea side that looked in need of smelling salts before the midway stage of the first half. Three games, 11 goals, nine points, and more fool anyone who thought this might be the most difficult assignment of the lot.\n\nWhat actually happened was a peacock-like spreading of City’s feathers, featuring a four-goal blitz inside the opening 25 minutes, another hat-trick for Sergio Agüero and the feeling, once again, that, if Liverpool can beat this team to the Premier League title, it will rank as the most exceptional performance of any of the championship-winning sides from Anfield through the years.\n\nSergio Agüero’s pageant directed by Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nIf anything it was just a surprise City did not add even more sheen to the margin of victory bearing in mind there was never a single part of the match when they looked bored by their own brilliance. City, to put it into context, have now scored twice or more in every Premier League home match this season, a feat no top-division team has managed in 15 successive games since Tottenham Hotspur from March to December 1965, with Bill Nicholson in the dugout and Jimmy Greaves terrorising opposition defences. Including the cup competitions the reigning champions have accumulated 33 goals from their last six home games. It feels like a statistic from another time, a sepia-tinted era of baggy shorts and boggy pitches.\n\nFor Agüero it was his 15th hat-trick in City’s colours and perhaps it would be impertinent to dwell too long on the moment, at 1-0, when he also produced possibly the worst miss of all his years in English football. Two yards out, Agüero might argue one would have to go back in time even further to find similar. No matter: his first goal came five minutes later and perhaps there was a measure of anger contained in his firecracker of a shot, 25 yards out, into the top corner of Kepa Arrizabalaga’s net. Missing a sitter, scoring a screamer – who cares if it was unorthodox when Agüero has 25 goals in his last 16 starts for City at this ground?\n\nBy the time Pep Guardiola’s team were done they had moved back above Liverpool to the top of the table, albeit having played a game more, and it did not seem unreasonable to wonder whether this result might seriously endanger Maurizio’s Sarri’s position as Chelsea manager. Put it this way: Roman Abramovich has sacked good men for considerably less.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThis was their fourth successive away defeat in all competitions and everyone connected with Chelsea, not just Abramovich, must be alarmed by their deterioration, particularly having just been whacked 4-0 at Bournemouth. The final goal means Chelsea drop below Arsenal to sixth place on goals scored. Yes, there is the Carabao Cup final to come on 24 February and a chance to decorate an increasingly problematic season with some silverware. Just do not bet your mortgage on it: the opposition at Wembley will be … Manchester City. Maybe Guardiola will start David Silva next time, too.\n\nChelsea have not managed an away goal since 30 December but their problems here owed more to chaotic defending and a collective meltdown after it all began, four minutes in, with Kevin De Bruyne slipping a free-kick behind the opposition defence to find Bernardo Silva completely free. Silva jinked into the penalty area and his low cross flicked off David Luiz to roll invitingly into Raheem Sterling’s path. Sterling found a gap between Arrizabalaga and the goalkeeper’s right-hand post and, after that, it was startling to see Chelsea’s capitulation.\n\nPlay Video 1:04 'I'm always at risk' of being sacked by Chelsea, says Sarri after humiliation at Man City – video\n\nIf nothing else, at least there were some encouraging signs for Sarri that Gonzalo Higuaín can flourish as the new arrowhead to Chelsea’s attack. No team, however, can expect to get away with defending as abjectly as Chelsea did during the period in the first half when most of the damage was inflicted. Chelsea conceded a goal on average every five minutes and, though an argument could be made that City pressured them into mistakes, that was not always the case.\n\nAgüero’s second goal was a case in point, originating from Ross Barkley trying to head the ball to his goalkeeper from the edge of the penalty area. It is an old Paul Gascoigne trick and, if it comes off, with so many opponents in close proximity, it looks good. If it does not, it can make the player who tried it look foolish in the extreme. Barkley got it horribly wrong and Agüero pounced to get in front of Arrizabalaga and score with a swivelling left-footed shot.\n\nQuick guide Premier League title race: the remaining fixtures Show Hide Manchester City (86 points) 24 Apr Man Utd (a)\n\n28 Apr Burnley (a)\n\n4 May Leicester (h)\n\n12 May Brighton (a) Liverpool (85 points) 21 Apr Cardiff (a)\n\n26 Apr Huddersfield (h)\n\n5 May Newcastle (a)\n\n12 May Wolves (h)\n\nIf Chelsea had been fully prepared, they should not have been taken aback by the early onslaught. City have now scored 15 times in the opening 15-minute periods of their league matches this season and the next most impressive figure belongs to Arsenal, with seven. It was 3-0 after 19 minutes and Ilkay Gündogan, a player who deserves far more acclaim than he actually receives, swiftly made it four, catching out Arrizabalaga with a 20-yard effort into the bottom corner.\n\nMaurizio Sarri admits concern over Chelsea but sidesteps query on future Read more\n\nAgüero completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot 11 minutes into the second half, after César Azpilicueta’s foul on the elusive and merciless Sterling, and City’s record scorer also headed one of De Bruyne’s beautifully delivered crosses against the crossbar before making way for Gabriel Jesus.\n\nOleksandr Zinchenko, drafted into City’s defence and outstanding throughout, supplied the cross for Sterling to finish the scoring. It was the heaviest defeat Chelsea have suffered in the Abramovich era – the heaviest, indeed, since losing 7-0 at Nottingham Forest in 1991, back in the days of Gordon Durie, Kerry Dixon and Tony Dorigo – and, when Sarri went straight down the tunnel at the end without shaking Guardiola’s hand, perhaps, to give him the benefit of the doubt, it was not a deliberate snub on the part of Chelsea’s manager.

Manchester United could afford to stretch their legs long before the end. They finished the job with maximum efficiency and still could have scored a hatful as they regained a place in the top four for the first time since the opening weekend of the season.\n\nUnited settled for three, allowing Ole Gunnar Solskjær to keep Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard back before PSG visit Old Trafford for the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie on Tuesday. Two goals from Paul Pogba and a sensational solo effort from Anthony Martial were enough to maintain their resurgence under José Mourinho’s successor, who has collected 25 points from 27 since his appointment in December.\n\nMohamed Salah and Liverpool sweep aside Bournemouth to reclaim top spot Read more\n\nIt has been a remarkable turnaround given that United were 11 points off fourth place before hiring Solskjær. No manager has held a better record from his first nine games in the league’s history and, while Chelsea could leapfrog them when they visit Manchester City on Sunday afternoon, it was striking to observe the change in a group who were choked by negativity during Mourinho’s grim reign.\n\nThat said, there are tougher tests to come. While United’s supporters revelled in another fine victory, Fulham’s fans booed Claudio Ranieri down the tunnel at the end. The atmosphere in the stands was mutinous and there seems little prospect of the team with the worst defensive record in the division pulling off a miraculous escape. Fulham have conceded 58 goals and are seven points adrift of 17th place with 12 games remaining.\n\nCraven Cottage, normally such a genteel place to watch a game, was an angry place when Ranieri replaced André Schürrle with Cyrus Christie in the 53rd minute. The locals were aggrieved to see two of their favourites, Ryan Sessegnon and Tom Cairney, kicking their heels on the bench until deep into the second half and made their feelings clear by aiming chants of “you don’t know what you’re doing” at a manager who appears to have run out of ideas after three months.\n\n“I wanted to put two strikers in front and try to defend better,” Ranieri said. “Ryan is a good player. But in this moment he is not in his best form. I consider him an important player for us. For now and for the future.”\n\nThe frustration for Fulham was that they could have been ahead by the time United took the lead, with their first shot, only for Luciano Vietto to waste a glorious opportunity inside the first minute, scuffing wide after being picked out by Schürrle.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nA strong wind made the ball move weirdly in the air and it took United a while to adjust. Not too long, though, given that they began to look threatening once Pogba took charge in midfield.\n\nPogba has been directly involved in 13 goals in the league under Solskjær, scoring eight and creating five, and he eased United ahead with a powerful strike. Ander Herrera won possession, Martial released Pogba and the midfielder lashed a rising drive inside Sergio Rico’s near post from a tight angle.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Pogba rifles in the opening goal. Photograph: Craig Mercer/MB Media/Getty Images\n\n“Paul is in good form,” Solskjær said. “When he arrives in the box there is always a chance of an assist or a goal.”\n\nIn the 23rd minute, Martial produced a moment of magic in keeping with United’s counterattacking traditions. The winger started his run just inside his own half after receiving a pass from Phil Jones and there was no catching him as he ignored Denis Odoi’s attempts to bring him down, shimmied past Maxime Le Marchand and opened up his body to curl a lovely shot past Rico.\n\nSolskjær is making the right tactical calls, strengthening his claim to be given the job on a permanent basis. He gave opportunities to some of his squad players here and was rewarded when strong work from Romelu Lukaku led to Le Marchand bringing down Juan Mata just inside Fulham’s area.

The Ivorian had become increasingly influential, rendering Ryan Fredericks ever more flustered on the flank, when, 14 minutes from time, he exchanged passes with James McArthur, exploited space near the byline and spat away a shot from a tight angle.\n\nThe rise of Aaron Wan-Bissaka: ‘A lot of the time I can’t get my head around it’ Read more\n\nThe effort would not have beaten the excellent Lukasz Fabianski had it not flicked up off Issa Diop to loop beyond the goalkeeper, but Palace had probably earned that element of good fortune.\n\nIt was Zaha’s first goal at Selhurst Park since the final day of last season and even if he loses his appeal and ends up missing the FA Cup fifth-round tie at Doncaster next Sunday Roy Hodgson may consider that to have been a risk worth taking.\n\n“It would have been a travesty had we not got anything from the game,” said Hodgson, who had made clear his frustration at the referee’s performance as the officials departed after the final whistle.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest West Ham United’s Mark Noble is congratulated after scoring. Photograph: Rob Newell - CameraSport/CameraSport via Getty Images\n\n“But, had we ended up losing 1-0 and played as we did in the second half to the end, I would have told the players in the dressing room that it had been a very good team performance. I can continue to hope this level of performance can get us into the top half of the table.”\n\nThey departed wondering quite how they had not forced home what would have been a vital win, given they still hover three points from the bottom three.\n\nThe substitute Michy Batshuayi and McArthur had missed glorious opportunities when they had trailed, the latter gliding on to Patrick van Aanholt’s pass to stare down Fabianski. Christian Benteke and the Dutch full-back had both been free to his right unmarked in front of goal, pleading for a pass, but the Scot waited for the goalkeeper to sink to his knees and with the arena hushed in expectation lifted his shot over the Pole but wide of his near post. It was an excruciating miss.\n\nNot that West Ham would have deserved to suffer a fifth consecutive away defeat in all competitions. Their first-half authority had yielded a deserved lead that might have been extended beyond Noble’s penalty, converted after Vicente Guaita had been penalised for clattering Michail Antonio as he leaped to reach Declan Rice’s cleverly clipped pass.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe visitors had carved out the better opportunities up to then, Guaita denying Fredericks and Robert Snodgrass, with Felipe Anderson – his weight of pass immaculate – orchestrating their attacks.\n\nAs it transpired, they regretted a failure to chisel out more than a slender advantage and could not rely upon Fabianski’s excellence to maintain their lead. The Pole had denied McArthur and Benteke.\n\n“We retreated to try and keep the lead and that was a mistake,” said Manuel Pellegrini. “Good players with big possession will probably score a goal in the end. They scored a lucky goal, with the deflection, but they deserved it.”\n\nZaha now boasts goals in his past two games.

the race for the top four so their manager, Unai Emery, took heart from their first away win in the league since November. But his agitation throughout this game showed he knows his team’s problems have not been cured, even if he declared afterwards that he was proud of his players’ work rate.\n\nThey worked, alright, but did not show much class or solidity. This performance was good enough to edge past the Premier League’s bottom side, but Arsenal still looked vulnerable for long periods and the goal they conceded in stoppage time means they have yet to keep an away clean sheet in the league this season. It was Huddersfield’s first goal in six matches and they deserved it.\n\n“This victory is very important and gives us confidence in our target of reaching the top four,” said Emery. “After 26 matches we are one point behind Manchester United. The top four is our target. It will be difficult but our motivation is very great.”\n\nMohamed Salah and Liverpool sweep aside Bournemouth to reclaim top spot Read more\n\nHuddersfield’s first-choice goalkeeper, Jonas Lössl, had talked defiantly in the buildup about staging a sensational late escape from relegation, reckoning that a haul of around 24 points from their remaining matches would see them reach safety. But Lössl fell ill overnight. If that was not an omen, then the fact that his replacement, Ben Hamer, bungled to help Alex Iwobi open the scoring in the 16th minute did not augur well for Huddersfield.\n\nEven before that Arsenal had threatened to score, looking dangerous every time they ventured forward. Terence Kongolo thwarted Alexandre Lacazette with a last-gasp tackle in the eighth minute and two minutes later Iwobi blasted into the side-netting after being teed up by Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who regularly made inroads from right wing-back.\n\nThere was no reprieve when Arsenal caught Huddersfield out with a quick free-kick on halfway, Sead Kolasinac, the other wing-back, sent scurrying down the left before flighting a cross to the far post. Iwobi met it with a weak volley from 10 yards but the ball found its way into the net as Hamer reacted too slowly to a deflection off Kongolo.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Hamer is unable to keep out Alex Iwobi’s shot. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nHuddersfield responded well, Jonathan Hogg, Aaron Mooy and Juninho Bacuna regularly getting the better of Mattéo Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira in midfield. The hosts could have been awarded a penalty in the 25th minute when a corner was only half-cleared and Jason Puncheon’s shot from 20 yards was blocked by Laurent Koscielny’s right hand.

He could have finished an attack he led in the 39th minute but was denied by Hamer, who saved his shot from 12 yards. No matter, Arsenal increased their lead five minutes later, Mkhitaryan again feeding the overlapping Maitland-Niles, whose low cross presented the unmarked Lacazette with an easy close-range finish.\n\nPogba drives Manchester United into top four as Fulham fans rail at Ranieri Read more\n\nNow Huddersfield needed to score twice, a feat they have managed once in the league this season. Emery started to look more relaxed but still felt the need to replace Torreira with Mohamed Elneny in an attempt to gain more control in central midfield. It did not really work and Arsenal’s three central defenders came under regular pressure.\n\nArsenal still carried menace on the counterattack. Mkhitaryan set up Iwobi in the 70th minute, but the midfielder lacked ruthlessness and Hamer was able to save. Two minutes later, Bernd Leno made a meal of stopping a low drive from 18 yards by Adama Diakhaby. No Huddersfield player was on hand to punish the Arsenal keeper when he spilled it.\n\nHuddersfield never gave up.

With a little more composure in front of goal Liverpool could practically have wiped out the goal-difference deficit, and what a statement of intent that would have been.\n\nJürgen Klopp says players’ attitude helped Liverpool overcome wobble Read more\n\nThe opening goal came midway through the first half and changed the mood of the afternoon completely. In the 23 minutes that preceded it, Liverpool had shown diligence and patience but not much imagination in trying to break down Bournemouth’s low defensive block. The visitors found they could cope with buildup play that varied between predictable and clumsy, and when Mohamed Salah found pockets of space on the right his attempts on goal did not cause Artur Boruc undue concern.\n\nThe breakthrough, when it came, was simplicity itself, although Eddie Howe was probably right in claiming it was fractionally offside. A James Milner corner failed to beat the first defender, but when Naby Keïta calmly returned the ball to the right for the jobbing full-back to have another go he swung over a much better cross that Sadio Mané met with a firm downward header. It was his fourth goal in four games and Mané showed his versatility a couple of minutes later by launching Liverpool’s next attack from close to the corner flag in his own half. A clever ball down the left channel found Roberto Firmino running into free space and when the Brazilian looked up he was able to pick out Georginio Wijnaldum up in support. The midfielder should probably have gone for goal himself from a threatening position, though he appeared to lack confidence and moved the ball wider to Salah, who miscontrolled.\n\nWijnaldum did not make the same mistake when his next chance arrived 10 minutes later, courtesy of an inspired ball forward from Andy Robertson. Again in an unusually advanced position, Wijnaldum first showed neat control to reach the pass, then with the ball still bouncing spotted his opportunity to lift a shot over Boruc, who had advanced slightly from his line.\n\nBournemouth had stayed mostly compact after going a goal down but were obliged to come out a little with their deficit doubled. Before retiring to defensive duties the visitors had almost taken an early lead when Ryan Fraser tested Alisson in the second minute, but the goalkeeper beat away the shot. Salah brought a save from Boruc at the end of the first half as Liverpool tried to extend their lead and Jefferson Lerma fired over the bar just before the interval with his side attempting to get back into the game.\n\nWithin three minutes of the restart Bournemouth’s hopes of a comeback were quashed when Liverpool pushed further ahead in exquisite style. Salah scored it, drilling a low shot into the bottom corner with his usual efficiency, though the sublime touches came from Keïta, with a superbly weighted ball forward into Firmino’s path, and Firmino himself, who dummied to shoot before casually backheeling the ball into space where he knew Salah would be waiting. It was the Egyptian’s 20th goal of the campaign in all competitions, making him the first Liverpool player since Luis Suárez to achieve the feat in successive seasons.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSalah hit the bar with only Boruc to beat as the game moved into its final quarter.

If you don’t stop conceding goals at the end and giving points away it will be very, very difficult. You can speak about development, tactical and everything else but I think the way that we have given four points away this week. We have rolled a very big stone in our way now and it will take a lot of work to remove it mentally and physically. We have two weeks now with no game, so for two weeks now we have this result in our mind and it’s the most horrible situation you can imagine. It’s a disaster.\n\n“We have to sleep on it. At the moment it feels horrible. Maybe when we wake up tomorrow, it won’t feel better, it will feel worse. I don’t want to make drama. But we have to be very, very honest with ourselves. Otherwise I can’t look in the mirror. It’s nothing new that we have to fight until the last game. That was clear for me in December. It does not change in February. But we could have made a big step forward. The way we lost this was the most horrible thing.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A tribute to Emiliano Sala is seen on the big screen at St Mary’s. Photograph: Henry Browne/Getty Images\n\nThe game was bookended by Cardiff supporters singing the name of Emiliano Sala, the club’s £15m record signing whose death was confirmed by police on Friday. Before kick-off there was an impeccable minute’s silence, while Cardiff players again wore shirts printed with a yellow daffodil – the Welsh flower and a symbol also of significance to his former club Nantes, nicknamed Les Canaris. In the away end, a few Argentina flags took prominence among the travelling supporters. But a match that had, at times, veered into the realms of slapstick it was so painfully short of quality came to a preposterous finale.\n\nBy the time Zohore, a substitute, wheeled away with seconds remaining, a turgid first half an hour punctuated by a series of stray passes, wayward goal-kicks and hopeful punts forward had been long forgotten about. For so long, the final ball eluded Saints so badly it was almost comical. Cardiff, meanwhile, displayed plenty of endeavour but lacked any real elegance, with Oumar Niasse repeatedly guilty of failing to make the ball stick, though Joe Ralls – described by Neil Warnock as a “manager’s player” – again impressed.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nA trio of billboards outside St Mary’s have been given a makeover, with the words “Welcome to Ralphampton” greeting supporters these days, though for Saints this was a case of the same old story; they have surrendered a league-high of nine points in the final 10 minutes of games this season. As for Cardiff, this victory alters the immediate outlook at the foot of the table.\n\nAsked about the psychological impact of leaping above the dotted line with 12 games to play, Warnock said: “It will make me sleep so much better in the next 10 days than I have for a long time. The pundits will still have us down but I think we have a good group of lads that don’t know when they are beaten. It’s a great quality to have at any level, even in the Premier League.”"}, {"date": "09/02/2019", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20333, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Ken Sema", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Masina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adalberto Peñaranda", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [90], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Digne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Cenk Tosun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This return was never likely to be a happy one for Marco Silva. Thirteen months after he was unceremoniously sacked by Watford, Andre Gray’s second-half goal meant Everton went down to yet another defeat – their fifth in six matches in all competitions – on an afternoon that he and Richarlison will want to forget quickly.\n\n“The club created a strategy,” said Silva. “All I can control is my job and I think I did it well.”\n\nBefore the match, the Watford captain, Troy Deeney, had distanced himself from comments he made at a fans forum this week where he promised to kick Everton’s players. Yet with passions running high in this part of Hertfordshire, as the chief executive, Scott Duxbury, said he would not engage with Silva in the opposition dugout, some supporters greeted their former manager with yellow inflatable snakes.\n\nAlex Iwobi and Alexandre Lacazette put Huddersfield further in mire Read more\n\nWatford are still seeking compensation for what they believe was an illegal approach from Everton after Ronald Koeman was dismissed in October 2017 and attempts to mediate a settlement between the two clubs failed, although Deeney appeared to fare better in the pre-match warm-up as he shared a warm embrace with Silva. Nonetheless, the fans made their feelings known as the teams were read out, with Richarlison, the Brazil forward who followed Silva to Goodison Park last summer, also singled out by the boo boys. “Javi Gracia, he’s better than you,” seemed particularly cruel.\n\nThe Everton manager made three changes from the side that lost to Manchester City in midweek as they attempted to turn around awful form that has yielded 11 points since the start of December. Many of Silva’s problems in that run have stemmed from his leaky defence, as was typified by the attempts to clear in the 11th minute after Deeney chested the ball down in the area. Luckily for Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford somehow managed to divert Étienne Capoue’s shot from five yards out on to the bar and over.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Agony for Marco Silva as Watford fans celebrate. Photograph: Nigel French/PA\n\nKeane had Everton’s first chance soon after when – not for the first time in the opening period – Richarlison was fouled, but his header from the resulting free-kick went straight at Ben Foster. The goalkeeper, who Deeney had revealed “eats shit, trains twice a week and turns up on a Saturday and is unbelievable”, also made a smart save from Kurt Zouma and then had to be alert to chase 40 yards out of his goal after Tom Davies broke free.\n\nFor all their possession in the Everton half, Watford were guilty of overplaying on several occasions and no more so than when a loose pass on the edge of their own area fell to Gylfi Sigurdsson and his shot was well saved by Foster. With seconds left before half-time, Gerard Deulofeu should have put the hosts in front after good work from the graceful Will Hughes but failed to connect properly with his attempt.\n\nGracia withdrew Ken Sema at the break and sent on Gray in an attempt to stretch Everton’s defence. But it was a piece of improvisation from Sigurdsson that almost broke the deadlock as his clever lob left Foster stranded, only to bounce off the woodwork.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWatford’s best chance of scoring seemed to be their threat from set pieces, with Pickford fortunate to escape with a free-kick when he had missed an attempted punch from a corner whipped dangerously across the face of his goal. Everton’s failure to clear another corner, albeit one that should not have been awarded, proved to be their undoing, however.\n\nCraig Cathcart’s brilliant backheel – “It was a pass more of a striker than a centre-back,” said Gracia – allowed Hughes to find space on the right and he picked out Gray for the simplest of finishes.\n\nLucas Digne hit the crossbar with a free-kick before substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin wasted a golden chance to earn a point with a header that missed the target. Everton’s misery was compounded when Zouma was sent off after the final whistle for arguing with the officials.\n\n“We had the chances to achieve the result but we were not effective,” said Silva, who added he would be seeking out Lee Probert for an explanation over Zouma’s dismissal.\n\nYet with the Watford supporters’ gleeful rendition of “you’re getting sacked in the morning” ringing in his ears as he returned to Merseyside, only time will tell if Silva’s employers share the same inclination."}, {"date": "09/02/2019", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 29323, "home_team": {"name":

We have a referee that’s probably 10 yards away and a linesman that’s supposed to help him out in those situations if he hasn’t seen it.\n\n“It wasn’t, for me, a difficult one to see. VAR or no VAR, it’s one that a referee should have seen. If we were to have that penalty, we score it, it’s 2-1, we’re back in the game, momentum shifts in our favour.”\n\nThe result, which extended Albion’s winless run to six league games, left them in 14th, level on 27 points with Burnley, three points above the bottom three.\n\n“We probably don’t want to speak that way [about a relegation battle],” said Hughton, “but we are a level of club that’s going to have ups and downs and everything’s not going to be smooth for us. We know how difficult this league is.”\n\nThe victory for Burnley secured a club record seventh successive Premier League game without defeat. Having slipped into the relegation zone before kick-off following Cardiff’s dramatic win at Southampton, Sean Dyche’s side have now taken 15 points from a possible 21 since a 5-1 Boxing Day thrashing at home to Everton.\n\nDyche says he could “smell” the mental strength returning to his players after a difficult start to the campaign following last season’s unexpected Europa League qualification.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“I’m pleased with seven unbeaten in the Premier League, it’s another historical marker for these players,” said Dyche. “I’m mostly pleased for the mentality of the group because we had heavy questions this year. The players take massive credit for that.”\n\nThere had been just one goal in the previous three league encounters between the clubs but this was an open affair. Solly March was arguably Albion’s best player in the first half but he was substituted early in the second period due to an apparent injury. Without him, the Seagulls struggled to create.\n\nThe Clarets wrapped up the points in the 74th minute following the controversial sequence. After Hendrick escaped penalty appeals for a possible handball, Barnes broke clear at the other end and was brought down by Mat Ryan before Wood, searching for a hat-trick, slotted his effort wide of the empty net. Attwell then brought play back to award the penalty, allowing Barnes to stroke the ball into the bottom left corner for his second successful spot-kick in two games."}, {"date": "06/02/2019", "arena":

This time the split was a relatively moderate 61-39 in City’s favour and for a long time it looked as though they might win through a set-play goal off the head of one of their defenders.\n\nCity could not relax properly until the second goal arrived via Gabriel Jesus, one of their substitutes. That was not until the seventh minute of added time, but the bottom line is they were always superior to the team in the darker shade of blue.\n\nAll of which should probably be no surprise given Everton had won three of their previous 12 league fixtures, losing seven times in the process, and came into this match on the back of a downward spiral that meant only two other clubs, Huddersfield and Fulham, had gathered fewer points since the beginning of December.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThis was Everton’s fifth home defeat of the season, as many as the last campaign in its entirety, and Marco Silva will have to expect scrutiny even if his players could not be accused of a lack of effort. It was the imbalance in talent that counted.\n\nSilva had tried to shake up his team by leaving out four established and, in some cases, highly expensive players – Richarlison, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Cenk Tosun and Seamus Coleman – and adjusting the shape of his team to a 4-3-2-1 formation.\n\nThey also had the backing of a crowd that, contrary to rumour, did not show any outward signs of rooting for City, aka Anyone But Liverpool. And unlike Arsenal and Newcastle, City’s previous two opponents, they did at least stop Sergio Agüero opening the scoring inside the first minute. Indeed, they held off their opponents for longer than many might have anticipated.\n\nNot that Everton should be too pleased with themselves when they did not manage a single attempt on target and it was difficult to remember Ederson, City’s goalkeeper, being in any real danger.\n\nSilva talked about it being an improvement on their recent performances but it will not help his cause that Aymeric Laporte’s goal came from a familiar route. No other team in the top division have let in more goals from set pieces this season.\n\nThis was the 12th time Everton have conceded from a free-kick or a corner and nobody could say they were not warned about Laporte’s threat in the air. He had already headed one chance wide from a corner and he made amends for the goal and, on both occasions, he was completely unchallenged.\n\nResolute Manchester City give rivals a demonstration of title-winning traits | Andy Hunter Read more\n\nAt this level, no side can expect to get away with defending so generously. That, however, has been one of the regular flaws of Everton: a lack of defensive organisation. David Silva swung over the free-kick from the left and Laporte had found space between Kurt Zouma and André Gomis. It was a more difficult chance than his first one, but Laporte adjusted his body position to beat Jordan Pickford with a twisting header.\n\nOn the balance of play, it was fully merited towards the end of an opening period in which Ilkay Gündogan had flicked a shot against the crossbar and Everton, to give them their due, had threatened sporadically, but rarely with conviction.\n\nAs long as there was a solitary goal between the sides, Everton still had the opportunity to find a way back. Still, though, they could not create a clear opening during the second half and the game was finally sealed when two of City’s substitutes linked up.\n\nKevin de Bruyne’s pass put Jesus through the middle and when the Brazilian’s first effort spun into the air, having been blocked by Pickford, his follow-up header looped into the net for a goal that would have sent reverberations all the way

"report": "The door is starting to creak open for Manchester City. Liverpool, with the weight of history threatening to pin them down, found their title charge losing further momentum on an evening of suffocating tension. Even the gift of an offside goal was not enough to extinguish the nerves choking the Premier League’s pacesetters, heightening the impression that Jurgen Klopp’s red machine is finally showing signs of wear and tear.\n\nThis was the second successive game Liverpool were gripped by stage fright, with their anxiety captured by the moment when Divock Origi fluffed a glorious opportunity to steal the points with the final kick of a fraught contest. Time stood still when Naby Keïta’s lofted pass fooled West Ham’s stubborn back four and the stage seemed set for Origi, on as a late substitute, to repeat the stoppage-time heroics that won the Merseyside derby two months ago.\n\nThe striker’s weak effort went straight at Lukasz Fabianski and means Liverpool’s lead over City stands at three points, presenting the champions with an opportunity to go top when they visit Everton on Wednesday night.\n\nTension at the top starts to bite Liverpool’s creaking defence | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nCity can smell blood in the water. Once again Liverpool failed to master mid-table opposition, following up last week’s home draw against Leicester with another laboured display, and they were fortunate to leave east London with a point.\n\nWest Ham, bright and inventive in possession, were entitled to feel that they deserved to win. It spoke volumes that Manuel Pellegrini expressed disappointment at the draw.\n\nWest Ham defended with impressive organisation, made the clearer chances and were aggrieved with the officials for failing to spot that James Milner was at least a yard offside during the move that culminated in Sadio Mané putting Liverpool in front midway through the first half.\n\nEvidence of City’s silky swagger returning during their win over Arsenal on Sunday had raised the stakes before Liverpool’s latest assignment and there were hints that the visitors were feeling the pressure during a difficult opening period. West Ham flew forward from the first whistle, with Felipe Anderson eager to test out Milner’s nous at right-back, and the hosts looked more than capable of coping without the injured Marko Arnautovic leading their attack.\n\nAlthough West Ham are drifting in mid-table and out of the FA Cup after a dismal defeat by AFC Wimbledon, they played with the handbrake off. Javier Hernández stung Alisson from long range and the little Mexican ought to have scored after twisting past Virgil van Dijk in the third minute, only to bend his shot inches wide.\n\nPlay Video 1:02 Liverpool 'doing well' despite draw at West Ham and injuries, says Jürgen Klopp – video\n\nAfter a while Liverpool found some poise, remembering perhaps that they had scored 16 goals in their previous four meetings with West Ham. Making his fourth league start of the season, Adam Lallana created the danger with a lovely pass into space down the right. West Ham appealed in vain for a flag as the ball reached Milner. He crossed for Mané, who spun Issa Diop and fired past Fabianski.\n\nHow the travelling fans roared, sensing lift-off. Yet there have been signs of vulnerability from Liverpool’s defence in recent weeks and West Ham reeled them in with a clever free-kick routine in the 28th minute. With their opponents waiting for a cross, Anderson and Robert Snodgrass combined to release Michail Antonio, who held off Keïta before leaving Alisson rooted to the spot with a firm shot.\n\nLiverpool suffered without the leadership of Jordan Henderson and energy of Georginio Wijnaldum in midfield, where Keïta struggled to assert himself against Declan Rice and Mark Noble, and West Ham should have led at the break. Another free-kick from Anderson deserved a sharper finish from Rice, who was aghast to put his free header over.\n\nJürgen Klopp admits Liverpool must raise their game to end long wait for title Read more\n\nThese are the occasions when elite players prove their class. The contest had become a test of Liverpool’s mettle and they needed more from Mohamed Salah in the second half, but the Egyptian found it tough to shake off Cresswell, West Ham’s diligent left-back. Instead it was Anderson who was threatening, always demanding the ball, always willing to run at defenders, luring Joël Matip into a clumsy foul with a piece of skill that left the centre-back looking dizzy.\n\nLiverpool started to rush their passes. Team-mates glared at each other after snatched decisions in the final third. With the minutes ticking away and emotions rising, hope flared when Salah wriggled through on the right and made to shape one of those trademark curling shots into the far corner, but it was too close to Fabianski. It was beginning to feel like one of those nights.\n\nQuick guide Premier League title race: the remaining fixtures Show Hide Manchester City (86 points) 24 Apr Man Utd (a)\n\n28 Apr Burnley (a)\n\n4 May Leicester (h)\n\n12 May Brighton (a) Liverpool (85 points) 21 Apr Cardiff (a)\n\n26 Apr Huddersfield (h)\n\n5 May Newcastle (a)\n\n12 May Wolves (h)\n\nKlopp argued that injuries have disrupted Liverpool’s rhythm, pointing out that Milner had missed four days of training with a virus.

For the first time since the days when Sir Alex Ferguson was in charge – back in the 2012-13 season – Manchester United have racked up five successive away victories, the latest arriving courtesy of a player who has looked reborn ever since the Norwegian took over at Old Trafford.\n\nMarcus Rashford has now scored six times in 10 games under Solskjær and this was a fitting way for the 21-year-old to mark his 100th Premier League appearance. The fact that Ryan Giggs is the only United player to have reached that landmark at a younger age – there are only 20 days in it – says much about Rashford’s impact at the club since he burst on to the scene as a teenager.\n\nWhy transfer window was subdued – despite Mike Ashley splurge | David Conn Read more\n\nPerhaps most significantly, Rashford is playing with a smile on his face again, revelling in the responsibility that Solskjær has given him to lead the line (Romelu Lukaku dropped to the bench again here) and be the focal point of a United team who remain unbeaten since José Mourinho was sacked.\n\nIt is now nine wins and one draw under Solskjær, with this narrow victory proof that United are capable of grinding out results without playing particularly well. Leicester, who have beaten Chelsea and Manchester City and drawn with Liverpool over the last six weeks, certainly had enough chances to derail United’s momentum and take points off another top-six team but they lacked the clinical edge to punish Solskjær’s side for a rather flat display.\n\nSolskjær – who dashed off to Lyon afterwards to watch Paris Saint-Germain, United’s next opponents in the Champions League, play against Lyon – was delighted with the character that his players showed. “Our attitude was spot on,” he said. “There are a couple of bruised noses and knees – it is supposed to be like this. There are three points on the line. Our lads sacrificed everything they had. They know they can do better than this but a clean sheet is always a foundation to build on.”\n\nThat clean sheet was partly down to some typically excellent goalkeeping from David de Gea but also Leicester’s profligacy. Jamie Vardy had a decent chance in the closing stages, after the impressive Harvey Barnes broke away on the left flank, and it was a source of frustration for Leicester that two other presentable opportunities fell to defenders. Jonny Evans missed his kick in front of goal with 10 minutes to go and Harry Maguire screwed a shot wide in injury time.\n\nFrom Leicester’s perspective the damage was done early on and that has become a recurrent theme for this team. For the fifth match in succession Claude Puel’s team conceded a goal inside the first 10 minutes. “We do not all take our responsibility, which is a big shame,” Puel said. “We can do things in training but the reality is we must do it on the pitch and have character to start the game.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcus Rashford beats Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images\n\nTo make matters worse, Leicester were architects of their own downfall. Ricardo Pereira, picking up the ball deep inside the Leicester half, played a loose and careless pass intended for Nampalys Mendy. Paul Pogba easily cut the ball out and flighted a perfectly weighted pass beyond Maguire and Ben Chilwell. Rashford, who had headed a fine chance over the bar five minutes earlier, was not going to be as forgiving this time.\n\nHe cushioned Pogba’s pass beautifully with his first touch and thrashed it home powerfully and unerringly with his second, giving Kasper Schmeichel no chance. “Against a Schmeichel you would think you might want to try through his legs but it was a great finish,” said Solskjær. “The kid is improving and improving. He’s played a lot of games and he got a dead leg earlier on but he struggled through it, so well done.”\n\nLeicester looked a little shell-shocked at that point but started to eke their way back into the game as United retreated deeper and lost some control in central midfield.\n\nLiverpool unlikely to freeze in their quest for Manchester City’s title | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nJames Maddison’s eyes lit up when the ball dropped kindly to him after ricocheting off a couple of United players but his shot from little more than 12 yards was brilliantly blocked by Luke Shaw’s last-ditch challenge.\n\nThe home team continued to press for an equaliser after the restart, with Vardy’s acrobatic volley gathered by De Gea at the second attempt. Puel then withdrew Maddison and replaced him with Rachid Ghezzal, prompting boos from the home supporters. “I wanted to give more possibility and freshness to try to hurt United,” explained the Leicester manager.\n\nWhile it was a curious decision, Ghezzal did come close to bringing parity with a 30-yard free-kick that De Gea spectacularly clawed away from the top corner. Another Ghezzal free-kick, this time crossed into the United area from out wide, was headed back across goal by Maguire only for Evans to thrash at thin air.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWith the game now stretched, chances came and went for both teams. Lukaku and Anthony Martial, both second-half substitutes for United, were denied by Schmeichel as the visitors hit Leicester on the counterattack in search of a second goal.

difficult to imagine quite where he finds the space to keep all the balls he has collected as souvenirs of his hat-tricks.\n\nAgüero, one imagines, can afford the kind of property where they are all on show, along with enough trophies and medals to fill an aircraft hangar. Which is probably just as well bearing in mind this was the 14th time he has scored three or more in a game for Manchester City. Ten of those hat-tricks have come in the Premier League and, if you were to believe that top-division football was invented in 1992, the relevant statistic is that only Alan Shearer, with 11, has more.\n\nWho would bet against Agüero claiming that record for himself one day? His priority, of course, is another championship medal but, on this evidence, maybe he would like to think the two even go in tandem.\n\nManchester City v Arsenal: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThese were the goals that meant him reaching the 20-goal mark this season, as he has done in seven of his eight years in Manchester, and when his latest hat-trick was confirmed – a little fortuitously bearing in mind the ball went in via his ribs and elbow – it meant he had scored 22 times during the last 15 home matches for City when he has been in Pep Guardiola’s starting lineup.\n\nMore importantly for City, he had also made the telling contribution on the day the reigning champions gave Arsenal a harsh reminder about the level of artistry that is required to harbour authentic title aspirations.\n\nFor Arsenal it has been a long time since they held that information for themselves and they have fallen to sixth position. City, in contrast, have moved within two points of Liverpool. They have scored at least twice in every home match this season and would dearly appreciate a favour from West Ham when the leaders play in London on Monday.\n\nAgüero’s performance, comprising the 217th, 218th and 219th goals of his City career, certainly warranted the crowd’s acclaim when Guardiola replaced him with Gabriel Jesus at the 80-minute mark.\n\nThe Argentinian had scored after only 24 seconds in City’s previous game at Newcastle. This time his first one was timed at 46 seconds and, unlike the trip to St James’ Park, there could be no accusation of City’s players looking bored with their own brilliance – or the word that every elite manager despises: complacency.\n\nManchester City v Arsenal: player ratings | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nThe visitors did toy with the idea of making a fist of it after Laurent Koscielny had surprised everyone, perhaps even Arsenal themselves, by scoring with an 11th-minute header. Unai Emery and his players were aggrieved that Agüero’s hat-trick goal was not ruled out for handball. Yet they will also know it could well have been a more emphatic victory for City on the balance of play. Agüero had restored City’s lead late in the first half and the home side’s domination after the break was a reminder that Liverpool will have to play exceptionally well to shake them off between now and May. In the second half City managed 13 attempts at goal, Arsenal zero.\n\nNot that this was a lopsided display from the winning team. Right from the start City seemed intent on getting the defeat at Newcastle out of their system. Guardiola’s side love to take early control, to worry their opponents from the first whistle, and it resulted here in one of their defenders, Aymeric Laporte, venturing forward to dispossess Alex Iwobi on the edge of Arsenal’s penalty area and set up the opening goal. Agüero, alert as ever, was waiting for the cross, twisting his body to direct a stooping header past Bernd Leno, the goalkeeper.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Agüero looks on as the ball trickles over the line for his third goal. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images\n\nFor a while it looked as though Arsenal would be overwhelmed by the sheer ferocity of City’s early pressure. All of which made it surprising, to say the least, when the away team emerged from the onslaught to equalise. Lucas Torreira whipped a corner over, Nacho Monreal won the first header and Koscielny had broken away from Raheem Sterling – a strange choice of marker – to score with the next one.\n\nThe corner, the flick-on and the back-post finish – and, for City, the slightly worrying statistic that exactly half of the 20 goals they have conceded in the league this season have come from set plays. It is the highest percentage in the top division and something, presumably, that not just Emery will have noted among opposition managers.\n\nFor Guardiola a little insecurity at the back is the downside, perhaps, of being so attack-minded – they set up here with Fernandinho operating as both a midfielder and auxiliary centre-half. When City were going forward, Laporte and Kyle Walker both had carte blanche to break out of defence and spread play by moving wide and morphing into attacking full-backs.\n\nNicolás Otamendi was sometimes the only player left back, with Fernandinho drifting between his two positions and often joining Ilkay Gündogan in midfield. Ahead of them, Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva had Sterling and Bernardo Silva operating either side of Agüero. It was a formidable lineup, albeit one that occasionally threatened to leave City open to the counterattack.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nFor that to happen, however, Arsenal needed to get the ball first. Agüero’s second goal came from close range after a lovely exchange of passes involving Sterling and Gündogan and the striker dived in to complete his hat-trick just after the hour.\n\nAgain it was Sterling playing the decisive pass across the six-yard area. Arsenal’s players gathered round the referee, Martin Atkinson, to protest that it was handball but Agüero was already wheeling away, with that familiar smile, the arm raised and the guarantee of another ball for his personal collection."}, {"date": "02/02/2019", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 41219, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris",

"The Premier League table screams with possibility for Tottenham. For so long, this looked like being one of those days when the ball would not go in for them. Érik Lamela hit the crossbar; Christian Eriksen, almost implausibly, saw two efforts cleared off the line and other chances went begging.\n\nYet this is a team that does not do draws, which fights until the end and, thanks to Son Heung-min’s late winner, they have clambered above Manchester City into second place and sit four points behind the leaders, Liverpool, albeit having played a game more than both.\n\nWhy transfer window was subdued – despite Mike Ashley splurge | David Conn Read more\n\nMauricio Pochettino has insisted that his squad is not equipped to win the title. With trips to Anfield and the Ehitad to come, they remain a tantalising outside bet. Son has now scored 14 goals in all competitions at club level in a season that has twice been interrupted by commitments with South Korea, firstly at the Asian Games and, more recently, the Asian Cup. His form since the November international break has been irrepressible. He has 12 goals in 17 Spurs games since then and it has reached the point where he has played himself into the conversation for the player-of-the-year awards.\n\nHis goal here was a disaster for the Newcastle goalkeeper, Martin Dubravka. The forward had shifted the ball smartly on to his right foot on the edge of the area, throwing a couple of defenders, and the shot was well struck. But it was pretty much straight at Dubravka and not swerving with any menace.\n\nDubravka, though, allowed the ball to squirm under his gloves and, in a heartbeat, Newcastle’s resistance was punctured. With the owner, Mike Ashley, in attendance, they had created some decent openings and hit the post through Salomón Rondón. The late concession was a bitter pill.\n\nSon had returned from the Asian Cup to fire the late comeback win over Watford last Wednesday – he scored the equaliser on 80 minutes – and this match was not dissimilar. Spurs were not at their best but they refused to accept that dropped points were a part of the script.\n\n“We fully deserved to win because we dominated the game,” Pochettino said. “We don’t need to be in this position to convince ourselves about our capacity. We always believe in ourselves. Then, it’s if we are capable to go close to our opponent to be champions. We will see what happens.”\n\nRafael Benítez turned on his heel and grimaced when Son’s goal went in. It had been a good week for Newcastle, what with Tuesday’s home win over Manchester City and the club-record transfer deadline-day signing of Miguel Almirón, together with the loan of Antonio Barreca. But it would not get even better. Almirón did not feature because he does not yet have his visa.\n\n“To concede the way we did was really disappointing,” Benítez said. “I don’t blame anyone [for the goal]. Everybody can make a mistake. It’s a goal we could have avoided.”\n\nBenítez made the point that Newcastle had to be better on the ball in the second half but he felt they defended well in his 5-4-1 system while they enjoyed some encouragement on the counter-attack. Matt Ritchie was a threat with his crosses from left wing-back while Ayoze Pérez showed his twinkle-toes.\n\nNewcastle went close on the half-hour when Ritchie crossed and Pérez, who was gloriously placed, could not make a clean connection. Rondón would be inches from scoring on 51 minutes when he headed against the upright from DeAndre Yedlin’s cross while Pérez extended Hugo Lloris from the edge of the area.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nTottenham had the greater number of chances and there were some gilt-edged ones, none more so than Lucas Moura’s free header early on. Lamela nodded against the woodwork from Jan Vertonghen’s cross; Moussa Sissoko was denied by Dubrakva while the substitute, Fernando Llorente, blew a looping header.\n\nEriksen twice flicked goalwards following corners only for Fabian Schär and Ritchie to clear off the line. Schär’s stretch back to hook away was particularly dramatic. Son, however, would cut through the frustration."}, {"date": "02/02/2019", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30414, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew

they were good value against fellow strugglers Burnley and less than a minute from gaining victory, only to be denied by a last-gasp mistake that presented the home side with their first penalty in more than a season.\n\nThat was only poetic justice, for Sean Dyche’s penalty paranoia raged anew in the first half when Alex McCarthy brought down Ashley Barnes as he tried to reach Phil Bardsley’s long ball. It looked like the long wait might be over and Burnley would have the chance to go in front, yet instead Anthony Taylor booked the Burnley striker for simulation, which was hard to understand as the contact was obvious and McCarthy failed to reach the ball.\n\n“It was as clear a penalty as you will ever see,” the Burnley manager said. “And he fell naturally.”\n\nMatters were made even worse when Southampton deservedly took a second-half lead and looked like holding on to it until Jack Stephens handled in stoppage time when attempting to clear from Ashley Westwood. The defender went for a header with his arm raised, the ball struck it and Barnes was as relieved as anyone to put away the penalty.\n\nWhy transfer window was subdued – despite Mike Ashley splurge | David Conn Read more\n\n“A draw was fair, we are just disappointed to concede so late,” Hasenhüttl said. “We showed we are not easy to beat. With some young players we produced some good situations.”\n\nSouthampton made most of the early chances before Burnley missed a glorious opportunity when Dwight McNeil played in Chris Wood. The striker did the hard work by coolly dragging the ball back to strand Stephens and give himself a sight of goal, only to blaze wastefully high.\n\nThen the moment of controversy arrived as Barnes was brought down and booked. That was harsh for although there was no intention to foul on the goalkeeper’s part he collided with his opponent, and to suggest Barnes imagined or invited contact was ridiculous.\n\nAt least Burnley ended the first half with a better share of the game, and might even have turned round ahead had Wood been able to reach Barnes’s volleyed cross across goal.\n\nWood did reach a cross early in the second half; unfortunately it was a Southampton corner and it took a goalline clearance from Bardsley to prevent an own goal.\n\nThe visitors had again started impressively and gained their reward when Nathan Redmond opened up Burnley through the middle, evading Jack Cork and taking advantage of James Tarkowksi’s hesitancy to beat Heaton from the edge of the area.\n\nInevitably, Dyche sent on Peter Crouch to try and rescue the game, just as he would have done with Sam Vokes before last week’s swap with Stoke. Crouch was immediately involved, using his height to help set up a close-range shooting chance for Barnes, who saw McCarthy make a smart reaction save.\n\nBarnes was even unluckier in the closing minutes when his volley on the turn struck the crossbar. It looked like it was not going to be his day, but then Stephens put his hand up to help.\n\n“I’m just glad we got the second penalty,” Dyche said. “If that had been turned down it would have been mental.”"}, {"date": "02/02/2019", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 40626, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Kepa Arrizabalaga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

have been times over the last week when Maurizio Sarri’s decision to pin his hopes on Gonzalo Higuaín had felt risky. Witness that display in midweek when the Argentinian had barely mustered a touch as Chelsea, collectively and ignominiously, subsided at Bournemouth. Or indeed the head coach’s post-match observations on the south coast that the striker was “not in good shape”. This team needed the loanee from Juventus, hardly an ideal buy at 31, to hit the ground running, adapting instantly in alien surroundings. He had to be the answer.\n\nIn that context, this was an afternoon of promise. It is dangerous to draw too many conclusions from a straightforward dismissal of Huddersfield Town, the division’s whipping boys and a side who already seem resigned to a return to the Championship, but Sarri and Chelsea, so shocked by that humiliation at the Vitality Stadium, had needed some hope on which to cling. Higuaín, as much with his movement and linkup play with Eden Hazard as the sumptuous finish he summoned midway through the second half, duly provided plenty.\n\nMichy Batshuayi makes instant impact as Palace pour misery on Fulham Read more\n\nThe pedigree clearly remains. His experiences at Milan over the first half of the season have not drummed the quality out of him. The shot arced, right-footed and first-time, over Jonas Lössl from distance demonstrated as much, the kind of instinctive brilliance Chelsea have missed of late. Their No 9s have had a habit of underwhelming in the many years since Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink wore the shirt but Higuaín, a Sarri loyalist, has now swollen his goal tally to 38 in 37 league games under the Italian, in Serie A and Premier League.\n\nJust as encouraging had been the clever dart into space behind Terence Kongolo and away from Christopher Schindler to reach N’Golo Kanté’s cute pass, clipped between defenders just after the quarter-hour mark. It was the culmination of a period of patient buildup play down the right, a rat-a-tat of passes that dragged Huddersfield out of position. But without Higuaín making that run, then ripping his finish high inside Lössl’s near-post, it would have felt like another passage of possession for possession’s sake, lacking the punch to make a proper mark. It was the bite Chelsea have been missing. Here, albeit against generous opponents, they boasted incision with Higuaín as the focal point.\n\nThe striker’s combinations with Hazard, in particular, will have left Sarri drooling. When Chelsea were fizzing their passes at their most progressive, in the opening quarter, the pair already appeared to have synchronised their runs and flicks.\n\n“I’m really very happy because, apart from the goals, my feeling is Gonzalo’s really suitable to play very close to Eden,” said Sarri. “On the pitch they are really very suitable to play one close to the other. For us, this is very useful for Higuaín because he will be able to score a lot of goals, but also for Eden.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eden Hazard celebrates scoring. Photograph: Chloe Knott - Danehouse/Getty Images\n\nIt was no surprise to see Hazard back at his dazzling best. He had already scored a penalty in first-half stoppage time when, midway through the second half, he skipped on to Ross Barkley’s fine pass to round Lössl and score a 15th goal of the campaign into a gaping net. He has not scored that many at this stage of a season since moving to Chelsea in 2012.\n\n“Higuaín is a new player, but he knows what the manager wants,” said Hazard. “He is a great striker who can score a lot of goals. England is different to Italy and Spain, but he has that ability.”\n\nSon Heung-min strikes late against Newcastle to send Spurs second Read more\n\nChelsea face Manchester City twice, Manchester United and Tottenham before the end of this month. They may now have a combination to wound lofty opponents.\n\nHuddersfield had no answer, their own bright start amounting to Aaron Mooy’s header over the bar from Chris Löwe’s cross and fizzling out thereafter. They had cause to complain at the award of the penalty in first-half stoppage time, Elias Kachunga’s challenge on César Azpilicueta having started outside the box.\n\n“Without that penalty, it’s different,” said Kachunga. “I touched the ball first, and maybe his leg as well a little bit, but when you give a foul before he was in the box, it’s no penalty. My teammate asked the linesman and he told him: ‘No penalty.’ So I don’t know why they don’t speak on the pitch.”\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nYet, Adama Diakhaby’s scurries up the right flank aside, the visitors provided little clout and were undone far too easily by Chelsea’s cut and thrust. A 12th defeat in 13 games in all competitions had felt inevitable from the opening exchanges. “Chelsea were quite angry after the Bournemouth game and showed it, so it was a bad time to play them,” offered Jan Siewert. His immediate task feels far more daunting than Sarri’s very specific stated objective: to extend the bright play demonstrated by his team in the opening half hour to nearer “75 to 77 minutes”.\n\nDavid Luiz, stooping to reach Willian’s corner near the end, would register the fifth via a healthy deflection off Kachunga. That ensured the horror of midweek had been resolved, and fourth place reclaimed for 24 hours at least.

With the weeks flying by and defeats piling up, their hopes of conjuring a miraculous escape are fading and for all that Claudio Ranieri tried to keep the mood light after witnessing another lamentable effort on the road from his naive side, the Italian must have seen signs of a group who have already started to accept their fate.\n\nMore than anything, it was the lack of fight that was most troubling once a dismal error from Cyrus Christie had sent Crystal Palace on their way to a crucial win in the battle to stay in the Premier League. Buoyed by a lively cameo from Michy Batshuayi, Palace fully merited a victory that eased relegation pressure and left Ranieri’s side looking forlorn in 19th place, seven points behind fourth-bottom Burnley and with the walls closing in as 13 games remain.\n\nAny positivity Fulham generated after that thrilling comeback against Brighton & Hove Albion on Tuesday is gone. They lacked the nous to deal with the tension and a first away win of the season was never going to happen, even though Ranieri rued the moment when Aleksandar Mitrovic wasted a glorious opportunity to give Fulham an early lead. “If we score a goal, I think it could change the match,” Fulham’s manager said. “When you take a chance, maybe everybody is more combined and strong.”\n\nIt was a surprise to see a striker of Mitrovic’s aerial prowess fluff his lines when Joe Bryan’s cross found him unmarked in the six-yard box. Normally so deadly in the air, Fulham’s top scorer wore the look of a man who knew he could not rely on his teammates in defence to lessen the effect of his profligacy. The striker has seen enough to know that mistakes are never far away and it was not long before the division’s worst backline presented their hosts with a gift.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luka Milivojevic celebrates scoring a penalty.

Yet the presence of Christian Benteke unsettled Christie, who threw out an arm in a doomed attempt to clear.\n\nMichael Oliver, the referee, was almost apologetic as he penalised the wing-back, giving Luka Milivojevic the chance to beat Sergio Rico from the spot.\n\nWhy transfer window was subdued – despite Mike Ashley splurge | David Conn Read more\n\nRanieri condemned “a stupid foul” and even Roy Hodgson, Palace’s manager, struggled to make sense of Christie’s thinking. “We got a piece of good fortune,” Hodgson said. “I didn’t expect Christie to handle it and give us that penalty. Only he would be able to tell us how it came about.”\n\nIt was one-way traffic after Milivojevic had struck a powerful penalty past Rico, who was by far the busier of the two goalkeepers. Belief soared through Palace after a nervy start and Benteke, who looked determined to make up for lost time after being handed his first start since 1 September, was unfortunate to see an overhead kick crash against the bar.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nPerhaps the arrival of another Belgian forward on deadline day has stirred Benteke after a difficult campaign. Palace have more competition in attack after signing Batshuayi and Hodgson was grateful to have the Chelsea loanee in reserve once Benteke had tired, especially as Wilfried Zaha was suspended.\n\nOn came Batshuayi, turning on the edge of the area and firing a shot that Rico palmed to Jeffrey Schlupp to gobble up from the rebound. “It was an incredible impact,” Hodgson said. “He has scored in almost every debut he’s had and he almost kept that record going.”\n\nRanieri, whose side failed to muster a single shot on target, tried to finish on a defiant note. “We have to continue to fight,” he said. “We lost a battle but not the war. I am always positive. I want the maximum in every training session. I want the maximum in every match.”"}, {"date": "02/02/2019", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39380, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [16], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [37]}, {"name": "André Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cenk Tosun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [37], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Conor Coady", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Boly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Doherty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leander Dendoncker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rúben Neves", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [7], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [49]}, {"name": "João Moutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Otto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raúl Jiménez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Diogo Jota", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ivan Cavaleiro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hélder Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Gibbs-White", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romain Saiss", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [49], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron John", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Wolves had just confirmed their first win at Goodison Park in 40 years when a black cat strolled on to the pitch. A bad omen in Portugal and entirely appropriate for Marco Silva. His Everton team are listing dangerously and their shortcomings were ruthlessly exploited by Nuno Espírito Santo’s visitors. No worrying signs or problems crossed their path.\n\nEverton, bereft of leadership, concentration and a coherent gameplan yet again, were comfortably beaten for the sixth time in nine Premier League games as the malaise that has flatlined their season deepened. The spotlight will inevitably fall on a manager who appears powerless to react to the slump or galvanise his team but players who are going through the motions at Goodison shoulder responsibility too. They have become the epitome of a nothing team.\n\nMichy Batshuayi makes instant impact as Palace pour misery on Fulham Read more\n\nNuno, by contrast, sparks the opposite reaction from his players and they coasted to a third consecutive league win courtesy of a Rúben Neves penalty, a Raúl Jiménez header and Leander Dendoncker’s volley. Wolves were disciplined in defence, sharp in midfield and moved dangerously in attack. They were everything Everton are not.\n\n“We gave them things that are not normal at this level of football,” said Silva, who sounds stuck on repeat when lamenting poor defending at set pieces and unforced errors. “I’m the first one, if our opponents do something really special and are really better than us, to be fair and give congratulations. But when I see how we lost the game, giving them everything so easily from the first minutes that they could score from anywhere, it is really tough for me. It was really tough for us as a team. I’m seeing things that I really do not like. It is happening often, more than normal, and we keep doing the same things.”\n\nA dark day for Silva opened ominously with a penalty conceded clumsily and Wolves operating with a pace and purpose that Everton lacked. Leighton Baines was available despite suffering a rib injury at Huddersfield in midweek and was not rewarded for playing through the pain barrier. Within a minute he had received a painful blow from João Moutinho and moments later he sent Matt Doherty sprawling in the penalty area after being muscled aside by the wing-back. A clear penalty, and Neves side-footed it into the bottom left corner as Jordan Pickford dived to his right.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A black cat runs on to the pitch. Photograph: Tony McArdle - Everton FC/Everton FC via Getty Images\n\nWolves could easily have doubled their advantage through Diogo Jota and Dendoncker only for Pickford to intervene on both occasions. Theo Walcott was completely anonymous on his return to the starting lineup but did force a save from Rui Patrício before, with Wolves evidently superior, Everton surprisingly levelled in style. André Gomes started and finished the move that involved Tom Davies, Séamus Coleman and Cenk Tosun before Gomes drove his first Everton goal into the top corner from 18 yards.\n\nSon Heung-min strikes late against Newcastle to send Spurs second Read more\n\nEverton were suddenly roused, only to re-gift Wolves the lead moments before the break with yet another example of weak, disorganised and ill-disciplined defending. The lightweight Michael Keane created the problem with a needless foul on Jota off the ball. From the resulting free-kick, swept towards the penalty spot by Moutinho, Coleman and his teammates stood and admired Jimenéz as he followed the flight of the ball alone and planted a textbook header into the bottom corner. It was the fourth goal Everton had conceded from a free-kick in a week.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAdemola Lookman replaced Walcott as the Everton manager sought inspiration only for the young winger to demonstrate why he does not command a regular place in the side. Within minutes of his arrival Lookman lost possession in midfield and failed to track back as Jota broke clear. Coleman and Kurt Zouma combined to block the striker’s shot but the rebound fell perfectly for Dendoncker to volley his first Wolves’ goal high into Pickford’s net. Enter the cat.\n\n“It is a growing process for us,” reflected Nuno. “70% of this team today were with us in the Championship and we don’t forget where we come from.

Bobby Reid, surrounded by his teammates, held aloft a T-shirt displaying Sala’s face as the football fraternity united to pay their respects to the striker, who disappeared in a light aircraft alongside pilot David Ibbotson over the Channel Islands almost a fortnight ago.\n\nThe locals describe Sala, whose name reverberated around the stadium from start to finish, as the best striker the club never had. This win over Bournemouth – Cardiff’s first this year courtesy of two goals by Reid on his 26th birthday – was unquestionably for Sala and Ibbotson.\n\n“I was all right until the final whistle went and I went on the pitch,” Warnock said. “Emiliano would have been with us today and I said to the lads: ‘You have to perform.’ I thought today the whole club was amazing – I was the proudest man to be manager of the whole club. The noise volume, I’ve never heard anything like it. Ever. I’ll remember it for the rest of my life. I felt immensely proud of everybody. It was as if we had to show our support for him and coming back to the main stand to see my wife and my kids up there it just hit home that we done him proud. It was almost like we couldn’t be beaten today – the crowd wouldn’t let us be beaten. I’m really proud and I’m sure he [Sala] would have been.”\n\nEmiliano Sala: privately funded search for plane to begin on Sunday Read more\n\nAfter more than £324,000 was raised online, a privately funded search for the Piper PA-46 Malibu plane will begin on Sunday. The plane vanished en route to the Welsh capital on 21 January, hours after Sala had said farewell to his Nantes teammates having signed for Cardiff for a club-record £15m. He was due to train with his new team the next day.\n\nThe game itself was always going to be superseded by a series of stirring tributes paid to the pair in a truly moving atmosphere, with Cardiff fans serenading Sala in the 28th minute, a nod to his age, while an enormous blue banner was strewn along the foot of the Canton Stand before a ball had even been kicked. It simply read: “We never saw you play and never saw you score, but Emiliano our beautiful Bluebird we will love you forever more.”\n\nThere was a moving moment of reflection on the referee Jonathan Moss’s whistle – an impeccably observed minute’s silence – as the Cardiff fans held aloft yellow and blue placards to create a mosaic that spelled out the Argentinian striker’s name.\n\nOn entry to the ground, every fan was handed a yellow daffodil – the national flower of Wales and also of significance to the Ligue 1 club, whose nickname is the Canaries.\n\nThe atmosphere hours before kick-off was understandably sombre, as fans added to the rows of daffodils laid around the Fred Keenor statue, while others placed scarves, handwritten letters and flags in tribute to Sala. One note, in blue ink, read: “RIP Sala, our beautiful bluebird.” Another, with the words printed and taped on to a Cardiff home shirt, said: “The most painful goodbyes are never said and not explained.”\n\nIn the programme dedicated to Sala, a joint-statement by the Cardiff board expressed how they had been moved by the “goodwill of the football world”. The nature of the growing number of tributes reflected that, with Argentina, Barnsley, China, Liverpool and Wolves shirts among the dozens amassed over the past 12 days outside the stadium.\n\nWarnock turned away as Reid dispatched a fifth-minute penalty down the middle of Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc’s goal after Steve Cook’s silly handball, and was celebrating again just 15 seconds into the second half.

The days when Luiz Felipe Scolari was shown the door in February of his first season, André Villas-Boas was cut adrift in March or Roberto di Matteo, fresh from a European Cup triumph, dumped unceremoniously in late November are apparently long gone. Yet this is the kind of wretched occasion prone to leave a livid hierarchy flicking through a list of potential interims as they contemplate a return to chopping and changing. Head coaches, after all, have been condemned by defeats far less emphatic.\n\nMaurizio Sarri had spent most of the second half here scribbling frantically in a notepad while his team were shredded, brutally and brilliantly, out on the pitch by Bournemouth. The hosts had only recently emerged from a run of 11 defeats in 14 games in all competitions but poured through Chelsea’s panicked and pathetic ranks, their counterattacks carrying all the bite and incision their opponents have lacked since the late autumn, sensing little to no resistance en route. The notes could express nothing else but horror.\n\nMaurizio Sarri admits: ‘Maybe it’s my fault – maybe I can’t motivate Chelsea’ Read more\n\nNot since 1996 have the London club endured a league thrashing of this magnitude. In other words, Roman Abramovich has never had to digest a loss so unpalatable. All of which makes this situation feel far more volatile than it might otherwise have been. This is actually uncharted territory, for all Sarri’s post-match insistence that he felt more “frustrated” than under pressure. The Italian had cast his coaching staff from the away dressing room and, while they shivered outside, spent an hour with his players attempting to piece together what had gone so hideously wrong.\n\nThis, after all, was arguably a defeat far more insipid than that at Arsenal earlier in the month which had prompted Sarri, in his native tongue, to lacerate his players in public. He has already used the stick, and there is no appetite for carrot. “Maybe we are not at the top of the Premier League at the moment, but we are competitive and we cannot lose 4-0 against Bournemouth,” he mumbled once he had emerged. “I want to respect Bournemouth, and you know I like very much the coach Eddie [Howe], but it’s impossible to lose 4-0 here.”\n\nOnly César Azpilicueta and David Luiz dared to approach a disgruntled away support to offer their apologies after the final whistle though, by then, plenty had ventured out into the night and away. Those who watch this team consistently are finding everything, from tactics to substitutions to meek and feeble displays, grimly predictable at present. They had whipped up a chorus of “You don’t know what you’re doing” to greet Gonzalo Higuaín’s withdrawal when their team’s deficit was two. Sarri needs Higuaín, a player he convinced the board to buy, to make an immediate impact. The Argentinian’s Premier League debut amounted to being flagged twice for offside, and not a single shot fired off or chance created.\n\nNot that this defeat was down to the 31-year-old loanee from Juventus. Higuaín was just the latest Chelsea forward struggling to provide some bite for a team who ping passes with little intent, whose movement off the ball can become aimless, before desperation sets in. They had needed to shift the ball far more quickly during a first half when they were actually on top, but they never went closer than Mateo Kovacic’s early header that was tipped on to the crossbar by Artur Boruc. Bournemouth’s threat, as sporadic as it was at first, always carried more menace, not least because this Chelsea team are only ever one concession from a collapse. Retreat almost exactly a year and the Cherries had won 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. This time, they would run riot on home territory.\n\nLiverpool miss chance to pull clear as Harry Maguire grabs point for Leicester Read more\n\nThe home side’s ruthlessness was utterly admirable, the slick nature of their passing and movement putting the Carabao Cup finalists to shame. There was Ryan Fraser’s clever flick for David Brooks, and the Welshman’s precisely weighted pull-back into space for Josh King to dispatch and force Bournemouth ahead. Then the combination play between King and Brooks around the hour mark, with Brooks cutting inside a befuddled David Luiz to slide in a second beyond the exposed Kepa Arrizabalaga.\n\nKing, with a splendid finish from Junior Stanislas’ pass, and the substitute Charlie Daniels would complete the rout.

six-pointer, Southampton and Crystal Palace were forced to settle for one apiece on a night that ended amid acrimony and no little anger as Wilfried Zaha was sent off after being shown two yellow cards in quick succession.\n\nZaha, who had earlier scored his first goal in more than four months to put Palace ahead, gave Andre Marriner little option but to dismiss him when he sarcastically applauded the referee’s decision to book him, after he had squared up to James Ward-Prowse.\n\nLiverpool miss chance to pull clear as Harry Maguire grabs point for Leicester Read more\n\nSure enough a second yellow card followed and even then Zaha, who allowed his frustration to get the better of him, carried on clapping Marriner as well as the Southampton supporters. That reaction to the red card – Zaha took some time to leave the pitch and had to be encouraged to do so by teammates – means he now runs the risk of his mandatory one-match ban being extended.\n\nThe flashpoint happened in the 87th minute and was prompted by a Ward-Prowse tackle close to the touchline. Zaha, who had already been fouled on plenty of occasions, clearly felt that he should have been awarded a free-kick. Marriner decided otherwise and Zaha ended up squaring up to Ward-Prowse moments later. That confrontation earned Zaha his first booking and within the blink of an eye Marriner was brandishing a red card.\n\nAlthough Roy Hodgson felt that Zaha was the victim of persistent fouling, the Palace manager accepted that the forward’s response to Marriner was only going to lead to one outcome.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Ward-Prowse celebrates his equaliser. Photograph: Matt Watson/Southampton FC via Getty Images\n\n“It’s disappointing that the player who perhaps provided some of the best entertainment during the 90 minutes with his performance, and who was consistently fouled throughout the game, wasn’t able to contain his frustration with that consistent fouling and protests over a foul which is not given – and maybe should have been. But then once he applauds the referee’s decision to give him a yellow card, under the rules of the game the referee has got no option but to send him off.”\n\nHodgson, who said that he did not believe Zaha was deliberately targeted by Southampton, added: “Of course it’s not a good evening for me here knowing that he’s going to be suspended for the next game. We need him playing. He will be very contrite, I’m sure, especially about the reaction to the yellow card.\n\n“But as someone who has been in football a long time, it’s sometimes disappointing that the people who are the ones we most want to see are the ones who are often being taken out of games, either by fouls, or on this occasion because unfortunately they haven’t shown the saint-like behaviour which is required in this situation not to react to fouls.”\n\nLlorente’s late winner against Watford breathes life into challenge of Spurs Read more\n\nIt was a strange end to what had been a fairly uneventful evening up until then. Ralph Hasenhüttl has re-energised Southampton since taking over as manager but his team looked flat and devoid of ideas here. Although Hasenhüttl felt the absence of a game for 10 days contributed to their lack of “rhythm” in the first half, the truth is that it was not much better after the interval and hard to see where an equaliser was going to come from. Ward-Prowse eventually provided it when he dispatched Matt Targett’s cross with a first-time shot from close-range after a flowing move down the left flank.\n\nRather ironically Zaha’s goal, which was drilled home at the near post, owed much to Marriner’s excellent decision to play advantage after Andros Townsend was fouled by Oriol Romeu on the edge of the area. Although both teams had chances to win the game late on, it was Zaha’s red card, rather than spurned opportunities, that provided the only talking point."}, {"date": "30/01/2019", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53092, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson Ramses Becker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [16], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Naby Keita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Fabinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rafael Camacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Pereira", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Nampalys Mendy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Maddison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harvey Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hamza Choudhury", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When the story comes to be told of the complete 2018-19 season, how vital will this game turn out to be? Liverpool have moved five points clear of Manchester City and, for that reason alone, it has been a profitable 48 hours for Jürgen Klopp’s team. Yet there was no getting away from the fact this was a missed opportunity for the Premier League leaders, with the first tell-tale signs of nerves sweeping Anfield and, most alarmingly for Klopp, perhaps getting into the minds of one or two players.\n\nThis is certainly no time to get stage fright, with 14 games still to go, and it was particularly surprising given Sadio Mané, Liverpool’s most dangerous player, had given them the lead after only three minutes. Leicester were tough, obdurate opponents who refused to be cowed and demonstrated a spirit of togetherness that made it perplexing Claude Puel finds his position questioned so frequently, with four defeats from their previous five games.\n\nLiverpool’s Jürgen Klopp frustrated by refereeing decisions in Leicester draw Read more\n\nLiverpool, in turn, seemed to be feeling the pressure in a way that could not be said of them at any other time this season. It was rare, for example, to see Mohamed Salah so ineffective. It was not that Salah played badly, just that he did not get close to his most exhilarating levels. The same applied to the team as a whole and the crowd could not rouse themselves in the way that might have been expected. Overall, it was a strangely subdued night and, though it is important to remember Liverpool extended their advantage at the top, they did not look like a team who want to be regarded as champions-in-waiting. Nor did Manchester City at Newcastle the previous night, which makes it even more intriguing.\n\nLiverpool certainly set off as though they had been given a lift by the result at St James’ Park and there were people still taking their seats when Mané exchanged passes with Andy Robertson to conjure up the opening goal with a clever first touch and precise right-footed finish. Not one player in blue had managed a clean touch of the ball before it ended up in Kasper Schmeichel’s net and, in those early exchanges, Liverpool looked like a team in a hurry, keen to get the job done quickly.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Naby Keïta goes down after a challenge from Ricardo Pereira in the Leicester penalty area. Photograph: Craig Galloway/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nInstead, Leicester began to grow in confidence – encouraged, perhaps, by the clear suspicion Alisson might be in an unexpectedly obliging mood. The Liverpool goalkeeper’s casualness on the ball endangered his team on two occasions when the score was 1-0 and Klopp, never a manager to hide his emotions, was clearly startled by the manner in which his players were making life unnecessarily hard for themselves.\n\nThe equaliser was the case in point, with Robertson giving away a needless free-kick to leave his team vulnerable. Klopp’s displeasure was clear on the touchline and, though James Maddison’s delivery was turned away, Leicester had plenty of players forward. Virgil van Dijk, who was marking Harry Maguire, had switched off and lost his man. Ben Chilwell, one of Leicester’s outstanding performers, returned the ball into the area and Maguire had the space and time to stroke his shot beyond Alisson.\n\nJordan Henderson’s right-back role made tougher by Puel’s tactical tweak Read more\n\nLiverpool’s crowd had been calling for a red card earlier in the first half when Mané shaped to run behind the Leicester defence only to be brought down by Maguire. The centre-half escaped with a booking, presumably because Robertson’s through ball was at a slight angle away from goal.\n\nLiverpool also felt aggrieved in the second half after a penalty appeal for Ricardo Pereira’s challenge on Naby Keïta. Pereira had trodden on Keïta’s left boot, just as he was taking aim with his other foot, but it happened so quickly, with so many players in close proximity, the referee, Martin Atkinson, gave Leicester the benefit of the doubt.\n\nOverall, though, the away team fully merited the draw and might even have snatched a win with some of the chances involving Maddison, Demarai Gray and, again, Maguire. The emphasis in the second half was on Liverpool to soothe the crowd’s anxieties. They could not manage it and Puel’s team have already shown this season they can raise their performance against the top sides, beating Chelsea and Manchester City since late-December.\n\nAt half-time a team of groundsmen were sent on to remove flecks of snow from the penalty area that Liverpool would be attacking. The other side was left as it was , which was a bit sneaky, but understandable, perhaps, when there was so much at stake.\n\nThe Fiver: Sign up for our daily football email.\n\nNot that it made too much difference and, if anything, it was Leicester with the best opportunity of the second half when they broke on the counterattack and Gray decided to shoot instead of rolling the ball into Maddison’s path to leave his teammate a relatively simple finish. Maddison could also reflect on a golden chance inside the first half when he got his header horribly wrong inside the six-yard area.\n\nLiverpool had plenty of the ball but maybe the importance of the occasion restricted their performance – 29 years since their last league title.

Time was running out, and the home side appeared to be heading for another defeat on the backs of those which had seen them depart two cup competitions in quick succession, when the goals they required for a turnaround arrived. The first was scored by Son Heung-min on his first appearance for Spurs since arriving back from the Asian Cup and then came the winner from someone who has been at the club all the while and finally may feel he belongs.\n\nThe mix of relief and joy on Fernando Llorente’s face as he celebrated his goal with three minutes of this contest remaining was as eye-catching as it was understandable. The Spaniard has found it hard going ever since he joined Tottenham from Swansea two summers ago and especially in recent weeks as he has been asked to fill in for the injured Harry Kane. Quite simply, he is not in the England captain’s class, and that has been noticeable, painfully so at times, as was the case here on 52 minutes when he missed an absolute sitter. Cue howls of fury from the majority of the 29,164 people in attendance – Tottenham’s lowest ever crowd for a Premier League fixture at Wembley – yet they were in raptures when the player finally came good.\n\nLiverpool miss chance to pull clear as Harry Maguire grabs point for Leicester Read more\n\nDanny Rose swung a cross from the left deep into Watford’s area and the ball hung in the air long enough for Llorente to rise above José Holebas and send a perfectly placed header into the far corner of the net for his first league goal in over 12 months. Perfect timing and, you could say in light of recent comments by Mauricio Pochettino, a perfect boost for Llorente’s ego.\n\n“Fernando works so hard for the team and today he helped the team win three points,” said the Tottenham manager. “It is a massive thing and will help build his confidence.”\n\nThat will be the hope for all concerned at Spurs before Newcastle’s visit here on Saturday, when another victory for Pochettino’s men would see them overtake Manchester City in second and find themselves just four points behind Liverpool. Not bad for a side whose sense of purpose had yet again come into question following Sunday’s FA Cup defeat at Crystal Palace.\n\n“There are still a lot of games to play,” said Pochettino when asked about the significance of this result. “But this is a fantastic way to finish a little bit of the negativity that has been around in the last few days.”\n\nThe biggest encouragement Pochettino can take from this contest is the spirit his players showed. Tottenham were not at their best, during the first-half especially, when their forward play was stodgy and predictable. But the second period proved very different as they performed with greater determination and aggression.\n\nMuch of that came from Son, who put in a remarkable display given he only returned from the United Arab Emirates on Saturday. The South Korean performed with his usual energy and direct running and drove Spurs on as they searched for an equaliser following Craig Cathcart’s goal for Watford on 38 minutes, the defender sending a header into an empty net, via a deflection off Davinson Sánchez, after Hugo Lloris hesitated in his attempt to keep out Holebas’s corner.\n\nIt was fitting Son should be the one who got Tottenham back into this game, thumping a close-range drive past Ben Foster on 80 minutes, as those in white and blue well and truly cranked up the pressure. “It was a great goal,” said Pochettino. “He [Son] showed massive commitment for the team.”\n\nThat was the case from others in the home ranks, Llorente included, and, as such, it would have been a shame if his most memorable contribution of the game had been the moment he caught the rebound to his own shot with a knee and sent the ball over a practically open net.\n\nIt was a howler yet it was Watford who were ultimately left feeling sick. As Javi Gracia said, his side “missed a very good chance to get points against a very good team” and while the visitors were second best in terms of possession and territory, they arguably deserved a draw given the togetherness they showed throughout.

Neil Warnock had admitted that “in an ideal world” his club would not have played. There have been a lot of painful questions since the disappearance last Monday of Emiliano Sala – Cardiff’s record signing from Nantes – and one of them has taken in the point of it all.\n\nHow can a bunch of blokes kick a ball around with any meaning when one of their own is missing presumed dead? On the other hand, Warnock knew a game was perhaps what Cardiff needed – to get them firing again; to work up some adrenaline against all of the misery.\n\nPaul Pogba and Victor Lindelöf rescue Manchester United against Burnley Read more\n\nWarnock saw his team play well, carrying the fight to Arsenal, especially during a first half that they controlled. He described it as Cardiff’s best away performance of the season and he could be pleased, even surprised, to see his players rack up 19 shots, albeit only two were on target.\n\nThere was frustration when Bruno Ecuele Manga stretched into an ill-advised challenge to concede a 66th-minute penalty, which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang converted to turn the game. Warnock called it “diabolical”.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette scored Arsenal’s second as Unai Emery’s team closed up on fourth-placed Chelsea, and the substitute Nathaniel Mendez-Laing’s stoppage-time drag back and finish was nothing more than a consolation. Yet the truth was that the football was a sideshow. Sala was in the hearts and minds of everyone and Warnock spoke with feeling afterwards.\n\nOn the upside, Warnock admitted it had done him and his players the power of good to get back out there. “The first five minutes, to shout at the fourth official was fantastic,” he said, with a smile.\n\nYet once again Warnock did not disguise the depth of the trauma. “I can’t explain how it’s been this week but you’ve not wanted to get out of bed,” he said. “Everything was really miserable and nobody could actually do anything about it. I know we’ve lost a game of football but there are other more important things.\n\n“What’s gone on has been unprecedented. We spoke about it before kick-off – that we ought to, for Emiliano, try to put in a performance. I know people would expect us to lay down but I thought they showed what they were made of tonight.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Cardiff players gather for a period of silence in tribute to missing striker Emiliano Sala as the Cardiff fans hold up their yellow placards and the wreaths lie in the centre circle. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nThe travelling supporters held up yellow placards when the teams emerged for the kick-off, while the captains, Mesut Özil and Sol Bamba, strode to the centre circle to lay wreaths. There was one bouquet of yellow tulips – the symbol of Nantes – and another of yellow daffodils to represent Wales. It was also a nice touch from the programme editors to include Sala’s name at the bottom of the squad lists on the back cover – hauntingly, without a shirt number.\n\nThere were banners in the away end. “Once a bluebird, always a bluebird,” read one. Another said: “We never saw you play, we never saw you score but Emiliano, our beautiful bluebird, we will love you forever.” What was meant to be a minute of pre-match silence turned into a period of applause.\n\nLife goes on; football goes on. But how to focus? Cardiff showed their professionalism and they ought to have led at the interval. Bobby Reid blew two clear chances while Oumar Niasse was denied a penalty when Nacho Monreal nibbled at him inside the area.\n\nEcuele Manga made two rash penalty-box challenges on Lacazette in the first half and the Arsenal fans howled when Mike Dean refused to penalise him. Lacazette did not make a meal out of the first and, perhaps, he made too much of the second.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cardiff fans pay tribute to missing striker Emiliano Sala. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nDean had no option but to point to the spot when Ecuele Manga erred again, lungingin on Sead Kolasinac, who had been released by the half-time substitute, Alex Iwobi. Aubameyang’s goal was his 18th of the season in all competitions.\n\nArsenal had offered little in the first half, bar an early Lacazette shot which was blocked by Ecuele Manga and a Shkodran Mustafi header that flashed wide. But they were better after the break, when Iwobi and a switch to 4-2-3-1 brought more urgency.\n\nIwobi was denied by Neil Etheridge before Lacazette scored when he outstripped Bamba and shot into the bottom corner. It might have been different had Mustafi not made a saving challenge on Niasse in the 65th minute.

At half-time, trailing 2-0 as sleet turned to snow Claudio Ranieri looked on grimly from beneath the hood of his coat. After that Fulham became the embodiment of the adage that attack is the best form of defence – just as well, really, to breathe new hope into the challenge of Premier League survival. “These three points mean we are alive,” Ranieri said. “We could see a little light in front of us.”\n\nThis was the latest in a series of must-win games for Ranieri’s team and until now fans had been watching through their fingers with a gnawing sense of dread in their gut. All that gloom was transformed into euphoria as Fulham’s avalanche of second-half goals had a reviving effect.\n\nRicharlison’s early strike gives 10-man Everton win at Huddersfield Read more\n\nIn a blazing second period Aleksandar Mitrovic was in one of his unplayable moods, winning aerial balls like a kid reaching into the sky to catch bubbles. Luciano Vietto came on, made a nuisance of himself and scored his first goal for the club. Tom Cairney orchestrated with a classy touch. Ryan Babel earned particular praise from his manager for the way he used his experience to show his teammates how to find their forward momentum.\n\nIt was, as Ranieri explained, “a very strange game” in that dominance swung in such an extreme way. Brighton were so comfortably in front early on there seemed no obvious way back for the hosts. Fulham’s plight has not been helped by the worrying number of goals conceded this season – they went into this game with the worst defensive record of any team in Europe’s five major leagues – and they haemorrhaged two more in the opening 17 minutes. Both were snaffled by the evergreen Glenn Murray, who even had the chance to grab a first half hat-trick, such was Brighton’s supremacy.\n\nThe gravity of the situation called for a tactical substitution midway through the first half, Cairney introduced as part of a reshuffle. For a team incapable of defending, there was no option than to engage in a shooting match. “Believe me, in that moment I said it’s much better at the beginning than at the end like [Sunday’s last-minute defeat] against Tottenham when you don’t have time to react. We reacted immediately.”\n\nThey seized a lifeline early in the second half when Calum Chambers connected with Mitrovic’s knock-down and smacked the ball low past Ryan. The Craven Cottage crowd dug deep into their well of optimism and allowed themselves to believe in something. Anything.\n\nThe chances came in a flurry and when a long ball fell in the vicinity of Mitrovic, the hulking striker beat two markers and Ryan to make sure he won the ball and nodded into the net. This critical game hung in the balance and though Fulham rode their luck when Rico saved a header from the unmarked Murray, the keeper’s teammates took it as the signal to come on strong again. Joe Bryan did the sensible thing by standing his cross up for Mitrovic, who again won the aerial battle to seal a remarkable turnaround.\n\nNewcastle’s Matt Ritchie on the spot to dent Manchester City’s title hopes Read more\n\nThey are used to seeing defenders at odds with one another here but this time it was Brighton’s pair of Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk arguing as their team fell apart, put under pressure by Fulham’s commitment to attack.\n\n“It was not like us,” said Chris Hughton, who was surprised and not a little angered by an uncharacteristic implosion. “As good as we were in the first half we were as poor in second. We found it hard to cope and needed to work harder. Of course I was angry to be leading 2-0 and concede four goals in one half.”\n\nThe roar when Vietto gave Fulham breathing space after Cairney struck the bar was visceral, immense.

To be kind to Everton they managed to see out the game after Lucas Digne’s dismissal but this win was far from the confidence booster it could have been.

Jonas Lössl managed to keep it out with his knees, though it was a simple enough task for Richarlison to reach the loose ball first and find a now unguarded net.

Huddersfield have just five home goals to their credit from 13 league fixtures, a record low. While the reliable Jason Puncheon looks a decent acquisition his inclusion left Aaron Mooy and Alex Pritchard on the bench, leaving Huddersfield somewhat short of attacking inspiration.\n\nPuncheon produced the neatest of back heels to set Kachunga free along the goalline as the home side searched for an equaliser but, unlike the Everton move earlier, it did not produce a goal.

Arnautovic, or West Ham, had hoped for.\n\nThe striker, anonymous from start to finish for a team who failed to register a shot on target, was helped down the tunnel by coaching staff with 15 minutes left to play with what his manager, Manuel Pellegrini, described as “not an easy injury”. Arnautovic will undergo a scan on Wednesday to determine the extent of the problem.\n\nBy the time Arnautovic was forced off, Wolves were already cruising courtesy of a Romain Saïss header, before a double by the brilliant Raúl Jiménez put the gloss on a superb performance that lifts Nuno Espírito Santo’s side to seventh.\n\nArsenal’s Alexandre Lacazette seals win on emotional night for Cardiff Read more\n\nFor West Ham, this was another meek display four days after crashing out of the FA Cup to League One’s bottom club, AFC Wimbledon. Gareth Southgate was in attendance, presumably to cast his eye over the Wolves captain, Conor Coady, and Declan Rice, the midfielder undecided over his international future, but West Ham had nothing to shout about with a third consecutive defeat.\n\nAfter two weeks in hiding, Arnautovic, who supposedly had his heart set on playing in Guangzhou until performing a dramatic U-turn and signing a contract extension last weekend, found himself in the harsh surrounds of the Black Country. Arnautovic – ineffective up front alongside Michail Antonio – was one of five West Ham changes with Rice and Felipe Anderson restored to the starting lineup. Arthur Masuaku, Angelo Ogbonna and Issa Diop, who were given the runaround by League One’s lowest scorers on Saturday, all retained their places but were pulled from pillar to post, as Wolves wiped the floor with West Ham.\n\n“No shots on target and we conceded three goals, so it was impossible to play worse,” Pellegrini said. “It was the moment to try to find a reaction. We couldn’t do it and we have to review all we are doing, because something we are doing is bad.”\n\nAsked about the seriousness of Arnautovic’s injury, sustained following a second-half challenge by Rúben Neves, he added: “I think it will not be an easy injury. I hope he hasn’t any problems but we must review him with an examination. I’m disappointed about that and disappointed because we have just 15 fit players. We don’t have any creative midfielders in this moment with Lanzini, Yarmolenko, Wilshere and Nasri out, so it’s difficult playing so many games with the same 15 players.”\n\nRicharlison’s early strike gives 10-man Everton win at Huddersfield Read more\n\nWolves’s wafer-thin squad – they have used just 18 in the Premier League this season, the lowest in the division – continue to deliver, however. It always felt like just a matter of time before they found the net, the only surprise being that rather than a slick opener, their first goal came from a routine corner by João Moutinho. His delivery picked out Saïss, who brushed aside his marker Robert Snodgrass before powering home a bullet header. Jonny – who is set to join Wolves permanently from Atlético Madrid for £18m before Thursday’s transfer deadline – was equally influential on his return to the team.\n\nPellegrini predictably summoned Andy Carroll in response to going a goal behind but things quickly went from bad to worse. Arnautovic headed down the tunnel, seconds before a busy Lukasz Fabianski collided with Matt Doherty, who caught the West Ham goalkeeper attempting to turn home Jiménez’s cross. Fabianski continued but Wolves, who thoroughly outclassed a listless West Ham, deservedly added to their tally, with Jiménez striking home another Moutinho corner before his deft chip over Fabianski sealed victory four minutes from time.\n\nAs West Ham restarted, the home faithful made it clear to the Wolves hierarchy they would also like Jiménez, on loan from Benfica, to stick around. “These decisions will be made when they have to be made,” Nuno said. “Raul is doing a fantastic job, which goes beyond the goals he scores. The way he plays, his combinations, the way he works, he doesn’t stop he is always giving us our first reaction to losing the ball. But he has to keep on going.”"}, {"date": "29/01/2019", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74529, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [],

champions.\n\nChris Wood’s 81st-minute header looked to have proved the winner despite Paul Pogba’s late penalty but after bombarding Burnley’s goal up stepped Lindelöf to smash home in added time to send the home support delirious.\n\nNewcastle’s Matt Ritchie on the spot to dent Manchester City’s title hopes Read more\n\nIt left Solskjaer contented with the spirit but rueing two points that escaped. “The way they came back was fantastic,” he said. “So I’m happy with a point but we could have got three at the end. Now you’ve got your answer – can they come back if they go one down or two down even, so I’m very happy with the response.”\n\nHe made five changes from Friday’s FA Cup win at Arsenal. He retained Romelu Lukaku and introduced Marcus Rashford, the first time they operated together under the Norwegian. Alexis Sánchez was dropped after scoring, Jesse Lingard joining him on the bench, with no place for Anthony Martial due to a minor injury.\n\nThe other four new selections were Juan Mata, David De Gea, Phil Jones and Andreas Pereira, who replaced Ander Herrera, the midfielder also a substitute.\n\nAfter Burnley’s 5-0 walloping at Manchester City in the Cup on Saturday, Sean Dyche reverted to the XI that drew at Watford in their last league outing.\n\nIn selecting Pereira and Lukaku Solskjaer took what appeared a gamble. He stood down Herrera from what had been his first-choice side and moved Rashford from the No 9 berth out left to accommodate Lukaku.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ashley Barnes drills Burnley’s opening goal past David de Gea. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nThe early signs augured well regarding Rashford. First, he combined sharply with Mata and Pogba and stood up a cross from his wing that Burnley scrambled out for a corner. Then, he was in the area to have a shot blocked. Next came a one-two with Lukaku, though when in on goal he stabbed wide when scoring looked easier.\n\nPereira’s first contribution was to spray a wild ball and concede possession and from this juncture Burnley enjoyed a passage of pressure inside United’s half.\n\nThey went close after Wood found Ashley Westwood and Jones’s intervention nearly became a pass to Ashley Barnes as Luke Shaw slipped but the central defender cleaned up.\n\nWhat Burnley did well was press United inside their half. Pereira often had to go backwards when receiving due to the close attention of a white shirt. The way to beat this can be quick ball forward as when Lukaku took possession and flipped in a delivery towards Rashford in Burnley’s area.\n\nArsenal’s Alexandre Lacazette seals win on emotional night for Cardiff Read more\n\nAs soon as the second half started there was a scare for United. When De Gea tried to prevent a corner he handed possession to Barnes but to the goalkeeper’s relief it pin-balled back to him.\n\nThe home side’s response was to move up-field, a sequence that ended with Mata hitting straight at Tom Heaton. More fluidity followed when Young pinged a 40-yard diagonal pass to Shaw along the left. He killed the ball, found Pogba and the effort had to be watched closely by the keeper.\n\nThen disaster struck for United and it was down to Pereira. The midfielder he dawdled near his own D and Jack Cork pounced and dispossessed him. From there, the ball was left to Barnes and he smashed home.\n\nThis left Pereira aghast and United behind for the first time under Solskjær. Here, then, was a new test for him: could his side keep calm and respond?\n\nWhen Young forced a corner United had a chance. His delivery found Shaw and his attempt flashed across goal only for Pogba’s back-heel to be steered wide.\n\nJust after the hour mark Solskjær acted. This was the obvious move of pulling off the disappointing – and disappointed – Pereira and bringing on Lingard. United turned the heat up and after Lukaku’s close-range effort was saved he was replaced by Sánchez. This moved Rashford back inside but the question of why Solskjær had tinkered in the first place remained.\n\nHe said: “Rom’s done really well against Burnley before, he’s scored, he’s a handful and with Anthony injured we thought that was the best option with Rashy out there.”\n\nDyche was unhappy with Lingard’s part in the penalty, going down following a Jeff Hendrick challenge. “I just don’t like it when there’s a touch on the shoulder and their legs don’t work but it’s modern football,” he said."}, {"date": "29/01/2019", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 50861,

The only problem was De Bruyne had not waited for the whistle and the “goal” was disallowed.\n\nFar from impressed, City clearly felt this represented painful pedantry on the part of referee, Paul Tierney, with their dismay only intensifying when De Bruyne was booked for his quick thinking.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester City’s players voice their displeasure to Paul Tierney after he chalked off their goal and booked Kevin De Bruyne. Photograph: Greig Cowie/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nConscious they had been reprieved, Newcastle regrouped and even gave their guests an odd counterattacking fright, most notably when Christian Atsu’s 20-yard shot took a hefty deflection off John Stones and swerved marginally off target.\n\nBy now the temperature was plunging and a thin frost seemed to have permeating City’s brains, inhibiting customary invention and incision. At times, Guardiola’s players looked distinctly mortal.\n\nYet although Dubravka was surprisingly underemployed, City remained loosely in control and Newcastle’s Fabian Schär made two vital interceptions; namely a splendidly timed tackle that prevented the lively Agüero from scoring and then a clearance off the line which diverted David Silva’s header to safety after City’s captain had displayed a wonderful change of pace before playing a one-two with Danilo.\n\nSchär’s interventions had the added effect of ensuring Guardiola could not relax. City’s manager looked perpetually on edge whenever Atsu’s counterattacking pace highlighted his side’s defensive vulnerabilities.\n\nArsenal’s Alexandre Lacazette seals win on emotional night for Cardiff Read more\n\nActually exploiting them was something entirely different though. If Almirón had been on the pitch in the No 10 role it might have been different but, in his absence, improvisation was hardly an injury-hit Newcastle’s strong suit. Neither were killer final balls.\n\nBenítez’s players did possess plenty of sheer bloody-minded determination and it paid dividends when Fernandinho only partially cleared a Ritchie cross and Isaac Hayden headed it back into the box. City had made the mistake of leaving Salomón Rondón unmarked and, having narrowly avoided colliding with Atsu, he drove a right-foot shot into the turf which bounced up over a nonplussed Ederson and on towards the roof of the net. Guardiola and co appealed for offside but their pleas seemed forlorn.\n\nTellingly that equaliser came very shortly after De Bruyne had been diplomatically withdrawn in the wake of a challenge on Ritchie arguably worthy of a second yellow card.\n\nNo one epitomises Newcastle’s diligence more than Benítez’s right-winger turned left wing-back so it seemed fitting Ritchie scored the winner from the penalty spot following Fernandinho’s foul on Sean Longstaff – and what seemed an eternity of a delay while Ederson had treatment on a groin injury which may, or may not, have been a psychological ploy designed to preserve his side’s title hopes.\n\nIf so, it failed, leaving the ball firmly in Liverpool’s court."}, {"date": "20/01/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24190,

Pep Guardiola’s men duly took advantage of a side whose toes seem tagged for the relegation morgue and, in the process, renewed their threat in a title race that still offers them all sorts of possibilities. The gap at the top of the table is back to four points and the message for Liverpool is loud and clear: it is going to be a heck of a job to shake off the current champions.\n\nNot that this was the most devastating performance to be seen from City this season. Indeed, they may reflect that on a better day it would have been a prime opportunity to add even more sheen to their outstanding goal difference in the top division. Yet it was difficult to be too critical when City were still capable of winning with something to spare despite a performance, by their standards, that seldom encroached above six out of 10.\n\nPep Guardiola says Manchester City must improve to win the league Read more\n\nTheir opening goal here, when Danilo got lucky with a 20-yard shot that flew in off Christopher Schindler, was City’s 100th this season in all the various competitions, and they quickly added two more from Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sané during the opening stages of the second half. It is 386 minutes, match-wise, since Roberto Firmino became the last player to score against City and in that time Guardiola’s players have now scored 23 times without a single one conceded.\n\nIt works out at a goal, on average, every 17 minutes and, if anything, it was probably a surprise they did not add any more on a day that confirmed why Huddersfield’s manager-in-waiting, Jan Siewert, might already be planning in advance for the Championship.\n\nCity were also denied a clear penalty, with the game goalless, when the referee, Andre Marriner, missed Terence Kongolo’s foul on Sterling and, to Guardiola’s irritation, they may even have allowed a touch of complacency to creep in once they had opened the scoring against the side put together by Mark Hudson, Huddersfield’s caretaker manager.\n\nMaybe it was too straightforward for the away team. Too easy, even. Perhaps it was a direct consequence of neither David Silva nor Bernardo Silva starting the match. Yet City did have Kevin De Bruyne and Ilkay Gündogan in that garish purple and orange kit – two colours that really should not be seen together on a football pitch – and it would have been reasonable to think Sergio Agüero’s focus might have been sharpened by the fact he had been selected ahead of Gabriel Jesus, the scorer of seven goals in his last three matches.\n\nWhatever the reason, it was certainly unusual to see City take the lead, then drop their tempo rather than pouring forward again, in the way that is expected of such a team.\n\nFor the remainder of the first half, anyway. Sané confirmed afterwards that Guardiola had a thing or two to say about it at half-time – “he woke us up a bit” – and City quickly put it right, scoring in the 54th and 56th minutes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Huddersfield’s caretaker manager Mark Hudson talks to Pep Guardiola at the final whistle. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nHuddersfield were clapped off at the end and their supporters, as always, seemed appreciative of the team’s efforts.\n\nUltimately, though, it was clear why the home side had managed only 13 league goals all season, neatly encapsulated by the final kick of the match being a spectacular miss from the substitute Steve Mounié.\n\nMounié was in the six-yard area but still managed to put his shot wide, rounding off an afternoon for Huddersfield that did not really improve from the moment, before kick-off, when they tried to play a farewell message from David Wagner on the big screen. The sound failed and the public announcer had to ask the crowd to lip-read.\n\nHuddersfield Town 0-3 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHuddersfield did at least put that right at half-time, resulting in a standing ovation for the recently departed manager, but it was probably unrealistic to think the league’s 20th-placed club would recover against a City side with such immense resources that Guardiola could not even find a place in his squad for Riyad Mahrez.\n\nSané, the game’s outstanding performer, set up Sterling to double the lead with a diving header inside the six-yard area. Sané had been marginally offside in the build-up but Hudson did not complain in his post-match interviews, perhaps mindful of the penalty that should have been awarded in the first half, and there was no argument about the third goal. This time it was Sané running through the middle, latching on to Agüero’s flick-on, to slip his shot past Jonas Lössl.\n\nEarly on, City had looked like a side in a hurry and Huddersfield were looking hassled even before that moment, 17 minutes in, when Danilo took aim and Schindler inadvertently diverted the shot into his own net with a stooping header.\n\nSiewert, a 36-year-old who has been recruited from Borussia Dortmund’s Under-23s, was picked out by the television cameras shortly afterwards in the Huddersfield directors’ box. Except it turned out it was a doppelganger – rather bizarrely.\n\nThe new manager should be announced soon but Huddersfield look in need of a football miracle and, at the final whistle, their supporters must have wondered how long it may be before City visit this place again."}, {"date": "20/01/2019", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 24807, "home_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup":

The start of Tottenham’s period without their talismanic centre-forward and, indeed, Son Heung-min, too, looked set to end in frustration as Fernando Llorente – the player entrusted with the main striking role – endured a nightmarish afternoon.\n\nLlorente scored an own goal at one end and missed two good chances at the other as Spurs laboured to find their attacking groove. Dele Alli had equalised for them early in the second half but he would be forced off with a hamstring injury in the 86th minute – compounding the sense that this would not be Spurs’s day.\n\nFulham 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nEnter the unlikely saviour – actually, enter two of them. Winks had not scored since November 2016 against West Ham United while the transfer-listed Georges-Kévin Nkoudou had only played once all season – as a 64th-minute substitute against the Hammers in the Carabao Cup. On as the replacement for Alli, Nkoudou sent over an excellent cross with only 15 seconds of stoppage-time left and, suddenly, there was Winks, stealing in to head home and break Fulham’s hearts.\n\nIt was a bitter pill for Claudio Ranieri and his players because they had been the better team in the first half, when Hugo Lloris made two fine saves, and they were not overly stretched in the second period.\n\nRanieri complained that Aleksandar Mitrovic ought to have had a penalty after being pulled at a corner by Jan Vertonghen with Fulham leading, which was debatable, but everybody could agree that his players showed their inexperience and defensive frailty at the end, when they failed to close out what would have been a morale-boosting draw. Fulham remain seven points adrift of fourth-from-bottom Newcastle, with comfortably the worst defensive record in the division.\n\nWith Arsenal and Manchester United closing up on them after wins on Saturday, dropped points in the battle to make sure of a Champions League finish were not a part of Spurs’s thinking. Thanks to Winks, they found a way to record their 11th away win in 13 Premier League matches this season and, according to Pochettino, it was a tribute to the collective belief.\n\nPlay Video 1:43 'It doesn't look great': Mauricio Pochettino worried by extent of Dele Alli's injury – video\n\nMissing Kane to ankle ligament damage and Son to Asian Cup duty, the manager was also without Lucas Moura because of knee trouble. Pochettino gave Llorente a second league start in 18 months as a Spurs player, mindful that in the first – at Swansea last January – the Spaniard had scored in a 2-0 win.\n\nLlorente was on the mark again in the opening stages here – just not in the manner he would have wanted. When Jean Michaël Seri’s 17th-minute corner reached him, the clearance looked routine but, with his feet set poorly, he jabbed at the ball and diverted it the wrong way past Lloris.\n\nFulham might have taken the lead even earlier, having started with the bit between their teeth. Ranieri played Ryan Babel, who arrived last Tuesday from Besitkas on a six-month deal, as the left-sided forward in his 3-4-3 system and the Netherlands international used his power and movement to good effect – starting in the 12th minute. Babel outmuscled Davinson Sánchez and, when he got into the area, he shot for the near corner. Lloris reacted superbly to tip the ball behind.\n\nSpurs lacked ideas in the first half as Fulham kept men behind the ball and compressed the space, although Llorente ought to have equalised on 23 minutes following Vertonghen’s cross. He had the position on Tim Ream, who had his hands on him, but mistimed the header. The ball flew goalwards off his shoulder and Sergio Rico made an important save.\n\nSterling and Sané ensure Manchester City cruise to victory at Huddersfield Read more\n\nFulham played some quick and direct stuff in the first-half and they might have scored again before the break. Babel headed high from Cyrus Christie’s cross while Lloris kept out André Schürrle’s volley with a brilliant reflex save. Mitrovic headed home the rebound but he was offside. Babel was also put off by a Vertonghen challenge after Calum Chambers’s backheel.\n\nSpurs had enjoyed their first clear midweek since the November international break which meant more time to dwell on last Sunday’s 1-0 loss to United at Wembley, which Pochettino described as “unfair.” Another reverse was unthinkable. It was imperative they roused themselves in the second-half.\n\nThe equaliser originated from a Ream air-kick as he attempted to clear and when Christian Eriksen dropped a cross into the area, Alli had melted into space behind the flat-footed Denis Odoi.

Deep into three minutes of second-half stoppage-time, he charged towards the corner flag to join the celebrations and the growing pile of delirious Wolves players after Diogo Jota added the seventh goal of this topsy-turvy match – completing a classy hat-trick after applying the finishing touches to another magnificent defence-splitting pass by the regal Rúben Neves.\n\nWolves 4-3 Leicester City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nJamie Vardy lightened the mood at training in the past week by dressing up as Spider-Man and Leicester thought they had found an unlikely superhero in Wes Morgan, who crashed home a headed equaliser with three minutes remaining, only for Jota to inflict one final blow, slotting home from Raúl Jiménez’s cross to add to the gloom shrouding Claude Puel. An obliging Nuno was sent to the stands by the referee Chris Kavanagh but this kind of agonising defeat – a third in a row and a fifth in the league in eight games – could well send Puel packing. Leicester’s cavalier approach at the end was even more reckless considering how valuable a point could have been given they face Liverpool, Manchester United and Spurs next.\n\nPuel could only grimace with his head in his hands as the stadium erupted, with Nuno guilty of letting the overwhelming elation get the better of him. “It’s difficult to contain your emotions,” the Wolves head coach said. “It’s a very difficult moment, especially because of the way that the game went. After all the situations that passed through the game, it is a tremendous happiness to finish like that for everybody at Molineux. As a manager it’s difficult because there are so many circumstances during the game that I think we should avoid but it was a very good game because both teams went for the game. I don’t know if it’s going to happen again. I’m so, so happy.”\n\nPuel could not have wished for a worse start. Leicester‘s porous defence was exposed throughout and they trailed inside four minutes, by which point Kasper Schmeichel had already made a magnificent left-handed save to deny Neves from adding to his impressive catalogue of long-range strikes. But when Demarai Gray lost possession just inside his own half, Jiménez fed João Moutinho, who stood up an inviting cross. Arriving at the back post, Jota was hungrier than Danny Simpson, the Leicester right-back, and stabbed home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Agony for Claude Puel as Wolves celebrate. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nIt proved a recurring theme, with Ryan Bennett unmarked to tower above Harry Maguire and power a header in to double Wolves’ lead. “It was a crazy game,” Puel said. “We conceded all these goals in the first 15 minutes and it is not possible to accept this.”\n\nWolves should have added a third midway through the first half but Schmeichel gathered Jota’s tame downward header, after the striker eluded a flat-footed Morgan. But whatever Puel said at the break had the desired effect and Leicester were level inside six second-half minutes. First Vardy did superbly to free Gray after Bennett misjudged a bouncing ball on halfway and the Leicester forward galloped into the box before applying a cool finish, drilling the ball across goal and in.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSuddenly Leicester were in the groove and they pulled level on 51 minutes. Ben Chilwell raided down the left flank and Jonny’s interception ran into the path of Harvey Barnes, who lashed home on his Premier League debut, via a kind deflection off Conor Coady. When another sublime Neves pass – a 50-yard ball for Jota – unlocked a frail opposition defence 10 minutes later, the Wolves striker thundered home his second of the afternoon to undo Leicester’s work.\n\nBut just as Morgan thought he had snatched an unlikely draw, heading home the substitute James Maddison’s free-kick, Jota had the final say, adding his third – and his side’s fourth – to leave Leicester on their haunches. Neves dispatched a raking ball into the right channel for Jiménez, who crossed for Jota to sweep in. “We were naive,” admitted Puel. “It is a big shame, a big disappointment. It is important in these moments to just run the clock down and finish the game with a fantastic feeling after a difficult game but now we have a negative feeling.

While their star forward sat at home, dropped after expressing his desire to join Guangzhou Evergrande, a bad week was compounded in wildly contrasting ways by two men who have been touted to take his place.\n\nThe one who did, Andy Carroll, produced an inexplicable miss after half-time to let Bournemouth off in a tightly-poised game. The one they would apparently like to sign, Callum Wilson, promptly scored a blistering opener and West Ham’s lack of response after that provided a grim snapshot of how things might look if Arnautovic gets his wish.\n\nA goal for Carroll might only have proved a sticking plaster in any case but, in the context of this match, what happened in the 49th minute changed everything. Carroll, starting for the second time since returning from injury last month, met Mark Noble’s cross at the far post and headed down for Michail Antonio, who had timed his run well.\n\nJames Ward-Prowse hits stunning goal to steer Southampton past Everton Read more\n\nAntonio could not make a good connection, instead fluffing his lines and watching the ball squirt a yard from the goalline, where his provider was running in. To the disbelief of both persuasions Carroll, with the odds overwhelmingly in his favour, cleared the stand with his shot. It was, you dared think, an opportunity a mercurial Austrian might have gobbled up.\n\n“That chance was a key moment in the match,” said the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, who shared the home crowd’s relief at the termination of a four-game winless run. “In previous weeks these moments have been going against us.”\n\nWilson did not hang around in compounding Carroll’s frustration. His goal owed much to Ryan Fraser, who set himself free on the left with a slick touch on halfway. As he crossed, a heavy challenge from Issa Diop sent the ball spinning into the D and it sat up for Wilson, with textbook technique, to volley sweetly past Lukasz Fabianski. West Ham created nothing of note after that and hardly tested Artur Boruc, who turns 39 next month and was starting his first Premier League game since May 2017 in place of the dropped Asmir Begovic.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Artur Boruc gets down to safely secure the ball for Bournemouth. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nWilson is among West Ham’s preferred replacements for Arnautovic but they do not have the funds to interest Bournemouth, who would want £75m for the player. That figure might have risen further if Lukasz Fabianski, flinging himself to his left, had not tipped Wilson’s daisycutter against the post, keeping West Ham in the game as it entered the last 20 minutes.\n\nIt was Wilson’s final involvement, Howe saying a knee problem curtailed his game, but further punishment would arrive at the death. David Brooks, who missed a free header in the first half but otherwise played elegantly, broke clear down the right and laid on a simple finish for Josh King. Bournemouth had come close on other occasions, Fabianski saving breathtakingly from Steve Cook moments before Carroll’s moment of ignominy, and their margin of victory was deserved.\n\n“I thought it was a real reward for the players’ efforts and mindset during this difficult run,” Howe said, while a curt Manuel Pellegrini offered little about the rationale of leaving Arnautovic behind.\n\n“As a manager you must make decisions on the players that work better in the week,” the West Ham coach said. “Marko has another issue so I thought it was not a good idea for him to play. We don’t need to talk about a player that was not in the squad; I never complain about players that are not here.”\n\nWhen might Arnautovic be ready to play again? “I don’t know,” Pellegrini shot back.

They conceded three goals here and ended up with 10 men after James Milner had, almost inevitably, picked up a second yellow card for another foul on Wilfried Zaha.

They halted the City procession by unexpectedly winning at the Etihad before Christmas and they might have pegged Liverpool back here but for lapses of concentration that ruined a promising start. In Manchester Palace mounted a spectacular comeback after going a goal down, scoring twice in quick succession to surprise Pep Guardiola’s side. Here they seemed to grow tired of waiting for the league leaders to go in front and after half an hour of comfortably repelling everything Liverpool could throw at them they went upfield to demonstrate what a quick and incisive attack looks like.\n\nThe much-anticipated contest between Milner and Zaha did not really happen in the first half because Palace did so little attacking, but when Liverpool found themselves overstretched and Patrick van Aanholt picked out the winger on the left he took full advantage. Zaha was round Milner on the outside in a flash, reaching the byline and cutting the ball back across goal, where Andros Townsend reacted quicker than Fabinho to beat Alisson from near the penalty spot.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe goal was against the run of play but the run of play and a wealth of possession had not been doing Liverpool any favours. With Xherdan Shaqiri on the bench they seemed to lack ideas and penetration, constantly shuttling the ball across the pitch without coming close to breaking through Palace’s two banks of defenders. Julián Speroni made an early save from Joël Matip and Virgil van Dijk headed narrowly over the bar from a free-kick but that those two half-chances represented the closest Liverpool came to a goal in the first period told its own story.\n\nThat was just the first half, though. With the sort of luck that will worry City supporters, Liverpool were back on level terms almost immediately after the interval with a goal that was more of Palace’s making than their own. First Van Aanholt and Mamadou Sakho dithered over a loose ball in the penalty area, eventually clearing unconvincingly. Jordan Henderson fed Van Dijk, whose shot from 30 yards out was hopeful in the extreme, yet the ball struck James McArthur on the way through and ended up hanging tantalisingly in front of Speroni. The goalkeeper might have been more decisive and his hesitancy was punished by Salah, who stuck out his left leg to collect one of the simplest goals of his career.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mohamed Salah equalises with his first goal of the day. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images via Reuters\n\nPalace were unnerved after that and the defence that had stood so firm in the first half gave way again six minutes later. James Tomkins unwisely stood off Roberto Firmino in the area, allowing him to take Naby Keïta’s pass and turn almost at leisure to beat Speroni with a shot into the bottom corner. At least Tomkins was quickly able to atone for his error when he levelled the scores from a Luka Milivojevic corner, rising unchallenged at the far post to head past Alisson.\n\nPaul Pogba and Marcus Rashford strike as Manchester United beat Brighton Read more\n\nThat could and perhaps should have been a decisive moment in the title race but another defensive mistake steered Liverpool towards the three points. Milner did well to reach Fabinho’s diagonal pass and turn a first-time cross back into the danger area but there was no one to accept the invitation until Speroni tried to intercept and succeeded only in wafting the ball backwards towards goal. Once again Salah was on hand to profit – his knack of being in the right place is uncanny – but the ball was crossing the line anyway.\n\nThere was still time for two more goals and a dismissal as the

Goal No 41 of his career came just before the interval and ensured a seventh win from Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s opening seven matches in charge.\n\nThe Norwegian believes Rashford may currently be the Premier League’s finest No 9. “He’s playing the best football of his career,” Solskjær said. “Harry Kane is injured so maybe that gives him the chance to be the best at the moment.”\n\nJosé Mourinho bemoans lack of backing compared to Klopp and Guardiola Read more\n\nRashford’s winner came after Diogo Dalot moved along the left, drawing two defenders, before playing a clever ball to the 21-year-old. From there Rashford turned on the style: despite a tight angle he made a mug of Pascal Gross, then beat David Button with a sweet curled effort.\n\nSolskjær said: “What a finish. It is great working with him. That was his 150th game – I think he has scored more than a couple of the legends we have so he has a great future ahead of him. The first thing when I met him – he had missed some chances – I said: ‘No problem, you’ll be all right, just settle down a little bit’.”\n\nSolskjær initially named his preferred XI, meaning no changes from the win at Tottenham, but Luke Shaw’s withdrawal due to illness led to Dalot’s inclusion, the Portuguese player slotting in at left-back. Chris Hughton retained the same team that lost to Liverpool last Saturday.\n\nUnited’s speed of passing and thought dominated a quiet start, with the visitors claiming a corner and not much else. Ashley Young lifted a free-kick straight into the Stretford End, but the captain came close to creating the opener with his next contribution.\n\nA scuffed cross came to Rashford via Gaëtan Bong and his shot was beaten away by Button, the danger eventually ending when Paul Pogba’s subsequent effort was blocked.\n\nThis flurry jump-started United. Pogba narrowly missed with an overhead kick, and soon after a Rashford chip came close to beating the visiting goalkeeper.\n\nUnited stepped on the throttle, Nemanja Matic firing a 30-yard diagonal to Pogba. The midfielder’s first touch swept the ball inside the area and Bong took him down. After a pause the referee, Paul Tierney, pointed to the spot. Up stepped Pogba, with his trademark slow-motion shuffle run-up, to beat Button to the right.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Pogba celebrates after his penalty. Photograph: Jon Super/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nBrighton’s response was to pepper United’s area aerially and the home side just about dealt with it. When Hughton’s side tried some slide-rule stuff they carved a chance for Glenn Murray but the No 9’s attempt was a pea roller that gave David de Gea no cause for concern.\n\nButton needed to be alert when Anthony Martial tried a lob that appeared to have him beaten before he stuck out a glove to keep the score at 1-0. Next came Rashford’s strike and the second half’s opening act also had him taking the lead.\n\nMohamed Salah double helps Liverpool to rollercoaster win over Crystal Palace Read more\n\nThis time he collected the ball down the left, cut in, then hit a dipping cross in that Jesse Lingard should have finished. The Rashford show may well have inspired Martial as he sliced through Brighton and let go an effort that beat Button but landed on the roof of the net.\n\nOn the hour Hughton replaced Solly March and Murray with Anthony Knockaert and Florin Andone. As is the way under Solskjær, though, United continued to press. Young won a corner from his cross, took this, and Victor Lindelöf’s header went wide.\n\nBrighton showed backbone by pulling one back: Davy Pröpper’s ball with the outside of his boot was missed by Phil Jones and Gross made no mistake. Despite a nervy finish neither did United in closing the contest out. Rashford took a painful knock from Martín Montoya but was able to continue before being replaced in added time by Matteo Darmian.\n\nIf United beat Burnley on Tuesday week it will be their seventh straight league win, and Solskjær will pull ahead of Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola as the manager with the best start to a Premier League tenure.\n\nSolskjær said: “The last 20 minutes we were in trouble. You can’t always play fantasy football. At times we did and it’s a great three points.”"}, {"date": "19/01/2019", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 49864, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name":

"Hostility seemed to lurk at every turn but then Fabian Schär reminded everyone that football should be more about beauty, joy and sheer fun than grudges and grimness.\n\nSchär scored the first two goals as Newcastle secured only their third home win of the season but his opener featured such a gorgeous finish that it almost erased an outpouring of hatred towards the club’s widely detested owner, Mike Ashley.\n\nCallum Wilson’s blistering strike sets up Bournemouth for win over West Ham Read more\n\nMeanwhile, down in the technical areas, Rafael Benítez and Neil Warnock spent most of the afternoon studiously ignoring each other. It is an understatement to say the managers of Newcastle and Cardiff are enemies so it was small wonder Benítez’s pleasure at leapfrogging Warnock’s team to move fourth bottom – one place and two points above Cardiff – seemed particularly pronounced.\n\n“We’re very happy,” said Newcastle’s manager. “We knew how important this game was to win and we’re in a better position to stay up now.” Not even the rumoured prospect of Dennis Wise returning to Ashley’s inner circle – and possibly even a new executive role at St James’ Park – could darken the horizon of a manager still to recruit a single player this month. “I just want to enjoy today,” said Benítez. “I have no idea [about Wise] – but I can’t control other things.”\n\nEarlier everyone had looked a little startled when Warnock’s defence abdicated control and Schär opened the scoring. After collecting the ball in the right-back position, nearly 50 yards from goal, the £3m centre-half showed off a smart change of pace as he sashayed beyond the Everton loanee striker Oumar Niasse – struggling on his Cardiff debut – and advanced unchallenged.\n\nWith three visiting defenders standing, politely, off him, as if transfixed, Schär proceeded to show off his comfort on the ball while cutting inside. Eventually he took a steadying touch, before sending a cleverly delayed, beautifully weighted, left-foot shot curving into the bottom corner from around 12 yards. In its audacious simplicity the goal was a little out of keeping with much of the huff and puff, slightly helter-skelter, stuff which had preceded it. But with Sean Longstaff, recently promoted from the Under-23s, impressing in central midfield, Benítez’s side just about deserved their lead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sean Longstaff on the ball for Newcastle. Photograph: Craig Doyle/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n“What a silly goal to give away,” said Warnock, who is close to completing the £15m signing of Emiliano Sala, the Nantes striker, “It was disappointing because Newcastle were nervous. But don’t write us off.”\n\n“We’ll always be relegation favourites,” he went on, “but I think it will go right down to the wire with six or seven teams involved.”\n\nSchär’s opener arrived at an important moment as the cessation of a temporary truce between Ashley and Newcastle fans dictated that mood was fast threatening to turn toxic. Not that the owner seemed overly bothered as he sat, smirking, in the directors box listening to chants of “We want Ashley out” and “Stand up if you hate Ashley.”\n\nGiven that he is said to be contemplating ending protracted takeover talks with assorted potential purchasers of the club after reportedly losing patience with those negotiating to buy him out, such messages could well prove forlorn. Instead Ashley and the Gallowgate Enders may be stuck with each other for some time to come.\n\nEven though Cardiff’s most dangerous cameo involved a speculative long-range shot from Victor Camarasa which dipped tantalisingly over the bar, Newcastle’s understandable edginess was manifested in a tendency to defend a little deep at times. Considering Martin Dubravka, their goalkeeper, was not required to make a single serious save, such initial timidity was probably unnecessary.\n\nHome nerves were finally assuaged when Schär doubled his side’s advantage. After Matt Ritchie’s corner was headed on by Jamaal Lascelles, the hero of the hour flicked out a thigh to divert the dropping ball beyond the Cardiff goalkeeper, Neil Etheridge. When Ayoze Pérez added a stoppage-time third the relief was palpable but the overall mood remained more shade than light. As Pérez tapped home a cross from the influential Salomón Rondón, resounding choruses of “We want Ashley out,” continued to echo around St James’.\n\nIt took the sight of Benítez striding towards the centre circle and saluting his public to lighten the atmosphere as, finally, smiles replaced snarls.\n\nTom Heaton is Burnley’s hero as Sean Dyche enjoys his homecoming Read more"}, {"date":

But the mentality of the team has been terrific. I thought it was a winning performance today.”\n\nNo Watford manager since Gianfranco Zola left in 2013 has celebrated a one-year anniversary but, having taken over on an 18-month contract following the dismissal of Marco Silva last January, the former Real Sociedad midfielder Gracia has proved a sound appointment. His side went into the match having been beaten in only one of their last seven Premier League matches – at home to Chelsea on Boxing Day – but were up against the manager who lasted 13 months in the hot seat before being sacked when the Pozzo family bought the club and appointed Zola in 2012.\n\nBurnley were looking to win their first three top-flight games in a calendar year for the first time since 1958 yet looked surprisingly edgy in the opening exchanges. Gerard Deulofeu should have punished their sloppy start in the second minute but could not find a way past Heaton when clean through.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The giant screen shows former manager Graham Taylor in the 72nd minute of the match, commemorating two years since his death.

Watford seemed to struggle without the dominant presence of Abdoulaye Doucouré in midfield due to injury, with speculation mounting that the Frenchman could be on his way to Paris Saint-Germain. Ashley Barnes wasted the two best chances for the visitors to take the lead but somehow contrived to poke his shot wide when Adrian Mariappa’s headed clearance fell at his feet.\n\nOn the stroke of half-time Troy Deeney saw his effort from Kiko Femenía’s cross brilliantly parried by Heaton, who played his last match for England in 2017 before losing his place for club and country to Nick Pope due to a series of injuries.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBen Foster was part of Roy Hodgson’s squad at the 2014 World Cup after coming out of international retirement and has excelled for Watford since he joined from West Brom last summer.

Dwight McNeil hammered a volley from the resulting corner high over the bar from close range before it was Heaton’s turn to deny Deeney with his feet at the other end. “You always want more but if you don’t play your best game you can’t expect to win,” said Gracia. “The keepers both had good performances but I think we can play better in attack because we usually do.”"}, {"date": "19/01/2019",

Chelsea’s frailties brutally exposed and the head coach reverting to his native tongue to make clear the depths of his dissatisfaction. Overwhelmed as Arsenal ripped into them through a one-sided first half, Maurizio Sarri’s team had no incision of their own with which to muster anything approaching a riposte. A side lacking a focal point to their front-line limped away in defeat attempting to recall what had constituted their solitary shot on target, and with the gap to fifth and sixth place trimmed to a precarious three points.\n\nTheir efforts had been feeble. They are a team treading water at present and Gonzalo Higuaín, a short-term fix at 31 and a striker with no previous experience of the helter-skelter of this division, cannot arrive on loan from Juventus soon enough. How they could have done with the Argentinian in his pomp here as they attempted to retrieve the deficit shipped in that furious opening period, though that lack of firepower was only one aspect of the problem.\n\nMaurizio Sarri says Chelsea’s players are ‘extremely difficult to motivate’ Read more\n\nTheir play was too stodgy, their threat only ever sporadic, but it was Sarri’s attack on their character which will have stung most of all. His post-match laceration questioned his players’ motivation, determination and, as a result, their basic commitment. A club which only recently was built around John Terry and Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and Petr Cech, has suddenly been rendered mentally frail. Prone to implosion. A side who roll over who are “never going to be a team well known for its battling and fighting qualities”. That was utterly damning, the kind of public criticism that, when key players had the owner’s ear, might actually have left the head coach’s position under serious scrutiny.\n\nSarri’s predecessor, Antonio Conte, was once rendered equally livid by a thrashing in this arena, but duly ripped up his blueprint and started again with a completely different approach. Chelsea went on to win the title that season. Sarri, however, does not work that way. He was brought to this club to play a certain way, with a style that established his reputation at Napoli, and he will not change. Yet, if this group really cannot adapt, that inflexibility could end up costing all dear. Their points tally is identical now to the same stage last season, when Conte’s tenure was apparently unravelling, but they have scored one goal fewer. This is a team whose identity is drifting.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexandre Lacazette drills in Arsenal’s opening goal after three clever touches in the tightest of spaces. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nThey had wilted before the break, blown away by Arsenal’s greater intensity. Their defending was made to look flimsy by the excellence of Aaron Ramsey, Alexandre Lacazette and a workaholic Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, and a tigerish midfield. Yet, in many ways, it was the inability to recover which was more troubling. Marcos Alonso nodded against a post, the 16th time this season Chelsea have struck the woodwork, but that was as close as they came. The statisticians’ insistence that the visitors had managed a first shot on target since the 64th minute against Newcastle seven days previously had felt generous, whether it referred to Ross Barkley’s attempt, blocked by Laurent Koscielny, just after the hour-mark or Alonso’s cross shot, pushed away by Bernd Leno, eight minutes from time.\n\nRegardless, each effort had been repelled with relative ease. It was telling that Koscielny, a player whose form had been rusty ahead of a sixth league appearance after seven months out with a ruptured achilles, looked a centre-half reborn. The days when Drogba would rampage at will in this arena, wrecking Arsenal opponents’ careers en route, have never felt more distant.\n\nThis was a victory to cherish for Unai Emery after a difficult week. His switch to a diamond midfield, tipped by the Juventus-bound Ramsey, proved a masterstroke, and the furious nature of the hosts’ first-half display showcased Arsenal at their attacking best.\n\nArsenal 2-0 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe hosts might have scored three times even before, as the quarter-hour mark approached, Lacazette collected Héctor Bellerín’s centre on his instep amid a clutter of opponents. The Frenchman, initially with his back to goal, twisted smartly away from Pedro and beyond Alonso’s half-hearted attempt to block before, with the angle suddenly horribly tight, spitting away a shot which ripped high inside Kepa Arrizabalaga’s near-post with the goalkeeper pawing at fresh air.\n\nHad they led by only one at the break, Arsenal might have been frustrated given the misses by Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Koscielny and Aubameyang. As it was, the home side would not be denied. Papastathopoulos’s optimistic shot six minutes from the interval turned into an astute cross with Koscielny, stooping on the edge of the six-yard box, looping in a second improbably off his right shoulder.\n\nEmery later suggested that progress was being made on Denis Suárez’s loan arrival from Barcelona, the only sour note on a restorative evening’s work a serious knee injury sustained by Bellerín late on. That will need to be scanned “but first impressions are not positive”. His team have already claimed more points – eight – against the top six this season than they did last, and are now hovering alongside Manchester United on Chelsea’s shoulder.

Pep Guardiola’s team made that clear when Liverpool came here two Thursdays ago and, in their latest victory, it quickly became clear the reigning champions are quite happy playing this game of catch-up – for now, at least.\n\nBy the time they were finished the gap at the top had come back down to four points, Gabriel Jesus had fully justified Guardiola’s decision to keep him in the starting lineup and the goalkeeper, Ederson, had been impudent enough to stroll out of City’s penalty area and nonchalantly start to stroke around the ball in midfield. The crowd loved those moments and, briefly, it did seem to cross Ederson’s mind that he might continue those little one-twos even further upfield and join everybody else in the hunt for more goals. Do not bet against it happening at some point.\n\nManchester City v Wolves: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThe only surprise, perhaps, was that City did not do more to enhance their goal difference – now plus-42 compared with Liverpool’s plus-40 – once Jesus had scored twice in the first half, either side of Willy Boly’s red card for a studs-to-ankle challenge on Bernardo Silva. Two ahead against 10 men, City coasted through the second half but restricted themselves to only one more goal, courtesy of the Wolves captain, Conor Coady, inadvertently turning a deflected cross into his own net.\n\nTo say it was comfortable would be an understatement and, in the process, City kept up their record of having scored at least twice in every home game this season. Their next goal will be their 100th in all competitions in 2018-19 and it is another measure of their firepower that they could win so convincingly on a night when Sergio Agüero and Kevin de Bruyne were restricted to substitute roles.\n\nAt the same time it is also fair to say Wolves were obliging opponents for a side with City’s needs. Boly did at least apologise to Silva and, in days gone by, the defender would probably have had a reasonable defence that he took the ball first. Unfortunately for Boly, he ought to have realised that is no mitigation in modern football when the follow-through involves studs connecting with a player’s ankle. City were already leading at that point and the Frenchman’s red card meant the night swiftly became an exercise in damage limitation for the away side.\n\nJesus had opened the scoring with a close-range finish from Leroy Sané’s low delivery, a goal that originated from a beautifully weighted pass forward by Aymeric Laporte, and when the Brazilian doubled the lead with a penalty six minutes before half-time it meant he had accumulated seven goals in eight days.\n\nDid Ryan Bennett make enough contact on Raheem Sterling to warrant the decision? Sterling was travelling at speed, darting past Bennett and Coady, and he does occasionally tend to make the most of any form of contact inside the penalty area. Yet it was a clumsy effort from Bennett, who missed the ball, and ultimately Sterling was too quick for him. Jesus came forward, stuttering his run-up and sidefooted his kick past Rui Patrício in the Wolves goal.\n\nBoly’s early departure meant Leander Dendoncker moving into a more defensive role and the visitors switching to a 5-2-2 system with little hope but to defend robustly and try to catch their opponents on the break. Truthfully, however, a side with 10 men was bound to be vulnerable against City’s pass-them-to-death approach. City have not been defeated by a promoted side in 35 attempts, going back to February 2007 against Reading, and Wolves have not won here in the top division since December 1979.\n\nAt least the Wolves fans had not lost their sense of humour, greeting every touch with “olés” during one passage early in the second half when the 10 men reminded themselves what it was like to keep the ball for a couple of minutes. No longer than that, mind. City soon had it back and set about re-establishing their superiority, keeping their first clean sheet in 10 league fixtures.\n\nInstead Wolves had to repel a City side for whom Sané was excellent, Ederson was rarely troubled and David Silva established himself as the club’s highest appearance-maker in the Premier League era. This was the Spaniard’s 267th league appearance in City’s colours, taking him above Joe Hart from the modern era – though still some way short of the proper club record, set by Alan Oakes with 564 games from 1959 to 1976.\n\nSilva was replaced by De Bruyne on the hour and it was the Belgian’s cross that led to the third goal. Romain Saïss, one of the Wolves substitutes, headed it towards his own goal but the final touch came off Coady to benefit a City side that now have Huddersfield, Burnley and Newcastle, all in the bottom six, as their next three assignments.

Just good enough to beat Bournemouth, just good enough to claim a first win in five home league games and more than enough to spark an eruption of joy and relief from the Everton manager. Pressure eased.\n\nSilva’s impassioned reaction to the stoppage-time goal that sealed victory said everything about the scrutiny that has been intensifying on his position in recent weeks, and not only since the majority shareholder’s comments at the club’s general meeting on Tuesday. Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s cool finish, added to Kurt Zouma’s first goal for the club, delivered three hard-earned and invaluable points as well as welcome respite for the Portuguese coach.\n\n“It is a really important win,” the Everton manager said. “It is always important, of course, but I understand why you ask about this win because we didn’t achieve what we wanted as a team or a club in the last weeks.”\n\nTheir current position of 10th will not be cause for long-term celebration given Moshiri’s ambition and level of investment, but there was no overstating the importance of this victory. Eddie Howe’s visitors started and finished strongly but departed only with regret: that they did not capitalise on their strongest moments, that André Gomes escaped a red card and the concession of a penalty, and that an 11th defeat in 14 matches will eat away at their belief.\n\n“When you don’t win confidence becomes an issue but you wouldn’t have known it from our performance today,” said Howe. “We created chances and didn’t take them. We switched off for a second at a set piece and were punished. That changed everything.”\n\nEverton took 31 minutes to create a chance of note against a Bournemouth side missing the injured Callum Wilson, a rumoured target for Chelsea. Until that moment they posed no threat whatsoever to Asmir Begovic’s goal and appeared to have no clear idea of how to mount any. The visitors controlled the early exchanges, displaying greater urgency and purpose. Erratic distribution from Jordan Pickford and his defenders offered Bournemouth further encouragement for a first away win since Fulham in October. “They put high pressure on our build-up and we made too many easy mistakes in the first half,” said Silva.\n\nJosh King had missed one excellent chance for the visitors before David Brooks, denied a strong penalty claim by the referee Anthony Taylor, was played through by Junior Stanislas after Zouma’s appeals for a foul went ignored. Brooks placed his shot beyond Pickford only to watch in disbelief as the ball struck the inside of the far post and fell for Gomes to clear.\n\nEverton, their fans growing increasingly restless and their manager increasingly angry, began to match their opponents for aggression and precision in possession as the interval approached. Their performance was transformed as a result. Bernard headed their first chance wide from a Séamus Coleman cross and just failed to connect with a Lucas Digne delivery from the opposite flank. Michael Keane headed against the top of the crossbar after another inviting cross from the France full-back.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Calvert-Lewin celebrates with Ademola Lookman after making the result safe. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nThe second half opened in a similar vein with the growing influence of Bernard, Gylfi Sigurdsson and Gomes ending Richarlison’s isolation as the lone striker. Richarlison went close to opening the scoring when, after his initial header had been blocked by Jefferson Lerma, his rebound was blocked on the line by the knee of Nathan Aké.\n\nDigne was responsible for creating the breakthrough with another perfect cross after Lerma headed clear from a Sigurdsson corner. The full-back controlled beautifully on the left, taking him away from King and floated an inviting delivery to the near post, where Zouma powered a header into Begovic’s top right-hand corner.\n\nGomes, already harshly booked for dissent, was highly fortunate to escape a second yellow card for a foul on Steve Cook, another one on Stanislas and especially when he clipped Lerma around the head inside the penalty area late on. “I’m told it’s a stonewaller,” said Howe. Bournemouth applied sustained pressure in the search for a late equaliser but it was Everton who struck again thanks to the perseverance of Ademola Lookman.\n\nThe young winger regained possession from Adam Smith while grounded and was then sent clear down the left by Idrissa Gueye. Lookman sized up his options and pulled the ball back for Calvert-Lewin who side-footed inside the bottom corner via a slight deflection off Aké.

Mauricio Pochettino and Tottenham lost but it is not curtains for the Argentinian’s candidacy. He will remain of great interest to the power-brokers at Old Trafford.\n\nWhat the result did do was swell the feelgood factor at United that has built under the caretaker management of Ole Gunnar Solskjær. Remarkably he has now won each of his first six matches in charge – no United manager has ever done that – and this was a big one in what was the first acid test of his tenure.\n\nTottenham 0-1 Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nSpurs have established themselves as a Premier League force under Pochettino and they threw everything at United in a fine second-half performance. Unfortunately for them they ran into a goalkeeper in inspired form.\n\nDavid de Gea made a succession of saves and blocks with his feet in that unshowy manner of his to merit the man-of-the-match award. He could not have been expected to make some of them. It added up to a fourth league defeat of the season for Spurs at Wembley and it came coated in misfortune, with the added blows of injuries to Harry Kane and Moussa Sissoko.\n\nThe former limped off at the very end after twisting his ankle under a challenge from Phil Jones, and Spurs will hold their breath on the results of scans. Kane has a history of ankle problems and it is certainly bad timing, with Son Heung-min now departing for the Asia Cup.\n\nMost pleasing from United’s point of view was how Solskjær’s team came to play and attack. He sprang a tactical surprise by starting Jesse Lingard, rather than Romelu Lukaku, as the central striker, with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial either side of him and the trio gave United a pacy and energetic feel.\n\nUnited’s visits to top-six opposition under Mourinho had, with only a couple of exceptions, been grisly wars of attrition. They did not just park the bus but throw the keys into the stand and the statistics showed only two wins from 13 matches – and 11 goals scored.\n\nPlay Video 1:37 Solskjær praises De Gea's heroics and Manchester United's 'blistering pace' after Spurs win – video\n\nIt was a different story here and United deserved their half-time lead, which came on 44 minutes when Lingard, perfectly positioned by Solskjær, intercepted a loose pass from Kieran Trippier. He found Paul Pogba who, in keeping with Solskjær’s philosophy, got United moving quickly. It was his sumptuous crossfield ball that released Rashford in the inside right channel and offered the latest evidence of the freedom with which the Frenchman is playing under the Norwegian.\n\nRashford got himself up against Jan Vertonghen, who was back after two months out with a hamstring injury, and the Spurs defender never looked like stopping the United forward, whose first touch was assured. The angle was tight but the low finish was arrowed into the far corner via Hugo Lloris’s fingertips.\n\nIt was always going to be interesting to gauge Spurs’ intensity levels after Tuesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Chelsea, when they looked jaded. United by contrast were fresh from a warm-weather training break in Dubai. Sissoko lasted only 42 minutes before succumbing to a groin problem, and it was while Spurs tried to reorganise that Rashford scored.\n\nSpurs created a few moments of danger in the first half, mainly through Kane, but it was the visitors who looked the slicker and more threatening before the interval. They could look back on a chance for Lingard, which he snatched at and lifted over, and low shots on the break from Rashford and Martial, both of which Lloris kept out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcus Rashford celebrates after scoring. Photograph: Chloe Knott - Danehouse/Getty Images\n\nSpurs dug deep in the second half to show their character and quality. Sissoko’s replacement, Érik Lamela, injected bite and penetration, Trippier repeatedly got into crossing positions on the right and Dele Alli and Kane shimmered with menace. They hinted at an equaliser extensively but it would not come.\n\nSome of Spurs’ chances were gilt-edged, beginning with Kane’s on 48 minutes, forged by Alli’s through-ball. Kane shot straight at De Gea. The United goalkeeper did well to keep out an Alli header while another from Kane was more comfortable. He was just getting started.\n\nDe Gea’s one-on-one block from Alli in the 66th minute took away the breath and so did the save he made with his left foot to keep out Toby Alderweireld’s near-post flick from a corner. There was also a flying catch from a Kane free-kick and further excellent saves to deny Alli and Kane. De Gea refused to be beaten.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\n\nUnited had their chances at the other end. Pogba saw a header and a low shot both saved by Lloris and there was another moment when he chased his own blocked shot, brushed aside Christian Eriksen and tried to lob the Spurs goalkeeper, who made a wonderful reaction save.\n\nThis was good Pogba, fusing muscle with deft touch to lift things to a higher plane – almost bullying the opposition – but there was a flash of bad Pogba on 78 minutes when he left a nasty boot in on Alli, for which he was booked. He diced with further trouble by hurling the ball away immediately after the foul.\n\nIt was thrillingly open, the sort of game United fans used to see on a regular basis.

Rice’s latest immaculate display underlined why West Ham tied him down to a new long-term deal last month, not to mention why he is coveted by England and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nRice was everywhere, frustrating Unai Emery’s toothless side with a series of unfussy interventions, and it is unlikely that anyone in claret and blue will score a more popular goal this season.\n\n“I am sure Declan will be a top player,” Manuel Pellegrini said. “He is very strong in the aerial duels and has good technique, as we saw with the goal he scored.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marko Arnautovic takes a shot. Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe West Ham manager was just as delighted his side provided further evidence that his attacking approach is working. They achieved their first home win over Arsenal since 2006 with one of their most complete performances of the season, outplaying opponents with designs on qualifying for the Champions League. “I am pleased with the way we played,” Pellegrini said. “We tried to have an ambitious mind.”\n\nEver the showman, Arnautovic bleached his hair for the occasion. Yet this was a subdued performance from the Austrian, who went off with pain in his back for the second successive week, and the early threat emanated from Arsenal.\n\nBurnley fight back to beat Fulham without a shot on target Read more\n\nThe visitors almost scored when Alex Iwobi played Alexandre Lacazette into space vacated by Angelo Ogbonna, only for Lukasz Fabianski to deny the forward with a fine stop.\n\nEmery criticised his players for failing to impose themselves on West Ham and, following their manager’s recent admission that he has funds for only loan signings this month, it was impossible not to feel that Arsenal have got themselves into an unenviable bind when it comes to Mesut Özil. He did not even merit a place on a bench containing three full-backs and a 19-year-old forward, Eddie Nketiah, who has never started a Premier League game.\n\nÖzil is Arsenal’s biggest earner by a considerable distance. Was it not a luxury to travel to West Ham without a player on £350,000 a week? “The players that were here were the players that deserved to be at this match,” Emery said.\n\nYet Arsenal have taken two points from their previous five away games and their failure to score in the league for the first time since the opening weekend exposed their creative deficit.\n\nWest Ham were the stronger side in the final third, with Felipe Anderson’s quick feet causing problems and Samir Nasri determined to silence the constant taunts from the away end. The former Arsenal midfielder was influential in the No 10 role and produced the assist for Rice’s goal.\n\nSlack defending led to the breakthrough in the 48th minute. Anderson skipped round a lacklustre challenge from Lacazette and when Granit Xhaka met the winger’s cross with a lazy header, Nasri fed a composed pass to Rice, who swept a shot high to Bernd Leno’s left.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nEmery responded by replacing Xhaka with Aaron Ramsey and switching to a back four, Shkodran Mustafi making way for Lucas Torreira. There was a brief flurry from Arsenal, Iwobi threatening, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang firing over.\n\nThose were isolated moments, though, and Aubameyang spent most of the game pining for the kind of service Özil could have provided."}, {"date": "12/01/2019", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30682, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "David Button", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Montoya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jürgen Locadia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Andone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Balogun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Steele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Max Sanders", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson Ramses Becker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [50], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Naby Keita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rafael Camacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Liverpool did not sparkle here but, more importantly, nor did they wobble. After losing their unbeaten record to Manchester City they returned to winning ways thanks to a second-half penalty by Mohamed Salah. It was a narrow victory but one that restores Liverpool’s seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League and challenges City to close the gap again when they host Wolves .\n\nDefeats in their two previous matches led to this being billed as a particularly revealing interrogation of Liverpool, with a team aspiring to be champions required to give persuasive answers. The questions ranged from the elementary to the tricky. Could Liverpool’s confidence really be so brittle that a narrow loss at City and a practically invited one at Wolves in the FA Cup would cause it to crumble despite half a season of domestic invincibility prior to that? Answer: No.\n\nLiverpool are mature but ‘not the Harlem Globetrotters’, says Klopp Read more\n\nWhat about their ability to cope with the pressure of a title race when their closest rivals have undoubted pedigree? Their response was positive. They will be asked it again over the remaining 16 matches of the campaign.\n\nAnd what of their depleted defence, which, owing to a spate of injuries, included the midfielder Fabinho here alongside Virgil van Dijk? When Trent Alexander-Arnold collapsed during the warm-up it looked like Jürgen Klopp would be forced into further improvisation but, after having his ankle strapped up, the right-back declared himself fit enough to play. He played well, as did Fabinho despite a lapse in the 15th minute that allowed Glenn Murray a free header from 12 yards. The striker sent his effort over the bar.\n\nThat was Brighton’s only chance in a first half when they spent most of the time entrenched behind the ball in a rigid 4-5-1 formation. This, then, was not a test of Liverpool’s makeshift defence as much as of their creativity. They flunked it in the first period but never lost patience.\n\nTheir play from the start was slow and predictable, almost entirely in front of the hosts. Many times this season there has been a disconnect between their defence and attack and usually Xherdan Shaqiri has helped bridge the gap, with Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum industrious but not ingenious.\n\nPlay Video 1:06 Klopp praises 'most mature' Liverpool performance after Brighton win – video\n\nShaqiri started in a role that allowed him to flit about but he struggled to get involved, although he did have the visitors’ best chance in the first half, nodding wide from 10 yards after a cross from the right by Alexander-Arnold.\n\nLiverpool’s full-backs were their most penetrative players, as Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané tended to get bogged down in overly intricate moves in congested central areas.\n\nIt would have been interesting to see at what stage Klopp might have varied the approach but, as it turned out, there was no need for him to do so because Brighton suddenly played into Liverpool’s hands. A mistake by Martin Montoya early in the second half presented them with an opportunity to launch the sort of rapid counterattack at which they excel. Salah needed no second invitation, hurtling into the box and letting fly with a low shot that David Button did well to hold.\n\nTwo minutes later, Pascal Gross made an even more costly blunder, oafishly fouling Salah in the box. “I feel for Pascal because Salah is probably the most dangerous player when he gets into those situations,” said Chris Hughton, who had no quibble with the decision to award a penalty. Salah’s conversion left no room for doubt, either, the Egyptian ramming the spot-kick beyond Button and into the corner of the net to claim his 14th league goal of the season.\n\nBurnley fight back to beat Fulham without a shot on target Read more\n\nThe onus was on Brighton to vary their approach and subject Liverpool’s defence to a more vigorous test. Hughton made a double substitution in the 65th minute in an effort to give his team more attacking impetus, though the hosts never committed fully to attack.\n\n“Brighton defended like they defended because they knew that one mistake from us and they were back in the game and not making a mistake is difficult,” said Klopp. “But we did it.”\n\nWith 20 minutes to go Jürgen Locadia cut in from the left to unload a 20-yard shot, possibly going wide, that Alisson pushed around the post. But that was as dangerous as Brighton got.\n\nLiverpool found more vibrancy as the game loosened up and had chances to make their lead more comfortable in the 75th minute but Button batted away his swerving long-range shot. Wijnaldum then flashed a low shot inches wide from the edge of the box after a nimble build-up involving Salah, who missed a much better chance in the 87th minute, dragging a shot wide from seven yards after a pull-back by James Milner."}, {"date": "12/01/2019", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19316, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight McNeil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Rico", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [23], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxime Le Marchand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Ream", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jean Seri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [20], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [2], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marcus Bettinelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neeskens Kebano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cairney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Floyd Ayité", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Vietto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahima Cissé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When your luck’s out, it’s out. Relegation-haunted Fulham must have thought they were in with a chance when they got off to a dream start at Turf Moor with a sensational goal after two minutes, only for two own goals in quick succession to put Burnley in control before Claudio Ranieri even had a chance to speak to his players about protecting their lead.\n\nBurnley were therefore able to climb the table without finding the net or even having a shot on target, though that does not necessarily mean Fulham were victims of any cruel misfortune. Sean Dyche’s team reacted positively to going behind at such an early stage and spent most of the first half pressuring the Fulham goal. It was only the identity of the scorers that was harsh on a side looking for their first away win of the season.\n\nTom Cleverley’s volley seals Watford comeback win at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nA home player might have claimed a goal when Chris Wood beat Sergio Rico to a Phil Bardsley cross but slapped his header against an upright. Fulham were not clearing their lines particularly well and, when Dwight McNeil’s cross from the left ran through to Jeff Hendrick on the right, the midfielder’s driven ball across goal was diverted over the line by Joe Bryan’s knee.\n\nThat only encouraged Burnley to keep going forward and, though the second own goal had some comedy value when Denis Odoi seemed to appear from nowhere to head Hendrick’s cross past a startled Rico, it was the home side’s passing and movement that led to Hendrick finding space in the area after starting the move 30 yards out.\n\n“You need a bit of luck now and again,” Dyche said. “I was really pleased with the calmness we showed after going a goal down, we’ve won our last two games by coming from behind and that feels like a big step forward.”\n\nBurnley were well on top at that point and Fulham were looking at familiar failings, which had not been the case in the second minute when André Schürrle opened the scoring with a goal of the highest class. There appeared no particular danger when Odoi launched a long ball into the Burnley box from 10 yards behind the halfway line but Schürrle’s immaculate first touch created the scoring opportunity and left Ben Mee a mere spectator. Extending his right leg to cushion the ball as it fell from the sky, Schürrle had it under control in an instant, letting it bounce once before whacking a dipping shot over and beyond Tom Heaton.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The scene under the Turf Moor lights.

At least Fulham revived somewhat in the second half, enjoying more of the game and almost finding an equaliser when James Tarkowski had to clear Luciano Vietto’s shot off the line.\n\nTom Cairney made a difference when he came on and Burnley had to put in their share of last-ditch defending, with Heaton producing a diving save to keep out a Vietto effort from the edge of the area.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAt times Fulham overstretched themselves, sending too many men forward and inviting their opponents to strike on the counter, though Burnley are too one-paced to be effective on the break.\n\nWhat they are good at once again, after appearing to lose the habit in the first half of the season, is dogged defending. Mee and Tarkowski safely saw out the game, earning Burnley a third successive league win and leaving Fulham to ponder what might have been.\n\n“It’s football, what can you do?” Ranieri said. “I was quite pleased with the performance but not the result.

We will probably receive another phone call from the FA this week, where they will apologise for the referee’s decision, but this doesn’t help us.”\n\nHuddersfield may have stopped the rot after nine consecutive defeats and probably shaded play, though both teams mustered only half-chances. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing was Cardiff’s catalyst and, after skipping away from Erik Durm, he whipped a delicious ball into the box, where Junior Hoilett and Hadergjonaj collided. The latter did not appear to win the ball cleanly. “I suppose you could say justice was done in that respect,” Warnock said.\n\nMohamed Salah penalty puts Liverpool seven points clear at the top Read more\n\nHuddersfield have scored only 13 goals this season, the fewest in the division, and again came up short in the final third. Cardiff, too, were blunt in attack, with Warnock turning to Rhys Healey, fresh from a loan spell at MK Dons, midway through the second half. Kenneth Zohore could return at Newcastle next weekend but Warnock is still desperate to bolster his front line and the club’s chairman, Mehmet Dalman, insists a deal for the Nantes striker Emiliano Sala is not dead. “It stuck out like a sore thumb that we needed something up there,” Warnock said. “I don’t think the chairman has ever worked so hard to get me players.”\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nChances were few and far between and, when they did arrive, they often ended in farce, such as when Sol Bamba bounced into Sean Morrison to stop Elias Kachunga latching on to the ball with Huddersfield pouring forward, four against two on the counterattack.\n\nBut the true drama arrived late on, when Bennett and Hadergjonaj tangled inside the box. After a brief conversation with his assistant, Mason gave the hosts a free-kick, presumably for a foul on the Cardiff left-back before he upended Hadergjonaj.

That Southampton played for 45 minutes with 10 men, following the dismissal of Yan Valery, added insult to injury on another chastening afternoon for the Leicester manager, who, once again, finds himself under the spotlight.\n\nThe headline statistic is that Leicester are eighth in the table, yet that fails to tell the full story of their season. Puel’s decision to field weakened teams in the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup has done him no favours and the booing that greeted the final whistle provided a reasonable barometer of the mood. One elderly fan even had a “Puel Out” placard removed before a ball had been kicked.\n\nBurnley fight back to beat Fulham without a shot on target Read more\n\nIt is 18 days since Leicester beat Manchester City at home, hot on the heels of an impressive victory at Chelsea, yet those results already feel like distant memories. They have lost against Cardiff and Southampton at home since and been dumped out of the FA Cup by Newport County, who are in the bottom half of League Two.\n\nPuel had come out fighting before the game, yet it was his former club who delivered the blows that mattered. James Ward-Prowse converted from the spot and Shane Long, moments after Valery had been sent off, doubled Southampton’s lead in first-half injury-time.\n\nAlthough Wilfred Ndidi pulled a goal back just before the hour mark and Leicester dominated thereafter, Southampton defended with tremendous determination and courage, epitomised by the performance of the excellent Jannik Vestergaard, and held on for the most precious of victories. They are now out of the bottom three and have a favourable run of matches to come.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Claude Puel cuts a dejected figure. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nLeicester’s run of fixtures is not as obliging, although maybe that will help a team that rarely looks comfortable when trying to break down opponents who sit deep and apply what Puel described as “a deep block”.\n\nAsked whether he feels under pressure, Puel replied: “It’s not my concern, no comment. I’m just focused and concentrating on my team. I want to work with these players. The fans are like us – disappointed and frustrated. We wanted to give a good response after the FA Cup against Newport.”\n\nBright from the outset, Southampton got off to a great start. Nampalys Mendy, who endured a miserable afternoon and was withdrawn at half-time, clumsily brought down Long as the Southampton forward ran on to Stuart Armstrong’s pass. Kasper Schmeichel got his hands to Ward-Prowse’s penalty but was unable to keep it out.\n\nDavid Wagner fumes as Huddersfield see penalty denied in draw with Cardiff Read more\n\nThe first half was drifting and felt a little flat until Valery picked up the first of his two yellow cards for a high and late challenge on Ben Chilwell, who was also booked for his reaction. Wes Morgan had a shot cleared off the line by Jan Bednarek from the free-kick that followed but that was a rare Leicester chance in a first half that finished in dramatic fashion.\n\nThe clock had just ticked into the 45th minute when Valery was caught the wrong side of Marc Albrighton and pulled the midfielder back, giving Michael Oliver, the referee, little option but to brandish a red card. Ralph Hasenhüttl admitted he feared the worst at that point, but Southampton’s day got better.\n\nAlex McCarthy punted upfield, Ricardo Pereira’s header was wayward and Mendy allowed Long to pick his pocket.

courted by one of Europe’s biggest clubs, how Chelsea supporters must be thankful for Eden Hazard. The Belgium forward’s contract expires at the end of next season and he could yet find himself at Real Madrid one day, but he remains by far the most important player at Maurizio Sarri’s disposal as the Italian struggles to impose himself on English football.\n\nIt took a moment of brilliance to settle this as Hazard set up Willian – himself the subject of a rejected bid from Barcelona this week – to curl home from an acute angle and end Newcastle’s hopes of a point after they had equalised Pedro’s opener.\n\n“Willian for us is really a very important player,” said Sarri. “We need wingers, so we need Pedro, we need [Callum Hudson-]Odoi, we need Willian, of course. For us, in this moment, he is a fundamental player.”\n\nTom Cleverley’s volley seals Watford comeback win at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nSarri said Chelsea lacked depth in key positions such as central midfield. “As you have seen, today Jorginho was in trouble and on the bench there wasn’t a player for that position, so I need a player, I need an option for Jorginho,” he said. “The club knows very well my opinion, I need the player there [but] it depends on the club decision.”\n\nWatched by owner Mike Ashley as he continues to be frustrated in his attempts to sell the club, Rafael Benítez’s side battled hard but were undone by a lack of quality in the final third as they slipped into the bottom three.\n\nPlay Video 0:56 'I need a player for that position': Sarri asks Chelsea for Fàbregas replacement - video\n\nWith Álvaro Morata injured and potentially on his way out on loan, Sarri turned to Hazard to lead the line as Hudson-Odoi made way for Pedro on the right flank. The 18-year-old – the subject of a £35m bid from Bayern Munich this week – has still to start a Premier League game and found himself on the substitute’s bench despite impressing in both cup competitions.\n\nUnsurprisingly Benítez opted for a safety-first approach in front of his employer. Having stayed away for more than a year before he showed up at Selhurst Park in September for the 0-0 draw with Crystal Palace, Ashley attended six matches in succession but had not been seen since November, when news of a potential takeover led by former Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon first emerged.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nEven less surprisingly, he was greeted with a chorus of disapproval from the away end inside the first 60 seconds of the match. But, on his return to Stamford Bridge, Benítez got off to a terrible start when David Luiz’s brilliant long ball picked out Pedro’s run and he calmly lobbed the ball over Martin Dubravka. Yet Chelsea did not create another real chance until David Luiz headed wide in the 25th minute and they were pegged back just before the break. Ayoze Pérez had already served warning of Newcastle’s threat when he raced on to Salomón Rondón’s flick and poked his shot wide, but Ciaran Clark made no mistake with his header from Matt Ritchie’s corner.\n\n“After the goal I think we thought, ‘now it’s easy’, but it wasn’t,” admitted Sarri. “We slept for 20, 25 minutes, so at the end of the first half we were in trouble. We need to improve in the mental reaction. After our first goal something happened. We need to improve.” Having touched the ball less than any other Chelsea player in the first period, Hazard dropped deeper in an attempt to spark his side into life and the result was almost immediate.

Pedro wasted another great chance from Marcos Alonso’s cross but after Newcastle failed to clear properly, Hazard pounced on the loose ball, wriggled past three markers and played in Willian to curl a sumptuous effort in off the far post.\n\nIt was Hazard’s 10th assist of the season, joining Lionel Messi as the only player from Europe’s top five leagues to have reached both that mark and 10 goals. Hudson-Odoi was serenaded with chants imploring him to stay when he came on for Pedro but Newcastle could have stolen the show had Rondón converted Javier Manquillo’s deep cross. “The reaction of the players after we conceded shows that they care,” said Benítez. “Hopefully everyone can see that the effort was were but it still was not enough. We have to stay calm because it’s a long-distance race. If we continue to play like we did today then we will have a good chance.”"}, {"date": "03/01/2019", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54511, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup":

pull away.\n\nJürgen Klopp: ‘How on earth was Vincent Kompany not sent off?’ Read more\n\nIf City were to prolong the argument, it was imperative they found a way past the leaders. Even a draw would have felt like a grievous setback for the reigning champions and, when Roberto Firmino nodded in Liverpool’s equaliser, approaching the midway point of the second half, a lesser side than City could conceivably have wilted under the pressure.\n\nNot this team, though. As the song goes, City fight to the end and it was not just their competitive courage to conjure up a decisive goal, courtesy of Leroy Sané, that delivered a message. It was the spirit of togetherness displayed by Guardiola’s players in that nerve-shredding finale when Liverpool started pumping balls into the penalty area.\n\nOn one hand City have not kept a clean sheet during their past 11 fixtures. On the other it was a show of collective defiance during those fraught moments when Liverpool had Virgil van Dijk operating as an extra centre-forward. City gave everything to defend their lead, in the way that true champions do. They dug in, they formed an impenetrable blue line and, when it needed the ugly stuff, they were happy to oblige. In the process they made it clear to their opponents it is going to be one hell of a battle between now and the end of the season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sergio Agüero celebrates rifling in the opening goal from an acute angle. Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA\n\nFor Liverpool the priority must be not to wallow in self-pity. It is, after all, only a month ago that City were five points clear and looking capable of turning the title race into a procession. Liverpool still have a four-point cushion and, if they need encouragement, there is only one other club in history who has reached the new year unbeaten and not gone on to win the league – and that was Sheffield United in the 1899-1900 season.\n\nLiverpool will, however, reflect that the night could have taken a very different complexion but for an astonishing goalline clearance from John Stones. And Jürgen Klopp should be aggrieved that, having made it 1-1, his players left themselves so stretched when Sané collected Raheem Sterling’s pass and fizzed a diagonal shot past Alisson to score via the far post.\n\nPlay Video 1:42 Manchester City 2-1 Liverpool: Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola react – video\n\nManchester City 2-1 Liverpool: Premier League player ratings Read more\n\nPerhaps Liverpool might have been better to employ more restraint once Andrew Robertson, the game’s outstanding performer, had turned Trent Alexander-Arnold’s long cross into the six-yard box for Firmino to equalise with a stooping header. It is difficult to be too critical after such an absorbing game but Liverpool lost their shape at the key moment and Sané punished them with a brilliantly angled finish.\n\nKlopp also made the point that, with the game goal-less, Vincent Kompany was fortunate to be shown only a yellow card for a scything challenge on Mohamed Salah.\n\nCity certainly rode their luck at times and never more so than when Salah played Sadio Mané through the middle, the shot thudded off the post and for a split-second, as Stones’s first attempt to clear the danger came back off Ederson and started looping towards an exposed net it felt as if the entire stadium held its breath, anticipating an own goal.\n\nThe technology showed nine-tenths of the ball had crossed the goal-line – but not the final tenth. Stones had somehow got back to hook the ball away, brilliantly, from beneath his crossbar and City were spared by a matter of millimetres.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Stones clears the ball off the line to prevent a farcical own goal giving Liverpool the lead. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nWhen Liverpool watch the replays they will barely comprehend how Stones’s final swing of the ball missed Salah, from point-blank range, when even the merest of touches would have resulted in a goal.\n\nCity made the most of their fortune and, when Sergio Agüero put them into the lead, five minutes before half-time, it was a reminder that the truly great strikers tend to save their best for the big occasions.\n\nSergio Agüero, the man with the grey-blue rinse, shines as City’s beacon Read more\n\nBernardo Silva did the build-up work on the left and for the first time Agüero had manoeuvred a yard for himself inside the penalty area. He was still left with an acute angle, shooting left to right, with an outstanding goalkeeper to beat in the shape of Alisson. Agüero had nicked the ball in front of Dejan Lovren but still had his opponent in close proximity.\n\nIt was the kind of shooting opportunity, on the half-turn, that many strikers would have passed up, concluding that the chances of scoring were too remote. His finish was a beauty – swivelling on the spot and connecting with power and precision. The ball was still rising as it soared between Alisson and his near post and City had the breakthrough they craved.\n\nThat goal continued Agüero’s record of having scored on all seven occasions he has faced Liverpool in league fixtures at this stadium. More importantly, it gave the home team an element of control when, until that point, Liverpool had seldom looked in trouble. Robertson had been coping with Sterling, Alexander-Arnold had the speed and agility to match Sané and, until that piece of brilliance from Agüero, it was unusual to see City finding it so difficult to create chances.\n\nEqually, the same could be said of Liverpool for most of the game and, if City’s supporters had any apprehension about seeing Danilo and Aymeric Laporte operating as their team’s full-backs, it was gone by the end.\n\nLiverpool’s 20-match unbeaten run was over and, for City, the title race had opened up with new possibilities."}, {"date": "02/01/2019", "arena": "Vitality

Six goals in the first half, including four in the space of half a dozen chaotic minutes, provided plenty of drama but not all of it on a night when Troy Deeney accused Dan Gosling of trying “to do Tom Cleverley” and also claimed the referee “bottled it on a few occasions”.\n\nDeeney, who also scored twice and was a handful throughout, is likely to land himself in trouble with those controversial comments, which will go down badly with Bournemouth and also the FA.\n\nChelsea find Southampton tyro Angus Gunn an unbreakable barrier Read more\n\nThe striker did also admit that Abdoulaye Doucouré, his Watford teammate, was lucky not to be dismissed for an awful challenge on Ryan Fraser in the first half. Doucouré’s studs were high as he recklessly lunged at Fraser, yet the referee decided it was only a yellow-card offence.\n\nWatford were 2-0 up but a couple of goals in the blink of an eye, from Nathan Aké and Callum Wilson, brought Bournemouth level. Although Ken Sema then restored Watford’s lead with his first goal since arriving from Östersund in the summer, Bournemouth quickly equalised again through the excellent Fraser. It was breathless stuff and perhaps not surprising that the second half turned into something of an anticlimax when it came to the goal count.\n\nThere was no shortage of incident, though, as Ben Foster produced several superb saves, Watford appealed in vain for a late penalty after the ball struck Aké on the hand, and Gosling made that full-blooded challenge on Cleverley that led to him being booked and provoked such an angry response from Deeney.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Troy Deeney scores his and Watford’s second goal. Photograph: Robin Jones - AFC Bournemouth/AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images\n\n“It was an interesting game to be involved in,” Deeney said. “The defending from both teams was Sunday league at best, to be honest. It was an end-to-end game. It could have been 6-6. As entertainers we’re happy but not as professionals. The only people that are happy are the fans. Abdoulaye Doucouré probably did get lucky [to not be sent off]. But you can’t tell me that their boy did not try to do Tom Cleverley. They know it. We know. But the referee bottled it on a few occasions.”\n\nQuickfire Marko Arnautovic rescues a point for West Ham against Brighton Read more\n\nEddie Howe, the Bournemouth manager, had a rather different take. Asked whether he thought Doucouré was fortunate to stay on the pitch, he replied: “Yes, I do. I think it was a straight red card. I think Ryan is very fortunate not to have picked up a serious injury. It was a very dangerous tackle. I don’t think anyone wants to see those type of tackles in any league.”\n\nAs for Deeney’s remarks about Gosling, in particular the accusation that the Bournemouth midfielder had tried to deliberately hurt Cleverley, Howe said: “I know Dan inside and out and he’s not that type of player. He’s an honest guy. Yes, he’s mistimed the tackle. But in terms of those words, that’s not in Dan’s makeup.”\n\nGosling had an eventful match. It was his wayward pass that led to Deeney doubling Watford’s lead, after the striker had emphatically headed in Sema’s fine cross to open the scoring in the 14th minute. Gosling then saw his header brilliantly saved by Foster before Aké headed in the rebound to reduce the deficit. Fraser delivered the free-kick that led to that goal and also provided the dead-ball delivery from which Wilson equalised with a towering header.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBournemouth’s celebrations were quickly cut short as Sema thrashed home a low left-foot shot from 22 yards that beat Asmir Begovic at his near post. Bournemouth, in keeping with the helter-skelter nature of the game, went straight back up the other end and drew level. Junior Stanislas, who impressed as a makeshift right-back, delivered a low centre that Fraser, who was totally unmarked, coolly dispatched.\n\nHowe, like everyone else, was still trying to make sense

The cushion to Arsenal in fifth stands at three points and it is a quirk of the fixture list that Chelsea still have to visit both of the Manchester clubs, Arsenal and Liverpool.\n\nChristian Pulisic realises his dream by moving to the Premier League Read more\n\nChelsea are the lowest scorers in the top six by a margin and they ran aground against a Southampton team who defended as though their Premier League survival depended on it. Gunn, who joined from Manchester City last summer, showed sound positioning throughout – he left his line to tidy up on more than one occasion – while in the 19-year-old right wing-back Yan Valery the visiting side had an unexpected star. Up against Hazard, he more than held his own.\n\nSarri lost Willian on 37 minutes to a calf injury following a challenge with a little on it from Maya Yoshida, and he joins Pedro and Callum Hudson-Odoi on the list of injured wingers. It was the last thing Sarri needed given the paucity of creative options he had on the substitutes’ bench. He included a complete back four on it. The manager said that Pedro would return to training in one week, Giroud in 10 days.\n\nThe day was a whirr of transfer activity for Chelsea, with the headline item being the signing of Pulisic – he has been loaned back to Dortmund for the remainder of the season – but there was also a move from Monaco for Cesc Fàbregas and one from Wolves for Tammy Abraham, the striker who is currently on loan at Aston Villa.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cesc Fàbregas made his 500th appearance in English football and was seen waving to fans after being linked with a transfer to Monaco. Photograph: Chloe Knott - Danehouse/Getty Images\n\nSarri brought Fàbregas on as a 68th minute substitute for what was his 500th club appearance in English football – not the most significant landmark, perhaps, but one he wanted to reach before he departs – and at full-time he could be seen waving to the home fans. It seemed like a goodbye, although he is expected to play in Saturday’s FA Cup tie here against Nottingham Forest. Fàbregas wants to join Monaco this month and he has to hope that Chelsea can sign a replacement to help make it happen.\n\nSouthampton were compact, they crowded the ball and asked Chelsea one question: do you have the guile to break us down? They did not and it seemed as though the frustration set in early. Midway through the first half, there was audible grumbling from the home crowd.\n\nThat said, Chelsea did create three decent first-half chances, with the big one coming when Hazard took down a high ball and smacked a shot into Gunn’s face. Morata had blown a headed opportunity in the 12th minute while he saw another effort deflected wide by Valery.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nHazard cut inside to work Gunn on 58 minutes and Morata would be denied by the tightest of offside calls following Fàbregas’s pass. Towards the end the substitute Ruben Loftus-Cheek ushered in Morata but he shot straight at Gunn, betraying his rock bottom confidence. “We played a very good match for 80 metres of the pitch,” Sarri added. “The problem was the last 20 metres.”"}, {"date": "02/01/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 23715, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas

than seven minutes even before the dismissal of their most reliable defender.\n\nHuddersfield have found this season hard enough going with 11 men on the pitch, so having to play the whole of the second half without Christopher Schindler was always going to be testing, and Ashley Barnes was able to make Burnley’s extra man count before the end.\n\nQuickfire Marko Arnautovic rescues a point for West Ham against Brighton Read more\n\nBoth teams were down to 10 men by the final whistle, however, Robbie Brady having seen red for a reckless attempt to halt Isaac Mbenza’s breakaway as the game moved into stoppage time, but there was no time left for Huddersfield and the same might soon be true of their stay in the Premier League.\n\nAs ever, David Wagner could not fault his players’ attitude, though the reality to be faced is that the Terriers have lose eight league games in a row and last won in November. “Our luck can change, we’ve had a lot of narrow defeats,” the Huddersfield manager said. “But I don’t like to think about luck any more, it costs me too much energy.”\n\nSean Dyche accepted the sending off changed the game but said it was still a test of patience to find a way through. “We were always probing, always asking questions, and eventually we got our reward.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Mounie’s goal was the first by a Huddersfield striker in the Premier League this season. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nHuddersfield have not been scoring enough goals to be anything other than bottom of the table, though Wagner feels that the football his side have been producing deserves a better points reward, if only his forwards could be more clinical in front of goal. A good example of what he meant arrived early in this game, when an intricate passing move eventually found Elias Kachunga in space on the right, only to produce a cross that obliged Steve Mounié to attempt an overhead kick that flew harmlessly over the bar.\n\nWith both Chris Wood and Barnes up front Burnley always looked capable of hitting their opponents on the break, though the closest they came to a first-half lead was from a set piece, Jonas Lössl getting down low to keep out Ben Mee’s header from an Ashley Westwood free kick.\n\nThat seemed to act as a wake-up call for the home side, who redoubled their attacking efforts almost immediately. Phil Bardsley had to intervene to prevent Kachunga’s firm header reaching its target, and when the resulting corner was not fully cleared Mbenza’s cross from the left found Mounié at the far post. The striker has not exactly been rampant this season, this was his first goal of the campaign, but his header managed to beat Tom Heaton.\n\nJordan Ayew and Crystal Palace scupper Wolves’ search for home comforts Read more\n\nNo sooner had Huddersfield gone in front than their evening began to fall apart. Luck had a role in the ball reaching Dwight McNeil when the teenager set up Burnley’s equaliser, but he still bamboozled Florent Hadergjonaj before sliding the ball across for Wood to score from six yards.\n\nTwo minutes after being pegged back the Terriers found themselves short-handed when Schindler picked up a second yellow for a sprawling tackle on McNeil. Neither of the offences was heinous, the first had been for a similarly clumsy foul on Wood, but a centre half on a caution has to be careful. Wagner’s reaction was to substitute an unhappy looking Alex Pritchard, immediately robbing them of one of their brighter attacking performers.\n\nHuddersfield still found it difficult to contain McNeil in the second half, which made it all the harder to understand why Dyche replaced him just after the hour. A fit-again Brady was a more than capable substitute, but McNeil had been passing Hadergjonaj for fun on the left, as well as launching Charlie Taylor on the overlap.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBurnley almost profited when the home side sent too many men forward and Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Ashley Westwood broke from halfway, only for the former to shoot straight at Lössl. The winner arrived when good hold-up play by Wood allowed Westwood to find Barnes unchallenged in the area, the striker’s dependable finishing doing the rest as he beat Lössl with a confidently placed shot. Exactly the sort of thing Wagner had been looking for from his own players, except it was now too late, even once Brady evened up the numbers. “One-nil, and you messed it up,” chorused the travelling fans in the scoreboard end.

But when they come to reflect on the result the visiting side will certainly take heart. Brighton did not create much but they were composed, sharp and steadied the ship at 2-2 to ride out the game in relative comfort.\n\nFor Manuel Pellegrini, there were more questions to ponder. Why had his team failed so badly to deal with a Brighton set-piece threat that was anything but a secret? Why had they struggled to find any type of fluidity for so much of the match? And why was Andy Carroll restored to the starting XI after a year only to be unceremoniously hoiked at half-time?\n\nThe answers offered afterwards were inconclusive. Pellegrini was frustrated with his defenders, “Brighton score most of their goals from set pieces and to concede two knowing this is disappointing.” At first he blamed seasonal fatigue for the level of performance, especially in the first half. But when pressed, the Chilean conceded: “We cannot play here at home and not create one chance in 45 minutes. We had a lack of creative movement when they were defending.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andy Carroll (right) was substituted at half-time after making his first start in a year. Photograph: Jane Stokes/ProSports/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAs for Carroll, the striker had made his first start since 2 January, exactly one year on, when he scored both in the 2-1 win over West Brom. Times have changed, though, and it was clear from the off that the No 9, who seems to be talked about whatever he does at West Ham, was not in sync with his teammates. He looked unfit for starters, but more obviously he looked like a giraffe in a team of leopards.\n\nIt is sometimes said that playing Carroll means teammates inevitably end up lofting the ball long to his head. But here the effect was almost the opposite, with players determined to make quick flicks despite the presence of the lumbering giant in their midst. Carroll, Pellegrini said, is working his way back to match fitness. His substitution at the interval was “physical and tactical”.\n\nWithin a quarter of an hour of the restart the home side looked sunk. In the 56th minute a Jürgen Locadia cross was shanked out of play for a corner by Issa Diop. Pascal Gross delivered the set piece and landed it on the penalty spot where Lukasz Fabianski came out and punched but only as far as the edge of the box, where Dale Stephens was waiting to promptly turn it back past the Polish international with a smart left-foot volley.\n\nCrystal Palace’s Jordan Ayew and Luka Milivojevic leave it late to sink Wolves Read more\n\nIf that was not to Pellegrini’s liking it got worse a moment later in what almost qualified as deja vu. Another Gross corner, another outswinger to the penalty spot. This time, however, the ball bounced to the back post where Shane Duffy was waiting to hook it into the net for his fourth goal of the season.\n\nIt was then that Pellegrini drew a line. He made another two substitutions, bringing both Mark Noble and Michail Antonio into the fray. By the time the clock ticked to 68 minutes they had helped Arnautovic to restore equilibrium. Noble started it off, his long pass read by Arnautovic who rolled Duffy before shooting past David Button. Two minutes afterwards Antonio made his mark, cutting inside the box (the ball only just staying in play) and finding Arnautovic again, who crashed his effort into the net and went wild in celebration.\n\nWhen asked how to explain this sudden turnaround, Hughton gave a typically wry response. “It’s the Premier League,” he said, “it can happen.”"}, {"date": "02/01/2019", "arena":

Luka Milivojevic then confirmed a precious away win for Roy Hodgson’s side by converting a penalty in stoppage time after Ryan Bennett upended Wilfried Zaha.\n\nAyew’s goal, his first since joining Palace on loan from Swansea in the summer, was particularly timely on a day when the club’s attempt to sign the Liverpool reserve striker Dominic Solanke broke down. “We were interested but it turns out there are complications,” said Hodgson, who refused to comment on reports that Palace became unsure about the player’s fitness, adding: “I do feel a little disappointed for the player because at one stage he had made up his mind in our favour but it didn’t work out. There are other elements that are beyond a coach’s control.”\n\nChelsea find Southampton tyro Angus Gunn an unbreakable barrier Read more\n\nPalace’s two goals here brought the tally for the season to 19 from 21 Premier League matches and Hodgson suggested the club may yet sign someone else to help bolster their options. Any transfer may be partly funded by the departure of Jason Puncheon, with Hodgson saying the club are in talks over a potential departure of the midfielder to Huddersfield.\n\nWolves, too, are keen to sharpen their attack and are interested in Tammy Abraham, the Chelsea forward who has scored regularly while on loan this season at Aston Villa. Nuno Espírito Santo would not say anything about that beyond indicating that Wolves are on the prowl this month for players who could enhance them “but the core of the squad will stay the same”.\n\nOn the pitch, meanwhile, Nuno did not get what he wanted. Immediately after beating Tottenham at Wembley on Saturday, the manager made a new year’s resolution that he demanded his team honour: improve the home form. Instead, Wolves broke it at the first chance. They have now lost five of their last seven matches at Molineux.\n\nFor a long time here it looked like the only losers would be the 30,666 spectators who turned up to watch two weary-looking sides grapple weakly with each other. Effort was plentiful but there was little zip or spark.\n\nRyan Fraser earns Bournemouth a point in six-goal thriller with Watford Read more\n\nIn the 11th minute Matt Doherty produced the first shot of the contest, an otherwise insignificant effort that drifted over the bar from long range. Palace’s first shot followed nine minutes later and brought a save from Rui Patrício. Andros Townsend created the opportunity by nicking the ball off Willy Boly before passing infield to Milivojevic, who tried to poke the ball into the net from the edge of the area.\n\nIn general the match wavered between the humdrum and the torpid. Perhaps that is why Palace’s defenders almost nodded off as half-time approached, leaving Boly free to meet a corner eight yards from their goal. He misdirected his header before Doherty tried to reroute the ball towards the target but nodded over from six yards.\n\nWolves tend to be stronger in second halves and hinted at new energy after the resumption here, Raúl Jiménez tearing down the left wing and crossing for Hélder Costa who, under pressure, could not guide his shot on target. Jonny Otto was even less accurate in the 58th minute, sending the ball skyward from the edge of the box after being picked out by Doherty. And so the game’s pattern continued: much earnest intent and diligent to-ing and fro-ing but little or no spark.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nA breakthrough looked unlikely. And then the improbable happened: a goal, and for Ayew to boot. Fittingly it was created by a miscue, Van Aanholt’s shot from 18 yards flying to the forward. Ayew reacted with nimble precision, controlling the ball before finishing smartly. “If anyone deserved a goal it was him,” said Hodgson. “He did a lot of good work apart from his goal, defending well from the front and stretching their defence.”\n\nZaha stretched that defence to breaking point again in stoppage time, his trickery too much for Bennett, whose tackle demanded to be punished.

three about impact substitutions but even Manchester United’s former supersub extraordinaire must have been pleasantly surprised to see Romelu Lukaku step off the bench and score with his first touch.\n\nUntil the Belgian’s game-changing intervention, Solskjær had seemed outwitted by Rafael Benítez’s contain-and-counter tactics yet by the end of a bitterly cold Tyneside night the impressive Marcus Rashford had added a second to make it four victories from four for José Mourinho’s interim successor.\n\nLabouring Chelsea fail to break down Southampton’s resistance Read more\n\nIt makes the Norwegian the first Manchester United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his opening quartet of games. Perhaps instructively, he acknowledged it would be “hard” for him to relinquish the role and return to his “day job” at Molde in Norway during May. “Of course I won’t want to leave,” he said, semi-teasingly. “I don’t want to.”\n\nHis smile suggested he knows he will almost certainly have to – although much more of this and all bets will be off.\n\nIn marked contrast, Newcastle United have won only two home games all season and are just two points above the relegation zone. If Manchester United’s flight to the warmth of Dubai on Saturday evening for a mid-season training break should be a happy one, Newcastle have no reason for similar relaxation.\n\nBenítez was left rueing the rare goalkeeping error from Martin Dubravka which prefaced Lukaku’s opener. “We have to be disappointed in the way we lost,” he said. “We were very close to getting something but then we made a mistake and we paid for it.”\n\nSolskjær’s principal success seems to have been liberating the creative imaginations of players cowed and cramped by Mourinho. Accordingly as the visiting full-backs, Antonio Valencia and Luke Shaw, pushed forward against Benítez’s five-man defence and Dubravka scrambled an awkward early Rashford shot to safety, it felt as if it might be a long night for Newcastle.\n\nPlay Video 0:58 'I don't want to leave': Solskjær jubilant after Man Utd win at Newcastle – video\n\nThings certainly appeared to have changed since the last time Solskjær patrolled the away technical area here in the spring of 2014; back then Alan Pardew’s Newcastle won 3-0, confirming Cardiff’s relegation from the Premier League.\n\nNewcastle United v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nNot that the Norwegian could afford to relax as he surveyed a backline which could easily have conceded an early goal when Phil Jones’s ill-advised back pass played Salomón Rondón onside and the hitherto noisy travelling fans congregated high in the Leazes End temporarily fell silent.\n\nUltimately, Jones recovered to rescue the situation but Benítez had a glimmer of optimism.\n\nGranted, only Dubravka’s astute positioning prevented Rashford from scoring after Jamaal Lascelles and Fabian Schär collided in their own area and Paul Pogba regularly advanced down the inside-left channel with destructive intent, but the visiting side’s final ball was not quite coming off.\n\nNeither was Newcastle’s but at least Christian Atsu used his pace to good effect down the home left, exploiting the space often left by Valencia’s swashbuckling attacking advances. The problem was that when presented with two half chances, Atsu directed the first shot straight at David de Gea and sent the less than perfectly controlled second flashing across the face of goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phil Jones’ inch-perfect tackle denies Salomón Rondón. Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United\n\nAnother half chance saw Rondón connect with a decent Atsu cross but Jones’s presence seemed to restrict his leap and the resultant header flew harmlessly over the bar.\n\nThe watching Alan Shearer might have scored in that situation but at least Rondón was giving Solskjær’s defenders reason to curb their attacking inclinations. That mattered, particularly as, at the other end, Lascelles’s style had also been cramped, albeit for a different reason, namely the yellow card he received for a wince-inducing challenge on Ander Herrera.\n\nIf Lascelles had enjoyed gently roughing up Rashford, Jonjo Shelvey, a second-half home substitute, contributed a couple of defence-bisecting, outside-of-the-boot passes but was lucky to stay on the pitch after a high late challenge with which he caught Pogba on the back of a knee with studs raised.\n\nThat incident should not detract from Benítez’s commendable gameplan. Tellingly the increasingly urgent little chats Solskjær and his assistant, Mike Phelan, had been holding with Juan Mata and company during breaks in early second half play emphasised that Newcastle had succeeded in denying their guests room for fluid attacking manoeuvre.\n\nAn unlikely hero in this collective masterclass in the art of assiduous closing down was Matt Ritchie. Newcastle’s right-wing-turned-left-wing-back proved intelligence and industry personified as he worked to restrict the threat from Valencia and Mata.\n\nThe moment had come for Solskjær to liberate Lukaku and Alexis Sánchez from the bench and when Dubravka uncharacteristically spilled Rashford’s dipping 25-yard free-kick Lukaku reacted with alacrity, scoring with his first touch by responding faster than Lascelles to drive the rebound over the line.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nTime remained for an unmarked Rashford to slide a shot through Dubravka’s legs at the end of a move he had started himself. It involved Lukaku cueing up Sánchez, who marked his return from hamstring trouble with a pass which not only picked out Rashford but also rekindled visiting hopes of a top-four finish.\n\n“Marcus has a great hit,” added Solskjær after presiding over his first clean sheet. “He must have been watching Cristiano [Ronaldo] practising.

A fifth defeat in eight matches, inflicted by Jamie Vardy’s clinical finish plus a dreadful home display, meant the new year arrived with a new low for the Everton manager. He needs fresh ideas, not only a new striker, to halt the slide.\n\nEverton were booed off as Leicester savoured a third win in four matches and a rise to seventh in the Premier League. The visitors were poor too, in truth, but able to execute their gameplan to frustrate and punish any mistakes. Silva’s team offered plenty, Michael Keane’s the one that led to Vardy’s winner, as their winter regression deepened. Everton have won once since November, not kept a clean sheet in eight games and have the same points tally as at the equivalent stage of the last forgettable season. They were clueless here.\n\n“We were too nervous and anxious without reason,” Silva said. “We are playing a lot of games in a row with no time to rest but that is not an excuse when you miss simple things like passing the ball. When you play in this way with easy mistakes, bad things come to you and that is what happened with the goal we conceded. We gave them the chance to do what they came here to do.”\n\nAn early kick-off on New Year’s Day brought predictably meagre fare. The atmosphere was akin to a bad hangover, with an occasional groan breaking the silence, and the performance of both teams did little to lift it. The first half in particular was littered with basic errors, although Everton did create what few opportunities arose before the break.\n\nJonny Evans blocked a shot from the otherwise subdued Richarlison and Jonjoe Kenny, one of the few pluses for Silva in place of Séamus Coleman, struck a post after connecting cleanly with Lucas Digne’s low cross through the Leicester penalty area. The full-back also set up Dominic Calvert-Lewin for a powerful header that flashed wide of Kasper Schmeichel’s goal.\n\nLeicester threatened even less in the first half, despite receiving several invitations by the hosts’ careless distribution. A tame header from Evans was all that concerned Jordan Pickford in the Everton goal and Puel sought improvement by replacing Rachid Ghezzal with Marc Albrighton during the interval. Predictably, given the nature of a dire game, it was a mistake that provided the visitors with a cutting edge and not a change in personnel.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe breakthrough stemmed from a Schmeichel clearance that skimmed off Theo Walcott’s head and dropped to Keane midway in the Everton half. Under no pressure the central defender produced a terrible first touch and conceded possession to Ricardo Pereira. Quality then made its belated appearance at Goodison. The Portuguese right-back, stationed on the left wing by Puel, sent Vardy through on goal with a perfectly weighted pass. The striker took full advantage of his only chance of the game with a low shot into the far corner.\n\nSilva brought on Bernard and Cenk Tosun in an attempt to restore parity but, one shot and one header by the latter aside, Everton remained lethargic, unimaginative and lightweight. They could have been punished further when Vardy broke from another Keane mistake and the defender escaped a handball claim inside the area. Harry Maguire also volleyed over a Ben Chilwell free-kick from only three yards out. His blushes were spared somewhat by an offside flag but that call was wrong too.\n\nAsked about speculation over his position at Leicester afterwards, Puel replied: “That is not my concern. The most important thing is to show our quality as a team and a club. I am just a person who serves the club and I would like to continue to help the team and the players.\n\n“Speculation, I cannot have an impact on this. The only thing for me is to continue my work.

They did so a little gingerly but ended an afternoon freewheeling past Fulham feeling buoyed by the restorative power of points and goals.\n\nLast week’s slips at Brighton and, more punishingly, Liverpool came as a large dollop of reality for a club whose path to a new post-Wenger way was always likely to be a bumpy one. A reaction was needed – both from Unai Emery and from his players.\n\nThe Premier League’s original Tinkerman, Claudio Ranieri, knows all about the benefits and perils of high-intensity squad juggling and it will not have gone unnoticed how Emery has attacked this project with a penchant for impatiently shuffling his pack before and during games. The search for his most balanced side is an ongoing one, not helped by the vulnerabilities in defence that are so hard to cure with relentless injuries in that department.\n\nJamie Vardy punishes dismal Everton as Leicester start new year in winning style Read more\n\nBut for all the angst about Arsenal’s goals conceded column, goal creation and execution also needed attention, having dipped of late. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette were granted a rare start side by side (something they experienced only once in 10 games before this fixture). It is one of Arsenal’s enduring curiosities that both Emery and his predecessor showed reluctance to play their two strongest attackers as a pair. Both had opportunities. Both got on the scoresheet. For all that it might feel risky for Arsenal to start two strikers, it does seem riskier not to.\n\nEmery pondered it afterwards and touched upon the big balance question. That was something Ranieri also had in his mind. Fulham brought a sense of adventure, even if marrying that to defensive stability was not easy. They carved out two fantastic chances for the speedy Ryan Sessegnon in the first half. Aleksandar Mitrovic’s hulking presence was another menace as defenders bounced off him and Bernd Leno had to be alert to keep out a couple of his headers.\n\nJust as Arsenal were feeling the pressure they pulled themselves together to score. Sead Kolasinac and Alex Iwobi combined all afternoon and when the ball was floated in Granit Xhaka was unmarked with enough time to chest the ball down and pass it into the net.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nArsenal chances came regularly and they got a cushion early in the second half. Iwobi was involved, creating the space for a spate of quickfire passing involving Aubameyang and Kolasinac, and Lacazette was on hand to smash the ball in.\n\nLacazette was disappointed not to be awarded a penalty when Jean Michaël Seri caught him with an outstretched leg as he burst forwards in the box. Nothing was given by the referee, Graham Scott. Seri was instrumental in Fulham cutting the deficit moments later. He bundled over Lucas Torreira and advanced to play a key role in the move that ended with Sessegnon crossing for the substitute Aboubakar Kamara to tap in.\n\nThe Fulham bench was all smiles this time after the weekend penalty brouhaha. “I have no grudge,” Ranieri explained. “He apologised immediately to me, his teammates, the club and it is finished there. I need all my players. I kill but after I give oxygen to them.”\n\nThe mood lurched. Briefly Fulham attacked at will and Arsenal’s anxiety gnawed. The air of discontent took a notable turn as the substitution of Lacazette for Aaron Ramsey was greeted by boos – the first time Arsenal supporters aired an audible challenge to Emery. “You need a cold mind to make a decision,” he said. “Every supporter can have a different opinion but I need to do my work.” It was not such a bad change after all, as the Welshman eased some nerves by scoring Arsenal’s third on the rebound after Aubameyang struck a post.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsenal’s Aaron Ramsey scores their third goal. Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters\n\nIt looked like one of those days for Arsenal’s top scorer, who went close a handful of times, but his goal came eventually, albeit aided by a deflection. He went over to the bench to celebrate with Lacazette. The Arsenal hierarchy, and where certain players fit into it, remains an intriguing conundrum in the Emery era. Again Mesut Özil was absent and the Ramsey situation – with his contract running down while he continues to contribute – adds to the complicated strands that need tidying up.\n\nDefensive imrprovement is Emery’s priority. “Today was the first time we could play with Sokratis [Papastathopoulos], [Shkodran] Mustafi and [Laurent] Koscielny,” he said. “Then came an injury from Mustafi in the first half so we changed to a back four. We are very happy with the attacking players. We need defence also to take more balance and improve. We need to work. We need to prepare for to do better for the second half of the season.”\n\nThe prospect of any arrivals to bolster that department is difficult but open. “The club is working, watching different possibilities,” Emery said. “Maybe we can if the transfer market gives an opportunity to sign one or two players.”\n\nRanieri is also on the hunt for reinforcements and refinement. “My defence improved a lot but, when you play against these type of players that are fast, skilled, that is where you have to improve more,” he said. “They have to be faster. If there will be an opportunity for us I am sure our chairman will help us to stay in the Premier League.”"}, {"date": "01/01/2019", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 32485, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sol Bamba", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Greg Cunningham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aron Gunnarsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Paterson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Lee Peltier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Smithies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Mendez-Laing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Madine", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [12], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [26], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Foyth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Moura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver Skipp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Harry Kane was again on the receiving end of new year’s honours after helping Tottenham Hotspur turn up the heat on their title rivals by snatching back second place in the Premier League. Four days after being awarded an MBE, Kane opened the scoring after 141 seconds and, in doing so, broke his duck against Cardiff City at the fourth time of asking, having netted against every other one of the 27 top-flight teams he has faced.\n\nKane was the catalyst in a game that was over inside half an hour, feeding Son Heung-min for Spurs’ slick third after having a hand in the buildup to a typically classy Christian Eriksen strike from the edge of the box.\n\nJolted back into being the hunter as opposed to the hunted, Spurs seemed to enjoy themselves. Mauricio Pochettino had challenged his players to rise to the role of protagonists here and, while they remain six points off the summit having played an extra game, they issued a timely reminder to Manchester City and Liverpool, who meet on Thursday, that they are determined to make life as interesting as possible.\n\nPochettino will be a keen observer – a neutral, he said, though victory for Pep Guardiola’s side would surely enhance Spurs’ chances in the title race. After slipping up against Wolves, a trip to south Wales had the makings of another difficult evening against a promoted team. It proved anything but as Spurs, impeccably led by Kane, blew away a desperately porous defence with three goals in 26 first-half minutes, feasting on a calamitous Cardiff collapse. Kane got the ball rolling before Eriksen’s assassin-like finish and an arrowed effort by Son sealed the most routine of victories.\n\nFor Cardiff, this was yet another damning defeat against one of the league’s big-hitters, with Spurs sapping the life out of a side hoping to build on a character-building win at Leicester.\n\nCardiff’s record against the league’s so-called “big six” was naturally a concern, having lost their previous 14 meetings, the latest of which was a 5-1 “battering”, as Neil Warnock put it, against Manchester United last month.\n\nHe would have been right to fear this would go the same way when Kane struck the opener, with the ball bobbling in off his right shin after Sean Morrison’s failed clearance under pressure from Dele Alli, before Eriksen doubled Spurs’ lead on 12 minutes. Warnock had warned his players “not to breathe” on the opposition but they afforded them too much respect altogether. This was so easy for Spurs. The pained grimace on Warnock’s face said as much.\n\nCardiff passed up their best spell before Spurs’ killer second, the returning Danny Rose leaping highest at the back post to head away Josh Murphy’s high cross with Callum Paterson, the Cardiff forward, for company, a minute after Toby Alderweireld cut out Murphy’s low ball.\n\nKane, who started and finished the opener and had a hand in the second and third too, freed Moussa Sissoko down the right with a spearing, sweeping through-ball. Sissoko centred for Son, who fed Eriksen. Harry Arter went to ground as the Dane composed himself, teasing Bruno Ecuele Manga by dragging the ball back and forth, and giving Neil Etheridge the eyes as he shaped to bend an effort into the far corner before rolling a cunning low strike inside the near post.\n\nAny of the feelgood factor that Cardiff had fostered from that last-gasp victory at Leicester last weekend had certainly wilted by the time Son added a simple third. Kane was again involved, effortlessly pushing a first-time pass into the path of his teammate after more good running by the formidable Sissoko down Tottenham’s right. Son dispatched another rising effort over the bar moments later but it did not matter. The game was done and dusted with an hour to play.\n\nKane would have scored a second himself but for a superb block by Morrison, the Cardiff captain, midway through the second half. When Spurs did opt to grind through the gears, with the game already out of sight, Kane was at the heart of everything. Sol Bamba ran into trouble on the halfway line, with Sissoko cutting out his hopeful pass and picking out the striker. Again Cardiff were exposed, Etheridge faced with four Spurs forwards, but back came Bamba to deflect Son’s low effort on to the Cardiff goalkeeper’s shoulder and away.\n\nThen Aron Gunnarsson acrobatically denied a probing Alli in the box. Cardiff had failed this test miserably but, with 15 minutes left to play, it was time for Spurs to experiment. Fernando Llorente made a late cameo, in place of Alli, while the 18-year-old Oliver Skipp replaced Son, the academy graduate gaining some more valuable minutes before his likely involvement against Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup on Friday.

One flash of quality was all it took to claim the spoils and, suddenly, the gap from fifth place feels more like a five-point chasm.\n\nGiven Champions League qualification had always been Sarri’s target, he remains safely on track. Not that the Chelsea manager ever really gives off the impression of being satisfied. He would depart Selhurst Park pointing to a lengthening injury list, with Olivier Giroud on crutches as he left the arena after damaging his left ankle late on, once he had finished bemoaning his players’ inability to kill off the contest long before a mildly anxious last five minutes.\n\nHis nitpicking, admittedly justified, extended to a lack of energy in the team’s movement of the ball up to the interval. But Crystal Palace had still been kept at arm’s length, and beaten more convincingly than Sarri’s grumbling assessment had implied.\n\nPerhaps the rather downbeat nature of the occasion had affected him. This had been desperately humdrum fare until N’Golo Kanté, the manager’s half-time instructions presumably still ringing in his ears, injected some impetus early in the second half.\n\nChelsea had been probing, David Luiz sizing up his options in possession inside Palace’s half, when Kanté took it on himself to dart behind and away from Cheikh Kouyaté and between Patrick van Aanholt and Mamadou Sakho to the edge of the six-yard box. David Luiz’s lofted pass was perfectly weighted, with Kanté collecting neatly on his chest and steering his close-range finish beyond Vicente Guaita’s outstretched left hand.\n\nRoberto Firmino shows all Liverpool parts are now operating at their peak | Andy Hunter Read more\n\nIt was the first time Palace had conceded a goal at home since mid-November and evidence of the improvements Kanté has made to date as the World Cup winner adapts to a slightly more advanced brief in this team’s midfield. A third league goal already represents a personal best for an entire season.\n\n“But it was his movement without the ball that was really very good, and done with the right timing,” Sarri said. “It’s very important to have that when we have to play against opponents whose block is very low, and against whom our strikers and wingers find it hard to see space.” That decisive burst between otherwise disciplined opponents illustrated his progress.\n\nChelsea had other opportunities, with Giroud twice supplying eye-catching finishes from marginally offside positions, and had left the woodwork quivering amid a sudden flurry of chances just before the interval.\n\nHad either of those opportunities flown in then Palace would have felt aggrieved. Eden Hazard, scuttling into a rare pocket of space, had clipped his own heel 11 minutes from half-time, with the referee awarding a generous free-kick. Willian struck that on to the outside of a post as Guaita dived, with the referee compounding his earlier error by spying a non-existent touch from the goalkeeper.\n\nWillian would test the Spaniard again from distance at that set piece, forcing a second corner from which Ross Barkley, having shoved James McArthur away, acrobatically flicked a shot on to the same upright with his back to goal. Yet that excitement was utterly out of character with everything mustered up to then, and plenty thereafter. Chelsea, despite their blanket possession, found it hard to prise open obstinate opponents. Palace, for their part, were toothless and lacked anything approaching incision of their own.\n\nRoy Hodgson bristled at mention of his team’s five-goal tally from 10 home games. They have created plenty of chances – albeit not many of them clear-cut – in those fixtures, and had made 31 attempts without reward at Selhurst Park against Cardiff on Boxing Day. Christian Benteke’s absence through injury has hampered them severely but they should still be capable of better than this.\n\nConnor Wickham was flung on just past midway through the second half and skied a half-volley over the bar in the final minute, their clearest sight of goal all afternoon, but the striker is still horribly ring-rusty after a lengthy absence through injury. He is not ready to start Wednesday’s match at Wolves.\n\nAt least Dominic Solanke, the former Chelsea youngster who has found opportunities beyond him at Liverpool, should complete a loan move later this week to offer some much needed clout.\n\n“He’s a proven goalscorer through all the age groups at Chelsea and England,” said Hodgson, who had watched Solanke’s progression through the national ranks with interest. “If he comes here, it’ll be up to him to show he can do that in Premier League football, too. But he’s someone with the profile and ability we’re looking for.”\n\nUntil they find a way of unsettling resolute opposition, their campaign will be a prolonged flirtation with relegation. This was a disappointing way for their year to fizzle out.\n\nFor Chelsea, looking up again rather than at Arsenal over their shoulder, the future feels promising again."}, {"date": "30/12/2018",

managing to climb out of trouble but looking a lot more like their old selves in holding out against West Ham. Sean Dyche dropped Joe Hart and returned to a 4-4-2 formation in the hope of restoring some of the defensive solidity that has served the club well in the past.\n\nIt seemed to work, in that Burnley kept a rare clean sheet, though perhaps judgment should be reserved until opponents who can show a little more attacking conviction are encountered. Tom Heaton was not given a great deal to do in his first league appearance of the season until he made an excellent one-handed stop to foil Andy Carroll at the end. This was one of those tepid West Ham away performances that makes one wonder how they inspire such a large and loyal following, even for an early kick-off in the north.\n\nAgüero strikes as City survive Saints scare and return to winning ways Read more\n\nManuel Pellegrini acknowledged the support at the cricket club end as he walked to the dugout before kick-off, but could hardly bear to look as he trudged off at the interval with his hands in his pockets and his eyes on the ground. By then Burnley were two goals up and good value for it. What definitely worked for Dyche was bringing in the 19-year-old Dwight McNeil on the left wing, with the teenager involved in the first goal and opening his senior scoring account with the second. Yet the real star of the show was Ashley Westwood in an uncluttered midfield. West Ham could hardly get near him, except when Mark Noble was lucky to escape with just a yellow card for an ugly over-the-ball challenge.\n\n“We moved the ball around with real quality today, the players delivered,” Dyche said. “The stats were better, the play was more effective. It was a fine display, a strong sign of how we can perform and we certainly did enough to deserve to win the game. We are still where we are, though. The win was welcome but we are going to need a lot more of them.”\n\nWestwood was on the edge of his own penalty area when Heaton left his area to start the move for the first goal with a header to the midfielder. The ball was then transferred up the left to McNeil, then back to Westwood, whose diagonal ball towards the area was headed into Chris Wood’s path by Ashley Barnes. Wood took a touch and then slipped the ball past Lukasz Fabianski, turning to Barnes in celebration as if to ask why such a simple routine had not worked out more often.\n\nThe lead was no more than Burnley deserved – they could have been in front after a couple of minutes when Barnes anticipated a McNeil cross but put his shot the wrong side of a post. Just after the half-hour they increased it and again Westwood was involved, swinging over a cross that McNeil met at the far post for his first Burnley goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chris Wood fires home the opener. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nPellegrini’s predictable response was to send on second-half reinforcements in the shape of Carroll and Grady Diangana, the latter having more of an immediate effect and the former picking up a booking for clattering Barnes. Burnley still had the chance to make the game safe early in the second half when Westwood played in Wood with only Fabianski to beat.\n\nThe striker managed to miss the target from close to the penalty spot, though credit for that should go to the goalkeeper who left his line early and forced him into a hurried finish. West Ham did improve in the second half, though their first-half showing had set the bar very low. Heaton made one routine save from a speculative Carroll shot and then tipped his powerful close-range header on to the bar in the closing minutes, otherwise the additional aerial threat was capably dealt with by James Tarkowski and Ben Mee.\n\nPerforming as effectively as this, Burnley have a chance of surviving, though of course they will not get to play West Ham every week. “What went wrong?” Pellegrini asked rhetorically at the end. “I could say we had some tired players and only 48 hours to prepare but I don’t like to make excuses. Burnley might be in the bottom three but they played better than us in every sense.”"}, {"date": "30/12/2018", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31381, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kayne Ramsay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Bednarek", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [85], "own_goals": [], "goals": [37], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [45], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elyounoussi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}], "subs": [{"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stuart Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angus Gunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yan Valery", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [10], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [32], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Foden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arijanet Muric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The alarm bells shrilled for Manchester City. Almost out of nowhere, they had lost three Premier League games out of four and, with Liverpool flicking on the afterburners, it is no exaggeration to say that another reverse would have imperilled their title defence. Pep Guardiola and his players could feel a bit better after this. City imposed their front-foot football and, although they wobbled at times during the first half, they had too much for Ralph Hasenhüttl’s rebooted Southampton.\n\nLiverpool’s raggedness in swatting aside Arsenal may yet give rivals hope | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nCity’s self-belief flooded back during a one-sided second half, when it was a minor miracle that they did not add to their lead, but the most important thing was the result. The victory cut Liverpool’s lead at the top of the table to seven points going into Thursday night’s seismic match between the clubs at the Etihad. Win that and City are back in business.\n\nThey will have to tighten up on the finer details to do so. Defensively, there were flaws and Oleksandr Zinchenko, who had erred for Pierre-Emile Højbjerg’s equaliser, was almost caught out by James Ward-Prowse towards the end of the first half when the score was still 1-1. Ward-Prowse took a raking crossfield ball, he had the run on Zinchenko inside the area and, when he felt contact, he went down. A penalty might have changed everything but, in truth, there was not enough in it for a kick to be awarded. Guardiola said that Ward-Prowse had dived.\n\nAt the other end, it is doubtful whether Liverpool will afford City as many chances as Southampton did – the lack of end product was baffling on too many occasions. Yet the positives far outweighed the negatives, with City crafting an unassailable cushion thanks to a Ward-Prowse own goal and Sergio Agüero’s header immediately after the Southampton penalty appeal.\n\nSouthampton’s frustrations were summed up by Højbjerg’s dreadful challenge on Fernandinho in the 85th minute, which earned the home captain a straight red card. Højbjerg was high and out of control with his scissors-style tackle and was condemned by Hasenhüttl for his foolishness. Guardiola was incensed and immediately withdrew Fernandinho, who had earlier been caught by a yellow-card challenge from Charlie Austin.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg was sent off for this foul on Fernandinho. Photograph: Dan Istitene/Getty Images\n\nIt was Fernandinho’s first game back after a thigh injury and he brought reassurance and tempo from his position in front of the back four. At times like these, he can feel irreplaceable. City had started brightly and David Silva’s early goal pepped their confidence. Bernardo Silva swapped passes with Riyad Mahrez far too easily to cross and David Silva’s first-time finish was low and true.\n\nCity did not have it all their own way and Southampton had a great chance to take the lead on nine minutes only for Austin to waste it. Mohamed Elyounoussi’s clipped first-time through-ball was beautifully executed but, confronted by Ederson, Austin took a clumsy touch and the moment was gone.\n\nGuardiola’s side played some lovely one-touch stuff which even included Ederson. The goalkeeper’s composure on the ball when being pressed by red-and-white shirts was either sub-zero cool or terrifyingly reckless, depending on your viewpoint. He fired an end-to-end move in the 19th minute which featured a ball out from Fernandinho and a surging run by Mahrez whose finish was narrowly off target.\n\nChris Wood and Dwight McNeil’s goals take dominant Burnley past West Ham Read more\n\nCity might have been further in front before they were pegged back during an entertaining first half. Raheem Sterling had outmuscled Jack Stephens at the outset only to be denied by Alex McCarthy, while the Southampton goalkeeper blocked from Agüero at point-blank range following Sterling’s low cross.\n\nSouthampton were level shortly after Ederson kept out Austin’s flicked header from a corner with a diving one-handed save. Zinchenko was the City villain, turning into trouble and Højbjerg, and the Dane finished well. He drove into the area, shifted the ball smartly on to his right foot and sent his shot rising inside the near corner.\n\nSouthampton had their tails up and they implored the referee, Paul Tierney, to give them a penalty when Ward-Prowse tumbled under Zinchenko’s intervention. City salted the wound immediately and it was another hard-luck story for Ward-Prowse. Sterling darted into space inside the area and when he crossed the ball deflected wickedly off Ward-Prowse and flew inside the near corner of the net.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\n\nCity deservedly increased their lead when Zinchenko crossed and Jan Bednarek lost Agüero – the footballing equivalent of hara-kiri. Agüero headed down and the ball squirmed underneath McCarthy. It was a moment of redemption for Zinchenko.\n\nThe one-two punch deflated Southampton and City eased to the win. The home team had looked jaded in the defeat to West Ham here on Thursday night and they chased shadows in the second half. The speed and slickness of some of City’s play was too much for them.\n\nChances came and went in the second half. Sterling was denied in a one-on-one by McCarthy; Agüero spun and curled against the woodwork; Sterling was denied a penalty after a challenge from the substitute Yan Valery and Mahrez blew another one-on-one with McCarthy.

He’s coming on and will be a top player.”\n\nIn retaining Rashford and placing Romelu Lukaku on the bench Solskjær offered a clue to how he would prefer United to attack: with the greater nimbleness the No10 can offer over the No9. Within three minutes Rashford started to prove the theory. After drifting to the right he removed Nathan Aké with some Fred Astaire style footwork, fired the ball in and there was Pogba ghosting to the far post to finish.\n\nThis was the perfect start from a move straight out of the Busby-Ferguson playbook: fast, direct and ending with a killer touch. Moments later Solskjær’s men authored a near-repeat. United were showing a buccaneering spirit that has been missing since Ferguson retired in May 2013. Pogba roved everywhere and, when Martial chipped the ball in, there was the No6 again to test Asmir Begovic.\n\nBut on 33 minutes there was nothing Begovic could do to deny the Frenchman. Ashley Young pulled the ball back to Ander Herrera and he sent in a precise cross which Pogba, arriving late between two defenders, rose to head home, beating Begovic to the punch to register his fourth goal in two games.\n\nBy the break it was 3-1 and Solskjær, again, had injected the entertainment-factor back into United. Rashford’s second goal in three matches derived from Martial’s chipped pass from the right.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marcus Rashford slides in to make it 3-0.

Defensive sloppiness allowed David Brooks to cross and Aké beat David de Gea. This had a stern-faced Solskjær striding off at the interval and it gave Eddie Howe something to work with in his half-time talk.\n\nThe second 45 minutes began with Bailly needing to clear and Luke Shaw heading weakly as Bournemouth threatened. Now, though, came some one-touch football at the other end. Shaw won a tackle, Pogba foundMartial and he fed Herrera, who forced a corner.\n\nNext there was impressive pressing as Jesse Lingard hassled Charlie Daniels and Rashford, following up, won a throw-in. This preceded a long passage of possession for the home side in which United moved the ball from back to front with ease. When they next decided to pounce, Pogba slipped Rashford in and his lob was repelled by the ever-busy Begovic.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\n\nAfter Howe swapped Lys Mousset and Ryan Fraser for Brooks and Callum Wilson, off came the effervescent Rashford to be replaced by Lukaku. Solskjær’s substitution was inspired when the Belgian, despite appearing to be offside, beat Begovic with a neat right-footed strike.\n\nPogba then came close to the first hat-trick of his United career but his shot was turned on to the post by Begovic.\n\nBailly will miss three games and his manager had no argument with the decision. “No, I don’t think so. He knows he’s mistimed that one, excited, he’s playing again, thinks he’s going to win the ball and no complaints,” said Solskjær. The defeat, though, left Howe disappointed. “It was a tough game and a disappointing performance from us,” he said. “We were technically below the level we’re usually at and we got punished. We have to regroup, refocus and put things right in our next few games.”\n\nUnited, as Solskjær maintains, are a work in progress. But there is a new-found energy and belief after their travails under Mourinho."}, {"date": "29/12/2018", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30597, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove

sour, suggested he would use the winter months “to think if this is still good for me”.\n\nBrighton would say it seems pretty fine at this point. Locadia, a £14m purchase from PSV Eindhoven in January, had not scored this season until Boxing Day and seemed bound to be remembered as a footnote in history: the one-time record signing who rarely played and hardly found the net. But he has now earned his team four points in four days, his winner on the hour punishing Everton for a negligent start to the second half and if the outcome offered few definitive conclusions about two maddeningly inconsistent sides then perhaps it at least lessened Chris Hughton’s need to shuffle his attacking pack next month.\n\nLocadia’s strike was a curious one and, unlike his equaliser against Arsenal, did not bring the house down immediately. Brighton, behind on points at the break but brimming with menace in the 15 minutes after half-time, won a corner on the right and Locadia was clearly a couple of yards offside when Pascal Gross’s delivery ricocheted to him in front of goal. He spun and beat Jordan Pickford while everyone stood still; at first the assistant referee’s flag shot up and Andy Madley declined to award the goal, but the reaction of Brighton’s players suggested something was strongly amiss.\n\nAbdoulaye Doucouré rescues point for Watford against Newcastle Read more\n\nMadley and his colleague clearly felt similarly on second thoughts; they conferred and, after a brief delay, Brighton’s lead was granted. It turned out the ball had squirmed into Locadia’s path off André Gomes, who seemed unsighted by its flight; the episode felt like a particularly smooth-running imitation of VAR, although most of those present would have felt scandalised if Gomes’s contribution had escaped the officials.\n\n“We’ve never thought that way,” Hughton said when asked whether Brighton had been minded to cut their losses on Locadia next month. “He has always been ready and has trained really well. I’m really pleased now that he’s got his chance.”\n\nLocadia had been involved in Brighton’s best first-half chance, seeing Yerry Mina block his volley after Pickford had saved from Gross. But it was Everton who went in at the break in the ascendancy, going through the gears after a slow first 20 minutes and coming close when Richarlison’s angled effort was repelled by David Button.\n\nThey might have expected to take things further upon re-emerging but instead barely had a kick in the first quarter of an hour, Pickford flipping a Florin Andone header over the bar from point-blank range, and were overrun in that period as the home players upped the intensity.\n\nPerhaps they were rattled by an incident shortly after the interval whose reverberations continued to the end. Everton were furious as Brighton played on with Richarlison down in a heap, deeming Solly March the culprit and continuing their protestations even after the hosts’ attack came to nothing.\n\nThe ructions resurfaced at the final whistle, Lucas Digne taking particular exception to a comment from Glenn Murray and Marco Silva would only say that a referee “has to do the same things for both teams”.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSilva knew, though, that Everton had made their own problems. Button, deputising for the Asian Cup-bound Maty Ryan, tipped a Richarlison drive on to the post straight after the goal and Kurt Zouma thudded an 86th-minute header on to the crossbar, but their unpredictability is becoming a concern.\n\n“We have to be more consistent as a team, it is our goal to improve that in the new year,” he said.

For Huddersfield there was no disguising that belief is running out. This was their seventh consecutive league defeat and David Wagner was visibly shellshocked in his post-match press conference.\n\nIn an unusual turn Ranieri chose to use his conference not to celebrate victory but to deliver a tough message on the primacy of team over individual. Aboubakar Kamara was the focus and the subject of a public dressing-down.\n\nThe French forward had won a late penalty for Fulham, rather dubiously after flicking the ball on to the arm of Huddersfield’s Chris Löwe. But he then refused to give the ball to Mitrovic, the designated taker, and his kick was saved by Jonas Lössl. It is safe to say his manager was not happy.\n\nHe told the BBC: “I wanted to kill him,” and then added: “It is not possible to explain what happened after we got the penalty – or maybe I should say it is easy when a man thinks only of himself.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“It is not right. He didn’t respect me, the club, his teammates, the crowd – he took the ball and just said: ‘I want to shoot.’ He didn’t listen to reason.\n\n“I don’t know if that is it, if it is finished or if it will continue. Maybe I will take him away from the squad. The other players are calm because we won – but not me. It is not important whether we won or lost, it is important what you did and why.”\n\nRanieri at least found time to acknowledge the importance, and celebrate the contribution, of Mitrovic, who played through illness to end a barren run with his eighth league goal of the season. Running on to Ryan Sessegnon’s defence-splitting pass – the teenager having been set free by Tom Cairney in a move reminiscent of Fulham’s promotion form of last season – he finished precisely and coolly between the legs of Lössl. Ranieri said: “Mitrovic has played with a 39-degree fever but he is a strong man.”\n\nAbdoulaye Doucouré rescues point for Watford against Newcastle Read more\n\nFor Wagner, there was little to be said at all. “It’s very difficult. I think it was a game where you’ve seen both teams are struggling at the minute in the Premier League with less clear-cut chances. We were not able to create. This was the story of the game.\n\n“Obviously it’s a low point. Not only because we’ve lost seven in a row but how we lost it. It’s a heavy loss we’ve conceded today. We will need for sure a little bit longer than only 30 minutes afterwards to deal with it.”\n\nWith the Christmas fixtures unrelenting, Fulham now travel to the Emirates to face Arsenal on New Year’s

Cardiff and their supporters provided the perfect end to 2018.

It was the third time this season that Etheridge has saved a penalty and underlined his importance to a gutsy, resolute and spirited Cardiff team.\n\nSol Bamba epitomises all of those qualities and was another standout performer in the Cardiff team. Playing against his former club, Bamba made a vital intervention in the first half, after Etheridge had dashed from his line to thwart Jamie Vardy. Bamba then put his body on the line to get to the rebound first when the Cardiff goalkeeper repelled Maddison’s penalty, and later threw himself in the way of another effort, from the substitute Rachid Ghezzal, as Warnock’s side dug in for a point that suddenly became three.\n\n“We’ve bust a few coupons,” Warnock said, beaming. “I thought we deserved to win. If we’d have been precise in the final third we could have scored three or four. It was a really excellent team performance, our best of the season by an absolute mile. We’ve improved so much since the start of the season.”\n\nFor Leicester this felt like a classic case of after the Lord Mayor’s show. Excellent victories over Chelsea and Manchester City had eased the pressure on Claude Puel and lifted the mood, but this result was a reality check. Leicester had plenty of possession – 62% to be exact – but struggled to break down opponents who sat deep and defended in numbers, which has become something of a theme under Puel, whose decision to substitute Vardy in the second half went down badly with the Leicester supporters.\n\nFulham’s Mitrovic makes late difference in basement clash with Huddersfield Read more\n\n“Frustrated about the result,” said Puel, when asked for his thoughts. “We knew before that it would be a tough game with the tiredness. Also we played a team with another style of play after Chelsea and Man City, a team that played deep with a strong defensive unit, long kicks, second balls and counterattacks. We tried to push until the end. It’s a big disappointment and not a fair result.”\n\nEtheridge’s penalty save felt like the turning point in a game that took a while to come to life. Before that Leicester had plenty of the ball but were largely restricted to shots from distance, apart from when Vardy burst onto Maddison’s pass and Etheridge, dashing from his line, blocked the striker’s shot with his face.\n\nWarnock thought Maddison went down too easily for the penalty but it was a naive challenge for Morrison to make. With Vardy off the pitch, the responsibility fell to Maddison, who recently missed against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup. Etheridge read the Leicester player’s intentions and saved his tame kick. “Neil’s improving all the time,” Warnock added.\n\nCardiff would probably have settled for a point at that stage but their afternoon was about to get much better, courtesy of Camarasa’s right boot and a goal of the highest quality. “You need to play for a manager that believes in you,” Warnock added. “I just encourage him to shoot whenever he can.”"}, {"date": "29/12/2018", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 46356, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [],

"This was the kind of dramatic collapse that will leave Tottenham wondering if they have the depth and killer mentality to last the distance in the title race. Mauricio Pochettino’s side chose a bad moment to come crashing down to earth after their recent scoring spree and their failure to quash an astonishing comeback from Wolves inspired little confidence in their ability to keep up with Liverpool at the top of the table.\n\nTottenham struggled to absorb the disappointment after succumbing to a late storm from Nuno Espírito Santo’s fearless side. They were poised to extend their winning run after an early cracker from Harry Kane but their leggy response left much to be desired when Wolves roared back after half-time, prompting Pochettino to accuse his players of assuming that the game was over when they led 1-0.\n\nMauricio Pochettino says Tottenham lost their heads against Wolves Read more\n\nUnfortunately for Tottenham, Wolves proved far more durable opponents than Bournemouth and Everton after falling behind to Kane’s 18th goal of the season. The visitors played with impressive intensity and enterprise as the game wore on and were threatening long before producing an exhilarating 15-minute flurry that resulted in goals for Willy Boly, Raúl Jiménez and Hélder Costa. This was no smash-and-grab – Wolves, who are up to seventh place, were worthy winners.\n\n“I am very proud,” Nuno said. “It is something we insist on, to show character. We had two different halves. Tottenham had control of the game. They scored a goal and had chances. Then in the second half we tried to go for the game. It was a very good performance.”\n\nWolves adopted a cautious approach in the opening period and there was an air of edginess as Tottenham attempted to demonstrate their title credentials. Heightened expectations can do funny things to the mind; no wonder Nuno had designs on forcing a tight, frustrating affair.\n\nTottenham’s response was to adopt a shoot-on-sight policy. Dele Alli and Son Heung-min snatched at efforts and Kieran Trippier fired a free-kick at Rui Patrício. The hosts were in control but they were crying out for a spark of invention, a moment to set the pulse racing.\n\nLiverpool v Arsenal: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nUp stepped Christian Eriksen, bringing the best out of Patrício with a dipping strike.\n\nTottenham built up ominous momentum and the breakthrough arrived in the 22nd minute. Ivan Cavaleiro conceded possession, allowing Son to send Kane on a foray down the right. The threat was minimal but Kane is capable of scoring from any situation. The striker, who received an MBE in the New Year’s Honours list, cut inside Boly before using his supposedly weaker left foot to let fly with a superb drive from 25 yards.\n\nMore than anything, it was the abruptness of the shot that took the breath away. It was a wonderful exhibition of Kane’s technique and a crushing way for one of the most complete forwards around to puncture the tension.\n\nYet Wolves summoned greater conviction at the start of the second half, pinning Tottenham back, feeding on the crowd’s growing anxiety. Pochettino’s men were weary on and off the ball. Kane was booked for diving and with Rúben Neves increasingly influential in midfield for Wolves, an equaliser began to feel inevitable. That sense increased when Nuno made an attacking substitution, replacing Leander Dendoncker with the silky João Moutinho.\n\nThe question was whether Wolves were capable of fashioning a telling opportunity. With 18 minutes remaining, they produced an emphatic answer. Moutinho delivered a corner from the right and Boly took advantage of slack marking to head past Hugo Lloris.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWolves had scored with their first shot on target but Tottenham could have no complaints. Seeing that his opponents were wounded, Nuno urged his players to go in for the kill. “I felt we could keep on going,” he said. “You have to be brave in these situations.”\n\nThe tide had turned and the comeback was complete with seven minutes to go, Cavaleiro slipping a pass inside to Jiménez, whose trickling shot from the edge of the area somehow squirmed past Lloris’s late dive.\n\nWolves craved more. Neves combined with Matt Doherty, who released Costa. The substitute’s precise low shot sent the travelling fans into a state of ecstasy and left Tottenham with some tough questions to ponder."}, {"date": "29/12/2018", "arena": "Vicarage Road",

the Premier League – all the slip-ups and chokes are currently coming from the teams immediately below them, with the leaders sailing serenely on.\n\nJürgen Klopp’s team were almost untouchable here, taking advantage of Tottenham’s unexpected collapse at Wembley to open up an impressive nine-point gap at the top of the table. Klopp insists it is too early to talk about titles and leads, though if his side are still unbeaten after their visit to the Etihad on Thursday it is hard to imagine who or what might derail the most powerful assault on the Premier League Liverpool have ever mounted.\n\nArsenal gave it a shot, even inducing a mild frisson of tension by taking an early lead, but well before the end they were worn down by a relentless red machine. This was not Liverpool at their most flamboyant – it did not need to be. A combination of efficiency and boundless enthusiasm was enough to force Arsenal into errors, from which clinical finishing ensured the goals flowed.\n\nLiverpool 5-1 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nLiverpool predictably swarmed all over Arsenal from the start, with the front three pressing frenziedly and Fabinho and Andy Robertson driving through midfield to set up attacks, yet it was the visitors who struck first. Alex Iwobi had already seen a shot saved from the first real attack of the evening, before a misdirected pass by Dejan Lovren gave him the ball on halfway a minute later. Iwobi played a quick one-two with Aaron Ramsey and headed for the Liverpool area, this time crossing instead of shooting for Ainsley Maitland-Niles to supply a neat finish at the far post. Alisson might have reacted earlier and tried to get something on the cross, but he was probably expecting another shot and the speed with which Arsenal sent men forward took the entire Liverpool backline by surprise.\n\nUnai Emery’s players must have felt pretty pleased with themselves after a torrid opening period, yet Liverpool snapped back in under three minutes. Mohamed Salah’s shot inadvertently set up Roberto Firmino to equalise, and though Arsenal appealed for offside the referee’s assistant correctly ruled that the last touches had come off Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi, who had found only each other when attempting to clear. If that was a statement of intent from Liverpool another arrived almost immediately, Firmino popping up with his second after Sadio Mané dispossessed Lucas Torreira in midfield. That description does scant justice to the quality of Firmino’s contribution: the Brazilian glided effortlessly past attempts to challenge from Mustafi and Papastathopoulos before placing the ball calmly beyond a nonplussed Bernd Leno. It was one man against virtually the entire Arsenal defence and Firmino won hands down.\n\nJürgen Klopp: ‘We may be nine points in front but we have to go to City’ Read more\n\nAfter three goals in little over five minutes the game settled down for a while, with Liverpool always in control, before Mané increased the lead just past the half hour.

The full-back had all the time he needed to hit a 50-yard diagonal pass that picked out Salah in the area, and once the Egyptian had squared across goal Mané finished with an emphatic flourish even though the ball came to him at waist height.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shkodran Mustafi endured a frustrating evening at Anfield. Photograph: Ryan Browne/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nJust when Arsenal thought they might make it to the interval without further damage, after seeing attempts of their own from Maitland-Niles and Ramsey fly narrowly over in the closing minutes of the first half, a momentary lapse of concentration cost them dearly as stoppage time arrived. Firmino found space on the right and picked out Salah in the area, who then reached the goal-line ready to cut back across goal. The situation was already dangerous and a rash challenge from the luckless Papastathopoulos did nothing to improve it. The defender did not do too much to bring Salah down, a point he was still arguing with the Liverpool striker as the teams headed for the tunnel at half-time, but he had his hands on his opponent and his attempt at a tackle from behind did not reach the ball. Salah went down, the penalty decision went his way and he scored from the spot to secure a 4-1 interval lead.\n\nRaúl Jiménez and Hélder Costa stun Spurs as Wolves seal late comeback win Read more\n\nLiverpool could have gone further ahead at the start of the second half but for a careless touch from Salah, showing too much of the ball to Leno and wasting a quite wonderful pass into the area by Xherdan Shaqiri. Arsenal did not give up and came quite close to finding the net when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang lifted a shot over the bar from a yard or two out. It would not have counted – the flag was raised – but replays suggested Aubameyang had managed to stay onside to reach Ramsey’s cross.\n\nLeno had to make a save from Fabinho after a clever flick from Salah set up another chance, so Arsenal could not complain too much about another soft penalty bringing a fifth Liverpool goal. Sead Kolasinac shoved Lovren in the back as a cross from Jordan Henderson came in, Michael Oliver spotted it and awarded the spot-kick from which Firmino completed his hat-trick.\n\nPerhaps Lovren went to ground too easily, but the push gave him that option. Liverpool will arrive at Manchester City with 54 points from 20 games, 48 goals scored and just eight conceded. That’s championship form in anyone’s book.

The Brazilian was outstanding as he scored twice in six minutes to turn this game on its head and extinguish any hopes Southampton had of putting some distance between themselves and the relegation zone.\n\nNathan Redmond’s early second-half goal – bundled over the line with his arm – put Southampton ahead but that lead lasted for 168 seconds. Felipe Anderson scored only once in his opening 10 Premier League games after joining from Lazio in a club-record £36m deal but the 25-year-old has been making up for lost time since. He hauled West Ham level here with a terrific shot from just outside the area and then made it seven goals in his last nine matches by finishing off a superb counterattack with a beautifully placed winner.\n\nThe Guardian footballer of the year 2018: Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw Read more\n\nThat double blow left Southampton in a state of shock from which they never really recovered. Hasenhüttl, who had won two of his previous three games in charge, admitted his players looked tired in the closing half an hour and also expressed his frustration with the way that “old behaviours were seen today”. Southampton have lost more points from a winning position this season than any other Premier League club, which is why the manner of this defeat felt all too familiar.\n\nWest Ham, on paper, were welcome opponents. Manuel Pellegrini has a major injury crisis on his hands – he is without 10 senior players and was able to name only six substitutes here – yet the visitors looked the more accomplished side throughout. Declan Rice was particularly impressive in the centre of midfield in the first half, when Southampton faded after Danny Ings stabbed an early chance into the side-netting, while Felipe Anderson became more and more influential for West Ham and was unlucky not to finish the game with a hat-trick.\n\nSouthampton, however, were entitled to question whether his second goal should have come about. Television replays showed Rice wrestling with Jan Bednarek in the West Ham area in the lead-up to the breakaway that ended with Michail Antonio releasing Felipe Anderson clear on goal. “I haven’t seen it. But I heard it,” Hasenhúttl said, when asked about the penalty claim. “Maybe with VAR it can be a penalty for us. It could make a big difference for us in that moment. But we try to look at ourselves first and find the mistakes we made.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Declan Rice turns away from Southampton’s Oriol Romeu in what was an impressive performance by the West Ham midfielder. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Southampton manager was particularly disappointed in that respect. “We didn’t have our best evening; too many players didn’t perform like they did maybe last week or the week before,” he said. “And you see what I tell my players, that it’s the Premier League and, if you make easy mistakes like we did on the second goal, then you don’t deserve to win. The first goal we could also defend better. It was too easy how we gave our 1-0 lead away.”\n\nPellegrini, in contrast, could reflect on a hugely satisfying night, especially given that long list of absentees. West Ham have now won five out of their last six league games and they are up to ninth in the table, with 27 points on the board – not bad for a team that have been playing catch-up after losing their first four fixtures.\n\nFelipe Anderson is clearly their star attraction, although Pellegrini was guarded in his praise. “I think he will continue improving,” West Ham’s manager said. “He still loses too many balls, maybe because he must understand the Premier League is difficult if you keep the ball in your feet. But in every game he makes important plays and that’s the most great thing that he has.”\n\nSouthampton v West Ham: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThe match had been a slowburner and precious little happened before the break, apart from Lucas Pérez squandering a golden chance for West Ham. It came to life after the interval, however, when Redmond scored within five minutes of the restart. Lukasz Fabianski initially denied the Southampton winger, who was played onside by Grady Diangana, and the West Ham goalkeeper also thwarted Oriol Romeu. Redmond refused to give up, though, and controversially nudged the ball over the line.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nFelipe Anderson then equalised with a 22-yard shot that flashed inside Alex McCarthy’s near post. If McCarthy’s positioning was questionable on that occasion, there was nothing Southampton’s goalkeeper could do to prevent West Ham’s second. Antonio tore upfield and picked out Felipe Anderson, who took a couple of touches to steady himself before steering a rising shot into the far corner. Although Fabianski had earlier denied Stuart Armstrong and later kept out Mario Lemina’s effort, Pérez and Felipe Anderson both had chances to add a third for West Ham."}, {"date": "26/12/2018", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 24382, "home_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Rico", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Ream", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jean Seri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Joe Bryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aboubakar Kamara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marcus Bettinelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin McDonald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cairney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Floyd Ayité", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Vietto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxime Le Marchand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Conor Coady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Boly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Doherty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "João Moutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romain Saiss", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Otto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Morgan Gibbs-White", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Raúl Jiménez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ivan Cavaleiro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rúben Neves", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hélder Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Vinagre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leo Bonatini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Max Kilman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Claudio Ranieri was left frustrated by Fulham’s wastefulness after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Wolves.

into a seventh-place finish last season.\n\nSean Dyche’s side are in the bottom three for a reason, they have been giving goals away with reckless abandon since the start of the season, and one fears they will remain in trouble until they can restore Turf Moor’s reputation as a tough place to come and pick up points.\n\nSpurs go second as Son Heung-min doubles up in rout of Bournemouth Read more\n\nThis was a sprightly performance from Everton but the visitors had it far too easy. Yerry Mina put them ahead with barely two minutes on the clock, when Burnley were unable to defend the game’s first corner, Lucas Digne increased the lead a few minutes later with a free-kick that Joe Hart could not reach, and after Ben Mee had given away a penalty Everton found themselves 3-0 up with less than a quarter of the match played.\n\n“We were out of the game before we were in it,” Dyche admitted. “We didn’t deserve anything, you can’t start games like that in the Premier League. I was pleased with the way the lads responded to going three goals down, but we cannot afford to put ourselves in that position. For some reason we haven’t been keeping games tight like we did last season.”\n\nMarco Silva paid tribute to the Everton fans, finding the vocal support from the start reassuring after the 6-2 loss in the last game. “We had a bad afternoon against Spurs and what you need after that is for the next game to come quickly,” the Everton manager said. “Burnley are strong and direct but we prepared really well, and of course it always helps if you score early.”\n\nIf Everton thought the game was as good as over midway through the first half, they were wrong. Burnley do keep going and the contest was not quite as one-sided after Ben Gibson pulled a goal back before half-time, forcing the ball over the line from close range after Jordan Pickford had managed to keep out James Tarkowski’s header at a corner.\n\nThat meant all four first-half goals had come from set pieces, something to bear in mind for anyone wondering whether Everton will always start this well when they leave out Richarlison.\n\nMina had gone up for a corner and was still in position to beat Hart from the six-yard line when Bernard picked up a half-clearance and supplied the most inviting of crosses. Digne took on Hart and won with a free-kick from 20 yards out after Matt Lowton fouled Dominic Calvert-Lewin, then when Bernard earned a corner after dispossessing Tarkowski on halfway, Gylfi Sigurdsson scored from the spot after Mee had used a hand in preventing the ball reaching Kurt Zouma at the far post.\n\nThe first decent chance from open play came early in the second half, when Tarkowski could not quite find the finish to beat an exposed Pickford from Jeff Hendrick’s pass. A Burnley goal at that point would have made for a lively conclusion, but though Jack Cork brought a save from Pickford there was nothing resembling a home fightback.\n\nLiverpool rout Newcastle with Fabinho supplying the icing on the cake Read more\n\nBernard continued to cause Burnley problems and there were some neat touches from Calvert-Lewin and Theo Walcott, a chance for the latter leading to the corner from which Everton scored their fourth. It would be slightly unfair to describe it as another set-piece effort; the corner was long over and Everton were looking for a way back into the box when Bernard found Digne almost 30 yards from goal. The full-back’s unerring left foot did the rest, finding Hart’s bottom corner with a low shot driven through a crowd of players.\n\nWhile the French defender clearly has an eye for a shot, Hart cannot be happy at being beaten twice from well outside the box. At least there was little the goalkeeper could do about the fifth and final goal in stoppage time, when Richarlison supplied a neat finish with the outside of his boot to Sigurdsson’s defence-splitting pass.\n\n“He needed a rest, he’s had a difficult week,” Silva said of his Brazilian substitute. “The players are humans, not machines.

The home side mustered 31 attempts but only five tested the excellent Neil Etheridge in the visitors’ goal with countless other crosses skimming harmlessly across the six-yard box. Michy Batshuayi, offered by Chelsea as they seek to cancel his loan at Valencia, might have had a field day. Dominic Solanke, mooted as available at Liverpool, may have only one Premier League goal to his name but even he might have fancied his chances as the barrage intensified in the latter stages.\n\nBruno Ecuele Manga summoned a magnificent challenge on Wilfried Zaha as he burst through on goal while Etheridge thwarted Patrick van Aanholt, Max Meyer and Zaha again.\n\nWhen the rugged back five was bypassed, Andros Townsend looped an awkward shot on to the top of the crossbar inside the opening two minutes, Luka Milivojevic clipped a free-kick on to the top of an upright, while Cheikh Kouyaté and the substitute Connor Wickham missed from close range. A solitary goal would have made Palace comfortable. “But, for all the chances, we didn’t create a simple or clear-cut one, where you thought: ‘Here you go,’ except Connor’s shot or when Wilf was through,” Hodgson said.\n\nThat was telling.\n\nSpurs go second as Son Heung-min helps thrash Bournemouth Read more\n\nWickham had at least provided a focal point but this was a first appearance here in 25 months after a serious knee injury and his rustiness was to be expected.

The same might be said for Cardiff, who arguably created the best chance of the afternoon when Mamadou Sakho’s error surrendered possession and Kadeem Harris found himself free only for Vicente Guaita, not for the first time since finally breaking into the team since a summer switch from Getafe, summoned a fine save.\n\nNot that Neil Warnock, whose 38-year coaching career has included two stints at Palace, was left downhearted. For his side to be three points clear of 18th place after 19 games feels remarkable, and the refusal to wilt here was evidence of underlying character. “We’ve got a fighting chance,” said the Cardiff manager. “Our dressing room is our strength but we play a lot more than they get credit for and we’ve got a bit of steel about us.

Pep Guardiola’s side thus fall below Spurs to third in the table, seven points adrift of the leaders, Liverpool. The title is a two-horse race? Guardiola hopes not.\n\nHis team host Liverpool a week on Thursday. They will need to play much better than they did here if they are to prevent Jürgen Klopp’s team from opening up a bigger lead. Weaknesses were all too apparent in the champions here: a brittle defence, curious flatness in midfield and a frazzled disposition under pressure, exemplified by Fabian Delph’s red card for following through into Ricardo Pereira’s leg after winning the ball in the 89th minute. Leroy Sané was the only one of the visitors’ attackers to perform anywhere close to his best. Leicester deserved to add the scalp of Guardiola’s team to that of Chelsea, which they claimed on Saturday.\n\nLiverpool rout Newcastle with Fabinho supplying the icing on the cake Read more\n\nAt first it seemed as if this would be a stress-free return to routine for the visitors after Saturday’s shock home defeat by Crystal Palace. They enjoyed a comfortable start as Claude Puel decided to adopt the same cautious approach that yielded victory at Stamford Bridge, redeploying the same lineup and ordering 11 players to retreat deep behind the ball when their opponents had possession.\n\nManchester City did little with it until the 14th minute, when Aymeric Laporte accepted the invitation to stride forward and pinged a low pass to Sergio Agüero, who took one touch to control it and another to flip it into the path of Bernardo Silva. The Portuguese midfielder guided a low shot past Kasper Schmeichel. Normal service had resumed. But not for long.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fabian Delph is sent off to compound Manchester City’s misery at the King Power Stadium. Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nNow Leicester decided to take the fight to their visitors, whose weaknesses quickly became apparent. Within five minutes the hosts were level. Their equaliser came from a move that began when Ben Chilwell won the ball near halfway with a challenge on Danilo almost right in front of Guardiola, who is said to be such an admirer of the young English full-back that Manchester City are mulling over a transfer bid. From the tackle, Wilfried Ndidi and James Maddison helped the ball forward to Vardy on the right. The striker curled a lovely cross to the far post, where Albrighton arrived on the blind side of Delph and tucked a neat header into the far corner.\n\nThe champions were looking frail at the back and inadequate in midfield, with Fernandinho still absent with knee trouble and David Silva on the bench. Kevin De Bruyne was below par and so, too, was Raheem Sterling, eclipsed by Chilwell. Recognising his team’s opportunity, Puel adjusted his tactics on the half hour, swapping from a 4-5-1 to a four-man midfield, pushing Maddison forward to support Vardy.\n\nThat made Leicester more dangerous, although Manchester City were the first to threaten after the switch, Agüero dabbing over the bar from six yards after a cross by Sané. Bernardo Silva almost gifted Leicester the lead in the 39th minute, playing a careless back-pass to Vardy. Ederson granted the midfielder a pardon in the form of a fine save from Vardy’s shot.\n\nCity’s Pep Guardiola after Leicester loss: I must change the dynamic Read more\n\nThe goalkeeper was very busy for the next few minutes as Leicester created three more excellent chances before the break. First Ederson saved from Maddison after a dainty swivel and shot by the midfielder, then he parried a shot by Hamza Choudhury, who had snuck into the space behind Delph. Next, following a misjudgment by Danilo, Chilwell crossed for Vardy, who stabbed wide from close range. Half-time was a welcome chance for the frazzled visitors to compose themselves.\n\nThey dominated the early part of the second half but Leicester kept them at bay. Puel tried to get his team back on the front foot by introducing Demarai Gray on the hour in place of Choudhury. But Wes Morgan had to make a superb tackle to prevent Sané from scoring at a pull-back by Agüero.\n\nGuardiola’s acknowledged De Bruyne’s subdued performance by substituting him in the 70th minute, turning to David Silva for inspiration. The Spaniard soon slipped a canny ball through to Sané, who had it nicked off him in the box by a splendid sliding tackle from Harry Maguire. That was Puel’s cue to make another tweak by replacing Maddison with Danny Simpson to help Pereira quell the rising menace from Sané. He cannot have imagined the tables being turned as spectacularly as they were in the 82nd minute. That was when Sané headed an Albrighton corner to the edge of the area, where Pereira collected the ball and rocketed an unstoppable shot into the top corner.\n\nAs time ticked down, Delph was ordered off for an ugly follow-through on a tackle on Pereira."}, {"date": "26/12/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53318, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson Ramses

Liverpool were coasting at the time against Newcastle but now the entire stadium became charged, standing as one and singing with greater conviction about winning the league. With more justification too. Liverpool believe.\n\nThe 100th victory of Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool reign moved his team six points clear of Tottenham at the top of the table, seven clear of City, and extended their unbeaten run at Anfield to 30 league games. On current form, which is improving from a position of strength, they will take some stopping in the second half of the season. Dejan Lovren, a controversial Mohamed Salah penalty, Xherdan Shaqiri and the substitute Fabinho spread the goals through a team that is clicking at precisely the same moment as the reigning champions falter.\n\nManchester City lose again as Ricardo Pereira hits shock winner for Leicester Read more\n\n“I thought that was because of us,” said Klopp of the moment Anfield rippled with excitement over a goal at Leicester. “I’m really naive. I thought: ‘That is really nice, thank you very much’. Then I heard after the game it was about another result! Obviously nobody told our crowd that Tottenham won 5-0. It is fine. The atmosphere for Boxing Day was really good and exceptional in that moment but I thought it was because of us.”\n\nHis team’s efforts, quality and superiority over Newcastle did not go unheralded, however. Klopp refused to join in the euphoric reaction to City’s latest defeat – at least not in public – and described a six-point lead on Boxing Day as merely an encouraging platform. Rafael Benítez was more forthcoming on the possibility of Liverpool claiming the crown that eluded him at Anfield. “They are good enough to win the title, yes,” the Newcastle manager said. “They have a very good team and a very good squad with good players on the bench. If you want to win a league title you have to be consistent and they can do it.”\n\nLiverpool’s perfect Boxing Day began with a present from Jamaal Lascelles, the Newcastle captain, who made a mess of a straightforward clearance, teed up Lovren for his first goal of the season and undermined his team’s encouraging start in one action. There was no pressure on the central defender when Andy Robertson whipped over a cross from Shaqiri’s short corner but he miscued a header back across the area. The ball dropped invitingly for Lovren who swept an emphatic, rising drive into the roof of Martin Dubravka’s net. It was a finish that would have found approval from the onlooking Kenny Dalglish, Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer, though not the defending obviously.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mohamed Salah was awarded a controversial penalty by referee Graham Scott.

Joselu, starting ahead of Salomón Rondón as Benítez selected with Saturday’s trip to Watford in mind, could have put Newcastle ahead when Ritchie’s cross sailed over Virgil van Dijk. Unmarked in the six-yard box, the Spanish striker headed down and several yards wide of Alisson’s goal.\n\nCity’s Pep Guardiola after Leicester loss: I must change the dynamic Read more\n\nLiverpool were in no mood to offer further invitations once in front, however, and controlled proceedings. Sadio Mané was close to converting Roberto Firmino’s through ball only for Dubravka to save well with his feet. The Newcastle keeper was also alert to a powerful free-kick from Shaqiri that took a slight deflection off Mohamed Diamé before being beaten from a highly controversial penalty moments after the restart.\n\nSalah converted the spot-kick low to Dubravka’s right having won it with a theatrical tumble as he cut into the area from Trent Alexander-Arnold’s pass. Paul Dummett touched the Liverpool forward’s arm but not enough to impede Salah or produce the collapse that followed. Graham Scott, the referee, bought it and Liverpool scored a Premier League penalty at Anfield for the first time since November 2016. Benítez called it “a soft penalty that changed everything” but the legitimacy and merit of Liverpool’s victory was never in question.\n\nWith the threat from Newcastle nonexistent Klopp could afford to look ahead and rest Georginio Wijnaldum and Firmino for the remainder of the contest. Shaqiri converted the third after the visitors failed to clear a dangerous low cross from the fit-again Alexander-Arnold. Jordan Henderson threaded a fine ball back to the defender on the right and, from his second attempt, the Switzerland international was on hand to beat Dubravka convincingly from close range.\n\nAnfield was still digesting the news of Leicester’s second against City when Fabinho headed home Salah’s corner at the near post – his first Liverpool goal – with Diamé slow to react. Alisson preserved his clean sheet with a fine late save from the debutant Sean Longstaff and Liverpool moved serenely on, and six points clear, at the Premier League summit."}, {"date": "26/12/2018", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74523, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diogo Dalot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [53]}, {"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fred", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [53]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [28], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64, 78], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [53], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [53], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Durm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Terence Kongolo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philip Billing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Elias Kachunga", "yellows": [23], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Mbenza", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juninho Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Collin Quaner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Stankovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Old Trafford, once again, felt like a contented place. Ole Gunnar Solskjær was wearing a sunrise of a smile. There was even an embrace from Fred the Red, Manchester United’s devil-horned mascot, before the team continued their immaculate start on Solskjær’s watch, and it is probably for the better that the current manager is nothing like as boastful as the previous one. If Solksjær were a different personality he might have pointed out he had taken as many points in five days as José Mourinho managed during his last 45 in the job.\n\nSolskjær is certainly entitled to feel pleased with himself after two second-half goals from a renascent Paul Pogba, to add to the one scored by Nemanja Matic in the opening period, gave United’s supporters the chance to go through their old songbook to pay homage to the man who has taken on the caretaker manager’s role for the rest of the season.\n\nManchester City lose again as Ricardo Pereira hits shock winner for Leicester Read more\n\nThe volume felt like it had been turned up a few notches since those difficult periods under Mourinho when visiting Old Trafford was such a strangely flat, often joyless, experience. Pogba, in particular, seems to be relishing the change of management. His goals were splendidly taken – a reminder why the club were more concerned about losing him, rather than Mourinho, in the power struggle between player and manager – and when he skimmed in a 25-yard shot to make it 3-0 all that was missing from his Cantona-esque goal celebration was the upturned collar.\n\nPlay Video 0:57 'It makes you proud': Solskjær reacts after winning start at Manchester United – video\n\nSolskjær has placed greater emphasis on width and penetration, with the full-backs Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw encouraged to “fly on”, but it is the change in Pogba’s demeanour that is most striking. “That’s the Paul I’ve known since he was in the reserves and youth team,” Solskjær said. “He has always been a happy boy, he has always had a big smile on his face and when you score a goal, or two, of course you are happy. When you play football for Man United you should be happy. Of course it’s a responsibility, but it’s also an honour and a privilege. Paul loves playing for this club. He’s a Man United boy through and through, a kid who knows what it means to play for Man United.”\n\nAt the same time it would be an exaggeration to say Solskjær has entirely transformed a team that is still 19 points off the top of the Premier League table. Not just yet, anyway. Huddersfield may not have won at Old Trafford since 1930 but a side mired in relegation danger had been difficult opponents for the opening hour. David Wagner’s team chased everything, frequently looked bright in possession and it was not until Pogba slotted in the second goal, after 64 minutes, that the home crowd could relax.\n\nLiverpool rout Newcastle with Fabinho supplying the icing on the cake Read more\n\nThree minutes earlier it had needed a brilliant piece of goalkeeping from David de Gea to prevent Laurent Depoitre equalising from a corner and that clawing, one-handed save was arguably the key moment of the afternoon. De Gea showed in that moment why Solskjær had awarded him the captaincy – “the defining moment, one of the best saves I’ve seen” Solskjær eulogised. But Huddersfield did eventually get a goal for their troubles, courtesy of Mathias Jørgensen’s 88th-minute header. It was only Huddersfield’s 12th league goal all season and they have now lost their last six games.\n\nTheir problems are typified by Jørgensen, a centre-half, now being their leading scorer with three goals and the Premier League’s bottom club will think back to a golden chance for Terence Kongolo, 10 minutes in, to open the scoring. His close-range shot went into the crowd and, at this level, Huddersfield were always likely to pay for that kind of wastefulness. “We were not clinical enough and we have not made use of our chances,” Wagner said. “Performance-wise we did not look like a side that is bottom of the league. Everybody knows what our problem is and this is that we are not clinical enough.”\n\nSure enough United took the lead in the 28th minute after Pogba’s free-kick had been deflected behind for a corner. Marcus Rashford’s delivery was whipped over from the left. Victor Lindelöf was the first to attack the cross and, though Christopher Schindler blocked the initial effort on the goalline, the ball fell conveniently for Matic to apply the final touch.\n\nSpurs go second as Son Heung-min helps thrash Bournemouth Read more\n\nUnited’s second goal was the culmination of an incisive move along the right involving the lively Rashford, Juan Mata and the substitute Ander Herrera and concluding with a crisp finish from Pogba to beat Jonas Lössl from 12 yards.\n\nHuddersfield kept pressing but Pogba’s next goal was even better and United could be satisfied overall even if Jørgensen’s header, from a free-kick, left Solskjær staring back, arms folded.\n\n“It was a great day that I’ll never forget” said the Norwegian. “Walking out, hearing the crowd singing my song – it was humbling and made me really proud.”"}, {"date": "26/12/2018", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 45154, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup":

Tottenham Hotspur were 5-0 up and cruising to a 12th victory in 14 league games when news came through that Manchester City were losing at Leicester. Spurs were now second and suddenly the majority of those in attendance had another reason to make their presence felt. It was a collective roar of delight and, underneath a murky sky, the sound of gathering belief that a club so often mocked for never winning anything really could land the title.\n\nNot that Mauricio Pochettino is getting carried away. He spoke of it being “too early to talk about us being contenders” given the season has only just reached its halfway stage. But what is for sure is that Spurs are in the mix – a point clear of the champions, six behind the leaders, Liverpool, and, arguably, looking as formidable as they ever have under their Argentinian manager.\n\nTottenham were not actually at their scintillating best here, while defensively they were made to look vulnerable on more than one occasion by Bournemouth. Indeed, had either Ryan Fraser or David Brooks taken the presentable chances that came their way early on the outcome might have been different. But they did not and after 16 minutes Tottenham took the lead through Christian Eriksen, a moment Eddie Howe admitted rocked his players mentally and from which the home side took control. They were 3-0 up by half-time thanks to further goals from Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura, and pulled further ahead after Harry Kane scored his seventh goal in six league appearances against Bournemouth. Son’s second on 70 minutes, a tap-in from close range, wrapped it up and made it 11 goals in two games for a team well and truly on the up.\n\n“We were very clinical and fully deserved this victory,” said Pochettino, “To show the energy we showed is fantastic. I am very pleased. We are in a very good direction this season.”\n\nThat much is undoubtedly true and what is particularly encouraging in regards to Tottenham’s pursuit of a first championship since 1961 is the contribution of the squad as a whole. Here there was no Kieran Trippier and Dele Alli from the side who hammered Everton 6-2 yet it made little difference as Kyle Walker-Peters and Lucas Moura came in for them and shone.\n\nWalker-Peters’ contribution was particularly eye-catching. In only his fourth appearance of the season, and first league start, the 21-year-old assisted the opening three goals. The first may have been a simple pass to Eriksen that teed up the Dane for a long-range shot that he converted via a deflection off Jefferson Lerma but the second and third were impressive: a quick interception after Charlie Daniels had made a mess of clearing Toby Alderweireld’s long pass that allowed Son to strike from the edge of the area followed by a perfectly weighted volleyed pass that let Lucas sweep a shot past Asmir Begovic from close-range. “[His performance did] not surprise me,” said Pochettino. “He has amazing qualities and in the future is going to be a very important player for Tottenham.”\n\nOthers in white and blue also impressed, including Moussa Sissoko and Harry Winks in the heart of the midfield, while from Son came a display that Pochettino called “amazing”. Two more goals from the South Korean, this time operating as a wide-left forward in a 4-2-3-1 formation, and a further reminder that the 26-year-old will be a big, potentially telling loss for Spurs on his departure to the United Arab Emirates next month for the Asia Cup.\n\nFor Bournemouth this was a fourth away league defeat in a row and, while they showed their usual poise and creativity in possession – and arguably should have been awarded a penalty after Juan Foyth collided with Callum Wilson early in the second-half – they were incredibly ragged at the back, seen most starkly in the manner with which Kane ran straight between Steve Cook and Nathan Ake to score. For Howe there was the added setback of Simon Francis having to be taken off on a stretcher in the first half with a knee injury that could be season-ending. “He’s gone for a scan and it doesn’t look good,” Howe added. “Our thoughts are with him and his family.”\n\nPaul Pogba seals happy homecoming for United’s Solskjær against Huddersfield Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christian Eriksen opened the scoring for Tottenham on a chastening afternoon for Bournemouth.

The Arsenal manager apologised but his side have become becalmed of late and the Spaniard will not need reminding of Tottenham’s contrasting vibrant form over the holiday period.\n\nLocadia, a Dutch forward who cost Brighton £14m, has not had the happiest of times at the club and this was his first goal of the season. Hughton was the more content manager, with Arsenal ending the evening 13 points adrift of Liverpool, whom they meet at Anfield on Saturday night. Brighton had to endure a torrid start and deserved their precious point.\n\n“I hope Jürgen can make progress now,” said Hughton. “He has had a difficult time but he is a very committed player and his goal couldn’t have come at a better time. In the end I was a bit disappointed we didn’t go on to win.”\n\nFor Brighton it was a bad time to lose the services of Lewis Dunk, their England central defender, who was banned as a result of his dismissal at Bournemouth on Saturday.\n\nDunk had scored one of Brighton’s goals in the 2-1 win over Arsène Wenger’s side here last season and he left a large hole in a defence facing the threat of Aubameyang, the Premier League’s top scorer.\n\nSpurs go second as Son Heung-min doubles up in rout of Bournemouth Read more\n\nThe Gabon striker was soon causing Brighton problems, his lob forcing Mat Ryan to turn the ball over the bar; moments later Brighton failed to clear the danger and Aubameyang found himself unmarked in the area. His finishing is as sharp as a tack at the moment and an angled first-time shot gave the stranded Australia goalkeeper no chance.\n\nGlenn Murray had returned to lead Brighton’s attack and midway through the first half gave the visitors’ defence a fright when he appeared to have beaten Bernd Leno to a low cross and turned the ball over the line; but he was ruled by Anthony Taylor to have fouled the goalkeeper. Murray continued to pose a danger with Leno forced to stretch to save a snap shot from the veteran striker.\n\nAubameyang continued to keep the makeshift Brighton defence honest, missing a chance at the other end before Brighton equalised out of the blue. Granit Xhaka’s corner was cleared and Davy Pröpper hit a hopeful ball downfield. Stephan Lichtsteiner headed the ball into the path of Locadia who had come from nowhere and beat Leno from near the penalty spot.\n\nAlex Iwobi replaced Mesut Özil after the break. The German, making his 200th appearance for a side he seems destined to be leaving soon, had shown some nice touches in the first half without really imposing himself on the game.\n\nBrighton 1-1 Arsenal: Premier League – reaction! Read more\n\nInstead it was Mattéo Guendouzi who was pulling most of the strings for Arsenal’s midfield. He had ended the first half in some pain and Martín Montoya was booked for a reckless challenge on the Frenchman.\n\nEmery said his early substitution of Özil tactical. The Spaniard said: “For the first 45 minutes we controlled the match but we didn’t create many chances after the break. It is difficult at the moment because we have a number of injuries but we are improving. The draw was not the best but it was not the worst.”\n\nPröpper had a chance on the hour as Brighton continued to look the most likely side to break the deadlock. Solly March, influential in Brighton’s midfield, had a better opportunity when he escaped the clutches of Xhaka but his shot did not trouble Leno.\n\nArsenal survived but they headed back up the A23 to London a relieved side. “I think they were there for the taking,” said Ryan."}, {"date": "26/12/2018", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20415, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup":

four after a few hours’ absence, their advantage over fifth-placed Arsenal extended to two points.\n\nThe Belgian scored his 100th goal for Chelsea in first-half stoppage time, set off on the path to his second century with a penalty in the 58th minute, and had his teammates’ finishing matched his own he might have had a hat-trick of assists as well. Hazard has now claimed three goals and set up five more in his last six league games and either scored or created 19 goals in the top flight this season, more than any other player.\n\nIt was Hazard who set up Willian for the game’s first clear chance in the 10th minute, the Brazilian running into the area and rounding Ben Foster but shooting against the outside of the post from an acute angle. Watford’s Christian Kabasele collided with the same post as he attempted to protect his goal, the Belgian swiftly substituted and ending the game undergoing tests in hospital.\n\nIn the 72nd minute Hazard set up Willian again with a pull-back from the left, the Brazilian this time controlling before spearing a shot narrowly wide of the far post, and seven minutes later his excellent return pass to Kante preceded another effort off target. But though Hazard was integral to his side’s finest moments he was sometimes guilty of floating around its fringes, and was also responsible for the most glaring of the night’s many misses when he allowed César Azpilicueta’s driven cross to pass through his legs as he attempted a clever flick when any kind of contact was likely to prove sufficient.\n\n“He’s a player with special quality, with speed, skilful and it’s difficult to stop him,” said Watford’s Javi Gracia. “Not only him, all of them are very good players and we needed to work constantly and be very disciplined.”\n\nLiverpool thump Newcastle with Fabinho supplying the icing on the cake Read more\n\nIt took until first-half stoppage time for the game to witness its first shot on target, whereupon two goals were scored in three minutes. First Étienne Capoue gave the ball away in midfield. Mateo Kovacic took control, played in Hazard and the Belgian rounded Foster before passing into the net. A minute later Watford might have equalised after Deeney’s header set up Abdoulaye Doucouré, who had already seen one effort blocked and another go high, for a shot this time saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga. From the corner José Holebas lifted the ball to the edge of the area and Roberto Pereyra rifled a volley into the corner of the net, the second time this season that a similar routine has led to a goal.\n\nThe start of the second half was Watford’s finest period of the game, but though they exerted a measure of control all they created was a penalty appeal, after David Luiz, who was repeatedly troubled by the Spaniard’s pace, forced Gerard Deulofeu to the ground in the 54th minute.\n\nFour minutes later Martin Atkinson was pointing to the spot at the other end, after Jorginho lifted an excellent pass over the defence and Foster, obviously deciding that having already been rounded twice he was not going to let it happen again, brought Hazard down. From the penalty spot Hazard sent him the wrong way once again.\n\nThis time Watford could not wrestle their way back into the game. Though Deeney shot high from Doucouré’’s low cross with 10 minutes remaining Chelsea seemed more likely to extend their lead than to lose it. Their final chance to do so came in stoppage time when Foster, having come up for a corner, attempted an outlandishly optimistic overhead kick from 20 yards and was then stranded upfield as the visitors worked the ball to N’Golo Kanté, whose reluctance to shoot from distance allowed the goalkeeper to sprint back.\n\nChelsea’s evening was sullied by apparently minor injuries both to Pedro and to his replacement, Callum Hudson-Odoi, taken off five minutes from the end, and by the reported return of racist chanting from some Chelsea fans. “I don’t want to generalise, because 99% of our fans are really very good, wonderful,” said Sarri. “Then in every community I think there are some stupids, and so all together we have to fight against the stupid people.”"}, {"date": "23/12/2018",

pitch and their joyous supporters made one off it. “He’s Tottenham, you know,” they sang of Mauricio Pochettino after humiliating Everton in their own back yard. Their coveted manager responded with a clenched-fist salute. Prospective job offers from Manchester United can wait. He may have a title challenge to consider first on this form.\n\nMauricio Pochettino says Tottenham can be title contenders Read more\n\nPochettino’s focused team were outstanding as they inflicted the heaviest defeat of Marco Silva’s Everton reign to move within two points of Manchester City in second. Their reaction to the distraction of Old Trafford, both here and at Arsenal in midweek, has been flawless. It could haul them into the title race should it continue. Son Heung-min and Harry Kane both scored twice and led a comprehensive crushing that saw Everton outclassed. Silva’s side are without a win in five matches and have collected one point fewer than at the same stage of last season. Spurs, by contrast, are looking upwards and constructing a case for their manager to resist the anticipated advances from Old Trafford next summer.\n\nIt was a forgotten memory by the time Kane guided the visitors’ sixth goal past the overworked and struggling Jordan Pickford that both teams initially contributed to an open and compelling contest. The sheer quality of Spurs’ attacking play was a fundamental difference throughout, however. Everton were prised apart frequently by the pace and intelligent movement of Son, occupied by the power and quality of Kane and had no answer to Dele Alli’s ability to wreak havoc in the space he found behind their central midfield. Another costly mistake from Pickford and the decision to disallow a Dominic Calvert-Lewin header added to the home side’s miserable afternoon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Theo Walcott (left) opened the scoring for Everton but it was a miserable afternoon for the Merseyside club. Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images\n\nThe visitors created three excellent openings before falling behind to Theo Walcott’s first Premier League goal since August. Gylfi Sigurdsson, who provided Everton’s brightest moments, released Calvert-Lewin clear of the Spurs defence with a delightful backheel. He picked out the former Arsenal winger, who revelled in his close-range finish past Hugo Lloris. Calvert-Lewin and Walcott combined again moments later for what Silva claimed was a key moment in the game. The England Under-21 forward guided a superb header into the top corner but was adjudged to have pushed Davinson Sánchez by the referee, Paul Tierney. Spurs took full advantage of the reprieve. The speed of their passing, of Son, and their commitment to attack, obliterated Everton’s lead and their defensive composure. That said, they were gifted the way back by Pickford and Zouma.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nA first-time ball over the top by Kane sent Son on a hopeful chase. Zouma had the danger covered but Pickford decided to race out of his area and succeeded only in spreading confusion. The pair collided and from a difficult angle, Son floated a delightful finish into the vacant net. The South Korea forward was a class apart all game. Evertonians even joined in with the applause when he was substituted late on.\n\nSpurs’ conquest showcases Pochettino’s prowess despite club parsimony Read more\n\nThe visitors’ gained the lead when neat, one-touch passing from Ben Davies, Moussa Sissoko and Alli released Son on the left. Pickford saved the striker’s low shot with a strong left hand but the ball fell invitingly for Alli to drill the rebound home. It was three before Everton could regroup at the interval. Son was again involved, winning a free-kick that Kieran Trippier whipped against Pickford’s left-hand post from 25 yards. The rebound fell Spurs’ way once more and Kane gratefully converted with the goalkeeper grounded.\n\nPickford was extremely fortunate to escape punishment for a rash challenge on Alli that led to his England teammate’s departure at half-time with a hamstring injury. Alli had been given offside when the keeper committed the foul.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dele Alli was on the end of an ugly tackle by Jordan Pickford just before half-time. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nChristian Eriksen swept a beautiful half-volley beyond Pickford within minutes of the restart, crushing any hope the home side entertained of a recovery. Trippier released Kane down the right, as in the first half, and though Séamus Coleman headed the striker’s cross clear he was powerless to stop the return from the Danish midfielder, a controlled, precise finish that flew into the bottom corner.\n\nSigurdsson reduced the deficit with a fine finish of his own, collecting a pass from Richarlison and evading four weak challenges in a mazy run across the area before cutting his shot back beyond Lloris. But there was never any prospect of an Everton recovery. Spurs claimed their fifth when Érik Lamela, Alli’s replacement, dissected the home defence with a piercing pass that sent Son clean through on goal while Everton appealed in vain for offside. The striker shot through the legs of Pickford and then delivered the assist for Kane’s second of the game with a low cross from the left.

But he popped up early with a glorious pass that helped to make Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s first goal and late on, too, with an assist for the substitute Alex Iwobi.\n\nÖzil, though, was merely a sideshow. In a disjointed game, it was the simmering bad blood and niggle that came to hold sway.\n\nThe Burnley striker Ashley Barnes was central to much of it. He had a running battle with Sokratis Papastathopoulos – in which both players were booked – and Aubameyang would say that he had “never played in a game as feisty”.\n\nIt was summed up at full-time when Emery appeared to want to make a point to his opposite number, Sean Dyche, and grabbed him by the arm. The Burnley manager shrugged himself free and marched off.\n\nArguments between the rival staffs would continue into the tunnel. As ever, Barnes appeared to run on rage and Burnley’s aggression, in general, was a problem for Arsenal. Meanwhile, Emery withdrew Alexandre Lacazette on 78 minutes and the striker was furious. There was a lot of that around.\n\nPlay Video 0:48 'It can't be right': Sean Dyche slams Arsenal 'diving' after defeat – video\n\nNot least from Dyche, who poured it all out in his post-match press conference, when he accused Arsenal of blatant cheating. He was incensed at what he felt were a series of dives from the home players and he mentioned Özil and Granit Xhaka as being among the culprits. Their tumbles did not come inside the Burnley area.\n\nDeeney and Deulofeu seal Watford win over West Ham and raise hopes of Europe Read more\n\nDyche was unhappy at Barnes’s booking – which did look harsh – arguing that Papastathopoulos had thrown an elbow while he pointed out that the Burnley defender Kevin Long ought to have had a penalty after he received a “double-handed push” in the area from Sead Kolasinac. On the other hand, Barnes did appear to get away with a stamp on Mattéo Guendouzi.\n\nAubameyang put Arsenal in charge with his second goal at the beginning of the second half and he now has 12 in the Premier League this season; 14 in all competitions. But Burnley made life difficult and when Barnes pulled a goal back after a penalty-area scramble, the visitors sensed a precious point.\n\nEnter Özil. He drove into the area on a counterattack, jinked inside and caught a break when his pass deflected and broke for Iwobi. The finish was true. Arsenal had lost last Sunday at Southampton and again to Spurs in midweek. From their perspective, this was more like it. Burnley have lost eight of 10 in the Premier League.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alex Iwobi celebrates Arsenal’s third goal with Mesut Özil.

The connection was not clean but the direction was perfect.\n\nArsenal had flickered at the outset with Joe Hart denying Ainsley Maitland-Niles and James Tarkowski scrambling clear before Mohamed Elneny saw a header blocked. For Burnley, Ashley Westwood could not finish when one-on-one, after a Nacho Monreal mistake.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nArsenal’s second came after it looked as though Özil had put his team in trouble with a loose ball on the edge of his area.

But not for the first time this season, the young Wales international rose above the fray here to end Bournemouth’s poor run of form.\n\nBrooks scored a striking individual goal in each half, the first a precise long-range effort, the second a most unlikely arcing header, to give Bournemouth their second win in eight league matches.\n\nFor Brighton, there was some consolation in a well-drilled performance but they were undermined by one defensive error and a red card for Lewis Dunk.\n\nAubameyang double gets Arsenal back on winning track against Burnley Read more\n\n“He’s certainly ahead of schedule”, was the way Eddie Howe described Brooks, his summer signing from Sheffield United. “We knew we were getting a very technical, intelligent player but perhaps we didn’t know how good he would be for the team. He buys into the team ethic and the tactical side he has grasped very, very quickly. So far he has also been able to handle the Premier League and not get carried away.”\n\nBrooks cost Bournemouth £11m when he joined in the summer, with Howe speculating that the price would have been much higher – and Brooks likely coveted by bigger clubs – had he not had his second half of last season blighted by glandular fever.\n\nWhatever the might-have-beens, Brooks is now a key component in the Bournemouth side, able to link play under pressure and find space among compact opponents. He also has five goals for them and all have had the imprimatur of quality about them.\n\nHis first goal came out of nothing. Receiving the ball 15 yards outside the Brighton box, the 21-year-old looked to have only limited options in front of him. But while the Brighton defenders waited for a through ball, Brooks checked dismissively inside his marker Davy Pröpper and, before anyone could adjust, hit a left foot shot across goal and beyond goalkeeper Mat Ryan.\n\nThe second was even better than the first. It came from a Ryan Fraser cross and the Scot landed his delivery right on the edge of the six‑yard box. But Brooks turned a good ball into an exceptional goal, running in front of the cross and – with his back to goal – flicking a header over Leon Balogun and inside the far post.\n\nFor large parts of the game Brighton looked the part as one of the Premier League’s new middle class. They had their chances in a strong first-half performance, notably from Yves Bissouma and Dunk, but they sank after their captain was sent off with 20 minutes to go for a second yellow card.\n\n“I was really pleased with the performance, especially in the first half and it was very difficult to come in at half-time 1-0 down”, said Chris Hughton. “But that’s the game. It’s about making sure you take your chances, because if you don’t you’re playing against a talented team who will test you.\n\n“Our query with the sending off is with the first yellow card. Lewis gets booked [for a foul on Brooks] but it’s Bissouma who makes the first contact. It’s incredibly hard on Lewis. That’s our grievance at the moment.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Brooks fires on goal.

Leicester City had not won here since back in 2000 but, by checking Chelsea’s recent surge of optimism, his position suddenly feels assured heading into Christmas. The Frenchman might find that a rather unfamiliar sensation.\n\nThis was such a timely triumph, a display that allied commitment and defensive discipline with industry and real threat on the counterattack. It was almost a throwback to better times, though, in truth, City have hardly looked a side on the slide this season. They are restored to the top half, and even the non-selection of Jamie Vardy for the League Cup quarter-final defeat to Manchester City – and that only on penalties – in midweek appears less of an issue now given the striker, fit after recent groin trouble, sprung forward to plunder the only goal of this game.\n\n“I have nothing to justify,” said Puel, around whom the familiar criticisms over playing style and training intensity have swirled. “I try always to do my best to get the right balance to protect some players, get the best out of others and put a team on the pitch with the ability to win the game. If we’d won at Crystal Palace last weekend, we’d have been seventh in the table. We lost and were 12th, it’s just so tight. But our performance against City was very encouraging and, if Chelsea did not respond today, that is down to my players.” It was certainly not the display of a team whose faith in his methods had withered.\n\nLeicester’s willingness to scrap and compete would claim the day. The midfield unit was abrasive and industrious, Ben Chilwell was a force of nature down the left, and the backline heaved to thwart Chelsea’s attempts at revival. When Eden Hazard threatened to wriggle through, five City players swarmed round him to choke his dribble on the edge of the six-yard area. “We pressed them, defended well and created chances,” said Chilwell. “The result builds confidence. We know we have a brilliant squad, we know how good we are.”\n\nIn contrast, Chelsea are still finding themselves. A first home defeat of his tenure confirmed what Maurizio Sarri must have suspected: that his team remain a work in progress, even if the panic that set in once they had slipped behind disturbed the head coach. “The reaction was, for me, strange,” said Sarri. “Not in the right direction. Not as a team. But as 11 different players. So it was really very strange. I think we could have done better in the reaction. We had only to continue to play as [we had] in the first part of the match. There was time to score without a reaction as a team shocked, a team in mental confusion.”\n\nChelsea struck the woodwork twice, and both Hazard and Marcos Alonso might concede they should have scored having glided unchecked into space, but were otherwise rather lacking in punch. The experiment of utilising Hazard as a false No 9 backfired this time, and they craved more of a focal point to that front line. Maybe this will intensify efforts in next month’s window to conjure some firepower. There have already been talks with Juventus and Milan over Gonzalo Higuaín, the Argentina forward who has already worked under Sarri and is on loan at San Siro from the Turin club. That arrangement could potentially be cancelled, with the Rossoneri apparently open to the idea of taking Álvaro Morata for the rest of the campaign.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Luiz bites the net in frustration after missing a chance to score. Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images\n\nA certain amount of wheeling and dealing will be required but, on occasions such as this, even Sarri must crave a striker such as Vardy to shift a contest’s momentum. For all Chelsea’s monopoly of the ball, it would take fine saves from Kepa Arrizabalaga to deny Wilfred Ndidi and Marc Albrighton but, in between, Vardy had made his decisive intervention. The goal owed much to Ricardo Pereira’s muscular burst forward and James Maddison’s composure, the playmaker capitalising on Antonio Rüdiger’s slip to prod Vardy into space, with his finish thumped inside Kepa’s post. The goalkeeper had been left flat-footed and hopelessly exposed. He deserved better. Chelsea, probably, did not.\n\nAndros Townsend wonder goal helps Crystal Palace stun Manchester City Read more"}, {"date": "22/12/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 22384,

Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images via Reuters\n\nObafemi became Southampton’s youngest ever Premier League goalscorer and might have had a hat-trick in the 25 minutes he was on the pitch. “His speed gives us a little bit more opportunity,” said Hasenhüttl. “He had two or three more chances. I’m happy for him. He’s a cool guy, he has quality and I think after his injury coming back with the goal is perfect for him.”\n\nDavid Brooks’s double seals win for Bournemouth over 10-man Brighton Read more\n\nThe emotions were very different for Huddersfield, who are four points off safety after a fifth consecutive defeat. Philip Billing gave them hope by pulling a goal back in the 58th minute but, just when it looked like they might salvage something, a mistake from the captain, Christopher Schindler, led to Southampton’s third.\n\nDavid Wagner said: “The frustration today is more about our first-half performance because I think the first half was the worst in a long period that we played.”\n\nRedmond opened the scoring in the 15th minute with a fierce strike and Ings scored his eighth of the season from the penalty spot, after a trip by Mathias Jørgensen, three minutes before half-time. Billing scored only Huddersfield’s fourth home goal in the league before Schindler, who tried to turn out of trouble in his own area, was robbed by Redmond and the wide man set up Obafemi to slide the

"report": "Liverpool have the Christmas present they were looking for after Manchester City surprisingly fell to their second league defeat in three games. Jürgen Klopp and his players can now enter the festive period four points clear of the defending champions at the top of the Premier League. While one point separated the frontrunners City could look forward to rectifying the situation when Liverpool come here in the new year; now there might be little they can do if their unbeaten rivals maintain their impressive run of results.\n\nPep Guardiola bemoans Kyle Walker gifting Crystal Palace key penalty Read more\n\nCity were unrecognisable for large parts of the game and not just because key players were injured or rested. They were unimaginative going forward and sloppy in defence, with Kyle Walker having a game he will want to forget. That is to take nothing away from Crystal Palace, who were organised and effective at both ends and thoroughly deserving of three important points.\n\n“When we score three goals away from home I think we can say we deserved it,” the Palace captain Luka Milivojevic said. “Andros Townsend’s goal was amazing.”\n\nCity’s captain, Fabian Delph, accepted his side had not been at their best. “Palace were stubborn and organised but we started too slowly,” he said. “The ball was not zipping about.”\n\nThat was certainly true, for the shock of the season took a while to get going, even if a late City goal ensured a dramatic finale. The first half-hour was a test of patience. Palace were content to keep men back, challenging the home side to find a way through, while City’s efforts to make their wealth of possession count were hampered by their being without the spark of ingenuity that David Silva or Kevin De Bruyne would normally supply.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Townsend lets fly from long range to beat Ederson. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIt was one of those tepid encounters that needed a goal, though after City finally supplied one after 27 minutes the script took a wholly unexpected twist. Not only did Palace hit back almost straight away, within nine minutes of going behind they were in the lead after Andros Townsend beat Ederson with a delightful left-foot volley from 20 yards out.\n\nFirst things first though. City would not have seen any of that coming when Ilkay Gündoğan strode through a static defence to reach Delph’s cross and beat Vicente Guaita with a firm header. The midfielder ended up unopposed on the six-yard line but had remained onside – the Palace defenders simply failed to pick up his run.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dejection for Ederson and City. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe visitors’ only serious threat by that stage had come after six minutes, when John Stones took on a little too much in attempting to justify his selection in midfield and almost presented Wilfried Zaha with an opportunity after being caught in possession in his own half.\n\nCity could have done with Stones to help out in defence when Palace equalised six minutes after Gündoğan’s goal. Zaha got the better of Aymeric Laporte on the right, then as the ball was transferred across the edge of the area Jeffrey Schlupp found room to get round Walker and make space for a shot past Ederson.\n\nBefore City had a chance to reply they were suddenly behind and again there were questions to be asked of the defence. A free-kick into the area was not properly cleared and after two weak headers in succession from Gündoğan and Bernardo Silva the ball reached Townsend just outside the area. The winger returned it with a spectacular volley into Ederson’s top-left corner.\n\n“It sat up perfectly,” the scorer said. “I knew I couldn’t take a touch as City would have been on me and away on the counter.”\n\nDeeney and Deulofeu seal Watford win over West Ham and raise hopes of Europe Read more\n\nPep Guardiola’s response was to send on Sergio Agüero early in the second half, not for the ineffective Gabriel Jesus as might have been expected, but for Nicolás Otamendi. That meant Stones was back in his usual position just in time to see Palace extend their lead.\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka took on the defence down the right and from his cutback Townsend was unlucky to see his header strike a post. Walker was overzealous in trying to clear the rebound, jumping in to a tackle and catching Max Meyer in the area, allowing the reliable Milivojevic to score emphatically from the spot.\n\nThat prompted De Bruyne’s arrival on a rescue mission for the final half-hour, with Riyad Mahrez following him on to the pitch a few minutes later.\n\nUntil the closing stages the nearest City came to a fightback was a Leroy Sané free-kick that struck an upright, though when De Bruyne beat Guaita five minutes from time with a dipping shot that looked suspiciously like a cross, the crowd woke up to encourage their side to retrieve at least a point.\n\nThe best chance of City’s final push came in stoppage-time when what was definitely a De Bruyne cross found Jesus on the six-yard line, only for the Brazilian to head over.\n\nOne heroic block by James Tomkins to deny Gündoğan later, Palace had their victory and a sorry week for Manchester managers was complete."}, {"date": "22/12/2018",

was duly granted as, for the first time in the Premier League this season, Fulham’s defence kept things pristine.\n\nYet as the final whistle blew and he embraced his old friend Rafael Benítez, disappointment appeared Ranieri’s over-riding emotion. When his unexpected deployment of three centre halves very nearly paid dividends, Ranieri was left wondering whether Fulham’s shout for a late handball as Aleksandar Mitrovic’s shot struck Jamaal Lascelles’s arm should have been listened to.\n\n“It’s very important to have a clean sheet,” said the Italian, whose side remain bottom. “I don’t know if it was a handball against us but we created more chances than Newcastle.”\n\nBenítez seemed more downbeat. “We have to win these sorts of games,” he said after his players were booed off. “The fans want more but we have to realise we will be in the bottom half of the table all season. If we go higher, it will be a miracle.”\n\nWith Fulham’s wing-backs helping sever Newcastle’s supply line to Salomón Rondón, the visitors were well protected by that five man security blanket, with the goalkeeper, Sergio Rico, receiving only rare scares. His most notable fright arrived after Ki Sung-yueng’s free-kick was met by Lascelles, who directed a powerful angled header across the face of goal. After taking a deflection off Mitrovic – sold to Fulham for £22m by Benítez last summer – the ball seemed set to swerve into the net before Denis Odoi hacked it off the line.\n\nMitrovic – deemed to lack sufficient mobility by Benítez – assumed centre stage and, after nearly capitalising on a rare concentration lapse by Martin Dubravka by dispossessing the keeper, appealed in vain for the aforementioned penalty shout.\n\n“It was disappointing for 85 minutes,” said Benítez. “But a relief we did not lose in the final five minutes.”\n\nDanny Ings spot-on for Hasenhüttl as Southampton sink

elapsed since Watford embarked on their one and only campaign in Uefa competition but maybe it is time to start talking about the prospect of another one. Goals by Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu gave Javi Gracia’s team a deserved victory here against a club who came into this season with lofty hopes but now find themselves below the accomplished Hertfordshire side, as do many others.\n\nWest Ham also had to deal with more off-field woes, as home supporters in a section of the ground complained of being hurt by falling glass from a broken bulb in a floodlight. The club said they were not aware of the incident.\n\nOf the events on the pitch Manuel Pellegrini said West Ham deserved at least a draw, and it is true that Michail Antonio twice headed against the frame of the goal. Yet Gracia had good cause to claim he was “never scared about the result” because overall his team were the more coherent and they, too, created several chances to score more than two goals.\n\nDanny Ings spot-on for Hasenhüttl as Southampton sink Huddersfield Read more\n\nGracia was a youth-team coach at Villarreal nearly a decade ago when Pellegrini was the main man at the Spanish club but here the managers arrived as the closest of peers, their teams starting the day on the same number of points and virtually identical records. Watford went on to suggest they are the more upwardly mobile.\n\nThat might have been different if Javier Hernández had scored in the third minute after a cross by Antonio but he was foiled by an excellent tackle by Christian Kabasele. That was the first sign of the ordeal that lay ahead for the Mexico striker, who fluffed two more chances in the second half before a hamstring problem forced his substitution.\n\nOnce West Ham’s initial vibrancy subsided, Watford emerged as the more authoritative team. Fabián Balbuena saved the home side on three occasions, making critical blocks to deny Deeney, Roberto Pereyra and Deulofeu.\n\nAubameyang double gets Arsenal back on winning track against Burnley Read more\n\nThe slick combination between Pereyra and Deulofeu was a recurring feature of Watford’s attacks and eventually undid the hosts in the 28th minute. This time Balbuena’s intervention was ill‑timed, his tackle on Pereyra giving Watford a penalty and injuring his own knee.\n\nDeeney ignored barracking from the home fans to thrash the spot-kick into the net. Then he ran over to celebrate in front of those fans, hitting a corner flag out of its hole as he went. The referee chided the player. Someone should have a word with the West Ham fans, too, to remind them that ridiculing Deeney tends to be counterproductive: two years ago at this ground, after Watford recovered from two goals down to beat West Ham 4-2, the striker said the comeback had been motivated by the sense that West Ham were trying to “mug us off”.\n\nAntonio tried to lead a West Ham comeback here with a ferocious long-range shot that Ben Foster batted away. But that was a rare opening as Watford defended solidly and threatened to increase their lead on the counter.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWest Ham worked up a storm early in the second half but precision still eluded them. Antonio was unfortunate not to equalise, his header from a Snodgrass corner bouncing out off the post.\n\nWatford kept looking for a second goal on the break. Lukasz Fabianski had trouble repelling a shot by Pereyra after a lovely pass by Abdoulaye Doucouré, the goalkeeper thankful the rebound fell just behind Deeney. Moments later Doucouré was foiled by a magnificent save by Fabianksi, who pushed the midfielder’s blast from 10 yards over the bar.

It was the 90th minute, the game had in effect been over for more than half an hour, but when Jesse Lingard rolled the ball into an empty net, after gliding around Neil Etheridge, the Cardiff goalkeeper, the significance of the scoreline was lost on nobody. This was the first time that United have scored five goals in the Premier League since Sir Alex Ferguson’s last game in charge.\n\nNot a bad way, in other words, for Ole Gunnar Solskjær to get his reign as temporary manager up and running as United rediscovered their swagger of old with a victory that was every bit as convincing as the result suggests. Freeflowing, re-energised and liberated, United swept Cardiff aside with ruthless efficiency on a night when the Norwegian’s name was sung loud and clear throughout the game.\n\nSolskjær brings back Manchester United’s swagger – and Paul Pogba | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nIt was startling to see the transformation in United’s attacking play at times and, perhaps more than anything, the way in which confidence returned to a group of players who looked unrecognisable from the team that has toiled under José Mourinho for so much of this season.\n\nPaul Pogba, who was restored to the starting lineup, had a hand in three goals. Lingard scored twice, Anthony Martial finished off a lovely one-touch move, Ander Herrera got his name on the scoresheet and Marcus Rashford registered the first goal of the Solskjær era with only 183 seconds on the clock.\n\nSolskjær could not have wished for a better start in that respect and even when Victor Camarasa converted a penalty to halve the deficit, there was never really any danger that United were going to loosen their grip on the game. “The attitude of the players was fantastic,” Solskjær said. “To get the focus and perform as well as they did impressed me.”\n\nCardiff, it has to be said, were obliging opponents. Neil Warnock described their defending as “Sunday League” and from United’s point of view it will take a lot more than a victory over a relegation-threatened team to provide evidence that the club are back on track. At the same time it was easy to understand the scenes at the final whistle, when Solskjær and the United players gathered in front of the jubilant travelling supporters to celebrate what felt like a landmark win.\n\nAs well as being dominant in possession and putting together some lovely attacking moves, particularly in the lead up to Martial’s goal, it was noticeable how Solskjær’s players snapped into tackles and matched Cardiff physically. “One of the things I talked about today was that a Man United team should never be outworked,” Solskjær said. “If you run more than them, then your skills will give you a chance to win the game.”\n\nPlay Video 0:57 'It makes you proud': Solskjær reacts after winning start at Manchester United – video\n\nSolskjær, who spent nine largely forgettable months in charge of Cardiff in 2014, was booed on arrival as he stepped off the United team bus but it was the away fans who were making all the noise as soon as the match started, fuelled by the sight of a club legend in the dugout and their team scoring twice inside the opening half an hour.\n\nRashford was about 25 yards out when he struck the free-kick that swerved and dipped before finding the net, leaving Etheridge rooted to the spot. Warnock was deeply unimpressed with that goal, presumably because of the way in which Harry Arter and Callum Paterson parted to leave a huge space for Rashford to strike the ball in between.\n\nUnited’s second was laced with good fortune as Herrera, receiving a square pass from Pogba about 30 yards out, accepted the invitation to shoot as space opened up invitingly in front of him. The Spaniard’s rising right-foot effort took a significant deflection off Greg Cunningham and the ball looped into the top corner.\n\nMauricio Pochettino’s big dilemma: United job his if he wants it | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nCardiff had not managed a shot on target at that point but that changed when Rashford was penalised for handball. The United striker was bitterly unhappy with the decision, claiming he controlled the ball with a combination of his chest and shoulder, but Camarasa emphatically dispatched his penalty kick and suddenly it was a game on. Or so we thought.\n\nWithin three minutes United had doubled their advantage again with a goal of the highest quality. In a blur of one-touch passing and fluid movement, Martial, Pogba and Lingard carved Cardiff open. Martial finished what he started, coolly placing a low shot past Etheridge and United were in total control once again. “It was exhilarating to watch and as long as they keep that standard up we’ll pick up points,” Solskjær said.\n\nLingard then added the fourth via a penalty, after Sol Bamba was adjudged to have tripped him, before going on to complete the rout when he ran on to Pogba’s measured pass.\n\nWarnock was probably right when he implied that Cardiff were their own worst enemies at times but he still found a positive. “If you’d told me at the start of the season that we’d be out of the bottom three at Christmas, I’d have snatched your hand off,” he said."}, {"date": "21/12/2018", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 31358, "home_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers",

The good news is that the team in that position in eight of the previous nine seasons has gone on to win the league. The bad news is that Liverpool, back in 2013-14, were the one club to come up short.\n\nNot that this Liverpool team is likely to be burdened by the past. Jürgen Klopp has assembled a formidable side and victories such as this one will do nothing to dampen the belief that Liverpool are authentic title challengers and capable of stretching Manchester City in a way that would have been unthinkable for anyone last season.\n\nJürgen Klopp praises Liverpool’s maturity after victory at Wolves Read more\n\nLiverpool have now recorded seven successive top-flight games, their unbeaten Premier League run stretches to 19 matches, and when Klopp spoke afterwards about possibly needing as many as 105 points to win the title, it did not seem outlandish to imagine his team finishing the season with that sort of haul.\n\nMohamed Salah is the Premier League’s top scorer once again, after taking his tally for the season to 11 with an exquisite goal, and the Egyptian also set up Liverpool’s second. Virgil van Dijk, with his first goal for the club since he scored on his debut against Everton in the FA Cup, converted Salah’s cross and it was particularly impressive to see the way in which Liverpool closed the game down thereafter.\n\nKlopp used the word “mature” to describe Liverpool’s performance and that captured it perfectly. They had a slightly difficult period towards the end of the first half, when Wolves started to take control of the game for the first time, but otherwise this was a highly professional Liverpool display, with Van Dijk’s commanding presence at the heart of the defence every bit as impressive as Salah’s beautiful touches at the other end of the pitch.\n\nWolves have proved to be awkward opponents this season, beating Chelsea and taking points off both Manchester clubs as well as Arsenal, yet their hopes of recording a first victory over Liverpool at Molineux since 1981, when Mark Lawrenson and Bruce Grobbelaar were making their debuts, looked slim from the moment that Salah opened the scoring.\n\nThe goal was simple enough in its construction – Fabinho played a one-two with Sadio Mané on the right flank – but it was exquisitely finished by Salah. He was standing almost sideways on when he nonchalantly flicked Fabinho’s cross beyond Rui Patricio with the outside of his left boot from about eight yards.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Virgil van Dijk scores Liverpool’s second goal. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nFrom Wolves’ point of view it was a disappointing goal to concede. Up until that point they had soaked up plenty of Liverpool possession without being cut open.\n\nRuben Neves, however, switched off and failed to track Fabinho on the edge of his own penalty area, enabling the midfielder to run in behind unopposed. Fabinho’s centre was perfect and what followed was a moment of class from Salah.\n\nThe goal felt a little harsh on Wolves, who had carried the greater attacking threat in the early stages, even if Liverpool were seeing much more of the ball. Adama Traoré saw one shot saved and dragged another wide, and Alisson denied Romain Saiss following a lovely Wolves move that saw Conor Coady release Matt Doherty with a raking diagonal pass.\n\nSalah’s goal four minutes later could easily have discouraged Wolves but, to their credit, the home team continued to attack with conviction. Allison kept out Jonny Castro’s effort, following a neat exchange between Saiss and Traoré, and Doherty had claims for a penalty turned down when his sinuous run into the Liverpool area was brought to a halt by James Milner.\n\nWolves v Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAs much as Wolves were playing well, chasing a game against this Liverpool team is far from ideal and it was no real surprise when the visitors extended their lead midway through the second half. By that point Liverpool were looking more and more comfortable. Jordan Henderson, who was making his 300th Liverpool appearance, and Fabinho were dictating the game from their deep-lying midfield positions – this was the first time the two have started together – and Wolves’ attacking threat had diminished.\n\nVan Dijk had the measure of Traore – the Dutchman even managed to match the forward for pace in a fascinating duel close to the touchline just after the hour mark – and Nuno Espírito Santo, the Wolves manager, found himself in that difficult position whereby he needed to make changes to try to force an equaliser but knew that by doing so there was a danger Liverpool would add a second.\n\nThat is exactly what happened. Adam Lallana, on for the injured Naby Keita, saw his close-range effort blocked after Salah and Mané combined, and Liverpool profited from the corner that followed. Saiss’s clearance dropped for Salah, who was loitering on the edge of the area, and his perfectly flighted cross picked out Van Dijk, who coolly volleyed home from just inside the six-yard box.

The Belgian has grown used to taping on the ice packs in the dugout, and would rip the joint free once the final whistle had blown, but at least he could be warmed by the knowledge he had inflicted wounds of his own on the opposition.\n\nThis had been Hazard at his mesmeric best, one of those displays where defenders seem hypnotised by his skill and shrink at his every involvement, the ball seemingly glued to his instep as he scuttles at pace through massed ranks of markers. The first tackle tends to leave him hobbling these days but, like a footballing Gordon Greenidge, he is at his most dangerous when the limp is established and the adrenaline is flowing. For an hour Brighton & Hove Albion had no answer. It was to their credit that they rallied late-on to make the closing stages so uncomfortable for Chelsea after what had initially threatened to be a saunter.\n\nAlbion’s belated aggression came close to delivering parity, but they could not quite retrieve the two-goal deficit that Hazard had effectively established. There had already been an early assist to force Chelsea ahead, but the Belgium captain will have taken particular satisfaction from a first goal since early October, for all that his first reward for 12 matches came courtesy of Brighton’s generosity. Leon Balogun, in for the suspended Shane Duffy, scuffed a pass from the halfway line straight to Willian just after the half-hour, the Brazilian merely easing the ball forward for Hazard to charge unchecked into vacant territory.\n\nHis finish was dispatched crisply inside Mat Ryan’s near post, with the goalkeeper’s weight instinctively tipping the other way in anticipation of a shot towards the far corner. If Hazard is unhappy as a central striker, a role he was reluctant to play for Antonio Conte, then he is doing himself no favours with his recent productivity. “He could be very important in this position,” said Maurizio Sarri, aware that Hazard has been directly involved in the majority of his team’s league goals this season. “He’s very able to come out and play with his teammates, very able to create spaces. Now he has to improve attacking the box.”\n\nHazard’s charge through the defensive line inside Albion’s penalty area had already thrust Chelsea ahead, a weighted diagonal pass eventually presenting Pedro with a tap-in at the far post after a period of prolonged possession to leave Brighton utterly panicked. Sarri had tripped over a rack of energy drinks loitering in his technical area in the build-up to that goal, his gaze fixed upon Hazard wriggling into space. By the time he had recovered his dignity, his team were ahead.\n\nNot that the Italian would depart this fixture entirely satisfied. Marcos Alonso would belt a shot against the woodwork, but Chelsea retain the ability to wilt from a position of apparently complete authority. It had cost them at Wolves this month. Such was the ferocity of Brighton’s late revival, the home side bolstered by Solly March’s close-range finish from Bernardo’s nod down, that this might have been a repeat had Hazard not established slightly more leeway than at Molineux.\n\nAlonso might have been dismissed after hauling back March after Yves Bissouma’s through-ball, albeit the pass appeared to be running well away from the winger. David Luiz was also guilty of a petulant flick of a boot which caught Florin Andone. “When we have the feeling of being in full control of the match, we are dangerous for ourselves,” offered Sarri. “Suddenly, the level of application and attention is lowered. I think [their goal was] the first situation in our box for 30 minutes. But the feeling when we are in confidence, when we are sure of being in control of the match, is dangerous for us.”\n\nThat will have to be addressed. Brighton could cling to that late revival, despite their frustration that the first hour had been uncharacteristically tentative and sloppy. It was as if the home side were still scarred from the 4‑0 drubbing they had endured here to these opponents last term, for ever braced to be sliced open by a fluid front three.\n\nA physically imposing team who had lost only once in 10 top-flight home games seemed to shrink in this company, diminished by the speed and incision of their opponents’ passing. And yet the last half-hour, when Andone injected pace and aggression into their display, offered a hint of what might have been.\n\n“The first goal knocked the confidence out of us and the second was avoidable,” said their manager, Chris Hughton. “All you can do is ask the boys to respond at half-time and at least we finished with a good response. We can take something from that.”\n\nHow Fifa's clampdown on loan deals may affect Premier League clubs Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pedro celebrates after scoring Chelsea’s first goal.

Southampton’s home has been a despondent place since the last time they won three points here, back in April, but at the final whistle of this pulsating victory over Arsenal they could be happy again. More tangibly this was their first Premier League win since 1 September and hauls them out of the relegation zone with the new manager Ralph Hasenhüttl’s influence clearly evident in a vibrant display capped by Charlie Austin’s winner five minutes from time.\n\nFree beers for fans … three cheers for Southampton, says Hasenhüttl Read more\n\nFor Arsenal, while they might not cry themselves to sleep at a first defeat of any description since August, a worsening defensive injury crisis may be more concerning. But the odd fact that they are yet to lead a Premier League game at half-time finally bit them here, in a performance that was curiously slack, without much of the dynamism and determination their opponents displayed.\n\nFrom a neutral perspective two goals from Danny Ings was the most heartening aspect: two horrible knee injuries sustained at Liverpool curtailed his career there but at Southampton he looks reborn. “I don’t want to pick one player out – all the team was very good and very committed,” said Hasenhüttl. “But he was very intense and invested a lot and, when you invest a lot, you earn a lot.”\n\nHis goals here mean he has six from 11 games in a side who have been broadly wretched all season: against Arsenal he showed what he could do with some decent service, heading home from a couple of perfect crosses after taking advantage of Arsenal’s bodged-together backline, at the heart of which was Laurent Koscielny.\n\nIt feels harsh to criticise Koscielny too much, given the Frenchman started with only 72 minutes of first-team football to his name since the achilles injury suffered against Atlético Madrid last season. It feels even harsher after the short film Arsenal put together about his recovery, displaying the ultimate mixed emotions as he watched France win the World Cup without him.\n\nWere it not for injuries and suspensions elsewhere, Koscielny surely would not have started but his rustiness was exposed after losing track of Ings twice in the first half. For the first he and Granit Xhaka – playing at centre-back and proving that no matter how frustrating he may be in midfield, it is better than having him in defence – allowed Ings to have a free header and for the second it was the third man in this makeshift back three, Stephan Lichtsteiner, who failed to cover the Liverpool loanee. Both times Ings punished the lapses with superb headers, one powerful and one high and looping.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nArsenal equalised twice through Henrikh Mkhitaryan, one terrific, one scrappy. The first came after a fine exchange between Alex Iwobi and Nacho Monreal allowed the Armenian to guide a header perfectly into the bottom corner; the second was extremely fortunate after his shot took a heavy deflection past a despairing Alex McCarthy.\n\nAfter that, with Alexandre Lacazette introduced to join Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang up front, it felt almost inevitable that Arsenal would go on to win. But they struggled to create chances and Mesut Özil’s arrival off the bench did not exactly give them the required spark: the German can be an easy target but he played here as if his feet were weighed down by sacks of sand.\n\nÖzil was not the man most to blame for Arsenal’s defeat, though. That makeshift defence, a half-fit Koscielny flanked by the full-back Lichtsteiner and midfielder Xhaka, performed roughly as one might have expected. The backline could become a significant concern for Unai Emery: Héctor Bellerín was forced off at half-time with a calf problem and Lichtsteiner was withdrawn after a kick to his shins.\n\nSouthampton 3-2 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe immediate problem is who will play at the back against Tottenham in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final but beyond that there may have to be some movement in the January transfer window, although Emery did not seem particularly optimistic. “Maybe we can think of something but it’s not good for transfers in January,” he said.\n\nAustin’s winner came five minutes from the end, as Bernd Leno misjudged a Shane Long cross and allowed it to drift to the back post. Austin was there to head into an unguarded net, and those inside St Mary’s felt something unusual: joy, relief, exhilaration, certainly one of the lesser-spotted positive emotions.\n\nAt the final whistle Hasenhüttl charged on to the pitch in celebration, briefly forgetting managerial protocol, but he can be forgiven for that. “It was very emotional. I have to apologise I didn’t shake Emery’s hand but I had to run to my guys. We deserved to win today.” If this sort of performance becomes the rule rather than an exception for Southampton, there could be plenty more of that."}, {"date": "16/12/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 52908, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson Ramses Becker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Naby Keita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73, 80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rafael Camacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diogo Dalot", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Maybe it was appropriate that José Mourinho and his players stayed at a hotel named after the Titanic. Fill in your own jokes here. Or consider, perhaps, the gloating cries of “Don’t sack Mourinho”, heavy on irony, from Liverpool’s supporters on the day Jürgen Klopp’s team seized back control of a title race where their arch-rivals are barely even an afterthought.\n\nFor all the historic rivalry of this fixture it is the other team from along the East Lancs Road that should be uppermost in Liverpool’s thoughts now. Liverpool versus Manchester City is what matters. And United? They are just a memory. Mourinho’s team have conceded more goals in mid-December than they did throughout the whole of last season. They are 19 points off the top and one statistic in particular stood out: 36 shots for Liverpool, their most in any league fixture for two years. It could be years before United are title challengers again and, for a club with their ambitions, who could be surprised if the manager pays the price with his job? At any of his previous clubs it would probably have happened already.\n\nLiverpool v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nOne certainty: Liverpool will enjoy rubbernecking in United’s direction. The league leaders were fortunate in one respect, that Xherdan Shaqiri’s second-half goals both took deflections before beating David de Gea in United’s goal.\n\nOverall, however, who could say they were lucky given the balance of play, the long spells when they pinned their opponents back and the clear suspicion that, but for a dreadful mistake from Alisson, Liverpool’s goalkeeper, it would have been an even more straightforward victory?\n\nLiverpool were winning 1-0, courtesy of Sadio Mané, before Alisson’s faux pas allowed Jesse Lingard to steal in for an equaliser that changed the complexion of the game. At 1-1 there was a considerable period when Liverpool looked unusually short of ideas. But it was an adventurous move from Klopp to replace Naby Keïta with Shaqiri in the 70th minute. The substitute scored twice within 10 minutes and Mourinho had to spend the remainder of the game listening to the crowd’s schadenfreude, with Ed Woodward, Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Alex Ferguson watching on from the stands. It is the worst points total for United at this stage of a season for 26 years – worse than anything that happened under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal.\n\nPlay Video 1:57 'Just perfect': Jürgen Klopp celebrates Liverpool's victory over Manchester United – video\n\nIf one is going to be generous, the issue was not whether Mourinho’s players were trying their hardest. The problem boiled down to something else: an imbalance of talent. Pep Guardiola made this point when City visited Anfield earlier in the season: Liverpool can swamp opponents when the game is this frenetic. And, for United, it was a dizzying blur at times, particularly in those frantic early exchanges when there was barely time to analyse some of the incidents. The saves from De Gea, the penalty-box pinball, the goal-line clearance from Ashley Young, the shots that flew left, right and high of the United goal.\n\nAfter 19 minutes there had been 10 scoring attempts, nine for Liverpool. De Gea could be seen pleading with his team-mates to calm down. But the visiting players were rushing their passes, falling into the trap, making it the game Liverpool wanted it to be and, five minutes later, the pass Fabinho clipped into the penalty area was weighted beautifully to find Mané. Young had let him go and Mané took his goal with such expertise, controlling the ball on his chest and volleying a left-foot shot past De Gea, it felt barely conceivable to remember all those chances he passed up in Liverpool’s previous game against Napoli.\n\nIf Liverpool had kept a clean sheet, they would have established a record for the 17-game mark of the Premier League era. Instead Alisson contrived to present Lingard with an equaliser wrapped in red ribbon. The goalkeeper had both hands on the ball when he went down to collect Romelu Lukaku’s waist-high cross. What he could not do was get a firm grip of it and suddenly the ball had squirted free. Lingard was sliding in. The ball was scuffed into the net and the nearest defender, Virgil van Dijk, was doubled over in shock, both hands covering his face.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nIt took a while for Liverpool to shake their heads clear and for 20 minutes in the second half there was a hint of desperation to their play, with Nathaniel Clyne, then Dejan Lovren and Van Dijk all taking aim from long distance. Again Klopp’s team were pushing their opponents back but their decision-making was erratic and it was difficult to get through all the congestion in United’s penalty area. At one point Mohamed Salah even miscued a corner and a huge sigh reverberated off the Kop.\n\nShaqiri’s arrival added another penetrative player to Liverpool’s attack and that was decisive. His first goal skimmed in off Young, via the underside of the crossbar, after Mané had beaten Ander Herrera to create the danger. Shaqiri’s next one flicked off Eric Bailly to fly past De Gea from just outside the penalty area and, amid all the drama, a penny for Paul Pogba’s thoughts? Once again there was no place for Pogba in Mourinho’s line-up and, when United needed some inspiration, their World Cup winner remained on the bench.\n\nIt finished with Klopp pumping his fists on the pitch, United 11 points off the top four and Mourinho sounding increasingly desperate. Liverpool, holding off the champions at the top of the table, can forget United now and that, more than anything, shows the different directions in which these clubs are travelling."}, {"date":

City achieved this by retaining the relentlessness that steamrollers most opponents and that finally wore down their visitors’ resistance.\n\nManchester City’s Pep Guardiola praises Raheem Sterling’s calmness Read more\n\nThis was among City’s more impressive displays this season following the defeat at Chelsea and the 2-1 victory over Hoffenheim in midweek that meant they won their Champions League group but had only two days to prepare.\n\nCity were again without Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Agüero in their starting lineup, though both were back in the match-day squad after injury and the former made a 15-minute appearance as a second-half substitute.\n\nGuardiola said: “It was a tricky game, a dangerous game after the CL with less than three days’ recovery. It was something in our minds that we were going to suffer in this game.”\n\nIn all he made four changes. Out went Raheem Sterling, John Stones, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Phil Foden. In came Fabian Delph, Riyad Mahrez, Fernandinho and Kyle Walker. For Everton Idrissa Gueye and Theo Walcott made way for Kurt Zouma and Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nThe temperature was close to zero yet the football contained some heat. Everton gave an early warning when Calvert-Lewin got behind the defence and shot, though he was ruled offside. City’s riposte was a slide-rule Ilkay Gündogan ball that set Leroy Sané racing in behind. With Gabriel Jesus available in the area the German turned inside and lost control.\n\nManchester City 3-1 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAfter a sweet Jesus turn that had Zouma scrambling and just about recovering Sané was in again. This time Fernandinho had the vision but Sané’s touch was faulty once more.\n\nWalker was the next City man to commit an error and it was nearly costly. The right-back dawdled and Lucas Digne turned pickpocket. The left wing-back lobbed in the ball but Richarlison lost composure. Further Everton thrust came from a Bernard breakaway along the left flank: the attack came to nothing but did provoke a concerned Guardiola to leave his seat for the technical area.\n\nCity ratcheted up the pressure, which led eventually to Jesus’s opener. Fernandinho’s chipped ball had Mahrez driving past Digne, causing him to foul the Algerian, for which he was booked. The subsequent free-kick went to Delph but his 20-yard shot was always rising.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gabriel Jesus plants his header past Jordan Pickford for his and City’s second goal.

Offering the champions presents is folly, whether or not it is yuletide. Yet Everton did exactly this when Yerry Mina hoofed the ball from near his goalline straight to Gündogan. The German’s pass went instantly to Sané, his in turn went to Jesus and the Brazilian beat Jordan Pickford from a tight angle to break a four-month drought in the league.\n\nAt this juncture Everton refused to go under despite the light blue wave that advanced relentlessly. A rare foray by the visitors was halted by some classic Fernandinho midfield-general play that turned the ball over and defence into attack; when City needed to fight and become more rudimentary they could and would. Without the Pickford acrobatics that saved a Mahrez rocket of a volley from close in Everton would have entered the break 2-0 behind.\n\nFootball should not carry the can for society’s ills – but can help to remedy them | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nInstead they began the second half still in the contest. Almost inevitably, though, City were the aggressors as Jesus and Sané got in along the left, the ball was turned back to Fernandinho though his pot-shot was off-target.\n\nPlay Video 0:41 'I admire him': Pep Guardiola on Raheem Sterling – video\n\nThey doubled the lead with a goal beautiful in its simplicity as Sané dinked a cross from the left and Jesus’s header gave Pickford scant chance. This turned Everton’s challenge from molehill to mountain and Marco Silva brought on Walcott and Ademola Lookman for Bernard and Coleman. As City’s second was again aided by a defensive problem – no one got in Jesus’s face – whether fielding two fresh attackers could salvage the game remained to be seen.\n\nMore defensive laxity seemed to give the answer as Gündogan played a one-two with Mahrez and had time to take aim at Pickford’s goal. He missed and, when comedy City defending by Nicolás Otamendi gave the ball to Digne, Everton pounced. In came the cross and Calvert-Lewin headed past Ederson. If this suggested the match was back on, the sense lasted only moments. Sterling had replaced Sané and after interplay between Jesus and Fernandinho the latter crossed and Sterling headed home his ninth league goal of the season.\n\nDe Bruyne came on for Mahrez to make a first appearance since 1 November and there was also time for a contretemps between Ederson and Mina.

Crystal Palace, after 14 consecutive defeats across two seasons in Premier League matches played without their star player in the starting line-up, have finally won.\n\nIt was not pretty but Roy Hodgson did not care on a day that marked the end of relentless speculation that his team are incapable of prevailing without Wilfried Zaha.\n\nA stunning Luka Milivojevic first-half strike lit up an often scrappy game on a filthy afternoon in south London.\n\nAs well-timed as it was well-struck, the goal came just as Leicester were beginning to take control. “It’s quite nice to put that one to bed,” the Palace manager said of the Zaha statistic. “It’s something that’s got people writing and talking more about it than we have been.”\n\nChristian Eriksen’s late strike gives Tottenham win over Burnley Read more\n\nBoth managers had rung the changes after defeats last weekend. With Zaha and James Tomkins sitting this one out on the naughty step, Jordan Ayew and Martin Kelly were asked to step up by Hodgson. Kelly was outstanding alongside Mamadou Sakho but Ayew was abject. In goal Vicente Guaita made his first Premier League start for the club in place of Wayne Hennessey, absent with a back spasm.\n\nThe Spaniard had an early scare when Jamie Vardy barged him off the ball and poked into an unguarded net, only to be adjudged to have illegally shouldered the goalkeeper in the back. For Leicester Christian Fuchs got a rare start at full-back in the absence of the injured Ben Chilwell while Vardy and Harry Maguire were welcomed back from the treatment room.\n\nThe winning goal came out of nowhere. Andros Townsend, with the ball at his feet near the right touchline six minutes before the break, played it inside to Milivojevic. Surveying his options, the Palace captain set himself up with a touch or two before sending a rasping 25-yard drive curling away from the Leicester goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nSalomón Rondon seals precious points for Newcastle at Huddersfield Read more\n\nAn otherwise dire first half had begun in conditions so foul even Kayla, the Crystal Palace eagle, dug in her talons and refused to perform more than one of her traditional pre-match swoops, choosing instead to sit in the rain looking as she would rather be anywhere else.\n\nAs a game extremely low on quality approached half-time, the rest of those present felt her pain. Most perked up immeasurably when the outstanding Milivojevic struck.\n\n“It was a goal worthy of winning any game, which you’ve got to be pleased about,” said Hodgson.\n\nIt was a good job Milivojevic scored, as Zaha’s replacement could scarcely have been more ineffectual. Ayew has endured a difficult time at Palace since arriving as a summer loan signing from Swansea, a club whose fans could not wait to see the back of him. Yet to score in 13 appearances for his new club, he was bullied by Leicester’s captain, Wes Morgan, and missed a glorious chance to open his account in the second half.\n\nWith Leicester trailing, Claude Puel had sent on Rachid Ghezzal after the interval, removing the curiously ineffectual James Maddison on grounds he described as tactical. The midfielder’s card had already been marked when he found himself on the receiving end of an uncharacteristically angry volley of abuse from his manager for carelessness in possession. His replacement prompted further frustration when sending a gilt-edged chance fizzing just the wrong side of the upright.\n\nThe pick of Leicester’s chances, however, went to Vardy and his expression on failing to convert it was one of total disbelief.\n\nHaving narrowly avoided embarrassment at the striker’s hands in the first half, Guaita got down low to his right and pushed a clever, curling, goal-bound flick on to the post before gratefully clutching the fortuitous rebound.\n\n“Vicente was thrown in at the last minute and didn’t have much time to prepare,” said Hodgson. “I thought he played very well.” His save was the stand-out moment of a tense second half, which concluded with a roof-raising roar."}, {"date": "15/12/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance":

Then Löwe was given a chance to score himself; Billing won the ball in midfield before threading a deft one through to Alex Pritchard, who picked him out at the edge of the area.

Fabian Schär forced a good save from Jonas Lössl after being picked out from the first.

Christian Atsu nearly profited from errant defending in the 51st minute, pouncing on a loose ball in the area before being denied by Lössl. Huddersfield’s reprieve was short‑lived.\n\nWithin four minutes the hosts were undone.

For 90 minutes, it was the sort of grim afternoon that might lead everyone to question their life choices, the 0-0 scoreline to that point even less interesting than it might sound.\n\nTottenham are a different team when Eriksen is on the pitch: mostly that is for his invention and the way he seems to gently control games as if he is a delicate marionette operator, but this time it was his finishing. The Dane was brought on as a substitute to conjure something for a sluggish Spurs side, which he did just as second-half injury-time began, sweeping home his late winner and causing several Burnley players to sink to the turf. Cruel old game, football.\n\nRaheem Sterling finishes off Everton to put Manchester City on top Read more\n\nSean Dyche said that Burnley had been “done by a lump down the pitch”; a little uncharitable, perhaps, because one man’s lump is another’s controlled long pass, but it is true that his side had frustrated Tottenham with a 5-4-1 system and tactics you might call pragmatic.\n\n“We limited them, by their standards,” said Dyche. “They had to work incredibly hard to get something.”\n\nThis is exactly the sort of game where it is smart to park the bus, against a tired team with bigger things on their mind and with a crowd already frustrated at having to show up at their rented home again, months after they thought they would be shot of the place.\n\nAt the moment Tottenham feel like one of those couples on Grand Designs who have to live in a caravan while their ambitious, self-sufficient eco-home with a £10,000 bath is dogged by delays. Admittedly, Wembley is an expensive and very well-appointed caravan, but the point is nobody wants to be here, the novelty wore off some time ago and everyone is grumpy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joe Hart saves from Érik Lamela as Burnley threatened to derail Spurs’ pursuit of the top two. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nBut while not many of the 41,645 in attendance will have enjoyed most of their afternoon, Mauricio Pochettino was delighted. “We know very well you need to play 90 minutes plus. I’m so happy because we played much better than the opponent. It would have been a frustrating afternoon if we hadn’t got the three points. For us, it was about having patience. The character and mentality of the team was amazing, to keep pushing. It was a massive effort to finish the week in that way.”\n\nWith those games either side of this one in mind, Pochettino made five changes, including giving the 18-year-old midfielder Oliver Skipp his full debut. “Fantastic. Fantastic,” Pochettino said about the youngster, who at first glance looks like the mid-point between Eric Dier and Harry Winks. “He played like a 30-year-old man. I said to him ‘You look so relaxed.’ That’s the difference between someone who’s going to be a top player against someone who was a normal player like me.”\n\nRaúl Jiménez puts Wolves on their way as Bournemouth struggle again Read more\n\nPerhaps because of the changes, perhaps because they have bigger fish to fry, Spurs lacked their usual intensity, looking like a team who just wanted to get this game out of the way; understandable perhaps, given the fixtures it came between, a little like asking someone to get excited about the tap water that arrives after the lobster and before the steak.\n\nThey struggled to make chances and squandered the ones they did create before Eriksen’s winner, most notably from Son Heung-min and Dele Alli in the closing stages, as that frustration almost graduated to desperation.\n\nThe Recap: sign up for a roundup of the best of our coverage.\n\nBut then arrived Eriksen, right at the end, scoring from a Harry Kane pass after the referee had waved play on following a foul on Alli. Eriksen saved Tottenham’s Champions League campaign with a late goal against Inter and while it might be a bit much to say this one has saved their title challenge, it at least keeps them in touch with Liverpool and Manchester City.\n\n“We are in a very good position,” said Pochettino, celebrating his 100th Premier League win. “That is the reality: after 17 games, we have 39 points and are third in the table. It’s a massive achievement for us – we are there, we are close.\n\n“Look at what happened in the Champions League. After three games we had only one point – nobody believed, but we believed it was possible. The most important thing in football is belief and faith and if you give 100% all can happen.”"}, {"date": "15/12/2018", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20032, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [52], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Domingos Quina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ken Sema", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Masina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefano Okaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sol Bamba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Aron Gunnarsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Callum Paterson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Lee Peltier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kenneth Zohore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Smithies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [82], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Mendez-Laing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kadeem Harris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was a good win for Watford. Such was the harum-scarum nature of the closing stages, however, that a moment’s reflection was needed in order to be sure. After dominating possession and storming to a 3-0 lead with some sumptuous goals, they almost threw it away in the last 10 minutes. The final moments saw the hosts clinging on to the result, keeping the ball by the corner flag.\n\nThe time-wasting made Neil Warnock chuckle afterwards and once again his Cardiff side had rattled loftier opponents. Junior Hoilett and Bobby Reid both scored in the last 10 minutes to make the result close but even the Cardiff manager had to admit it was closer than it should have been. “We thought we would try and contain them and then have a go in the last half-hour,” he said. “But you don’t legislate for losing two or three goals by that point.”\n\nRaúl Jiménez puts Wolves on their way as Bournemouth struggle again Read more\n\nThose goals were quite something too. The first was scored by Gerard Deulofeu who gave the kind of performance that reminded one La Masia is in his blood. Picking up the ball midway through the Cardiff half he moved gracefully into the area before dribbling past two Cardiff defenders and simply passing the ball into the net. In the second half José Holebas and Domingos Quina scored matching long-range strikes, each curled beyond the impressive Neil Etheridge.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Domingos Quina steers the ball past Neil Etheridge for Watford’s third goal. Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images\n\nWatford’s Javi Gracia was inclined to look on the positive side. It was the Spaniard’s first league win since signing an extended contract. At a club with a reputation for managerial churn, this was in itself an unusual act. But the quality of Watford’s performance – especially at a technical level – gave a sense of why the Pozzo family may be confident the club are going in the right direction.\n\n“First of all we are very pleased with result,” Gracia said. “We have played many games recently where we didn’t get the reward we deserved. So a victory is very important. But we can analyse the game knowing we have played well. At 70 minutes we had scored three goals and their keeper had been amazing. Then, in the last part of the game, they have scored two goals. But in the end we had the control of the game.”\n\nSalomón Rondon seals precious points for Newcastle at Huddersfield Read more\n\nGracia has used Deulofeu only sparingly since converting his loan into a permanent move last summer and there is a suggestion he does not trust his forward to deliver in pressured situations. After an important cameo against Everton Deulofeu delivered here but his manager was still reluctant to pay him personal tribute. “We thought today it would be very important to attack Cardiff’s tight spaces and we needed his mobility, one touch and move. In my opinion, though, more important was our reaction we had when we lost the ball.”\n\nAnother standout performer, alongside the ever reliable Abdoulaye Doucoré, was Quina, who became the club’s youngest ever goalscorer at 19 years and 27 days. The Portuguese youth international was once coveted by Chelsea and then poached from West Ham. His passing was precise and his awareness of play notable but it was his curled finish from 20 yards that really raised eyebrows.\n\n“We did something in training this week trying to finish with more precision,” Gracia said. “We tried to improve. But I don’t know if that’s why we ended up scoring two goals like this.”\n\nCardiff’s wait for an away win goes on and they have still taken only a solitary point away from the Cardiff Stadium. Warnock attempted to build up a rant about the referee Andy Madley, making only his second appearance in the Premier League, calling him a “Sunday trainee” while Andre Marriner sat as the fourth official, but his heart was not in it.\n\n“It’ll be the best result of the season if and when it comes,” Warnock said of an away win. “We’ve just got to be a little more positive in some areas, a little less tentative. That said I’d take losing away if we won every game at home.”"}, {"date": "15/12/2018", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 30997, "home_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name":

Fulham’s previous bustle had been extinguished.\n\nAs Declan Rice strolled through midfield the home team were accepting of their fate. Anderson had a chance to score the goal his performance deserved but his header was weak.\n\nWith four wins from their last four matches, the club’s best run since February 2014, Pellegrini has his team playing something along the mythical lines of the “West Ham Way”. They are scoring goals and also likely to concede at any moment even if they did see out this London derby with a clean sheet collected with efficiency.\n\nLuka Milivojevic’s magic lifts Roy Hodgson as Palace edge Leicester Read more\n\nAfter the painful austerity under Slaven Bilic and David Moyes last season the away fans’ audible enjoyment suggested a club happy in its own company. That has rarely been the case since they moved to the London Stadium in the summer of 2016.\n\nThe noisy contingent from east London even sang their manager’s name for the first time, which Pellegrini said he was “very happy” to hear. “When we started the season so bad I never felt any negative reaction,” he said, in reference to West Ham losing their first four matches. “We know last season was not easy so I think they deserve this.”\n\nThey ended the day just two points off sixth-placed Manchester United. And in Anderson the Hammers may have a new hero in the club’s classic mould; his brilliance cannot always be counted on but he is a player capable of a hot streak. Pellegrini spoke of Anderson delivering “four or five decisive performances” before then preaching characteristic caution.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“It was important for him to learn what the Premier League is,” said the Chilean. “And Felipe still needs to improve a little.” With Marko Arnautovic absent until the new year, and Andriy Yarmolenko out longer still, a considerable burden has fallen on Anderson but he appears capable of shouldering it.\n\nRanieri has no such luxury.

It was in their grasp until stoppage time, deservedly so, only for Lucas Digne to produce an antidote for Silva and Everton’s self-inflicted suffering.\n\nEverton’s form has plummeted since they handed Liverpool victory in the 96th minute of the recent Merseyside derby. This time the 96th minute brought relief as Digne swept an exquisite free-kick into Ben Foster’s top corner following a careless handball by Christian Kabasele. Relief was fleeting as far as the Everton manager was concerned. His team led through Richarlison, the man who followed him from Vicarage Road to Goodison Park in the summer for £40m, and were punished for two lapses in concentration that produced an own goal from Seamus Coleman, plus what seemed an emphatic winner from Abdoulaye Doucouré.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson also failed to convert from the penalty spot before the France full-back Digne came to the rescue with his first goal in English football. Everton’s performance, however, in keeping with last week’s home draw against Newcastle, gave Silva cause for concern.\n\nEverton 2-2 Watford: Premier League – live reaction! Read more\n\n“Forget the derby, it is already past,” the Everton manager reacted. “That game is finished and we had to prove our quality in the next games.” They did not. “I agree with you,” he added. “We could not put our quality on the pitch in the second half. We gave them the chance to play long balls to Troy Deeney and prepare for second balls and we lost completely our focus and conceded the two goals. We gave them the chance to change the score.”\n\nJavi Gracia was also left aggrieved, although the Watford manager’s annoyance centred on the referee, Kevin Friend, and not his players’ efforts to record a first win in six matches. Theo Walcott was clearly offside in the buildup to Richarlison’s opener but the goal was allowed to stand despite vociferous protests from the visitors. “I prefer not to say anything about the referees,” Gracia said. “But it was offside. If VAR was ready today the result would have been different. I’m very proud of my players.”\n\nRicharlison scored five goals in his first 13 outings for Watford last season but none in the 28 games that followed or under Gracia. “At the end I told him that was the first goal I saw him score because he didn’t get one for me!” he said. The Brazil international claimed his eighth of the season when sweeping the hosts into an early, polished yet controversial lead.\n\nThere was no disputing the quality of the move that put Everton ahead. Walcott, making his 300th Premier League appearance, Coleman and André Gomes combined to breach the visitors’ defence. The Portugal international exchanged touches with Walcott before delivering an inch-perfect ball for Richarlison to convert at close range. But Walcott was offside when he received Gomes’s pass. Watford, their dispute over an alleged “unwarranted approach” for Silva unresolved, had another grievance with Everton.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up for our daily football email.\n\nThe hosts were initially bright in attack with Bernard and Sigurdsson bringing finesse and vision. The pair almost combined to create a second for Richarlison but Craig Cathcart made a crucial intervention. The defender also denied Sigurdsson, and Yerry Mina was booked for deliberate handball from Sigurdsson’s inviting cross. Mina flirted with a second yellow when he took Isaac Success and the ball as the forward broke in search of an equaliser. Enough of the ball in Friend’s view, to the obvious disgust of Success and Gracia. He would find consolation in his team’s dominant start to the second half.\n\nThe visitors’ strength, pace and movement – combined with a careless and chaotic restart by the hosts – turned the contest in their favour. Silva raged at his players from the sidelines but the lead evaporated before the Everton manager could implement change. Roberto Pereyra, Doucouré and Deeney went close before the equaliser arrived fortuitously but not without merit. A slip by Digne invited the former Evertonian Gerard Deulofeu to release Kiko Femenia down the left. His first-time cross was steered on to a post by Pereyra but, just as Watford thought their luck was out, the rebound struck Coleman on the thigh and rolled into an empty net.\n\nWatford were ahead two minutes later thanks to another raid down their right. As Everton dawdled over a free-kick Gracia’s team reacted sharply with Femenia playing Pereyra into space. The Argentinian delivered a deep cross to the back post where Doucouré rose above Coleman and sent a textbook header past Pickford. Chaos continued when Kabasele needlessly fouled Mina in the area but Sigurdsson’s spot-kick was saved by the trailing leg of Ben Foster. Victory beckoned but then Kabasele erred again.

the dismissal of DeAndre Yedlin, Newcastle held out with defiance and some composure and were 80 seconds away from earning a spirited and deserved point, when suddenly it felt like a sinkhole had opened up at St James’ Park.\n\nAyoze Pérez had the ball around 70 yards from his own goal. The tiring striker, who had endured a topsy-turvy afternoon that included a fine headed equaliser and a stray Willy Boly elbow to his face, lost possession.\n\nThe ball was ferried swiftly to the old gold shirt of Diogo Jota. Jota, too, had been involved all day, scoring the opener after 17 minutes with a cushioned volley and then being pulled down for Yedlin’s card.\n\nNewcastle United 1-2 Wolves: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nNow he raced from the halfway line and must have expected to be challenged before he reached the Newcastle penalty box. That was not the case, however, as Newcastle’s retreating defence kept back-pedalling.\n\nIt meant that Jota was about 10 yards out when he produced a rising shot. Martin Dubravka, not for the first time, saved it. But Dubravka’s parry had the ball in the air invitingly for anyone rushing in. Matt Doherty was that man.\n\nThe Irishman had scored the winner at Crystal Palace in October but this was much, much later. All Doherty had to do was make sure he hit the target. With a nod of the head, he did.\n\nAs Newcastle collapsed, the Wolves bench erupted. This has been a big week for Nuno Espírito Santo. After six games without a win, Wolves have beaten Chelsea and Newcastle in five days and are into the Premier League top 10 with 22 points.\n\nIt is a tally at this stage of the season which means Wolves can start planning for another year in the top flight.\n\nFor Newcastle, though, this was a second home defeat in eight days and while there is a measure of optimism surrounding Mike Ashley’s sale of the club, it is far from certain. Anticipation has not yet replaced hesitation on Tyneside. The planned supporter boycott of this televised game may have been postponed but, with seven losses at home, the issue will return if no progress on a sale is seen. Ashley was not here.\n\nA raging Rafa Benítez did not wish to discuss the home record. He was still seething with the referee, Mike Dean, and on two counts. Benítez could barely contain himself on the touchline when Yedlin was shown a straight red card for dragging down Jota 20 yards from goal. Dean deemed the covering Jamaal Lascelles far enough from Jota for it to be a goalscoring opportunity.\n\n“When you have a player in the corner of the box, with the ball two or three metres away, he was pulling DeAndre and DeAndre was pulling him, and Lascelles was close enough,” Benítez said. “I cannot believe that every time he would put the ball in the top corner and it’s a clear chance to score, I cannot believe that. It’s very difficult to explain to our fans, when the team is fighting for survival.”\n\nThat was the first injustice felt by Newcastle. The second came on 81 minutes when Pérez and Boly jumped for the ball in the Wolves area. Boly’s elbow caught Pérez who fell to the floor in a heap.\n\n“I saw the replay and we need VAR, right now,” Benitez said. “Imagine how I feel now. You can see the two incidents in the video – it was unbelievable. It was an elbow in the face, he was bleeding. It was so obvious.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest DeAndre Yedlin is dismissed by referee Mike Dean. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\nPérez was equally angry and, in a bizarre turn, said Dean had told him the ball had caused the bleeding, not an elbow. Not only did Dean not punish Boly, play went on with Pérez grounded. There was one of several menacing breakaways and this one climaxed with a neat dummy by the substitute Morgan Gibbs-White, a Doherty shot and a Dubravka save.\n\nNuno did not dispute the latter, saying it was a “clear elbow” from Boly. He did not think it intentional though. On the subject of the Yedlin red card, Nuno did not think Lascelles would have been quick enough to stop Jota, so then it was up to Dean.\n\nThe Wolves manager was being diplomatic, saluting Newcastle’s endeavour and Benítez’s coaching. But then Nuno could afford to be magnanimous. “The performance was not one of the best,” he said.

Even a cynical and crude attempt from Cook to bring Salah down, in the lead-up to the second goal, failed. “We struggled to handle him,” Eddie Howe said. “He’s one of the best in the world in my opinion.”\n\nJürgen Klopp agreed when the Bournemouth manager’s comments were put to him. “Whatever you do in a game, you need somebody to finish it off,” Liverpool’s manager said. “What Mo did around his two goals in the second half was just exceptional. I don’t know a lot of players who would have scored those two goals. The first one is a foul [on him] but he wants to score the goal so stays on his feet. His third goal is outstanding again.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Salah goes around Asmir Begovic to complete his hat-trick. Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\nFrom Liverpool’s point of view this was the best possible preparation for Tuesday’s critical Champions League tie against Napoli at Anfield. They racked up a fifth successive Premier League victory, came through the game without picking up any fresh injuries, replaced Manchester City at the top of the table, and their talisman turned in his best performance of the campaign. “The scoresheet was perfect,” Klopp added.\n\nTwo years ago Liverpool came here and led 2-0 only to be beaten 4-3 in a chaotic game, yet history never looked like repeating itself after Salah scored his second. Howe admitted that goal “seemed to knock the stuffing out of us” and he also acknowledged that this Liverpool side are a totally different proposition.\n\nCook’s difficult day started with that second goal. He gifted possession to Firmino with a loose pass and was fortunate not to be booked for crudely trying to bring down Salah seconds later. Salah just about managed to stay on his feet before accepting the invitation to shoot across Begovic as Aké kept backing off.\n\nDavid Luiz seals win as Chelsea end Manchester City’s unbeaten start Read more\n\nHowe was disappointed with the opening goal for different reasons. Begovic spilt Firmino’s 25-yard shot and Salah, on to the loose ball in a flash, was clearly offside. The assistant referee kept his flag down, however, and Bournemouth found themselves chasing the game. “I thought the first goal had a massive bearing on the game,” Howe said. “Up until that moment I thought we were OK.”\n\nThe absence of Callum Wilson, who was ruled out with a hamstring injury, clearly hurt Bournemouth, yet they were also their own worst enemies at the back. The sight of Cook turning Andrew Robertson’s cross into his own net was a case in point and the defender’s ordeal did not end there. Desperately trying to keep up with Salah, Cook tried to make a sliding invention but succeeded only in knocking the ball into the path of the forward. What followed was a joy to watch as Salah, almost single-handedly taking on the Bournemouth defence, applied the coup de grâce with his third and Liverpool’s fourth."}, {"date": "08/12/2018", "arena":

"Arsenal were able to inhale the sweet taste of a late victory thanks to the inspirational force of Lucas Torreira. The waspish presence who has breathed such effervescence into Arsenal’s midfield was the difference to break a tight, tense deadlock with an improvised overhead kick.\n\nHuddersfield’s unrelenting efforts meant Arsenal needed to extend themselves, to persevere, to keep plugging away to prise all three points out of this game. That kind of attitude seems to come naturally to Torreira.\n\n“We want to break every expectation with players and he is improving and works every day with good commitment and behaviour,” Unai Emery said. “He has the hunger we need. He can do very good work in defensive moments and he can get into the box and score.”\n\nThe last time these teams met was an occasion that marked the curtain coming down on the Arsène Wenger era and Emery has proved himself a man unafraid to reshape the team as he did again here, and eager to recharge the energy levels. At the end of a demanding week his players found enough to scrap it out. In the seven minutes of stoppage time he was so engrossed as to wander all the way across into David Wagner’s technical area to beckon Sead Kolasinac over for a quick instruction.\n\nJames Tarkowski’s scrappy winner gives Burnley the edge over Brighton Read more\n\nHuddersfield, like all of Arsenal’s Premier League opponents this season, got themselves safely to half-time. But a 0-0 scoreline did not reflect the nature of an increasingly feisty and complicated game, with tempers heating up and the yellow-card count veering out of control – five dished out over a five-minute spell set an intense tone. Huddersfield competed diligently, rising to the challenge set by Wagner to prove they could restrict Arsenal and give themselves a platform.\n\nThere were chances, including a piledriver from Torreira that was parried brilliantly by Jonas Lössl and when Alexandre Lacazette found the net he was aghast to be penalised for a tight offside decision earlier in the move.\n\nFelipe Anderson wonder-goal seals West Ham comeback over Crystal Palace Read more\n\nEmery wasted no time in shaking it up. While his instinct was to push for the breakthrough, there were growing concerns at the back. Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi picked up their fifth bookings of the season and will serve a suspension at a time when the squad are very short of fit and match-sharp centre-backs. Mustafi then hobbled off injured with what Emery described as a “small” hamstring injury.\n\nLaurent Koscielny’s appearance on the bench after a seven-month absence was timely but Arsenal have to use him cautiously after such a bad injury so Nacho Monreal came on instead. The defensive trio for the closing stages comprised Granit Xhaka flanked by Monreal (nominally a left-back) and Papastathopoulos. Remarkably, they held it together for a first clean sheet in the Premier League since September.\n\nHuddersfield contributed wholeheartedly, even if they missed some cutting edge. Alex Pritchard scooped one effort over and later on appealed in vain for a penalty. Arsenal’s increasing desperation showed as Mattéo Guendouzi was booked for diving (a third for simulation in the game). The teenager was more productive in the 83rd minute, prising Huddersfield open with a well-crafted ball for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Gabonese found room to chip over a cross and Torreira was there to deliver another big moment for his new club.\n\nWagner felt his team deserved something. “Because of defensive shift and effort and tactical quality we limited Arsenal and kept them away from our goal. That’s enough if you are Huddersfield Town to deserve a point,” he said. “Unfortunately we don’t have it. I can see the positives.”\n\nNow 21 games unbeaten for Arsenal, on they go. “The injuries and yellow cards are coming with matches,” Emery said. He will need to keep shuffling to find solutions. Having bustled around all game long, he is looking forward to a couple of days off to clear his busy head."}, {"date": "08/12/2018", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 18497, "home_team": {"name":

home victory against Brighton.\n\nThe goal came in the 40th minute when Jack Cork hit a shot and the ball went in off James Tarkowski’s chest. Having survived Brighton’s pressure in the second half to secure what was only their third league win of the season, the home side moved up from second-bottom to 17th in the table.\n\nFelipe Anderson wonder-goal seals West Ham comeback over Crystal Palace Read more\n\nDyche, whose side had lost six of their previous eight games, said: “I think it’s been a tough early period of the season. We are kind of getting back to where I think we should be performance-wise, but then you’ve got to turn performances into results. I think we’ve actually played better than we did today but the basics were done very well.\n\n“The quality of the shape, the importance of the details, the resilience that the side showed many times – those features are coming back into the side, and I’ve always said that gives you a base to work from. We still know we can play better with the ball, that technically we can find better moments. We had four or five during the game, and two or three particularly second half that were clear breakaway situations, on the counter, where we should do better, and then we kill the game off.\n\n“I think there’s a mixture of joy at a win but also a bit of relief because we’ve been on a tough run, and everyone feels it. The crowd felt it right at the end when they were putting corners in and spinning it in the box from everywhere, that bit of nervousness. But you get that one closed off like we did and then see what comes next. We’ve ground one out today.”\n\nThe goal came when Ben Mee sent a header towards Mat Ryan in the visitors’ goal, Brighton attempted to clear and the ball came to Cork. The midfielder unleashed a first-time strike and saw it go in via Tarkowski’s chest.\n\nEarly in the second half Burnley had appeals for a penalty rejected by the referee, Martin Atkinson, after Yves Bissouma had his boot high as he made a clearance and Phil Bardsley went down. Dyche said: “We still can’t get that elusive penalty. I don’t know what incident is going to have to occur, but when it does, I hope it’s something that really counts for us.\n\nSon Heung-min and Dele Alli lift Tottenham a class above Leicester Read more\n\n“There are two shouts today. Bruno gets done on the run by Robbie Brady and body-checks him. That was a maybe, but you’ve seen them given. The one on Bardo – he’s got kicked in the head more or less. There’s no malice, by the way, I must make that clear. But anywhere on the pitch that is dangerous play. For me that has to be a penalty. We’ve got to start getting a fair share. We haven’t had one in 58 [games].”\n\nBurnley did have some fortune and not only with their goal. The Brighton substitute Jürgen Locadia failed to make the most of a great opportunity in the 83rd minute as he headed over the bar.\n\nChris Hughton, whose Brighton side dropped a place to 11th, said: “We were the better team. It was the type of game where you felt there weren’t going to be many chances, up against a team that are quite direct. It was a scrappy goal we conceded and I thought we had the best chance of the game through Locadia. I thought we were the side who looked more likely to score. So, yes, disappointed.

After a bright start in which Charlie Austin twice flashed wide of Neil Etheridge’s goal, a vulnerable Southampton defence, particularly the 19-year-old full-back Yan Valery, were under siege for the majority of this match-up.\n\nHarry Arter was ubiquitous as Cardiff suffocated Southampton and the midfielder spurned their first opening, after Nathaniel Mendez-Laing clawed the ball into the six-yard box after good work by the lively Josh Murphy. Sean Morrison, the Cardiff defender, wreaked havoc at the other end. After embarrassing Vestergaard not once but twice – the 6ft 6in Southampton centre-back made the Cardiff captain look like a world-beater – he slid in Paterson who failed to convert.\n\nBy the time Alex McCarthy, the exasperated Southampton goalkeeper, had diverted Murphy’s effort from an acute angle the visitors’ vulnerability had been laid painfully bare. “It’s a very difficult situation for the whole club but I know we can do better than we did today,” Hasenhüttl said. “Today we all learnt, absolutely.”\n\nSouthampton lived dangerously, yet there was always a sense that the hosts could be punished for their profligacy. The half-time whistle killed Cardiff’s momentum, with Southampton starting the second half more convincingly. They had a penalty appeal turned down by Jonathan Moss, the referee taking a dim view of the manner in which Stuart Armstrong fell via Victor Camarasa’s outstretched leg, infuriating Hasenhüttl on the touchline. They got the rub of the green moments later, but Matt Targett’s free-kick sailed over.\n\nLiverpool’s Mohamed Salah romps to a hat-trick in 4-0 win at Bournemouth Read more\n\nBut Cardiff kept plugging away and, when Moss waved play on after Oriol Romeu clattered Camarasa on halfway, the ball ran through to Vestergaard, with Paterson lurking. At that point, Vestergaard provided an early Christmas present, with the £18m summer signing stuck in the mud and mistakenly playing in Paterson, who bulldozed his way through on goal before tucking home.\n\n“You know me, I criticise referees,” Warnock added, “but I don’t think anybody other than Jonathan Moss would have given us an advantage. He didn’t blow for the obvious free-kick, then Paterson got that little bit of luck. I have to say a big thank you; I thought it was a fantastic advantage.”"}, {"date": "08/12/2018", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74523, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diogo Dalot", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [13], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [28], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [82], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fred", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Rico", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Ream", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jean Seri", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André-Frank Zambo Anguissa", "yellows": [31], "reds": [68], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Tom Cairney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marcus Bettinelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neeskens Kebano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefan Johansen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Vietto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahima Cissé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aboubakar Kamara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [67], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "If only Manchester United could play Fulham every week people might begin to take them more seriously.

Claudio Ranieri’s strugglers were far too easily dominated, with the Italian reduced from an early stage to standing on the touchline with a resigned look and extended right hand to show his players the direction they were supposed to be playing. With just Aleksandar Mitrovic ploughing a lonely furrow up front it never happened, and Fulham looked beaten from the moment Ashley Young opened the scoring.\n\nThe United captain initially appeared likely to attempt a cross when he took the ball high on the left but once he beat Denis Odoi to find space in the area he caught sight of goal and found Sergio Rico’s top corner with a curling right-foot drive.\n\nJuan Mata scored next, applying a confident finish after Marcus Rashford cut back the ball from the goalline. Romelu Lukaku was criticised earlier in the week for not doing much except trying to score goals, so he should be quite proud of the pass that played Rashford behind the Fulham defence. Rashford then had the awareness to pick out Mata at the back of the penalty area, and when his shot beat Rico’s dive the contest was as good as over.\n\nThe Fulham fans certainly seemed to think so. “You’re nothing special, we lose every week,” was the chant from the travelling support.\n\nDavid Luiz seals win as Chelsea end Manchester City’s unbeaten start Read more\n\nRico produced a good stop to keep out a thunderous free-kick from Rashford, before United increased their lead just before the interval with a slick triangular passing move that clearly pleased Mourinho. Jesse Lingard found Mata, whose first-time ball along the six-yard line was neatly tucked away by Lukaku.\n\nFulham showed a little more life after Ranieri made two half-time substitutions, though their best chance in open play fell to André Schürrle following a weak clearance by Diogo Dalot, and the winger skied his shot. It summed up Fulham’s afternoon when less than two minutes after Aboubakar Kamara had pulled a goal back from the penalty spot, following a foul on the substitute by Ander Herrera, they went down to 10 men when a studs-up challenge on Rashford by André-Frank Zambo Anguissa brought a second yellow.\n\nAny hopes of United running up a cricket score were dashed when Rico managed saves from Rashford and then Lukaku, although the goalkeeper was beaten at his near post when Rashford scored an audacious fourth from the angle of the area.\n\nHad Fred not tried a risky pass rather than a straightforward one in stoppage time United might have hit five in the league for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down.\n\nIn the end Fulham were not quite that obliging but it was close. “It is quite simple,” Ranieri said with his usual pithiness. “If we play like we did in the first half, we will be relegated.

Any attempt to make sense of their wild inconsistency feels futile at the moment, with the sense of disorder summed up by the sight of Manuel Pellegrini struggling to stifle a laugh as he tried to offer considered analysis on a chaotic performance from his weird and occasionally wonderful side.\n\nPellegrini is usually much more circumspect when he meets the media. This time, however, he had no option but to chuckle after an afternoon that had featured sloppy concessions, wonder strikes from Felipe Anderson and Robert Snodgrass, a classic piece of poaching from Javier Hernández and a flamboyant comeback that lifted West Ham into the top half for the first time this season.\n\nMarcus Rashford seals comfortable win for Manchester United over Fulham Read more\n\n“It was a strange game,” Pellegrini said, just as he had after Tuesday’s victory over Cardiff City. His serious face returned and West Ham’s manager switched his focus to how his players had initially found it difficult to recover from James McArthur’s early goal for Crystal Palace. “We played without calm because we were a goal down,” the Chilean added.\n\nWest Ham, who have scored three goals in each of their last three matches, certainly appeared to have made the classic mistake of underestimating wounded opponents in the first half. Palace, who lie two points above the bottom three, had a point to prove after letting their supporters down against Brighton in midweek and a determined start brought them a reward in the sixth minute.\n\nPatrick van Aanholt lifted a deep free-kick towards the edge of the area, James Tomkins beat Arthur Masuaku in the air and nobody in claret and blue reacted as McArthur darted in. West Ham’s cries for offside fell on deaf ears, allowing the midfielder to bundle the ball past Lukasz Fabianski.\n\nThe London Stadium became an angry, frustrated place. Palace had survived an early scare when pressure from Van Aanholt stopped Hernández from squeezing a shot past Wayne Hennessey, but otherwise the visitors were comfortable.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Felipe Anderson’s strike flies over Wayne Hennessey for West Ham’s third goal. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nWest Ham’s toothlessness made them pine for the hamstrung Marko Arnautovic and the half ended with Palace almost adding a second. Luka Milivojevic was unfortunate to see his free-kick hit the bar.\n\nPellegrini responded by reaching for the ultimate Plan B, replacing the ineffective Lucas Pérez with Andy Carroll. West Ham surged forward and quickly equalised out of nothing. Mamadou Sakho’s clearance dropped to Snodgrass, who used his left foot to bend a beautiful shot past Hennessey from 20 yards.\n\nAnarchy reigned all of a sudden. Issa Diop foiled Wilfried Zaha, who will miss Palace’s next match after picking up his fifth booking of the season, and Fabianski denied Max Meyer with a brave stop.\n\nRalph Hasenhüttl off to losing start with Southampton after Cardiff winner Read more\n\nThe next goal felt hard to call. Yet West Ham sensed their moment when Tomkins tripped Carroll in a dangerous position. Anderson whipped the free-kick over the wall, Hennessey failed to push the winger’s effort to safety and Hernández smashed home the rebound.\n\nWest Ham went in for the kill. Anderson was in his element now and the Brazilian scored in the 65th minute, curling a stunning shot past Hennessey from the edge of the area.\n\nAnderson’s sixth goal of the season gave West Ham the illusion of safety, prompting them to bring out the flicks and tricks as they moved towards securing three consecutive league wins for the first time since December 2016.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get

understand why Pep Guardiola did not want to entertain any questions before this match about the possibility of Manchester City going unbeaten through the entire season. The Invincibles mark II? Not quite. The champions have been reminded what it feels like to lose a Premier League match, eight months since it last happened, and suddenly it is Guardiola’s team playing catch-up at the top of the table.\n\nThose of us who have lauded them for so long would probably be well advised not to join the stampede of revisionists finding fault in what had previously looked like a perfectly oiled machine. Yet, if nothing else, at least it is a reminder that City are not as slick as many people believed. They had been behind for a grand total of 12 minutes in all their previous league fixtures and, on the evidence of this defeat, it is fair to say Liverpool, the new leaders, can be encouraged by the possibilities that have opened up.\n\nChelsea and police investigate claims of racist abuse aimed at Raheem Sterling Read more\n\nOne bad result does not change the fact City are a supreme, brilliantly efficient and dangerous football team – quite possibly the most exciting collection of players we have seen in English football. But it was also brought into sharp focus during this display that Guardiola and his players have not, contrary to popular opinion, created a form of football perfection. Not yet, anyway.\n\nFor starters, there is no point outpassing opponents if you don’t outscore them, as was the case with City before N’Golo Kanté’s goal completely changed the course of this match. For the opening 44 minutes, Chelsea were grateful for City’s inability to turn their superiority into the hard currency of goals. Thereafter, Maurizio Sarri’s team played as though determined not to let an away side dictate play so comprehensively. Their victory was sealed by David Luiz’s 78th-minute header from a badly defended corner but, even taking into account the home side’s improvement, it must have been startling for Guardiola to see the deterioration in his own players. Their response to going a goal down was surprisingly weak and, at 2-0, there was absolutely nothing from the visitors to make it look as though they still believed the game was salvageable.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest N’Golo Kanté fires Chelsea into the lead late in the first half.

City undoubtedly missed the injured Sergio Agüero during the parts of the game early on when they were let down by a lack of penalty-area ruthlessness. David Silva went off with a possible hamstring strain and, perhaps for the first time, City badly needed Kevin De Bruyne, the match-winner in this fixture last season.\n\nN’Golo Kanté’s manic commitment helps Chelsea rattle Manchester City | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nTactically, Sarri did something similar to Guardiola with Chelsea’s frontline, with Eden Hazard playing through the middle and Álvaro Morata not even among their substitutes. Early on, however, it was not easy to gauge the success of this experiment, simply because the home team found it difficult to create any momentum whatsoever. Hazard could be seen turning to Sarri, arms outstretched, as if to say he was not particularly relishing his central role. The game had not reached the half-hour mark and, at that stage, not many people could have imagined Guardiola would be walking on to the pitch at full-time to congratulate the victorious players in the darker shade of blue.\n\nChelsea rode their luck at times but this was also a reminder that football is ultimately about putting the ball in the net rather than merely looking elegant in possession. Leroy Sané alone had three chances to open the scoring and Sterling could not get a clean contact with probably the most inviting opportunity of the opening 45 minutes. Chelsea, on the other hand, were clinical, taking the lead on the only occasion they caught their opponents out of position in the first half. Hazard slipped the decisive pass between two defenders and Kanté’s shot, from close to the penalty spot, was still rising at it flew into the roof of the net.\n\nUntil that point, the pattern of the game was a familiar one for regular City-watchers, with the away team knocking the ball around with immense confidence and streaming forward in what was, at times, a 4-1-5 formation. Ederson refrained from making any no-look passes or keepie-ups inside his own six-yard area, as he had in the midweek win at Watford, but neither was the Brazilian particularly troubled before Chelsea surprised everybody, perhaps even themselves, by taking the lead.\n\nPep Guardiola calls Manchester City’s defeat to Chelsea a ‘good lesson’ Read more\n\nChelsea began the second half as though determined that it would not follow the same pattern as the opening 45 minutes and, having starting the match with Sterling as a false 9, Guardiola soon brought on a real one in the form of Gabriel Jesus, albeit wearing the No 33 shirt. Sané, who had lost Kane for the opening goal, was taken off, with Sterling switching to the left, and Riyad Mahrez often looking like City’s best hope on the opposite side.\n\nBy the time the game reached the hour-mark, however, City had stopped passing the ball as effectively and Bernardo Silva, in particular, had gone off the boil. Chelsea had lost Mateo Kovacic with a second-half injury but were now looking far more controlled. Kanté’s influence was growing, while César Azpilicueta’s defending typified their determination not to surrender the lead. Something strange and unexpected was taking shape: a football match in which Guardiola’s men suddenly looked devoid of ideas.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up for our free daily football email.\n\nGuardiola was aggrieved about the corner decision that led to David Luiz’s goal but the replays confirmed the ball had gone out via a faint touch off Mahrez’s foot. City’s manager ought to have been more concerned about the marking from Hazard’s corner, or the chaos that was caused by David Luiz’s long, diagonal pass in the moments before Kanté’s goal. It turns out City are fallible, after all, and the most relevant question now, perhaps, is how quickly they can shake it out of their system."}, {"date": "08/12/2018", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31957, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nampalys Mendy", "yellows": [16], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "James Maddison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rachid Ghezzal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hamza Choudhury", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [9], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [58], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Lucas Moura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georges-Kevin N'Koudou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver Skipp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "How deceptive appearances can be. On the face of things this was hardly an assignment Mauricio Pochettino would have asked for with a potentially season-defining match in Barcelona three days away, and to the naked eye his decision to name Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen on the bench seemed to play fast and loose with the evening’s outcome. Yet reality told a different tale: one of a surprisingly comfortable win that at once minimised Tottenham’s stress levels before visiting the Camp Nou and left them aglow with what feels like a renewed set of possibilities on the domestic front.\n\nThat they departed so buoyantly owed plenty to Son Heung-min, whose slow start to the season has seemed a distant memory over the past three weeks. A largely dreary first half was drawing to a close when, cutting inside on to his left foot, he cracked a marvellously clean 20-yard shot across Kasper Schmeichel and ended a Leicester resistance that had just begun to appear precarious. He crossed for Dele Alli to score Spurs’ second after half-time and ensure that, with 36 points from 16 games, they have made their best-ever start to a Premier League campaign.\n\nLeicester City 0-2 Tottenham: Premier League – live! Read more\n\n“Now I will allow us to start thinking about Barcelona,” Pochettino said, although Tuesday’s fixture had manifestly crossed his mind well in advance. As Leicester asked questions of Tottenham’s defence in the first 20 minutes, while a mobile but outwardly brittle front three of Son, Alli and Lucas Moura struggled to impose themselves further forward, an inquest into his resource management did not seem unrealistic. But they settled thereafter, keeping possession well enough to deprive the home side of counterattacking oxygen and gradually making inroads in attack. The end product left Pochettino, whose side have responded admirably to their defeat at Arsenal and its surrounding storm, visibly enthused and sufficiently confident to talk up their chances of staying in the title race.\n\n“The reality is that we are there fighting,” he said, having seen Manchester City’s defeat at Stamford Bridge offer a shaft of light to those chasing the top two. “We are in a very good position with Liverpool, City, Chelsea and Arsenal. That is the reality.” They have not drawn any of their last 20 league games; the defeats, when they come, tend to bring doubts about their ability to match those around them but Spurs showed again here that the winning habit is hard to kick.\n\nThey limited Leicester’s chances to an early flurry and then, when the game had long since been wrapped up, a succession of crosses flashed across goal. Jamie Vardy was missing for the second week in a row, a groin injury continuing to lay him low, and Kelechi Iheanacho was a nervy stand-in. He shot wildly over when sent away by an early ball over the top although Jan Vertonghen then denied him a tap-in after the overlapping Ben Chilwell had crossed. There were cheers from some sections of the crowd when he was replaced by Rachid Ghezzal early in the second half and Leicester, who have as good a chance as anyone of landing the “best-of-the-rest” spot below the top six, look in need of more potent attacking options in January.\n\nDavid Luiz seals win as Chelsea end Manchester City’s unbeaten start Read more\n\nAs it happened Ghezzal’s chances of effecting an improvement were nixed almost instantly. Two minutes after he came on, Tottenham’s forwards contrived a tour de force, Moura finding Son on the left and Alli, with characteristically adept timing, running in from the opposite side to head the South Korean’s cross in at the far post. He was arguably a shade offside, but not obviously enough to impact upon the post-match narrative.\n\nThe conversation flowed more readily around the head of steam being built up by Son. “I think the first few months of the competition were a bit disappointing because he travelled a lot [with his national team],” Pochettino said. “But he was so focused and tried to improve. Now we are so happy with his performance. That is the player we want, we expect, that energy.”\n\nNow they travel to Catalonia with that vigour spread across the entire team. Kane, whose vigorous applause of Son’s goal from the bench was perhaps laced with relief that he would not be wheeled out for a salvage operation here, received a light runout for the last 20 minutes and Eriksen was afforded only slightly more. The cotton-wool exercise paid off and the only possible dampener for Spurs was an injury to Serge Aurier, who hobbled off to be replaced by Kyle Walker-Peters. It was hardly the biggest of troubles and the benefit of such a stately evening’s work may become apparent soon enough."}, {"date": "05/12/2018", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21741, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson Ramses Becker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [23]}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Naby Keita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Fabinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [23], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rafael Camacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Liverpool kept up their unbeaten record to maintain the pressure on Manchester City by coming from behind to beat Burnley. When the home side took a second-half lead it briefly looked as though they might climb out of the bottom three and leave Liverpool five points adrift of the league leaders but two goals in quick succession from James Milner and Roberto Firmino rescued the situation for the visitors.\n\nMohamed Salah missed a couple of chances to make the game safe that he would have buried last season but still had a hand in the decisive third goal, flicking an instinctive pass for Xherdan Shaqiri to score with an emphatic first-time finish. The Switzerland international was unmarked in the box, mainly because most Burnley defenders were returning from attempting to equalise at a corner, with Alisson touching a Ben Mee header on to his post before the ball was cleared downfield. That is the sort of luck Burnley are enduring at the moment whereas fortune seems to be favouring Liverpool, whose fans enjoyed putting Divock Origi’s name into their seasonal ditty: Merry Christmas Everton.\n\nLingard earns point for Manchester United after De Gea gifts Arsenal lead Read more\n\nJürgen Klopp gave the Belgian a rare start after his last-minute heroics in the Merseyside derby, one of seven changes to the side. That seemed a lot, even allowing for Sadio Mané’s foot injury, though the Liverpool manager said it was par for the course for the busiest stage of the season. Playing at right-back, Joe Gomez needed treatment after hitting a perimeter fence when Mee halted his run down the wing, eventually departing midway through the first half to cut short Trent Alexander-Arnold’s evening of rest. “Joe is injured,” Klopp said. “The tackle might have been fair but you have to be careful on such a wet pitch.”\n\nThe first period was short on goalmouth action, or indeed attacking moves of any promise. Liverpool lacked penetration and any element of surprise without their usual front three, while the home side were always likeliest to score from a set piece. Cruelly, when Ashley Barnes had applied a perfect finish to a well-flighted free-kick from Robbie Brady at the end of the first half, his celebrations were cut short by a flag for a narrow offside. Alisson in the Liverpool goal, helpless as Barnes’ volley flew past him into the net, was possibly the most relieved man in the ground.\n\nJoe Hart was called into action early in the second half when Naby Keïta struck a fierce shot from the edge of the area, one that was heading for the top corner before the goalkeeper made a one-handed save. At that point Liverpool looked to be getting on top, so it was a surprise when Burnley took the lead just before the hour. James Tarkowski’s weak header from a corner would have been a routine save for Alisson but for Chris Wood’s touch. The goalkeeper could only parry and, when he tried to reclaim the ball, Barnes got his foot in first, allowing Jack Cork to score from the ricochet. It was the scrappiest of goals and Liverpool complained bitterly that the goalkeeper had been impeded – but Stuart Attwell, after checking with his assistant, came to the conclusion that no foul had been committed.\n\nKlopp’s response was to warm up Salah and Firmino, but before they could be introduced Liverpool were level. Keïta found some space on the left, Origi coolly played a ball back out of the area and Milner took a brief look up before clipping a low shot just inside Hart’s left-hand upright from the edge of the area.\n\nSpurs’ Harry Kane shows Southampton’s new manager size of job ahead Read more\n\nSalah and Firmino did then come on and the latter had a goal with his first touch from what looked like a training-ground move. A short free-kick resulted in Alexander-Arnold crossing to the far post, where Virgil van Dijk reached it with his foot and turned the ball across the face of goal, leaving the Brazilian the simplest of tap-ins.\n\nNow more recognisable and with Salah’s presence dissuading Burnley from throwing too many men forward, Liverpool were comfortable even before adding a third, though Sean Dyche was entitled to bemoan his side’s luck.\n\n“Joe [Hart] was unsighted for the first goal and we thought the ball had gone out of play in the build-up to the third,” the Burnley manager said. “At least we kept going.

Fatigue and a lack of finesse in attacking positions ensured the after-effects of Anfield lingered for Marco Silva’s team.\n\n“We had chances to win it at the end,” the Newcastle manager said, “but they had won four home games in a row so to get a point in this stadium with the way things are going for us was a credit to our players. The application was fantastic. They have top-class players, players with World Cup and Euros experience coming from the bench, so our players have done a great job.”\n\nPickford received a rousing ovation from the crowd before kick-off – responding with an appreciative clenched-fist salute following his error at Liverpool – although the away section was predictably scathing in its reception for the born-and-bred Sunderland fan. The baiting intensified when the England No 1 was beaten from the first Newcastle attack of the game.\n\nAdemola Lookman, making his first league start of the season, was dispossessed in the Newcastle half. His appeals for a foul were ignored by the referee as Jacob Murphy raced down the left before delivering a precise cross low along the face of Pickford’s goal. Kurt Zouma and Yerry Mina were unable to intercept and Salomón Rondón steered a powerful finish into the roof of the net at the back post. “It was a foul, possibly two, but that is not an excuse because we had to defend that situation better,” said Silva.\n\nEverton, with André Gomes leading a composed display from central midfield, were not unduly disturbed by the setback. The left-wing partnership of Richarlison and Lucas Digne was potent and it engineered excellent chances for Gylfi Sigurdsson and the recalled Cenk Tosun before the interval. Sigurdsson was foiled by a superb block from Federico Fernández while Tosun volleyed straight at Martin Dubravka when picked out by another Digne cross. The home side had levelled at that stage and a 2-1 lead, seconds before the interval, could have changed the complexion of the contest entirely.\n\nSpurs’ Harry Kane shows Southampton’s new manager size of job ahead Read more\n\nDubravka had produced a fine save from Richarlison after the ball broke from Lookman, who again claimed to have been fouled in the build-up and again in vain. The resulting corner by Sigurdsson took a slight deflection off Jamaal Lascelles and fell invitingly for Richarlison to scoop the ball over the goalkeeper at the back post.\n\nParity and possession did not produce a commanding second-half display from Everton, who looked heavy-legged and were easily contained by Newcastle’s five-man defence. Lookman and Tosun were fresh but struggled to seize their chance to impress in the starting line-up.\n\nThe Everton manager admitted: “Lookman performed like I expected; he had some good moments and some not so good moments. Like the team. Same with Cenk. Newcastle came here with one thing in mind – to keep a strong defensive organisation with nine or 10 players behind the ball and they achieved what they wanted. We didn’t create enough chances in the second half to change the result.”"}, {"date": "05/12/2018", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 22881, "home_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Rico", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxime Le Marchand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jean Seri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aboubakar Kamara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Vietto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marcus Bettinelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neeskens Kebano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cairney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Ream", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André-Frank Zambo Anguissa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Caglar Söyüncü", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nampalys Mendy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Maddison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fousseni Diabate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Knight", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Fulham’s progress under Claudio Ranieri is being measured in small steps. The Italian and his players departed this tight contest vaguely dissatisfied to have taken only a point having led Leicester City through much of the second half, their mood coloured by the sight of Denis Odoi wastefully scooping a shot over the crossbar in stoppage time. Yet in the cold light of day, the improvements seen here should suggest a brighter future awaits.\n\nThe weight of the division still bears down on the Londoners but they are not the soft touch they were a few weeks ago. Three games into Ranieri’s tenure and some of the naivety has been drummed out of them. There were long periods while confronting a team with top-half credentials when Fulham even felt in control, their lead established against the run of play but their shape well-enforced thereafter and a threat carried on the counterattack. The frustration, of course, was that all it took was one moment of carelessness with the end almost in sight to undo a lot of their hard work.\n\nLingard earns point for Manchester United after De Gea hands Arsenal lead Read more\n\nLeicester conjured their equaliser when the substitutes Demarai Gray and Shinji Okazaki combined slickly down the visitors’ right flank and the latter, allowed space by a disoriented Alfie Mawson, pulled the ball back to the penalty spot. There loitered James Maddison, the classiest attacking talent on the pitch, to dispatch a crisp first-time finish into the bottom corner. The hosts’ wait for a first clean sheet of the season had been extended. “At this moment, when we make mistakes, the big opponents score,” said Ranieri. “But we continue to progress. Slowly, slowly.”\n\nThis had been an emotional experience for the Italian against the team with whom he claimed the only top-flight title of his managerial career to date. He had offered his tribute to the late Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha prior to kick-off, acknowledged the chants of the away support and saw four key members of his Premier League winning side start in Leicester’s ranks. Yet, other than a quick “hello” to familiar faces, he concentrated purely on Fulham’s latest opportunity and gained encouragement from much that he witnessed.\n\nFulham could point to the substitute Tom Cairney fizzing a shot just wide of the post while their lead still stood or that late miss by Odoi. Leicester threatened repeatedly in the first half and Kelechi Iheanacho should have scored the game’s opening goal early on. But at the other end Kasper Schmeichel was forced into an astonishing fingertip save to deny Callum Chambers – a makeshift defensive midfielder who seems destined to bring the best out of opposing goalkeepers having tested Chelsea consistently on Sunday – as he belted a volley from Odoi’s nod back towards the far corner.\n\nLiverpool hot on City’s heels after James Milner sparks fightback at Burnley Read more\n\nFulham eventually forced themselves ahead via an unlikely scorer. Aboubakar Kamara had provided the chaos factor out on the flank, disconcerting more with his upper body strength than any skill on the ball, until three minutes before the break. He barged on to Aleksandar Mitrovic’s flick and beyond the erratic Caglar Soyuncu to the byline, spinning on the loose ball while the defender slid off the pitch having anticipated blocking a left-footed shot. Kamara took an uncharacteristically calm touch and, from an unkind angle, skimmed his finish through Schmeichel’s legs and into the far corner.\n\nThat concession disconcerted the visitors, who rather ran aground on Fulham’s newfound discipline in the exchanges that followed. “We were poor in our play, without good invention or quality,” said Leicester’s manager Claude Puel. “We didn’t put on the pitch enough quality but we found all the time a fighting spirit and a desire to come back into the game.” It was down to Maddison, who looks the part at this level after his summer arrival from Norwich, to draw them level and extend their unbeaten run to seven games in all competitions.\n\nIndeed, they might have prospered more had Vicente Iborra or Gray taken chances in the frenzied last few minutes, though the most critical miss would come from Odoi as Leicester laboured to clear a corner. “Yes, we had the final chance,” added Ranieri. “If he had shot better or passed the ball to Mitrovic in the middle ... but I am happy.”"}, {"date": "05/12/2018", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 31300, "home_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício",

claiming on the eve of this game that Chelsea are “not able to fight with Manchester City” for the title Maurizio Sarri was proved absolutely right. Pep Guardiola’s side visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday with the gap between the two clubs now standing at 10 points after Chelsea fell to a second successive defeat that highlighted how much work Sarri has to do to turn Chelsea into credible challengers.\n\nAhead through Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s early goal, Chelsea had the perfect platform to go on and win the game but badly lost their way against a Wolves side who played with the courage, belief and flair that has been badly missing in recent weeks. The turning point was Raúl Jiménez’s equaliser, just before the hour mark, and from that moment on Chelsea never recovered. “We were suddenly another team,” Sarri said.\n\nMaurizio Sarri questions Chelsea players’ attitude after Wolves defeat Read more\n\nA couple of potentially critical refereeing decisions went against Chelsea – Álvaro Morata had strong claims for a penalty turned down and Willian felt he was fouled in the lead-up to Wolves’ second goal – but Sarri was too disappointed with the way his players performed in the final 30 minutes to dwell on either incident.\n\nThe Italian, who made five changes to his starting lineup – Loftus-Cheek, Andreas Christensen and Cesc Fàbregas all made their first Premier League starts of the season – questioned his players’ mentality and attitude at the end of a chastening evening. He also suggested that some members of his team have “too much confidence”.\n\nFor Wolves, who came into the game on the back of a miserable run of form in which they collected only one point from a possible 18, this felt like a restorative victory. They were unrecognisable from the team that lost meekly to Huddersfield and Cardiff in their previous two matches and it turned into a special evening for one teenager in particular.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wolves teenager Morgan Gibbs-White tangles with Andreas Christensen during a superb full Prmeir League debut. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images via Reuters\n\nMorgan Gibbs-White, aged 18, was outstanding on his full Premier League debut. Showing some lovely touches, the attacking midfielder played with a maturity beyond his years. It was his perfectly weighted pass that set up Jiménez for the equaliser and he thoroughly deserved the standing ovation that followed when he was substituted 20 minutes from time. “I think he is one of the best generation of England players for a long time,” said Nuno Espírito Santo.\n\nThe sight of Diogo Jota, who was Wolves’ top scorer last season, wheeling away in delight after converting Matt Doherty’s lovely cross completed a perfect evening for the Midlands club. Jota has not looked quite the same player this season but his first Premier League goal of the campaign should give him a huge lift, with the relief almost tangible as he celebrated in front of the euphoric Wolves supporters.\n\nChelsea seemed shellshocked after conceding twice in four minutes. They dominated possession – Sarri’s team had 70% of the ball – and registered 17 shots to their opponent’s six, yet only three of those efforts were on target and that says much about the absence of a cutting edge whenever they attacked.\n\nLiverpool hot on City’s heels after James Milner sparks fightback at Burnley Read more\n\nThe visitors’ opening goal owed much to good fortune. Loftus-Cheek picked up possession on the left from Eden Hazard and hit a curling right-foot shot that was unlikely to trouble Rui Patrício much until Conor Coady got in the way. Stooping to try to block the ball, the Wolves defender succeeded only in heading it beyond his own keeper and inside the near post. The goal was still credited to Loftus-Cheek, who has now scored six times in his last seven club appearances.\n\nPatrício produced an excellent save to tip Willian’s free-kick on to the bar and over and the Brazilian was denied again later in the first half when Ryan Bennett made a superbly timed tackle. Yet Wolves also signalled their intent during that opening period, especially down the left flank , where Rúben Vinagre delivered some dangerous crosses. Jiménez headed one over the bar and another ended up at the feet of Gibbs-White only for Fàbregas, who came into the Chelsea team for Jorginho, to make a crucial last-ditch tackle.\n\nThen came that penalty appeal straight after the restart, when Willy Boly appeared to swipe Morata’s feet from under him as he tried to touch in an inviting Loftus-Cheek cross. The significance of that moment became clear little more than 10 minutes later, when Jiménez ran on to Gibbs-White’s pass and drilled a low shot that seemed almost to go through Kepa Arrizabalaga in the Chelsea goal.\n\nIn the blink of an eye Wolves had a second after João Moutinho dispossessed Willian deep inside the Chelsea half before releasing Doherty on the right.

Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku could not even make the starting line-up and United were fortunate, perhaps, that Arsenal were unable to defend with more substance on the two occasions the visitors had put themselves in a position of strength.\n\nThe final goal of a dishevelled, rain-soaked evening was a case in point. It came within 13 seconds of the restart, Arsenal having gone 2-1 ahead courtesy of the substitute Alexandre Lacazette, and was fashioned via nothing more refined than a long punt from Marcos Rojo, a heavy touch from Sead Kolasinac inside his own penalty area and Lingard nipping in to poke a scruffy yet important goal past Bernd Leno, Arsenal’s slow-to-react goalkeeper.\n\nPlay Video 1:19 José Mourinho ‘frustrated’ with draw against Arsenal but praises players’ 'spirit' – video\n\nThen again Lacazette’s goal was hardly a masterpiece. This time Rojo lost the ball inside his own half. Lacazette exchanged passes with Henrikh Mkhitaryan, another substitute, and Rojo’s attempts to save himself resulted in a sliding tackle that succeeded only in nudging the ball past David de Gea. It was credited as an own goal, though replays showed the final touch came off Lacazette’s instep, completely by fluke.\n\nJosé Mourinho gets some mad dog spirit but Manchester United remain a puzzle | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nAs United-Arsenal games go, it was certainly difficult to remember another contest featuring so many of what Tony Adams, in his television role, described as “schoolboy errors”. This was the first time in 32 years, encompassing 83 meetings, that this fixture has taken place without Sir Alex Ferguson or Arsène Wenger in one of the dugouts. It was eighth against fourth at the start of play (Arsenal have now dropped back to fifth) and in United’s case it probably sums up their malaise that a club that once fielded, from right to left, David Beckham, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs as their midfield quartet started with a wing-back system featuring Diogo Dalot, Ander Herrera, Nemanja Matic and Matteo Darmian across the middle. Fred, the £52m forgotten man, was not even among the substitutes and Arsenal were denied only by De Gea’s goalkeeping in the final 20 minutes, when he saved from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, twice, and Lucas Torreira. Incredibly it was the first time any goalkeeper has kept out a shot from Aubameyang in a league match since Lukasz Fabianski managed it for West Ham in August.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The ball crosses the goal line for Arsenal’s first goal before Ander Herrera can clear it after David de Gea’s blunder. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEqually Mourinho must also be concerned that De Gea, usually such a brilliantly consistent goalkeeper, is having an erratic season. United’s goalkeeper will certainly not wish to see the replays of the opening goal, 26 minutes in, when Torreira swung over a corner from the left and Shkodran Mustafi powered in with a downward header. Bouncing off the turf, the ball flicked off De Gea’s gloves and dropped behind him rather than, as he intended, going over the crossbar. Herrera might still have saved United by trying to head the ball away, rather than waiting for it to drop and kicking clear, but it was poor goalkeeping. Mourinho later remarked that his team “drew 2-2 but we scored four goals”.\n\nRaúl Jiménez and Jota give Wolves comeback win over Chelsea Read more\n\nArsenal held the lead for only four minutes, continuing their run of having not led a league game at half-time this season, but they can be aggrieved about the free-kick that led to the goal and, secondly, that the linesman did not see that Herrera was marginally offside when Rojo took aim. Leno saved the shot but Herrera was fast to the rebound. His cutback went behind Lingard but rolled invitingly to Martial and, with nobody in an Arsenal shirt reacting quickly enough, he turned in his eighth goal of the season.\n\nArsenal, now 20 games unbeaten in all competitions, lost Rob Holding to a first-half injury and Aaron Ramsey, with a twisted ankle, was unable to come back out for the second half. That meant Mkhitaryan entering the game on a night when Mesut Özil was absent again from Unai Emery’s team, and the former United player was unfortunate that a linesman’s flag denied him a late winner. It was the correct decision but the angled, left-foot volley from Mkhitaryan was exquisite, one of the few moments of high quality from a game that felt a long way removed from United versus Arsenal

tempting to say that Ralph Hasenhüttl now knows the scale of the challenge that faces him at Southampton but the truth is the new manager was already painfully aware. Relegation-threatened clubs are queasily placed for good reason. They call for fresh direction in the middle of a season because they are desperate.\n\nThere were familiar flaws for Hasenhüttl to digest from his seat in the Wembley stands, having been confirmed as Mark Hughes’s successor in the morning – namely, defensive looseness that added up to the softest of concessions and, at the other end, a lack of discernible goal threat until Tottenham were 3-0 up and the game was over.\n\nJames Maddison earns Leicester draw at Claudio Ranieri’s Fulham Read more\n\nTime, of course, is short for Hasenhüttl. His first match comes at Cardiff on Saturday and the club will pray for a new-manager bounce. His presence did not inspire one here, although Southampton – under the caretaker charge of Kelvin Davis – did enjoy a decent final half-hour, when Hugo Lloris was forced into a succession of saves. To repeat: the game was over by then.\n\nMauricio Pochettino described Lloris as the man of the match, which was strange, but it was a strange kind of occasion, played out in front of only 33,012 – comfortably Spurs’ lowest attendance for a Premier League game at Wembley. Their regular followers are sick of playing here.\n\nTottenham were able to bounce back from their 4-2 defeat at Arsenal on Sunday, with Harry Kane putting them in charge with his 13th goal of the club season and Lucas Moura and the excellent Son Heung-min giving the scoreline its gloss.\n\nDavis could be proud of how his players kept going, with Lloris making his saves and the substitute, Mohamed Elyounoussi, heading against the crossbar in stoppage-time before another replacement, Charlie Austin, ran through to score. But no team can defend this generously and expect to emerge unscathed.\n\n“I think it’s a mindset,” Davis said. “I don’t know whether it’s confidence. If you look at the goals we conceded, they’re ultimately easy to stop. It’s something the new manager will be looking to address as quickly as he can.”\n\nSpurs switched off at 3-0 but the biggest blot on their evening was the groin injury that forced off Kieran Trippier. He was replaced by the 18-year-old Oliver Skipp, for whom it was a Premier League debut.\n\nPochettino said that Trippier’s problem was a legacy of the one he suffered for England in the World Cup semi-final against Croatia. He felt the suspect Wembley surface had done the full-back no favours.\n\nSalomón Rondón steals Everton’s thunder but Richarlison soon makes their point Read more\n\nHasenhüttl had flown into London and he addressed the club’s staff at the team hotel but he kept his distance from the players, paying Davis the respect of not interfering with his preparations. Davis has been named as his assistant coach.\n\n“He was very concise with his information and he explained how he wants to work,” Davis said. “There was a good feel to him. It was quite simple – how he likes to play the game, how he likes his sessions to be planned, how he watches opposition, what he expects in terms of standards.”\n\nSouthampton made a false start. After Son had stuck the post with a volley, the visitors’ defence switched off on a Spurs corner. Trippier played it short to Christian Eriksen, he crossed and nobody tracked the run of Kane.\n\nSouthampton stabilised and they would have been level midway through the first half but Pierre-Emile Højbjerg’s fizzing drive from 25 yards hit the inside of the post and Stuart Armstrong was offside on the rebound. It looked as though Lloris had got his fingertips to the shot. Southampton had some good spells of possession but cutting edge is what they wanted.\n\nSpurs looked as though they would score more before half-time, with Alex McCarthy making one particularly smart save to deny Son, and they did score more after the interval. Steven Davis failed to clear Trippier’s corner and Lucas lashed home at the second attempt. The third came when Trippier won the ball from Matt Targett; Kane crossed and Son tapped home.\n\nCue the Southampton flurry. Maya Yoshida somehow failed to touch home James Ward-Prowse’s free-kick, Lloris made a double save to deny Højbjerg and Ward-Prowse while he also thwarted Austin. The striker would find a way through with virtually the last kick but, by then, Southampton’s thoughts were turning to Cardiff."}, {"date": "04/12/2018", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance":

end of a game Huddersfield dominated but somehow came away from with nothing. For Howe and his Bournemouth players, who defended for their lives and spent much of the match without the ball, this was one of those occasions when the sound of the final whistle could not come soon enough.\n\nWest Ham’s Lucas Pérez takes advantage after Cardiff fluff penalty Read more\n\nHuddersfield were terrific and on another day would easily have come away with a point, possibly all three, after outplaying Bournemouth. They enjoyed 66% possession and, remarkably, registered 23 shots compared with Bournemouth’s six. It was like an attack against defence training exercise at times as David Wagner’s side laid siege to the Bournemouth goal, pouring forward in search of the equaliser that never came.\n\nThat was down to a combination of Asmir Begovic’s excellent goalkeeping, some resolute Bournemouth defending in the second half and, as Wagner would later lament, Huddersfield’s profligacy in front of goal. Even more frustrating for their manager than all of that was the way his side found themselves two goals down after only 22 minutes.\n\nCallum Wilson and Ryan Fraser, who are turning into quite a double act, did the damage, both setting one another up on a night when Bournemouth ended a run of four successive defeats and reclaimed sixth spot. Wilson’s goal was his eighth of the season in the Premier League – only Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored more – and Fraser has seven assists to his name.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Terence Kongolo pulls a goal back for Huddersfield after the hosts raced into a 2-0 lead. Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images\n\nYet from Wagner’s perspective both goals were preventable and that was his biggest annoyance. “We gave presents away, Christmas presents to Bournemouth, and this is why we didn’t deserve something out of this game,” he said. “And offensively we haven’t put the chances away. Then you can’t hope for something out of football matches. Yes, everything in between was good. It was a very good performance, we were brave, pressed them high, kept them away from our goal, created chances – good chances. But we gave easy goals away.”\n\nThat was all true but the outcome still felt harsh. Few teams will come to Bournemouth this season and control the game to such an extent that it felt as though Huddersfield had an extra player. “We always want the ball and it’s very unlike us at home to be without it for long periods,” Howe said.\n\n“We respect Huddersfield a lot, I think they play a really good brand of football – they press very well. We got the dream start and looked in total control at that point but they threw caution to the wind, put a lot of bodies ahead of the ball and played very well. So credit to them for that. But credit to my players also for how we responded in that second half and how we managed to repel their aerial bombardment.”\n\nManchester City given late scare by Watford’s Abdoulaye Doucouré Read more\n\nThere were only five minutes gone when Bournemouth took the lead. Erik Durm was penalised for a foul on Josh King just outside the area – Wagner felt the decision was soft – and from the free-kick that followed Fraser picked out Wilson’s darting run towards the near post. Unmarked and played onside by Mathias Jørgensen, Wilson met a curling delivery with a thumping header.\n\nBournemouth’s second was a classic counterattack and totally against the run of play. King released Wilson in the inside-right channel and Huddersfield were left horribly exposed defensively. It was two against one in Bournemouth’s favour and a sweeping move ended with Wilson squaring to Fraser, who beat Jonas Lössl with a low left-foot shot.\n\nThat was the cue for a Huddersfield onslaught that saw Begovic deny Alex Pritchard, Laurent Depoitre and Aaron Mooy before Terence Kongolo finished off a game of head-tennis in the area by nodding home. Although King squandered a great chance to give Bournemouth some breathing space at the start of the second half, Huddersfield continued to threaten and it took another smart save from Begovic to keep out Mooy’s effort. “A big relief,” Howe said. “We had the lead and we just seemed to wobble.

United to a home humbling of Arsenal, though this may be the victory they have enjoyed most to date. Crystal Palace, their perceived derby rivals, were humiliated by a team who had been reduced to 10 before the half–hour. The home fans revelled in a night of complete superiority.\n\nThe players conducted a lap of celebration after the final whistle with Lewis Dunk, a local, whipped up into a joyous frenzy. “We showed character,” said Brighton’s captain. “The win is for the fans. They have the bragging rights. I hope they enjoy it.” The memory of the bedlam of the latter stages of the first half, when Brighton had led by three and lost a man, will live long in the memory.\n\nCallum Wilson keeps Bournemouth on high despite Huddersfield onslaught Read more\n\nThere was ruthlessness to admire, most notably from the substitute, Florin Andone, whose charge on to Bernardo’s clearance deep into first-half stoppage time had yielded the third to remove all belief from Palace. The forward ran past the retreating James Tomkins, who simply could not keep up, conscious as he was that he had just been booked. Andone eventually cut back inside the centre–half and, via the defender’s toe, slammed in his side’s final goal.\n\nIt summed up Palace’s slapdash defending that Tomkins’ inadvertent touch had actually made the angle kinder from which to convert though, by then, they had long since become frazzled by a game of catch–up. Brighton were organised and robust throughout, their 10 men beaten only when Leon Balogun tripped Wilfried Zaha late on for Luka Milivojevic to score a consolation from the spot.\n\n“It was probably one of our proudest wins, so special,” Chris Hughton said. “We knew we’d have to defend well but I ended up being disappointed they got the penalty. I know they had a lot of the ball, but I felt we deserved the clean sheet.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Florin Andone celebrates after scoring for the second game in succession. Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images\n\nDespite that late riposte, the hosts had never properly been threatened. Of all the teams against whom to defend a lead en masse, Palace, so horribly blunt without a true focal point to their attack, are one of the more inviting. They have actually been leaning heavily on their own defensive surety, so their capitulation was cause for real concern given the relegation scrap into which they have descended.\n\nPalace were justifiably incensed at the decision to award the penalty which opened the scoring. James McArthur reached the ball to poke it away before José Izquierdo collided with him and crumpled to the turf. Yet Aaron Wan–Bissaka and Milivojevic should already have cleared, the pair tangling in mid–air and deflecting the loose ball into the box. And there were no excuses for everything that followed.\n\nGlenn Murray, a player who has represented both clubs and prospered for each, thumped in the spot–kick but, moments later, would damage his shoulder tumbling under a Tomkins’ challenge in the same box. That appeared a clearer foul but, as players squared up while Murray was receiving treatment, the referee, Kevin Friend, spotted Shane Duffy plant his forehead firmly into Patrick van Aanholt’s face a few feet away to prompt a red card.\n\nWest Ham’s Lucas Pérez takes advantage after Cardiff fluff penalty Read more\n\nBriefly, Palace’s hopes had lifted as Duffy trudged away without complaint, though this game had long since ripped up any conventional script. Brighton flung on Balogun to reinforce their back line before Solly March took the corner awarded for Tomkins’ tackle, with the centre–back unmarked just inside the area to volley in a loose ball 25 seconds after his introduction.\n\n“The second goal is something we have to take total responsibility for, and the third even more so,” Roy Hodgson said. “It wasn’t even an attack. It was a clearance. There’s no point allowing the penalty to disturb the way you want to play irrespective of whether you disagree with why it was given.”\n\nBrighton, victorious in a top-flight fixture between these teams for the first time since 1981, confirmed one supporter had been ejected for apparently throwing a pie at Zaha.

After seeing Lukasz Fabianski save Joe Ralls’s limp penalty when this strange game was in the balance, they were forced to endure the indignity of West Ham strutting around long before the final whistle. Even Andy Carroll, given a chance to stretch his legs after returning from his latest injury, was joining in the fun as the impudent Felipe Anderson led the showboating in the closing stages.\n\nCardiff, two points above the bottom three, had to suck it up after wasting a chance to claim their first away win this season. It felt ominous for West Ham when Marko Arnautovic, their main source of inspiration, suffered a hamstring injury shortly before half-time. Nobody inside the London Stadium imagined West Ham would start the second half with a 12-minute blitz that featured the rare sight of a couple of piercing strikes from Lucas Pérez.\n\nShane Duffy sees red but 10-man Brighton too strong for Crystal Palace Read more\n\nThe former Arsenal striker’s first league goals since January 2017 provided the platform for Manuel Pellegrini to claim his first consecutive wins in the Premier League since replacing David Moyes as manager. West Ham, up to 12th place, are starting to sense the pieces are falling into place. They have an inviting run of fixtures over the Christmas period and find themselves five points off sixth.\n\nHowever, their true level will remain hard to judge until they become sharper at both ends of the pitch. Pellegrini, who revealed Jack Wilshere was absent because of an ankle problem, was unhappy with his side for failing to kill off Cardiff when they were on top in the first 25 minutes. “We started very well,” he said. “After that we didn’t make good movements to create space.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lukasz Fabianski saves Joe Ralls’ first-half penalty. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nHaving survived the early storm, Cardiff moved past the halfway line. The sudden threat caught West Ham by surprise and Arnautovic, who had seen a shot cleared off the line by Sean Morrison, gifted the visitors a penalty when he shoved Junior Hoilett. “Absolutely unnecessary,” Pellegrini said, though Fabianski came to the rescue when he smothered the timid effort.\n\nAs for Arnautovic, his night went from bad to worse when pain shot up his left hamstring as he tried to reach a pass from Anderson. The Austrian will be assessed on Wednesday, but he could face a long spell on the sidelines.\n\nSign up for The Fiver.\n\nCardiff sensed an opportunity to build on last Friday’s victory over Wolves at that stage. Neil Warnock had urged his players to target Michail Antonio, struggling at right-back because Ryan Fredericks was unavailable to fill in for Pablo Zabaleta, and the visitors pressed down the left flank at the start of the second half, another low cross from Joe Bennett finding Víctor Camarasa, who ought to have done better than fire against Arthur Masuaku from close range.\n\nManchester City given late scare by Watford’s Abdoulaye Doucouré Read more\n\nThis time West Ham punished Cardiff’s profligacy, Camarasa’s error allowing Robert Snodgrass to lift a clever pass through to Pérez. Arnautovic’s replacement showed fine technique with a left-foot drive that had too much fizz for Etheridge.\n\nPérez has made little impact since his £4m move from Arsenal in the summer. Yet the Spaniard was in his element now, producing another accurate finish with his left foot after being released by Masuaku. “Lucas did very well,” Pellegrini said. “I hope he will continue in the same way.”\n\nCardiff’s woes increased when Antonio, shrugging off Harry Arter and darting in front of Callum Paterson, headed in Snodgrass’s corner in the 61st minute. “It showed we can win games away from home tonight,” Warnock said. “I pulled Manuel aside in the technical area and asked, ‘How can we be losing 3-0 to you?’ He went, ‘I don’t know’.\n\nWarnock went on to bemoan the individual errors that led to West Ham’s goals.

Luckily for Pep Guardiola the luxury of rotation comes easily to a squad replete with talent. Like a member of the Magic Circle performing tricks with a subtle sleight of hand, six of the starting selection that cantered past Bournemouth on Saturday moved out of the picture, replaced by a new set at Watford. Now you see Raheem Sterling, Aymeric Laporte and Ilkay Gündogan. Now you don’t. Now you see Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Riyad Mahrez instead. See what he did there?\n\nCity being City, half a team’s worth of switches led to no great discernible change in the overall pattern of play, collective confidence and end result.\n\nThat was certainly the case for the vast majority of this match. Dominant, controlling, enjoying long stretches of comfortable possession, two smartly worked goals from the purposeful Leroy Sané and Mahrez created a platform for a seemingly inevitable victory. So it was a shock for the story to produce a late twist, to go off at a very unexpected tangent.\n\nCallum Wilson keeps Bournemouth on high despite Huddersfield onslaught Read more\n\nAbdoulaye Doucouré bundled in an 85th-minute goal and City ended the match sucked into a pressure situation. Defending set pieces, all hands to the pump, nerves on edge, it was a reminder of how quickly, and how dangerously, control can evaporate.\n\nWhile not exactly welcoming that reminder, Guardiola did use the moment to press home the message to his players. “We spoke now in the locker room. We have to learn what happened in last 25 minutes. Never you can forget to play,” he said.\n\n“We lost a little bit our control. We suffered. The normal process is to win and improve. In general, I am satisfied. We will talk, we will visualise, if you let opponent play in last few minutes you can face problems.”\n\nUltimately, though, City returned to Manchester with three more points, and reimposed a five-point lead at the head of the Premier League, reloading the pressure on the chasers. They inflicted a fourth home defeat from their past five games here for Watford, which is a worry for Javi Gracia, but if there is ever a fixture to shrug and accept some punishment, then this is it.\n\nShane Duffy sees red but 10-man Brighton too strong for Crystal Palace Read more\n\nBen Foster must have suspected he would be in for a busy evening and he began in inspired form. Watford’s keeper showed wolfish persistence to produce a miraculous triple save in the 18th minute. City looked odds on to score when Kompany slipped an inviting pass for Mahrez, whose efforts were quickly followed up by Bernardo Silva and David Silva.\n\nFoiled three times in a matter of seconds, City might have perhaps spent half a second wondering whether it might be one of those almost impossibly rare nights.\n\nWatford found moments to show a flicker of ambition. Roberto Pereyra jinked into position and swept in a shot. On the half-hour, Doucouré flicked the ball over his head and it arced perfectly into Troy Deeney’s path. The crowd gasped. The forward steered his shot straight and Ederson grabbed hold of it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Abdoulaye Doucouré scores in the 85th minute to set up a late Watford rally. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe moment passed and City began pressing again. Five minutes before half-time, Watford’s resistance was broken in uncommon fashion by Sané. Mahrez spotted the German on the far side and as the ball was floated over he improvised to deal with the height it arrived at in the most efficient manner by sending it past Foster with a jut of cushioned chest control.\n\nCity extended their lead just after the break and the goal was symbolic of how they are able to force errors in opponents who look as if they are finding it hard to breathe when the blue shirts start to press.\n\nWatford had a throw in their own defensive third and City simply gobbled it up. David Silva threaded the ball to Gabriel Jesus, whose cross was guided past Foster by Mahrez.\n\nSome of the footwork on display from Sané, David Silva and Mahrez was breathtaking. There was almost sympathy for Jesus, whose low confidence and spurning of chances in front of goal really stood out.

More revealing was the fact the defeated manager, Claudio Ranieri, departed the more encouraged and citing reasons to be cheerful while Maurizio Sarri, victorious in a grind of a derby, bemoaned the nerves that had gripped his own team’s approach.\n\nChelsea v Fulham: Premier League - live! Read more\n\nAt no point, aside from celebrating his side’s goals, had Chelsea’s head coach given the impression he was satisfied as he prowled the edge of his technical area. The fallout from the first defeat of his stewardship, against Tottenham Hotspur the previous weekend, had actually rumbled on disconcertingly through this fixture. He recapped his frustrations from that loss at Wembley in his post-match assessment, reminding all present that “Eleven players had played very badly at Spurs, so today it was natural to give them another chance”.\n\nThey had come steeled by the pep-talk delivered in one-on-one meetings with Sarri earlier in the week but for all that they started eagerly for once and scored in the opening 20 minutes of a Premier League game for the first time since mid-August, insecurities had flared thereafter. Their display had been anxious in the second half.\n\n“But this was only about the result,” said Sarri. “We were a bit nervous. It wasn’t easy the days after Tottenham for me and the players, but I think that we have thought too much about that match. We lost one match after three and a half months. It can happen. So today it was important to react.”\n\nThey can prepare for Wednesday’s trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the hope normal service has been resumed. Certainly the slick construction of their second goal, all neat inter-play between Eden Hazard, Pedro and Ruben Loftus-Cheek on the edge of Fulham’s box, was a reminder of their qualities. Hazard’s burst into the penalty area drew opposing defenders to the ball, with the pass poked sideways duly liberating Loftus-Cheek into space vacated by Maxime Le Marchand. The England midfielder’s finish was emphatic, a fifth goal in six club games completing the success. He continues to stake his claim for greater involvement.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nRanieri’s shoulders rather slumped at that concession though, for all that he has seen his team ship four goals in two matches since his appointment, there are signs of improvement in their defensive organisation. Their diamond midfield clogged up Chelsea’s approach play here, even if they opted against swarming all over Jorginho to disrupt the home side at source. Hazard and Pedro, the liveliest of Chelsea’s front-line, were forever collecting the ball, looking up and blanching at the sight of massed ranks of white shirts through whom they would have to pick a route to goal.\n\nHad Callum Chambers not been thwarted three times by Kepa Arrizabalaga, once particularly impressively, then they might even have forced parity. “It’s strange to tell, but I think we played much better today than in the Southampton match, which we won,” said Ranieri, whose team were spared further damage as Álvaro Morata skied a shot over an open goal. “We have to continue in this way.” His principal regret was that a week of careful preparation, in which he had drummed home how Sarri’s teams press feverishly, went forgotten four minutes in to present the home side with “a great present”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pedro’s early goal gave Chelsea the initiative over Fulham. Photograph: TGSPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIt had been Cyrus Christie’s unhelpful pass, fizzed forward into midfield, and Jean Michaël Seri’s marginally slack collection that had left Fulham prone. In scuttled N’Golo Kanté, a player around whom Ranieri built a title-winning team at Leicester City, to snaffle the ball and, having advanced, liberate Pedro at his side. Ranieri had spun round on his heels, flapping his arms in frustration as soon as Seri had been robbed, and had his back to the play as the Spaniard turned inside Alfie Mawson to finish with ease.\n\nThat was a reminder of what Kanté always did best, either intercepting or stealing the ball under pressure, allied with everything Sarri is hoping he can become: forward thinking, aware and careful in the pass. The Frenchman has come in for criticism in the last few weeks with his new head coach unconvinced he boasts the technique to thrive as his midfield pivot. He is still teaching the World Cup winner the tactical awareness required to play in a three alongside Jorginho. Sarri could recall only one positioning error in this display. “Maurizio is right to pick on him sometimes, to improve him,” said Ranieri of his former player. “But N’Golo played a very good match.”"}, {"date": "02/12/2018", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59973, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Bernd Leno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

Unai Emery and his re-energerised team have built momentum and belief during the sequence, although they had not been able to beat a Big Six Premier League rival.\n\nThat changed on a wild afternoon in north London when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang continued his dead-eyed scoring exploits and Arsenal fought back from 2-1 down to register yet another come-from-behind win.\n\nSpurs face FA inquiry after fan throws banana skin at Arsenal’s Aubameyang Read more\n\nAubameyang got the equaliser for 2-2 – his second of the game – and he has now scored with his last 10 shots on target in the league. It was the substitute, Alexandre Lacazette, who put Arsenal in front with a shot that deflected off Eric Dier after a lapse from Juan Foyth and the outstanding Lucas Torreira added the gloss with his first goal in Arsenal colours.\n\nTottenham’s frustration was complete when Jan Vertonghen jumped into a rash challenge on Lacazette to earn a second yellow card on 85 minutes. They will reflect on how they had stabilised after Aubameyang’s early penalty only to be overrun towards the end. Mauricio Pochettino mentioned fatigue as a factor, in the wake of his team’s Champions League exertions against Internazionale last Wednesday. After six straight wins in all competitions this was a jolt.\n\nEmery deserved credit for how he reacted at 2-1 down, making bold attacking changes, the first of which saw Aaron Ramsey and a second striker, Lacazette, come on for the second half. At 2-2 Emery moved to a 4-4-2 diamond midfield system and, on each occasion, the dividends were immediate.\n\nIt was a rip-roaring derby, in which tempers were never far from boiling point and the atmosphere pulsed from the first whistle. Things spilled over after Dier had equalised for 1-1 when some of the Arsenal substitutes took exception to the Tottenham midfielder’s celebrations with his teammates. Stephan Lichtsteiner appeared to tap Dier and, as projectiles were thrown from the stand, players in red and white came together in a mass confrontation.\n\nRamsey, who was then off the field, had to be pulled apart from Dele Alli while another Arsenal substitute, Mattéo Guendouzi, rowed with Jesús Pérez, the Spurs assistant manager. There was plenty of pushing and shoving. Pochettino had run up the touchline to act as a peacemaker.\n\nArsenal started at breakneck pace and the touchpaper was lit when Aubameyang opened the scoring from the penalty spot and celebrated in front of the away supporters, who pelted him with missiles, including – most regrettably – a banana skin. The penalty was awarded when Vertonghen touched Granit Xhaka’s free-kick away from Shkodran Mustafi with his hand. Vertonghen was booked for the offence.\n\nArsenal were irrepressible in the opening 20 minutes, with Sead Kolasinac, in particular, making inroads from left wing-back. He cut one cross back for Alex Iwobi, who forced Hugo Lloris into a smart save with his legs. Moments later the other wing-back, Héctor Bellerín, saw a volley at the far post blocked by Ben Davies.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexandre Lacazette fires home Arsenal’s third. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nIt felt as though Arsenal might struggle to maintain the intensity and Spurs roared back into the game, turning it on its head before half-time. Alli had started off the left but he regularly tucked in behind Harry Kane and Son Heung-min and the visitors gained a foothold. Son showed his pace and threat with a series of darts, two of which saw him test Bernd Leno from tight angles.\n\nThe equaliser came from a Christian Eriksen free-kick, whipped in towards the near post, and it was a horror moment for Leno as he allowed Dier’s flick header to bounce, rear up above his hands and squirm inside the near post.\n\nArsenal’s Aubameyang seizes moment with all-action display against Spurs Read more\n\nThere was controversy when Spurs went ahead. Son had sprinted through again and Rob Holding jumped into a risky tackle but, when Son checked back, there was no contact from the Arsenal defender on him. Mike Dean still awarded the penalty and, after further arguments between rival players, Kane converted for his eighth goal in eight games against Arsenal. He has equalled Emmanuel Adebayor’s scoring record in north London derbies.\n\nMustafi hit the crossbar with a looping header in first-half stoppage time but Spurs were in the ascendancy and Emery made his double substitution at the interval. Arsenal were level soon enough. Bellerín curved a ball in behind Vertonghen and Ramsey twisted to hook it inside for Aubameyang. The striker bent a precision first-time finish inside the near post.\n\nAmid the bedlam it was easy to forget the sub-plot of Mesut Özil’s absence. Arsenal said that the playmaker had felt another of his back spasms but there was nevertheless plenty of eye-rolling when the teamsheets landed. It was easy to wonder whether Özil would have worked in Emery’s starting 3-4-2-1 formation.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSpurs flickered at the start of the second half, with Kane twice going close, but Arsenal – and Emery – turned the screw after the equaliser. Mustafi was denied by a goalline clearance by Alli and, after Son had tested Leno following a Bellerín error, Emery swapped Mustafi for Guendouzi and went to the midfield diamond.\n\nRamsey initiated Arsenal’s third goal when he robbed the dawdling Foyth and found Lacazette. There was fortune because the striker was slipping as he shot – there was also the deflection off Dier – and the best day of Arsenal’s season was complete when Torreira rolled away from Dier on to Aubameyang’s pass and shot into the corner."}, {"date": "02/12/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 51756, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson Ramses Becker",

Without it Liverpool would have left the pitch knowing Manchester City’s vastly superior goal difference at the top of the Premier League put the champions, in effect, five points clear. Origi’s winner dramatically changes the picture again. It was an incredible way to settle any match, let alone a derby, and Klopp’s celebration told its own story.\n\nFor Everton it was a crushing way to lose, culminating in a crestfallen Pickford holding up an apologetic hand to the corner of Anfield Road where their supporters were congregated. For long spells Everton had been superb, attacking stylishly, defending stubbornly and playing with an ambition that has rarely been associated with their visits to Anfield since the turn of the century. The bottom line, however, is that their miserable run against Liverpool is now 16 league games without a win, going back to October 2010, and to lose in such devastating circumstances will make it little consolation that they had contributed so richly to an absorbing contest.\n\nPickford’s role in the goal will inevitably be scrutinised and, plainly, the England international goalkeeper badly misjudged the trajectory of the ball. He was not alone, in fairness, but once he realised it was not going into the crowd he should probably have tried to tip the ball over for a corner. Maybe, so late into the game, he decided in that split second he would rather catch it. But he could not manage either, his fingertips helping to keep the ball in play, and his net was hopelessly exposed when – almost in slow motion – the ball dropped to Origi a yard or so from the line.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nUntil that point it would have been difficult to begrudge Everton a share of the points. Liverpool’s inability to break them down had already prompted Klopp to substitute Mohamed Salah with a quarter of an hour to play. Roberto Firmino was also removed, allowing Origi on the pitch. Sadio Mané and Xherdan Shaqiri had squandered Liverpool’s better opportunities and, when Origi had his first chance to be the hero, in the 87th minute, he could not take it, turning a close-range shot against the crossbar.\n\nLast-gasp derby error ensures away day blues continue to haunt Everton Read more\n\nIf nothing else, it must be encouraging for Everton’s supporters that their team could play so enterprisingly at the home of their nearest rivals. Too often Everton have made the trip across Stanley Park and seemed painfully aware of the imbalance of talent between the sides. Not here, though. Everton played with spirit, ambition and courage on the ball as if affronted by the fact they had not won a league game here since 1999.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jürgen Klopp dashes across the pitch after Liverpool scored a late winner to celebrate with his goalkeeper, Alisson. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images\n\nAs they reflect on how brutal this sport can be, Silva and his players will also think back to a number of scoring chances, particularly in the opening half. Yerry Mina headed the game’s first clear opportunity wide, six yards out, from a free-kick. Yet the biggest let-off for Liverpool came in the 20th minute when Alisson saved a point-blank header from André Gomes and, among a scramble of bodies, Joe Gomez managed to hook the ricochet off the goal-line. Gylfi Sigurdsson turned the loose ball against the post and that was a key moment. Gomes played well but really ought to have done better with the initial opportunity.\n\nUltimately, though, this match will always be remembered for what happened in the 96th minute – an injury to Idrissa Gueye had delayed the game after four minutes of stoppages were shown on the electronic board – and the wild scenes that followed. Silva tried to console Pickford at the final whistle but the damage was done and Anfield celebrated an extraordinary victory."}, {"date": "01/12/2018", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25098, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Luka Milivojevic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Max Meyer", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexander Sørloth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Guaita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The portents for this Selhurst Park encounter in terms of crackle and entertainment were not bright.

Having missed the chance to claim three points at Manchester United in their last, scoreless, encounter, they were confronted with an entirely different proposition.\n\nAndros Townsend’s quality second goal, after James McArthur’s slightly fortuitous first-half opener, was reward for the Palace manager, Roy Hodgson. On another slant Wilfried Zaha appeared at times to be on a solo quest in a duel against Burnley’s keeper Joe Hart, whose fine form prevented a mauling.\n\n“It’s been a long time coming and I’m equally pleased with the performance,” said Hodgson. “We haven’t been lucky at home. Results have been there in the shadow and they have eluded us but today it didn’t. It would be a curmudgeonly person to deny Palace [credit] today. It’s not often you have 30 attempts on goal.\n\n“This is one we needed to win but we got the points because we were better from start to finish.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James McArthur’s cross evades Joe Hart to give Palace the lead. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nNow in the bottom three, Burnley, meanwhile, were bereft of everything needed for survival and failed to register a single shot on target. Their manager Sean Dyche’s team are a dismal shadow of last season’s seventh-placed side. From a drizzly south London lens that heady Europa League qualification seems a world away. It looks as if everything has caught up with them, with visits to Tottenham and Arsenal coming up before Christmas.\n\nDyche refuses to panic. “The fear attached to football is an important factor,” he said. “You need that looseness to act naturally. That was off today and in the second half they deserved it.\n\n“The whole team performance is something to think about and when fear comes into performances you soften.\n\n“I don’t stare at the league table. We have to get back to a consistent level of performances. Today we slipped back again and need to find that consistency and performance. I knew in the summer this would be a real tough season.\n\n“I think I’ve been really loyal to players but we’ve been disrupted by injuries and it affects our growth as a team. We have to continually remodel and rethink.”\n\nAfter a zippy start, in which Max Meyer and Zaha were creatively prominent, Palace scored with 16 minutes gone. McArthur clipped in what appeared an innocuous low cross from the right and, with a combination of the Burnley defenders Matt Lowton and Kevin Long plus Palace’s Meyer failing to make contact, the ball somehow made its way into the far corner of the net.\n\nAfter that Palace and Zaha peppered the Burnley goal at will but there was still concern at their inability to complete the job until 12 minutes from time. It was worth the wait. After Zaha clipped the bar Townsend, gathering up a loose ball on the right, darted inside and shaped himself from 20 yards before rifling a fabulous shot into the top corner that not even Hart, who was on depressing damage limitation standby, could prevent.\n\nSign up for The Fiver."}, {"date": "01/12/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 22973, "home_team": {"name":

Their misery was underlined when Capoue was shown a red card a minute from the end.\n\nJavi Gracia, the Watford manager, said they will appeal against the dismissal: “It was in front of me but I prefer not to say anything apart from what Iheanacho said. He said Capoue didn’t touch him and it’s more important than what I say.\n\n“We dominated the possession, we had 62%, but it wasn’t enough to finish the action. We created the chances but we didn’t shoot on target.\n\n“We need to improve these situations. We are losing points because we are not efficient. When you score goals you feel more confident and maybe you finish better but when you don’t score you lose the confidence you need.”\n\nAndros Townsend stunner helps lift Crystal Palace away from danger Read more\n\nWatford began brightly enough and Abdoulaye Doucouré had an effort deflected over but they never recovered from Vardy’s penalty.\n\nBen Chilwell slipped Vardy through and the striker nipped in ahead of Foster, only for the goalkeeper to take him down. Vardy had scored once here this season but he confidently sent Foster the wrong way from the spot. Since the start of 2014-15, Vardy has won 14 penalties in the Premier League, more than any other player.\n\nWatford had won once in their previous 11 trips to Leicester and their task got harder after 23 minutes when Maddison made it 2-0.\n\nLeicester were comfortable and Demarai Gray fired wide 10 minutes before the break before Success should have pulled a goal back. The striker broke away with Gerard Deulofeu and wriggled goalside of Nampalys Mendy only to shoot wastefully over with just Kasper Schmeichel to beat.\n\nİlkay Gündoğan seals Manchester City victory over dogged Bournemouth Read more\n\nWatford tried to rally after the break and Ricardo Pereira denied Success a certain goal when he reached Deulofeu’s cross ahead of the striker.

the rest of the competition that, even with big names missing, they can keep up their scoring average of three goals per game. City do function better, however, when David Silva is involved and, though the Spain midfielder came on for only the last 13 minutes, it was enough to make the point.\n\n“We were flat at times but that’s normal when you play a lot of matches,” Pep Guardiola said. “I’m still delighted with the win, because one or two big teams will drop points this weekend. Maybe we weren’t good for the whole 90 minutes but we did enough in 75 to win the game. I don’t know what Leroy Sané ate before the game but I am going to show him the video and try to get him to eat it again. Next time he complains about not playing, I’ll tell him if he plays like that he will be in the side.”\n\nGuardiola rested several key players following City’s midweek exertions against Lyon, though the home side retained enough pace to trouble Bournemouth in the form of Sané and Raheem Sterling on the flanks. The former was particularly effective in the first half, regularly running on to well-struck passes from Ilkay Gündogan or Oleksandr Zinchenko to find space in behind Bournemouth’s flattish back five.\n\nAndros Townsend stunner helps lift Crystal Palace away from danger Read more\n\nThe first goal arrived in just such a manner, Zinchenko aiming a ball into the penalty area for Sané to attempt to reach first. The winger managed to stay onside and sprint clear of the Bournemouth defenders and, though Asmir Begovic left his line to try to cut out the danger, he was unable to make a clean catch because Sané was in such close attendance. Begovic succeeded in clearing the immediate threat from Sané but only at the expense of pushing the ball to Bernardo Silva, who unhesitatingly swept the ball into the unguarded net from close to the penalty spot.\n\nEderson, in the City goal, is currently rivalling David de Gea at Old Trafford for minutes spent merely watching games without being directly involved, but like his counterpart at Manchester United he keeps up his concentration so as to be ready when called on. Bournemouth might have equalised a few minutes before Callum Wilson brought them level when the same player got on the end of a Josh King cross, though his touch was hardly emphatic and the hitherto unemployed Ederson made a sprawling save. Wilson made amends for the miss a minute before the interval, this time getting above Nicolás Otamendi and Danilo to meet Simon Francis’s cross and give Ederson little chance with a firm and well placed header.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Callum Wilson climbs above two Manchester City defenders to head Bournemouth level just before half-time. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTurning round level was no more than Bournemouth deserved. City had enjoyed more than two thirds of the first-half possession but without David Silva seemed short of ideas of how to use it. Gabriel Jesus was inconspicuous as an attacking spearhead, and too many of the home side’s attempted attacks broke down on the edge of the area. Bournemouth gradually clawed their way back into the game as if surprised at how lightly they were being allowed to get off.\n\nAs Ryan Fraser and Andrew Surman started to pass the ball around City’s 18-yard line, gaps appeared and, as the interval approached, Bournemouth were attacking with the sort of conviction that eventually brought a reward.\n\nSign up for the Fiver.\n\nEddie Howe’s team began the second half brightly too, with Wilson straight away getting ahead of Aymeric Laporte to set up a chance for King. City went down the field to hit the post at the other end, Sterling ending an adventurous dribble with a slightly tame shot that deflected off Steve Cook to strike an upright. Undeterred, Sterling started and finished City’s second goal just before the hour, first setting up Danilo for a shot, then moving up to tuck away the rebound when the winger’s effort was blocked by a combination of Begovic and Nathan Aké.\n\nEven when back in the lead City showed signs of easing up again, so Guardiola sent on David Silva just to be on the safe side. It was a shrewd move. The substitute had been on the field precisely two minutes when he came up with the pass of the match, freeing Sané to cross from the goalline and leave Gündogan an easy close-range finish. “City have individuals who can hurt you but I thought the goals were scrappy from our perspective,” Howe said. “I think that’s the closest we’ve come to matching them. At least we managed to limit them in terms of clear-cut chances.”"}, {"date": "01/12/2018", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51853, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Martin Dubravka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Schär", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [54]}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [54], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Longstaff", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Freddie Woodman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabián Balbuena", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Issa Diop", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [32], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Felipe Anderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11, 63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Felipe Anderson will surely haunt DeAndre Yedlin’s memory for some considerable time. The Brazilian’s devastatingly intelligent change of pace periodically unhinged Newcastle’s entire back four but, as his specific marker, the USA right-back endured a particularly chastening match. His sense of self-esteem may take a while to recover.\n\nIf Anderson destabilised his hosts, Newcastle suffered the further indignity of dissection by Robert Snodgrass’s left-footed precision and were grateful Javier Hernández converted only two of the chances that came his way. By the time Anderson claimed a merited stoppage-time third, the sense of Geordie optimism engendered by a recent three-game winning run had long since evaporated.\n\nFlorin Andone strike takes Brighton past ten-man Huddersfield Read more\n\n“Felipe’s still learning the Premier League but he’s improving with every game,” said a contented Manuel Pellegrini who revealed Hernández’s recent appearances have been restricted by a virus. “I’m so happy for Javier,” said the West Ham manager. “He’s been five weeks ill.”\n\nAll in all it was a day on which the £100m invested by West Ham last summer seemed shrewd business, while Newcastle’s £20m transfer market profit appeared high-risk folly rather than prudence. “West Ham spent money on offensive players and that made the difference,” said Benítez, pointedly. “It’s a reminder of how tough things can be for us. If you don’t take your chances and another team has quality, this is what happens.”\n\nFortune began frowning on Newcastle as Hernández gave West Ham an 11th-minute lead, his goal coinciding with the late arrival of a minority of fans who had delayed their entry to the ground to precisely the same moment. The idea was to stage a “walk-in” protest to highlight the overall awfulness of Mike Ashley’s 11-year ownership but it rather backfired. As West Ham celebrated, the stragglers took their seats to a volley of boos from the majority of supporters who feared the demonstration would undermine the home performance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Javier Hernández scores in the 11th minute, as some Newcastle fans entered the ground late in protest over Mike Ashley’s ownership. Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle Utd via Getty Images\n\nSure enough, as soon as the militants started shuffling in, Newcastle’s defence suffered a concentration lapse and Javier Manquillo allowed Snodgrass sufficient space to curl in a gorgeous left-foot, right-wing, cross. All that remained was for the unmarked Hernández to time his connecting run perfectly before extending his right foot and sweeping the ball beyond Martin Dubravka from close range.\n\nNewcastle may claim they were distracted by those ripples of movement in the Gallowgate End but Manquillo, recalled for a rare outing at left-back, already looked a weak link against Snodgrass. Had Rafael Benítez really been right to disregard the old “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” maxim and abandon the back three who had served him so well at Burnley last Monday? That trinity’s dismantling left Ciaran Clark, very much the hero of Turf Moor, warming the home bench alongside Jamaal Lascelles and Jonjo Shelvey. As Anderson’s incisive advances down the left of Pellegrini’s 4-4-2 formation illuminated the rainiest and gloomiest of Tyneside December afternoons, the latter pair surely saw their chances of swift recalls enhanced.\n\nLeicester’s James Maddison sinks Watford with sublime volley Read more\n\nWith a sodden, awkwardly tricky surface ensuring chances came and went at both ends, no one was entirely in control and Ayoze Pérez spurned three decent openings for Newcastle. Until Hernández registered his second, West Ham’s lead always looked fragile. When Declan Rice hooked a ball forward, the sporadically brilliant Marko Arnautovic flicked a header down into the path of Hernández, whose surge into the area concluded with a low shot, side-footed beyond Dubravka. Like Pérez, the Mexican had missed some decent openings but he finally scored again by converting surely the most difficult of the lot.\n\nNot to be eclipsed, Anderson appropriately enjoyed the last word, connecting with the substitute Jack Wilshere’s slick counterattacking pass and shooting left-foot into the bottom corner. By then Pérez had been withdrawn – and jeered off – after fluffing a close-range header and a couple of shots – not to mention looking an ersatz No 10. Small wonder Benítez is desperate to sign Atlanta United’s £25m-rated Paraguay playmaker Miguel Almirón next month.

Scoring was a problem for Southampton even before Hughes’s arrival in March and, with neither Manolo Gabbiadini nor Charlie Austin finding the net in the Premier League this season, Hughes perhaps felt he had little to lose in turning to Obafemi in the absence of the injured Danny Ings.\n\nMourinho, meanwhile, opted against giving a Premier League debut to a teenager, leaving Diogo Dalot on the bench and deploying Ashley Young as a right wing-back instead. But the real intrigue in his selection was elsewhere: with only one fully fit centre-back available he nonetheless set his team up with a three-man backline, with Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic flanking Phil Jones. Marouane Fellaini was assigned patrol duties just in front of that trio, while Ander Herrera and Paul Pogba were intended as the central conduits to a front pair of Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford.\n\nWith Juan Mata, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard relegated to the bench, it looked as if Mourinho had sent out a team whose priority was to contain a side that have won only once at this venue in 2018. The fact that Mourinho was deprived of defenders and had a surplus of attackers at his disposal made his approach all the more perverse.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cédric Soares celebrates with Nathan Redmond after doubling Southampton’s lead.

Instead the chance came from a blunder by Alex McCarthy, who missed the ball entirely as he attempted to clear. Rashford cleverly kept it in play with a backheel but Lukaku could not convert, McCarthy recovering to block his shot.\n\nIf Lukaku’s attempted finish betrayed the lack of conviction of a striker who had not scored in his 12 previous matches, Armstrong soon produced a shot fuelled by the confidence of netting twice last week at Fulham. Southampton’s opening goal in the 13th minute was beautifully worked, too. Nathan Redmond went on a skilful dribble before feeding Obafemi at the edge of the area. The 18-year-old picked out Armstrong in space on the right hand side of the box and the Scot crowned the buildup with an immaculate finish, driving low into the far corner.\n\nUnited got worse before they got better. In the 19th minute Rashford conceded a free-kick just outside his own area. Soares, deployed in an unfamiliar left-back role, produced a finish more commonly associated with his compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo, curling over the wall and beyond the reach of David de Gea.\n\nSouthampton were looking vibrant but their woes are too deeply ingrained to be forgotten. When United, inspired by Rashford, woke up, Southampton became dishevelled at the back. After shrugging off a tackle by Maya Yoshida, Rashford slipped in Lukaku, who showed no hesitation this time, blasting a shot into the net from 12 yards. Six minutes later Rashford created the equaliser, dashing into the box before pulling a low cross back to the near post, where Herrera finished with an artful flick.\n\nJavier Hernández double helps West Ham end Newcastle’s winning run Read more\n\nThat was as good as United got. There was no rage for victory, no yearning to assert their superiority. Fellaini went close with a header after a free-kick by Young in the 51st minute and then, nothing. Much of the play was scruffy, neither team finding fluency and both guilty of misplaced passes and misjudged tackles. It was low-grade fare.\n\nRashford flickered for United, and Obafemi was an exception for Southampton, showing precocious composure and deft touches before being replaced by Gabbiadini after the hour. The youngster could have been awarded a penalty just before that but the referee deemed an ungainly tackle by McTominay to have been fair. Hughes, unsurprisingly, expressed a contrary view from the sideline. Dalot made his introduction in the 72nd minute in place of Luke Shaw, who had to limp off.\n\nLukaku, despite ending his drought, generally lumbered to little effect up front, partly because of inadequate service. Neither team threatened a winner, although Redmond forced De Gea to bat a long-range shot over the bar in the 80th minute."}, {"date": "30/11/2018", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 30213, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sol Bamba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aron Gunnarsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Paterson", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "Lee Peltier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Smithies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Mendez-Laing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kadeem Harris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romain Saiss", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Conor Coady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Boly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Doherty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [18], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "João Moutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rúben Neves", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Vinagre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Raúl Jiménez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hélder Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ivan Cavaleiro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Gibbs-White", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diogo Jota", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Giles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leo Bonatini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "On the eve of his 70th birthday, Neil Warnock could not have scripted it any better. Love him or loathe him, it is impossible not to admire Warnock’s longevity and this was another victory for the Yorkshireman to cherish as Junior Hoilett produced a moment of individual brilliance to give his manager the perfect present and lift Cardiff out of the relegation zone.\n\nTrailing to Matt Doherty’s first-half goal, Cardiff showed spirit and character in abundance to come from behind and win at home for the third time this season. They are a Warnock team in every sense in that respect and it is starting to look as though Cardiff’s relegation from the Premier League is not the foregone conclusion that many predicted it would be. “We’ve given ourselves a chance,” Warnock said. “But we’re not getting carried away.”\n\nCardiff v Wolves: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nWolves have far grander ambitions than Premier League survival but their promising start to the season has fizzled out and it will be fascinating to see how Nuno Espírito Santo, their manager, handles an alarming slump in form. The man who could do no wrong last season has now presided over a dismal run in which his team have collected only one point from a possible 18, with the back-to-back defeats against Huddersfield and Cardiff particularly worrying because of the way that Wolves have lost control of both matches.\n\nFrom the moment that Aron Gunnarsson equalised midway through the second half, after a bad goalkeeping mistake by Rui Patrício, Wolves looked anxious and vulnerable and it was no real surprise when Cardiff struck again. The same could not be said for the identity of the scorer, however, given that Hoilett had gone six years without a Premier League goal and was not exactly enjoying his best evening in a Cardiff shirt.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Doherty pounces on the loose ball and fires the ball into the roof of the net to give Wolves the lead. Photograph: Kieran McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nEverything fell into place for the Canadian, though, when he picked up possession on the edge of the penalty area, wide on the left, and curled a glorious right-footed shot that arced over the head of Patrício and into the top corner. “Vincent [Tan, the owner] will be delighted because he always says we don’t shoot enough,” said Warnock, who sprung a surprise by playing with three at the back.\n\nAlthough Warnock claimed victory was no sweeter on the back of the furious row that overshadowed the meeting between the two clubs in April, when the Cardiff manager had reacted angrily to Nuno’s decision to run on to the pitch at the final whistle without shaking his hand, the outcome here must have been particularly gratifying for him.\n\nFor Nuno, there are more questions than answers right now and he has to find a way of instilling some self-belief into his players prior to Wednesday’s visit of Chelsea. “After the equaliser the game became difficult and that was the moment we lost a bit of control,” he said. “We stuck together as a team but individually we have to raise our standards in the moments that can define games. We had numerous situations to cause more damage to Cardiff.”\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWolves were ahead as early as the 18th minute, when Doherty marked his 200th league appearance for the club by sweeping home at the far post after Neil Etheridge had repelled Raul Jiménez’s header. Gunnarsson, caught on his heels, should have been marking Doherty but he atoned for that error in the second half. Patrício found himself in no man’s land when Harry Arter, who had earlier hit the upright, lofted a high ball into the area, Sean Morrison flicked it on and Gunnarsson acrobatically hooked home from four yards out.\n\nRoared on by raucous home support, Cardiff were now buoyant and Hoilett, rolling back the years, relished the chance to take centre stage with his splendid goal. “In the Premier League you’ve got to have ability and skill but it does nothing without character, determination and togetherness,” Warnock said. “This is why I’m still in the game.”"}, {"date": "26/11/2018",

not even managed to score – though at the moment it does not take a great deal of luck or superstition to break down the Burnley defence.\n\nHad Matt Ritchie not come up with a candidate for miss of the season in the second half, the visitors’ win would have been even more emphatic. Newcastle have now taken nine points from their past three games to leave Burnley looking over their shoulder at signs of improvement in the sides below them. The Clarets need to stop leaking goals before they can form any mid-table designs of their own. “We are giving away too many soft goals, we know that,” Sean Dyche said. “But at the same time we could do with a scratch of luck.”\n\nLuke Shaw: You need thick skin to play for José Mourinho’s Manchester United Read more\n\nAfter a half-hour delay due to the referee’s assessor needing medical attention in the tunnel, Newcastle had the brightest of starts. Upfield for an early corner, Federico Fernández tried his luck with a shot when the chance came his way, and Ben Mee’s attempt to get in the way only succeeded in sending the ball beyond Joe Hart’s reach. It was a debatable own goal because the initial attempt may have been on target, but the goalkeeper probably had the shot covered before the Burnley captain’s intervention.\n\nChris Wood had the best couple of chances as Burnley attempted to draw level. He could not keep his shot down from the first one, failing to properly get hold of a raking ball from Matt Lowton that reached him at the far post, though he did much better from a lot further out with his next effort, producing a 30-yard shot that almost caught Martin Dubravka by surprise.\n\nJust as Burnley were enjoying more of the game, however, Newcastle delighted their vociferous support by scoring again. Goals have not been plentiful for Newcastle this season, and even the most rabid supporters would have been expecting a Rafa Benítez side to sit on an early lead, at least until half-time, but midway through the first half the visitors again took advantage of hesitant defending at a corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Ritchie sidefoots the ball wide with the goal at his mercy in the second half. Photograph: Jon Super/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nRitchie played a one-two with Ki Sung-yueng before sending over a cross from the right that Ciaran Clark reached ahead of Mee to glance a header into Hart’s bottom-right corner. Both captains were therefore on the scoresheet before the half-hour stage, unfortunately for Mee and Burnley both in the same net.\n\nDefensive solidarity used to be a plank of Burnley’s survival platform, they would not allow opponents many scoring opportunities and worked on being well-drilled at dead-ball situations. This season they have been conceding goals at a rate of slightly more than two per game, and without making Newcastle work particularly hard put themselves at the same disadvantage with barely a quarter of the match gone.\n\nIt says something for Burnley’s spirit that they did not give up trying at the other end. Mee made some amends for his earlier errors with the diagonal ball from halfway that allowed Sam Vokes to pull a goal back, though most of the credit should go to the striker for a masterful header from the edge of the area. It takes power and accuracy to score an aerial goal from that far out, but spotting that Dubravka was standing a few yards off his line Vokes directed his effort upwards and over him.\n\nQuick guide Newcastle end their Monday night misery Show Hide Newcastle’s dismal record in Monday night Premier League matches kicking off at 8pm has come to an end after 10 losses – all away from home Dec 2012: Fulham a L2-1\n\nAug 2013: Man City a L4-0\n\nSep 2013: Everton a L3-2\n\nApr 2014: Arsenal a L3-0\n\nSep 2014: Stoke a L1-0\n\nApr 2015: Liverpool a L2-0\n\nSep 2015: West Ham a L2-0\n\nMar 2016: Leicester a L1-0\n\nOct 2017: Burnley a L1-0\n\nApr 2018: Everton a L1-0\n\nNov 2018: Burnley a W2-1\n\nThe keeper was in action again, beating away a fierce shot from Wood in the closing seconds of the half. Burnley had made a terrible start, though by half-time they were the side looking most likely to score next.\n\nFor all that, the home side were allowed a scarcely believable reprieve at the start of the second half, when Ritchie managed to miss an open goal from a distance best measured in inches. DeAndre Yedlin made such inroads into the area after catching Robbie Brady napping he almost scored himself, but Hart managed to get a boot in the way and the ball rolled across the face of goal. Arriving at speed from the left Ritchie seemed certain to score, yet although a tap-in was all that was required he shot into the side-netting.\n\nCity will be seen as failures without Champions League title, says Guardiola Read more\n\nNewcastle spurned another opportunity to make the game safe 10 minutes from time, when Joselu ghosted behind the defence to reach Ayoze Pérez’s inspired pass, only to crash his shot against an upright.\n\nVokes and Wood went close for Burnley before the end, but with a little more composure in front of goal Newcastle could have been looking at a handsome Monday night victory. “I didn’t see what happened with the Ritchie miss, I still need to see the replay, but we could laugh about it at the end,” Benítez said. “It was a pity we could not get a third goal but we took three points from a good side.

his behalf by the club’s managing director, Vinai Venkatesham, came a result that pushed the Spaniard closer towards that objective at the first time of asking. Victory over Bournemouth puts Arsenal one point behind fourth-placed Chelsea and extends their unbeaten run to 17 games. Little wonder manager and players looked pleased with their afternoon’s work at the final whistle.\n\nBournemouth too ‘demanding’ for dropped Mesut Özil, says Unai Emery Read more\n\nThe travelling supporters located in the far corner of the East Stand were also in jubilant mood, yet it would be wise for all involved to not get too carried away. After all, these remain early days and much more will be known about Arsenal’s ability to not only get into the Champions League places but stay there after their next two games – Sunday’s visit of Tottenham followed by the midweek trip to Manchester United. Overall, however, this was an encouraging occasion for Emery’s men. They displayed character and determination against spirited and talented opponents and, while not at their fluent best, showed enough in attack to justify a first win in four games.\n\nNot that Eddie Howe saw it that way after watching his side slip to their third successive defeat and eighth spot in the table. Bournemouth’s manager was “disappointed with the result” and felt his team could have earned at least a draw had certain decisions gone their way, most notably David Brooks’s goal on eight minutes that was ruled out for offside following a neat one-two with Joshua King. It was a tight call by the assistant referee on the near side but, as replays showed, appeared to be the right one.\n\nHowe was also left to rue his side’s lack of luck, no more so than in regards to Arsenal’s opener on 30 minutes, resulting as it did from one of the most jaw-dropping own goals those watching, here as well as on television, are likely to have ever seen.\n\nBournemouth appeared to be facing only minimal danger when Sead Kolasinac collected Alex Iwobi’s through pass and delivered a cross from the left side of the hosts’ area. But then arrived the outstretched leg of Jefferson Lerma after he had charged back to help his defenders. It was a valiant attempt but led to the Colombian midfielder firing a first-time, and completely unstoppable, volley past Asmir Begovic.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“Bizarre” is how Howe described the own goal and it is credit to Lerma, on his 11th appearance for Bournemouth since arriving from Levante for £25m in August, that he did not let it wreck his day. Indeed, the 24-year-old came closest to salvaging a point for Bournemouth with a powerfully hit long-range drive on 84 minutes that clipped the far post.\n\nIt was during the closing moments that Arsenal had to dig deepest against a side who simply refused to lay down and die. Junior Stanislas twice went close to adding to King’s goal a minute into first-half stoppage time and ultimately there was an element of relief to the visitors’ celebrations. Yet, as Emery said, this was a game in which his players showed calm and generally controlled proceedings. The visitors enjoyed the majority of possession (59%) and territory (53%), and produced more shots on goal than Bournemouth – 15 compared with seven.\n\nWhat made Arsenal’s display particularly noteworthy was that it was carried out in a 3-4-2-1 formation. Emery had used the system only once previously, during last month’s 3-0 Europa League victory over Qarabag, and there were spells here when his players’ lack of familiarity with it showed. The three centre-backs – Shkodran Mustafi, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Rob Holding – occasionally appeared unsure of where they should be, while Henrikh Mkhitaryan, deployed as one of two inside forwards behind lone striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, generally struggled to make an impact, making Emery’s decision to keep Mesut Özil on the bench for the entirety of the contest especially puzzling.\n\nUnai Emery’s tough tactics bear fruit in victory over Bournemouth Read more\n\nHowever, those in mint green slowly but surely adapted to how their manager wanted them to function, with no one impressing more than Lucas Torreira. The Uruguayan was yet again outstanding in central midfield, regularly breaking up Bournemouth’s momentum with perfectly timed interceptions, while in possession he showed consistent assurance and purpose until his substitution on 79 minutes, having complained to Emery of tiredness.\n\nWith Alexandre Lacazette ruled out with a groin injury, Aubameyang was given the chance to play as a central attacker, rather than in his usual left-wing role, and he also impressed. The 29-year-old was constantly looking to unsettle Bournemouth’s defence and eventually pierced them on 67 minutes with a simple sliding finish – the result of clever movement between the hosts’ centre-backs, Steve Cook and Nathan Aké.\n\nThe goal, Aubameyang’s 10th of the season in all competitions, resulted from more good link-up play between Iwobi and Kolasinac and, as Emery was keen to stress, their left-sided partnership was definitely a positive aspect of Arsenal’s performance here. Indeed, perhaps the only real negative for the visitors was that they yet again failed to establish a half-time lead.\n\nThey were only seconds away from doing so but then Iwobi lost possession in Bournemouth’s area following an Arsenal corner and Ryan Fraser led a sweeping counterattack that resulted in King firing a well-hit curling drive into the top corner of Bernd Leno’s net."}, {"date":

trick. Fresh from some welcome winter sunshine during the international break, Huddersfield Town achieved their first away win of the season, courtesy of two goals from Aaron Mooy, to climb six places in the table.\n\nBottom of the league at the start of the day, David Wagner’s side departed the Black Country in the relative comfort of 14th place after outplaying Wolves, who were booed off by the home fans at the interval and again at full time.\n\nIt was the first time Huddersfield have scored more than one goal in a Premier League game since February – a run of 23 fixtures – and it is a measure of how well they played here that they could easily have scored three or four. “We hope we can continue to surf this wave,” Wagner said.\n\nWolves v Huddersfield: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nWolves, in contrast, were awful, totally unrecognisable from the team that have taken points off Manchester City, Manchester United and Arsenal this season. Perhaps most worryingly of all for their manager, they looked beaten from the moment that Mooy scored after six minutes. “The beginning of the game we felt we were never going to change the course of things,” Nuno Espírito Santo said.\n\nHuddersfield, in short, thoroughly deserved their victory on an afternoon when Wagner got his tactics spot on. The visitors outnumbered Wolves in central midfield, denying Rúben Neves and João Moutinho the time and space to get control of the game, and in Philip Billing they had the outstanding player on the pitch.\n\nA dynamic and effervescent presence, Billing must have covered almost every blade of grass and, crucially, made a superb goalline clearance to deny Raúl Jiménez an equaliser. “That was at least as important as a goal,” Wagner said. “Phil is a man now. He’s got this little bit of fighting spirit in his game which we always missed. He’s got the technique and the vision, he’s 6ft 6in, he has a throw-in and unbelievable shot – he has everything. He’s a very, very big talent.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aaron Mooy, left, sidefoots Huddersfield into a lead at Molineux. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nAlthough Billing’s clearance was a turning point in the game, it says everything that Nuno never even mentioned that moment afterwards. The Wolves manager looked and sounded every bit as exasperated as the supporters whose groans got louder and louder with every misplaced pass – and there were plenty of them.\n\n“Disappointing for us and our fans who deserved a better performance. Today we were very bad, and when you play bad you lose,” Nuno said. Asked what the reasons were for such a listless display, he added: “This is a job that I have to do this week, try to find out why. Everybody made mistakes. We didn’t have the ball. When we had it we lost it, we rushed ourselves, we were not compact; too far away from each other. A bad game. But credit to Huddersfield, I think they pressed us very well and deserved to win.”\n\nHuddersfield’s breakthrough turned out to be a sign of things to come as Billing released the overlapping Erik Durm, who intelligently picked out Mooy. Totally unmarked on the edge of the area, Mooy expertly steered a low shot into the bottom corner with his right boot. It was a lovely finish, and Steve Mounié should have added to it before half-time.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe introduction of Adama Traoré added some pace to the Wolves attack in the second half and it was the substitute’s cross that Jiménez headed past Jonas Lössl, Huddersfield’s goalkeeper, only for Billing to come to the rescue. As the game became stretched, Jiménez made a pig’s ear of another chance and Rui Patrício denied Alex Pritchard at the other end before Mooy sealed victory with a perfectly executed free-kick.\n\nSpotting a gap inside the near post, the Australian curled the ball around the outside of the wall and beyond Rui Patrício’s despairing dive to propel Huddersfield up the table.\n\n“We’ve known we are not as poor as maybe everybody thinks, because we have seen and played the games,” Wagner said. “This time it was different and I am very happy that the players got their reward.”"}, {"date": "24/11/2018", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30553, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

We were in a similar position last week, and you know when you play against a team of 10 men they are going to play a certain way.\n\n“You have either not got to concede, or you have to take advantage of it.

A team that held Chelsea scoreless last time out was confronted by opponents attempting to do the same at Goodison, and while it would be difficult to argue Everton did not deserve their hard-fought win there was less between the two sides than the league table might suggest.\n\n“I thought we made Everton look quite average,” a typically blunt Neil Warnock said. “If we’d played a little bit better we might have won, Everton were running out of ideas when they scored. It wasn’t a great goal but it cost us the game.” Silva pointed out, not unfairly, Everton could have won by a handsome margin with more clinical finishing. “We had chances to kill the game at the end but didn’t take them,” the Everton manager said. “I’m happy with the points, we were always expecting a tough match.”\n\nMo Salah strikes as 10-man Liverpool take three points at Watford Read more\n\nThe first half featured an amusing spat between heavyweight shoulder-bargers Yerry Mina and Callum Paterson, and a lively touchline discussion involving Silva and Warnock when the Cardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge was rightly booked for time-wasting, but little else that could properly be called exciting or entertaining.\n\nPerhaps that should not have come as a surprise. Everton are currently playing without a centre-forward, converted winger Richarlison occupying the role in only the most notional sense, while Cardiff’s front-man Paterson has only recently been pushed up from defence. As a result goalmouth action was in short supply. Everton kept trying ambitious passes from midfield without realising there was rarely anyone waiting in the area to pick them up. Paterson did shoot wide with the first chance of the afternoon following a mistake by Mina, though otherwise ploughed a lonely furrow as Cardiff’s only regular visitor to the Everton half.\n\nWhen Richarlison was presented with a centre-forward’s chance, from a Gylfi Sigurdsson free-kick that reached him towards the end of the first half, all he could manage was a tame header straight at Etheridge. While the home side enjoyed most of the possession the pre-interval worry was that their patient passing approach was failing to cause any alarm in the Cardiff defence. On the stroke of half-time André Gomes found room to send a cross fizzing across the face of goal only to see it beat everyone in a crowded penalty area, with a surprised Theo Walcott unable to get a telling touch at the far post.\n\nJamie Vardy salvages point for 10-man Leicester at Brighton Read more\n\nThe second half began more promisingly, when Bernard found Sigurdsson free in the box, though the Iceland international made his shooting angle tighter by turning away from goal and Sol Bamba was able to clear his effort off the line. The reprieve for Cardiff turned out to be short-lived. Theo Walcott broke clear just before the hour mark, and though Etheridge managed to stop the winger’s shot he was powerless to prevent Sigurdsson turning the ball into an unguarded net from close to the penalty spot.\n\nCardiff did not give up, they might have equalised had not Jordan Pickford proved equal to a terrific long shot from Victor Camarasa, though Everton wasted a succession of late opportunities to make the final scoreline more flattering. Ademola Lookman’s quick feet obliged Etheridge to make a save, and the goalkeeper was called upon again in the closing minutes to deny Richarlison. By the time Cenk Tosun had shot meekly at Etheridge when he really should have scored, Everton had only themselves to blame for a tense ending to the game when Cardiff forced a couple of corners.\n\nMuch to the home side’s relief, the visitors were unable to take advantage and Camarasa’s shot remained their only attempt on target.

of team character and a comeback all in one lurching 90 minutes surely amounts to a revelation in Fulham.\n\nThe benefit of having a managerial career lasting 32 years is that Claudio Ranieri had seen and been through enough to transmit a veneer of calm as Fulham scampered through the tense late exchanges of a helter-skelter game knowing the chance of an accident, a scramble, was well within reason. He kept his cool and offered a controlled round of applause at the end of it all.\n\nLeroy Sané double lights up Manchester City’s rout of West Ham Read more\n\nThere are only so many miracles one man can reasonably achieve and it spoke volumes that Ranieri’s overall satisfaction was shaded by the realism that defensive improvement remains core to the work ahead. “I saw a lot of things,” he said, knowingly. “We played a good match but conceded too many chances to the opponent. We need to improve tactically.”\n\nAs any good Italian man of football should, Ranieri is making Fulham’s goals against column a priority and they are the only club in England’s 92 yet to manage a clean sheet this season. Having said that the “small steps” they showed were encouraging. The positives thrilled the Craven Cottage crowd, who celebrated three fine goals of the sort that brought them to the Premier League with a reputation for aesthetic football, and a show of collective heart to react twice to setbacks during the match.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fulham’s new manager Claudio Ranieri signs autographs for fans before the game. Photograph: Marc Atkins/Getty Images\n\nThere were some standout performances. Aleksandar Mitrovic was a handful, back among the goals. Ryan Sessegnon excelled in creating chances. Tom Cairney, playing a more advanced No 10 role, was influential. Sergio Rico produced a string of important saves.\n\nSouthampton’s hunger to pounce on any Fulham uncertainty gave them the lead. Nathan Redmond chased down the ball and when Maxime Le Marchand only half-cleared, the energetic Stuart Armstrong surged on to steer the ball past Rico.\n\nFulham needed a spark of inspiration, needed to show they believed in themselves. Sessegnon took the initiative with a dipping long-range shot. Then they took collective responsibility to lift themselves as a team with a sweet passing move, sweeping the ball via seven different players, taking the scenic route to goal. The move took off as the ball zipped from Sessegnon to Cairney to Le Marchand. The Frenchman’s cross landed invitingly for Mitrovic to score by guiding his header into the far corner of the net. Craven Cottage erupted.\n\nSessegnon’s influence grew, and he demonstrated an excellent mix of technique and efficiency to carve Southampton open and help Fulham to score again. He zipped his way past Cédric Soares and angled a pass for André Schürrle to gobble up the chance with delight.\n\nJamie Vardy salvages point for 10-man Leicester at Brighton Read more\n\nWhen Michael Oliver blew the half-time whistle it signalled the first time Fulham had led since 1 September. Not that it lasted long. After Mitrovic was denied by Alex McCarthy the next meaningful attack fell to Southampton. Soares tried an intuitive back-heel and Armstrong had time to sprint on to the ball and lash an equaliser past Rico.\n\nWith the wind sucked out of their sails, how much character could Fulham muster? The answer was delivered with a sudden gust in the form of another well-worked goal. Cyrus Christie’s floated cross was glanced on by Sessegnon for Mitrovic to wallop the ball past McCarthy.\n\nSouthampton rallied. Rico beat away from Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and kept out a stoppage-time effort from Michael Obafemi. The loss piled pressure on Mark Hughes, and Southampton’s fans sang about getting sacked in the morning to their own man in the dugout.\n\nHughes considered his lot and expressed his disappointment that performances were not yielding points. “There is always noise,” he said. “You have to accept that. People get frustrated. It is a bit unfair as sometimes people smell blood. It doesn’t faze me. You just get on with it and do the job to the best of your ability.”\n\nNew manager bounce can be wonderful. The evidence, in the shape of Ranieri here, was unmistakable.\n\n“Fantastic character and fighting spirit – I ask just this,” he growled as he went off to digest an important win in the scheme of the

We played a game like it is only one more game but it is a game we really need to win.\n\n“This was the first of eight Premier League games until the end of December and my feeling is there was not enough from the heart.” Asked if the latter is something that should always be offered by his side, Mourinho agreed.\n\n“What’s the solution? You cannot change players’ natures dramatically. The solution is that probably I have to make certain choices based on heart and then probably I will blame myself. Because I will think heart is not enough and I am missing here some quality [and so possibly make compromised selections].”\n\nUnited were again bedevilled by a persistent problem: a one-paced tempo that has hampered them since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in May 2013.\n\nMourinho reinstated Romelu Lukaku and Paul Pogba following injury. They joined Matteo Darmian, making his second league start, and Juan Mata as the manager’s four changes, with Marcus Rashford, Ander Herrera, Marouane Fellaini and Alexis Sánchez all dropping out.\n\nRoy Hodgson made one adjustment, selecting Wilfried Zaha instead of Jordan Ayew, the former United man proving Palace’s best performer.\n\nUnited were the first to show. A Pogba ball was nodded back into Jesse Lingard’s path and his shot was blocked. Opposite United’s 4-2-3-1 Palace lined up in a classic Hodgson shape of 4-4-2 that had Zaha and Andros Townsend at its head.\n\nThis looked likely to waste Zaha if he received scant service and so it proved. When he dropped deep or pulled left to receive the ball suddenly United had a problem The first of these came 17 minutes in when Zaha took the ball from Max Meyer, shaped inside and let fly a curling effort that served as a warning.\n\nUnited’s response was to fashion their slickest move yet. Mata pinged the ball to Jesse Lingard who turned it to Pogba, whose shot forced a save from Wayne Hennessey.\n\nZaha was then close to profiting from an errant Lingard pass, the 26-year-old pulling the trigger in a flash. David de Gea – and Lingard – watched the ball go wide with relief.\n\nClaudio Ranieri has instant Fulham impact as Mitrovic sinks Southampton Read more\n\nUnited’s first-half display left many in the stadium disgruntled and a better second was sorely needed. Mata and Ashley Young set about trying to spark some improvement by probing down the left and the latter forced Hennessey into a sharp save. Lukaku pounced on the rebound to turn the ball home but was correctly adjudged – as Cheikhou Kouyaté had been on the stroke of half-time – to be offside.\n\nMourinho introduced Sánchez for the misfiring Pogba. When another replacement, Rashford, made a double-tackle, the Chilean suddenly had possession with Lukaku and Martial joining him in a red wave. Sánchez’s pass went awry, however, and another United attack faltered.\n\nNemanja Matic struggled on several occasions when trying to deal with Townsend.

For most of the game the visitors lacked spark but they illuminated proceedings with a brilliant move in the 67th minute that culminated in Mo Salah opening the scoring. Trent Alexander-Arnold added a second with an outstanding free-kick from 25 yards before Roberto Firmino topped off the scoring after a sweeping late counterattack.\n\nAlthough those goals gave the scoreline an emphatic look and took Liverpool to a better points tally than they have ever had at this stage of a campaign in the club’s illustrious history, they laboured at times here, a fact Jordan Henderson underlined by getting himself sent off for two shoddy tackles on his return from injury.\n\nEverton’s Gylfi Sigurdsson pounces to sink Cardiff City Read more\n\nJürgen Klopp accepted that both Henderson’s tackles merited bookings but said he was otherwise satisfied with his team’s display on the players’ return from international duty. “I know you always expect perfection but we had exactly one session to prepare for this game because the players came back on Thursday,” he said, arguing that in that context “it was a real mature performance” that demonstrated his team has evolved since last term. “In similar games last year we were not that convincing but we controlled [this match]. Controlling it and staying in that mode, being positive, that’s new for us. It was exactly how it had to be in our situation.”\n\nNot exactly, in fairness. Because Watford could have been awarded a penalty when the score was 0-0, as Will Hughes went down in the box after Andy Robertson waved a stray foot at him. Although the tackle was clearly mistimed, it was hard to tell whether he made contact with Hughes. Watford’s players claimed there had been an obvious foul but the referee, Jon Moss, disagreed. Shortly after that Liverpool went in front thanks to the first high-class move of the match.\n\nRobertson launched it with a dash down the left and then fed Roberto Firmino, who threaded a beautiful pass through to Sadio Mané. The Senegalese pulled it back to Salah, whose first-time shot gave Ben Foster no time to adjust. The goalkeeper got a touch on it but could not stop it from crossing the line. Salah celebrated with a double-handed gesture that looked a lot like the one that Sergio Ramos uses after scoring, but Klopp was mystified by suggestions that this might have been a dig at the Spaniard who caused Salah’s injury in last season’s Champions League final and is now engulfed in controversy in Spain.\n\nCrystal Palace hold Manchester United but Andros Townsend rues miss Read more\n\nThe biggest surprise about Salah’s goal was that Xherdan Shaqiri was not involved.

Then he created Liverpool’s other notable first-half chance, aiming a diagonal pass to Mané, who took a touch to tee himself up for an acrobatic volley on the run. Foster parried well. Then the Shaqiri-Salah double-act took centre stage again, with the Swiss floating a corner to his teammate at the back post. Salah got off a decent downward header from eight yards but Foster saved.\n\nWatford came from behind here to beat Tottenham in September but Liverpool never looked in danger of letting their lead slip. Instead, they extended it within nine minutes thanks to Alexander-Arnold’s superb free-kick.\n\nThe 20-year-old curled a 25-yard shot over the wall and into the corner of the net with such beguiling precision that Foster did not budge.\n\nDespite Henderson’s subsequent dismissal, Liverpool added a third, Robertson leading a counterattack before Firmino nodded in from close range after Foster

Manchester City comprehensively defeated West Ham in less than 40 minutes at the London Stadium, though both managers were too polite to admit it.\n\nPep Guardiola and Manuel Pellegrini insisted this had been a close contest, with the hosts creating more chances than the visitors, or at least more than they customarily give up. Pellegrini effectively attributed City’s hefty half-time advantage to moments of bad defending.\n\nFulham’s Aleksandar Mitrovic sinks Southampton to lift Claudio Ranieri Read more\n\nAll of this was true but the facts were selective. City went in at the interval 3-0 ahead with goals from David Silva, Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sané. West Ham created their chances only once the jig was up (and even then they did not take them).\n\nPellegrini was right to chastise his defence – and he hauled off the bamboozled Arthur Masuaku at half-time – but City’s forwards would likely have carved up that team however well they had played. They were just too good.\n\nWest Ham, lest we forget, spent £100m in the summer to challenge in the top half of the table and recruited a former Manchester City manager to help them do it . This was Pellegrini’s first encounter against his old employers since he left to make way for Guardiola, and his bold choice of formation – playing four forwards in an attacking 4-4-1-1 – fared no better than those of his predecessors. In four games between City and West Ham at their new home, the aggregate score is 17-1 to the visitors.\n\n“To win you must score,” Pellegrini said. “It’s difficult for me as a manager, when you lose, to say that there were a lot of useful things in this game. But unfortunately for us, we were weak in defending the first three goals.\n\n“I think before the first goal we were not intimidated. If you review the match you will see most of the play was in their half. The best thing we had today was that we kept playing exactly the same way even after the goals. We continued to try and created many chances to at least score a goal.”\n\nGuardiola, for his part, said: “Today we were lucky in some moments. They had two chances before half-time. We conceded more corners than usual. You see how they good they are with the forwards of [Marko] Arnautovic and [Michail] Antonio.\n\n“We were a little less stable because of the international break, but this is normal. You can see it has also effected the results of Real Madrid and Manchester United.”\n\nCity opened the scoring on 11 minutes from an innocuous situation, if there is such a thing with Guardiola’s team. Felipe Anderson surrendered possession just outside City’s box to Leroy Sané (the winger’s defensive work, alongside that of Sterling, earned praise from his manager). Soon enough the ball was at the other end with Sterling and two little movements opened the hosts up. Sterling bent a cross behind the back line, Silva darted beyond it and his finish was a tidy reverse clip past Lukasz Fabianski.\n\nMo Salah strikes as 10-man Liverpool take three points at Watford Read more\n\nNine minutes later the lead was doubled, Sterling tucking home at the back post after Sané had bewildered Pablo Zabaleta on the right-hand side. The third goal came 10 minutes before half-time and was just as simple as the others, Fernandinho looping a pass to Sterling. His first-time cross found Sané, who sent Fabian Balbuena sprawling and passed the ball past Fabianski.\n\nWest Ham’s big moment arrived just before the hour when Javier Hernández sent Antonio clear. The forward won the race and beat the onrushing Ederson but saw his shot cannon back off the post. Both Arnautovic and Balbuena had headed chances after that, but neither ended up on target. Sané, meanwhile, had one more opportunity, with the final kick of the match, and he volleyed it home.\n\n“Our biggest risk is the belief that we can not do better,” Guardiola said.

Do not get carried away, the manager has warned, there are many improvements to be made. And as for the Premier League title, well, do not look beyond Manchester City.\n\nChelsea had been due a defeat but, when it came against a rampant Tottenham team, it felt as though everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong, that all of Sarri’s worst fears crystallised at the same moment.\n\nTottenham 3-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHis team were shambolic at the back, where David Luiz endured a game to forget – when he is bad, he is really bad – but he was not the only one to blame. Chelsea were passive and error-strewn throughout, they started dreadfully and they flat-lined thereafter, as their unbeaten record disintegrated.\n\nIt was impossible to give any Chelsea player more than five out of 10 – apart from Eden Hazard, perhaps – and their woes were summed up when David Luiz hared into a challenge on Son Heung-min before Spurs’s third goal and kept on haring. He got nowhere near the ball and was last seen heading towards Wembley Park tube station. Son could not believe his luck and he finished inside the far post.\n\nSon was excellent but so were all of Spurs’s attacking players. Dele Alli’s early header got things started while Harry Kane added the second, albeit with the aid of a curious piece of ball escapology from David Luiz and a goalkeeping aberration from Kepa Arrizabalaga. Christian Eriksen probed with characteristic menace.\n\nBy the end, Tottenham were showboating – witness the substitute Érik Lamela sashaying away from Hazard – and, crazy as it sounds, they could be disappointed that they did not score seven or eight; Arrizabalaga made a few smart saves.\n\nThat was to split hairs. This was as good a performance as anything from the Mauricio Pochettino era and it was shaped by the manager’s tactical plan. Whereas Sarri is wedded to 4-3-3, Pochettino sprang a surprise with a 4-3-1-2 system, in which Alli played behind the strikers, Son and Kane. Sarri admitted that he had been taken aback by the move.\n\nPlay Video 0:49 'It was a disaster': Sarri rues Chelsea's defensive fragility in Spurs defeat – video\n\nPart of the idea was for Alli to mark Jorginho, Chelsea’s deep-sitting playmaker, to stymie him and it worked beautifully. Jorginho was reduced to making niggly fouls and he was booked for a bad one on Alli. Tottenham’s pressing across the piece was pitch perfect – there were times in the first period when Chelsea could not escape their half – the collective attitude was spot on and their creativity illuminated proceedings.\n\nA crucial period for Spurs has started brightly. Next up is the must-win Champions League tie here against Internazionale on Wednesday and Sunday’s league visit to Arsenal.\n\nMo Salah strike sparks Liverpool’s second-half surge to victory at Watford Read more\n\nSarri had bemoaned Chelsea’s slow starts to matches, describing them as a “mental problem” but they outdid themselves on this occasion. They were 2-0 down after 16 minutes, as Antonio Rüdiger was beaten for pace more than once, David Luiz struggled for composure and Mateo Kovacic laboured.\n\nThen, there was Arrizabalaga; his error for the second goal was inexplicable. Kane had collected possession, sauntered forward under no challenge and shot low from distance but the connection was not clean and the danger appeared minimal. But then David Luiz appeared to dodge out of the block – Sarri claimed that he did not want to deflect the ball – and the flat-footed Arrizabalaga could only watch as it bounced and skimmed, tamely, into the net.\n\nArrizabalaga had got his hands to Alli’s header from Eriksen’s whipped free-kick but he could not keep out the breakthrough goal. David Luiz conceded the free-kick for a nasty stamp on Kane and Alli’s sixth in five games against Chelsea came when he got in between Kovacic and Jorginho too easily.\n\nHazard ought to have had a penalty on 14 minutes when Juan Foyth went into him from behind but Sarri was not about to advance that as a hard luck story. Hazard also worked Hugo Lloris from long-range in the first half but, that apart, it was all Tottenham.\n\nSon lifted a half-volley high, after a lovely one-two with Eriksen, before the South Korean was denied by Arrizabalaga after beating Rüdiger, and the goalkeeper did well to keep out Toby Alderweireld’s flick; Foyth was narrowly wide with the rebound. Son then curled another effort over and was also denied by Arrizabalaga after good work by Alli and Eriksen.\n\nSpurs’s pace and incision contrasted with Chelsea’s sluggishness and it was all over when Son outstripped Jorginho, David Luiz blundered and the Spurs forward got the goal that he deserved.\n\nSarri substituted Álvaro Morata, which at least prevented him from being offside any more, Kovacic and Willian but he could have withdrawn anybody.

a mood to match after a seventh consecutive defeat but this did not resemble a funeral march for the Fulham manager. Bottom of the Premier League, yes, deservedly beaten, yes; though not without handing Liverpool an unusually difficult assignment at Anfield. Victory was built on ingenuity and no little controversy for Jürgen Klopp’s contenders.\n\nAn eighth goal of the season from Mohamed Salah plus a fine finish from Xherdan Shaqiri took Liverpool back to the summit, for a few hours at least. It was the reaction their manager craved following the lame Champions League defeat at Red Star Belgrade in midweek, a fifth home league win of the campaign and the clean sheet ensured Liverpool’s meanest start to a top flight campaign – five goals conceded in 12 matches – since 1979.\n\nLiverpool 2-0 Fulham: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFulham departed incensed, however, after Aleksandar Mitrovic had a header disallowed for offside 14 seconds before Salah opened the scoring. The visitors defended woefully at the resulting free-kick that produced the striker’s goal. Jokanovic had a point when insisting it was “absurd” they had to defend the counterattack at all, arguing the ball was still rolling when Alisson restarted play. Klopp was sympathetic to the Fulham manager’s overall plight on the final whistle, although not the outcome.\n\n“I absolutely have sympathy for his situation,” he said. “Today was the first time Fulham really changed their approach. It wasn’t the result they wanted but they had a lot of quality and worked really well. I wish him all the best for the rest of the season as I watched them quite a lot in the Championship last year and it was brilliant. I don’t think a lot of teams with a football‑playing idea get promoted from the Championship but they really played football. I think they should stick with it as that’s what they are really good at. But you have to score from your chances.”\n\nFulham’s grievance stemmed from a lack of reward for an encouraging first-half display as much as the reading of a tight offside call. Jokanovic stuck to his principles with a 4-2-3-1 formation, a brave shout not only given the opposition but his team’s struggles and rumours surrounding change at the top at Craven Cottage during the impending international break.\n\nOne change of note was the introduction of Calum Chambers for the club‑record signing Jean Michaël Seri in central midfield. The defender added stability alongside André‑Frank Zambo Anguissa, helping to curb Roberto Firmino’s influence in the pockets of space he always locates. Mitrovic made a nuisance of himself from the start, providing Fulham with an outlet to relieve the pressure.\n\nIn Sergio Rico, the on-loan goalkeeper from Sevilla, Liverpool encountered another obstacle in the way of a comfortable Sunday afternoon. The hosts created several early chances with Sadio Mané, Shaqiri, Salah and Trent Alexander-Arnold missing the target from inviting positions. This was not a repeat of the processions Liverpool have enjoyed against the lesser lights of the Premier League this season.\n\nThe first gilt-edged opportunity fell to Fulham when Mitrovic flicked Rico’s clearance into the path of Ryan Sessegnon who, beating Joe Gomez to the ball, found himself clean through on Alisson’s goal. The 18-year-old had the time and freedom to finish but not the composure, dragging a left foot shot horribly wide. Sessegnon’s reaction, beating the ground in frustration, was a fair reflection of what had been squandered.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aleksander Mitrovic heads the ball past Allison only to see the goal disallowed and Liverpool score 14 seconds later. Photograph: Paul Greenwood/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe turning point stemmed from a well-worked Fulham corner. Sessegnon and André Schürrle combined to find Tom Cairney and, from his dangerous delivery, the unmarked Mitrovic beat Alisson with a powerful header. As the striker celebrated with two teammates the offside flag was raised and spoilt their mood. It would deteriorate within seconds. Alisson played a quick free‑kick to Alexander-Arnold on the right, the full-back sent the onside Salah sprinting clear of an exposed, sleeping Fulham defence and he finished confidently under Rico. Jokanovic raged at the fourth official but his ire should also have been reserved for his team’s sluggish reaction to the offside decision. It was marginal, with Andy Robertson’s heel in line with Mitrovic, but not the “disrespectful” decision that Jokanovic claimed.\n\nSign up for our daily football email, The Fiver.\n\nThere was no disputing the merits of Liverpool’s second goal shortly after the restart. Rico saved superbly from Mané’s rising drive. Alexander‑Arnold’s subsequent corner was over-hit but Virgil van Dijk and Fabinho retained possession on the far side and fed the excellent Robertson. The left-back sent a first-time cross deep into the Fulham area where Shaqiri had ghosted away from Cairney and, with an expertly controlled volley, steered the ball beyond Rico.\n\nThere was no way back for Fulham.

The extension of his unbeaten start as Chelsea’s head coach to 12 matches established a Premier League record here, eclipsing Frank Clark’s achievement with Nottingham Forest 24 years ago. The Italian spoke of pride and thanked his new club, his players and his staff. “But, of course, I’d have preferred the three points,” came the sting in the tail.\n\nThis was a fractious and fiercely fought contest, and one which left Chelsea hugely dissatisfied going into the last international window of the autumn. Undefeated they may be, but ground has been surrendered in the fledgling title race, with Jordan Pickford’s excellence and Everton’s clear improvement under Marco Silva having rendered them blunt. Ross Barkley was flung on for the final eight minutes in the hope the script might have him conjuring some late drama against his former club, Eden Hazard having been required to play the full game, but nothing the home side attempted came off.\n\nChelsea 0-0 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIt was tempting to write it all off as one of those days but that would be to ignore the warning signs that have been flashing for Sarri over recent weeks, and the awkward excellence of Everton’s resistance. The Italian wants his players tearing into all-comers early but Chelsea’s slow starts are starting to become the norm. “I don’t think the problem is a physical problem because, in the last two or three matches, the warm-up was the same and in the second half we played at another speed, at another intensity,” said Sarri. “Maybe we have some difficulties approaching the match from a mental point of view.”\n\nThey certainly found Everton abrasive and aggressive in opposition. Previous sides from Goodison Park would have wilted in this arena, but Silva’s lineup boasts rare balance. Yerry Mina, the first of five players booked in the first half alone, was an imposing presence at the back. Gylfi Sigurdsson, chopped down by Jorginho before the half-hour mark and testing Kepa Arrizabalaga from distance, always carries a threat even if he will now surely miss Iceland’s Nations League tie with Belgium on Thursday courtesy of the injury sustained in that challenge. There is pace and invention from wide, and Pickford’s standards are consistently high these days.\n\nDavid Silva sparks Manchester City’s precious derby victory over United Read more\n\nThe England goalkeeper’s flurry of saves will have cheered Gareth Southgate from afar as much as they did Silva on the sidelines. There was a sharp stop to turn away Marcos Alonso’s glorious first-half volley, quick footwork to scuttle back and touch over Hazard’s deflected attempt after the break, and excellent reactions to turn aside Álvaro Morata’s near-post attempt just 11 seconds into the second period. When he was beaten, Willian’s low drive fizzed wide of the far post while Alonso’s shot skimmed the woodwork and bounced behind. Pickford probably warranted that good fortune. “We took a good step today towards challenging teams like Chelsea in the future,” offered Silva. With options off the bench, and assurance to the starting selection, he has good reason for confidence.\n\nThere was a spikiness, too, which at least made the contest more intriguing. Barkley, once loved and now loathed by Everton’s support, would emerge to warm up to a chorus of abuse, which he greeted with a smile, a thumbs up and some exaggerated applause. Yet the first half had been littered with nasty, niggling fouls of which arguably one of the worst, Alonso on Theo Walcott, went completely unpunished.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBernard’s flashpoint with Antonio Rüdiger, the Brazilian thrusting his head forward and up to meet the German as they disputed a foul – the Everton player gave up around a foot in height to his opponent – had contributed two of the cautions for all that the referee, Kevin Friend, had his back to the incident at the time. “You think Bernard, at that size, could do something?” asked Silva, before asking whether Jorginho might have escaped harsher sanction for his foul on Sigurdsson.\n\nThe coaches, too, would clash at times around a weary-looking Andre Marriner, the fourth official forever in the midst of the squabbling, though there was a hug at the final whistle with peace restored. Silva, by then, had something to celebrate. Sarri, for his part, had his record, but little satisfaction in the result. “At this moment the average of points of City, Liverpool is very high, [on course for] about 100 points,” he added. “So it’s very difficult to stay close to these teams.” Results like this will not help."}, {"date": "11/11/2018", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60030, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup":

manager, Unai Emery, gestured unhappily.\n\nThe home team had just equalised through the substitute Henrikh Mkhitaryan and felt the momentum was with them. They wanted longer in order to find the winner. This is the kind of belief Emery has engendered. Arsenal fight until the finish and they throw everything into attack.\n\nYet to think Wolves were finished or somehow hanging on for the draw was a mistake. Nuno Espírito Santo’s team had shown slick passing, creativity and incision on the break and they would be the ones who almost snatched the victory.\n\nFirst the substitute Adama Traoré sprinted on to a long ball and jinked inside Rob Holding to leave himself with only Bernd Leno to beat. Not for the first time the Arsenal goalkeeper made a vital block. And then, with virtually the last kick of a pulsating game, another Wolves substitute, Morgan Gibbs-White, unfurled a rising drive from distance that beat Leno and crashed down off the underside of the crossbar. For a heart-stopping moment, everyone wondered whether the ball had bounced over the line. It had not. Arsenal could exhale in relief.\n\nWhat a finish it was because on 85 minutes, with Wolves holding the lead given to them early on by Ivan Cavaleiro, they had almost made the game safe. Traoré was prominently involved in the counterattacking move – so was Raúl Jiménez – and, when the ball was worked to the substitute Diogo Jota on the overlap, he looked favourite to score. Leno would block.\n\nBack came Arsenal, who had advertised the equaliser during a stirring second half. One of their substitutes, Aaron Ramsey, tiptoed into a dangerous area, spun and shot only for Rui Patrício to save.\n\nThe ball went out for a corner and, for perhaps the only time all day, Wolves lapsed. Granit Xhaka played it short to Ramsey, he moved it back to Mkhitaryan and, when he was allowed to cross under no pressure and Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang made no contact with his attempted header, the ball carried on into the far corner.\n\nEmery argued Arsenal deserved to win, which was debatable, while Nuno said any result could have played out, which was indisputable. What was plain was Wolves had showed once again they can compete anywhere. After their draws with both of the Manchester clubs, this was another eye-catching result. “Nuno’s the Special One,” sang the travelling fans. Who was going to argue?\n\nWolves arrived on a three-game Premier League losing run but they were disciplined at the back and balanced in their 3-4-3 formation. Their goal stemmed from a Xhaka misjudgment and yet it was underpinned by slickness.\n\nSead Kolasinac, who was erratic throughout, played a pass towards Xhaka and the midfielder erred when he dummied it to no one. Cavaleiro picked up possession, he rolled it wide right to Jiménez and charged past Xhaka into the six-yard box. Jiménez’s low return was well weighted; Cavaleiro finished inside the near corner.\n\nThe half-time damage might have been heavier and it has to be a worry for Emery that Arsenal are one of only two teams in the league not to have led a game at the interval this season; Cardiff are the other.\n\nWolves had the big chance for 2-0 on the break in the 24th minute. The excellent Hélder Costa led the charge and, having beaten Holding, he streaked into the area before cutting back inside Holding and shooting. Leno sprang to his right to save. He would collect the loose ball in front of Jiménez.Leno also dived to repel a Costa shot on 27 minutes.\n\nArsenal fired only in fits and starts in the first half. Alexandre Lacazette bought himself a yard inside the area from Mesut Özil’s cross and saw his shot superbly blocked by Conor Coady, while Ryan Bennett headed a Héctor Bellerín shot that looked bound for the top corner to safety.\n\nEmery switched to a 4-3-1-2 system for the second half and Arsenal revived, even if Özil was off-colour. Lucas Torreira forced Patrício to tip over a long-range fizzer; Bellerín fired high when well placed and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hit the post from close range when he should have scored.\n\nArsenal extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 16 matches, having survived the breathless finale, but it was Wolves who could reflect with the greater pride.\n\nDavid Silva sparks Manchester

this victory Manchester City surely killed any lingering hopes Manchester United had of competing for the league title.\n\nJosé Mourinho’s side made a fight of it but City always appeared a class – at least – above and left United staring at a 12-point gulf to the leaders and seven from a Champions League berth.\n\nJosé Mourinho defends Manchester United from ‘outplayed’ claims Read more\n\nPep Guardiola made one change from the previous league outing, preferring Riyad Mahrez to Leroy Sané, a surprise considering the German’s flying form. Alexis Sánchez could also count himself unlucky to be dropped for similar reasons as Mourinho made four changes from the win at Bournemouth. Marcus Rashford replaced Sánchez at No 9 and Jesse Lingard, Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera came in for Juan Mata, Fred and Paul Pogba, who failed a late fitness test.\n\nCity soon began enjoying the kind of space that makes them lethal. First a raking Fernandinho pass was collected by Bernardo Silva and he let go with a 30-yard shot that narrowly missed to David de Gea’s left. A few moments later David Silva got in behind United but no City man could finish.\n\nTwelve minutes in and the visitors capitulated. Ashley Young failed to tackle David Silva, who turned the ball around the corner to Raheem Sterling. His cross curved in front of De Gea and Luke Shaw allowed Bernardo Silva to ping the ball back across goal, where David Silva was waiting to crash home for a seventh time this season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Juan Mata of Manchester United reacts after Manchester City’s third goal. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images\n\nThe contest was unfolding inside a raucous Etihad Stadium, the atmosphere as vibrant as would be hoped for this occasion. By the midway point of the half United had, at last, gone some way to quietening their opponents and the crowd. Fellaini, Rashford, Herrera, Shaw, Lingard and Anthony Martial were starting to combine and an effort from the latter crashed off John Stones to leave him momentarily floored. This new-found composure was illustrated by a dinked left-foot pass from Fellaini to Young along the right as City were pinned back: hardly a regular experience for them at this venue.\n\nUnited had managed to compress the game into the middle third – a far safer area than that near their goal. This had Guardiola shaking his head and the visitors able to launch the odd attack as when Shaw found Martial in City’s area, though the No 11 could not control the ball.\n\nCity’s David Silva and Sergio Agüero display their enduring brilliance | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nGuardiola’s men ended the half as they began, bombarding United’s goal as the two Silvas again terrorised and Sergio Agüero might have doubled the lead when the Portuguese one played him in: he could only find the side-netting.\n\nGiven the gap in points, a win was desperately required if United were to keep any title pretensions alive. Instead City dealt them a hammer blow. Lingard fumbled a regulation control near halfway, Bernardo Silva pinged the ball to Agüero and when he swapped passes with Mahrez the Argentinian smashed home a ninth derby goal to go level with Sir Bobby Charlton.\n\nQuick guide Manchester City player ratings Show Hide Ederson Distribution was excellent but his bungled challenge on Lukaku gave United a penalty and belief. 4/10 Kyle Walker Did not raid forward as often as usual but the England defender was generally solid. 7 John Stones Tidy in possession and unperturbed at the back for most of the game. 6 Aymeric Laporte Read the game with authority and passed progressively. But shot waywardly after going forward. 7 Benjamin Mendy Always available on left to join in interplay or deliver crisp early crosses but not with usual precision. 6 Fernandinho Intelligent and precise, providing both security and stimulus for his team’s magicians. 8 Bernardo Silva A constant threat, making mischief - and two goals - with vision and skill for the home side. Booked. 8 David Silva Ubiquitous yet elusive, ingeniously pulling strings throughout the match. 9 Riyad Mahrez Threatened down the right with clever running and passing until his departure. 7 Sergio Agüero Swiped at fresh air at early chance but finished emphatically to score at start of second half. 7 Raheem Sterling Sharp throughout. Superb cross for City’s opening goal. But not clinical when given chance to score. 8 Subs: Leroy Sané (for Mahrez 62) 7, İlkay Gündoğan (for Agüero 75) 7, Phil Foden (for D Silva 90) n/a Ratings by Paul Doyle\n\nThis put the volume level through the roof and, when Fernandinho put Sterling in, the forward might have made it game over if he had not dawdled. Instead Lingard was replaced by Romelu Lukaku and a Mourinho substitution was again successful. As with the introduction of Mata against Juventus last Wednesday, Lukaku’s entrance led to a goal. Martial put the ball through and Ederson inexplicably challenged and pulled the centre-forward down.\n\nAnthony Taylor awarded the penalty and Martial slotted the ball to Ederson’s left, the Frenchman’s seventh goal of the campaign arriving just before the hour to set-up a fascinating final third of the game.\n\nSign up for The Fiver, the Guardian’s daily football email.\n\nIt was now the toe-to-toe affair Mourinho – and the neutral - hoped for. A Fernandinho shot was saved low to De Gea’s right, Lukaku headed a corner clear and, on 72 minutes, Mourinho went for it via a double substitution that removed Herrera and Rashford for Sánchez and Mata. Guardiola answered by bringing on Ilkay Gündogan for Agüero.\n\nQuick guide Manchester United player ratings Show Hide David De Gea At fault for their second, showing uncharacteristically slow reflexes after a weak kick. 3/10 Ashley Young Tormented by Sterling but always tenacious and made an important tackle to thwart Sané late on. 5 Chris Smalling Defended competently, for the most part, and had United’s first shot of the match. 6 Victor Lindelof Dutiful and determined in the face of swarms of attackers but his best is not good enough. 5 Luke Shaw Lost track of Bernardo Silva for City’s first goal and booked after being lured into rashness by Mahrez. 4 Ander Herrera Looked out of his depth. Unable to keep tabs on David Silva and caught frequently in possession. 3 Marouane Fellaini Wholehearted and very useful for clearing crosses and set-pieces but carried no danger. 5 Nemanja Matic Like Herrera, unable to implement José Mourinho’s containment plan for the visitors. 3 Jesse Lingard\n\nThe bad pass that ruined a counter‑attack summed up his failure to make an impact. 4 Marcus Rashford Game but ineffective. Ran into a blind alley when given rare chance to lead rare counter-attack. 5 Anthony Martial Shoddy and too casual at times but converted the spot‑kick well and then perked up. 4 Subs: Romelu Lukaku (for Lingard 57) 6, Juan Mata (for Herrera 72) 5, Alexis Sánchez (for Rashford 72) 5 Ratings by Paul Doyle\n\nThe City manager’s move worked a treat as the German confirmed the win with a late strike when Nemanja Matic was left ball-watching. Gündogan’s finish was as accomplished as the move that created it: a sweetly rhythmical, 44-pass sequence that offers a microcosm of the difference between the blue and red half of Manchester.\n\nIf United had fashioned this it would be hold-the-front-page news. For Guardiola’s supreme team it is merely par for the course. They enter the international break in fine mood. In contrast Mourinho’s side remain, at best, a work in progress."}, {"date": "10/11/2018", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 29402, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup":

Brighton.\n\nNeil Warnock, taking charge of his 100th game as Cardiff manager, was among those jumping for joy as Bamba’s close-range effort – coming in a crazy six-yard box incident during which the central defender appeared to be offside – took the Bluebirds briefly out of the relegation zone.\n\nThe Brighton manager was less happy. “I don’t think it looked like Sol Bamba was offside – he was offside” Hughton said. “Referees have difficult decisions to make, especially with Cardiff’s style of play, but what you want them to do is make the big decisions correctly.”\n\nCardiff’s Callum Paterson had cancelled out Lewis Dunk’s effort before Brighton were handicapped by Dale Stephens’s 34th-minute dismissal for a studs-up challenge on Greg Cunningham.\n\nCardiff City 2-1 Brighton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nCardiff have let points slip with goalless draws against 10-man sides twice this season but such profligacy was avoided this time in a frantic late goalmouth skirmish. Bamba sent an overhead kick against a post before Paterson’s follow-up effort was deflected on to the crossbar. Finally, Bamba clambered back on to his feet to thump home.\n\nThe afternoon had started so well for Brighton with Dunk marking his call-up to the England squad by heading home Solly March’s sixth-minute free-kick – his second goal in two games – having lost Bamba at the far post.\n\n“In the old days I’d have taken the cane out,” Warnock said. “We worked on it every day this week, and then how long did it take? Six minutes.”\n\nCardiff were sluggish throughout the opening quarter and March and Glenn Murray failed to extend Brighton’s advantage when well placed. But Cardiff were level after 28 minutes when Kadeem Harris’s cross looped off Gaëtan Bong and Paterson headed in from close range for his third goal in four games.\n\nJoe Ralls saw his volley held by Mathew Ryan but Cardiff were given an open invitation to get on top when Stephens saw red. The Brighton midfielder chased after a loose ball and sent Cunningham spinning into the air.\n\nMartin Atkinson had no hesitation in brandishing a red card. “Dale has given the referee a decision to make,” said Hughton. “I don’t think there was great contact with the player, and on other occasions I think the referee would not have given the red card.”\n\nCardiff dominated possession and territory after the break, but created little until Harris struck the bar with a curling effort near the hour mark.\n\nBrighton’s box came under increasing pressure, but Cardiff lost their captain, Sean Morrison, after a clash of heads.\n\nMorrison appeared to be dazed after receiving treatment, but he remained on the pitch for several minutes before being substituted – something the Football Association might yet investigate in relation to concussion protocols.\n\nBrighton threatened when José Izquierdo forced Neil Etheridge into a full-length stop, but Cardiff’s perseverance paid off as Bamba secured their second win of the season.\n\n“I’m so pleased for Sol,” said Warnock. “He’s come here on a free transfer and from day one been an absolute breath of fresh air.”"}, {"date":

"Goals have been scarce in West Yorkshire all season, though it was clear from the opening few minutes of this game that it was not going to be another dour stalemate. With two porous defences it was a surprise in the end that only two goals were scored, but on the basis of chances created and missed Huddersfield have to be most disappointed at failing to secure all three points.\n\n“We played very badly in the first half,” the West Ham manager, Manuel Pellegrini, said. “We made a few changes and improved in the second, though not enough to win the match so a draw was the right result. We had to try something different, even though we ended up playing with 10 men in the last few minutes when Ryan Fredericks injured his ankle. It would have been more of a risk to continue playing in the same way.”\n\nThe Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, said it had been a frustrating afternoon for the home side, who remain in the bottom three. “We were the team that created the big opportunities, we hit the post and the bar, we had no luck. We had dangerous situations but could not get the final touch.”\n\nSteve Mounié almost opened the scoring inside two minutes when he sent a header goalwards from an Aaron Mooy corner, Lukasz Fabianski coming to the visitors’ rescue by pushing the ball on to the bar. West Ham came storming down the field only seconds later to create an opportunity of their own, a delightful pass from Grady Diangana sending Marko Arnautovic clear, only to be foiled by Jonas Lössl leaving his line quickly to push his shot round the post.\n\nSalomón Rondón’s double against Bournemouth keeps Newcastle going forward Read more\n\nThe home side took the lead a couple of minutes after that, when Alex Pritchard became the first Huddersfield player to score a league goal on this ground this season. West Ham only had themselves to blame, Issa Diop and Declan Rice losing possession in their own half to allow Pritchard to play a one-two with Jonathan Hogg and clip a low shot beyond Fabianski from the edge of the area.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alex Pritchard celebrates after giving Huddersfield the lead. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nBy the mid-point of the first half Huddersfield were looking good value for their lead and could consider themselves slightly unlucky not to be further ahead. Philip Billing struck a post with a cross from the left wing, then Florent Hadergjonaj put Mounié one on one with Fabianski, a less than convincing finish from the striker enabling the goalkeeper to make a save.\n\nWest Ham sent on Javier Hernández for the second half and the substitute was presented with an opening almost straight away. Unfortunately for the travelling fans in the scoreboard end he was unable to take it. Lössl dived at his feet to stop his first effort, and though that left the goal unguarded when the ball spun up into the air, Hernández’s header from the six yard line cleared the bar.\n\nLeicester and Burnley hit impasse on an afternoon of mourning Read more\n\nPritchard found himself in a position to make the game safe after an hour when he just about stayed onside from Mounié’s knockdown, but he did not have as much time as he imagined and Diop got back with a covering tackle to block him in the act of shooting.\n\nA weak finish from Mounié squandered another opportunity with only Fabianski to beat before West Ham got back on terms with just over a quarter of an hour remaining. The impressive Felipe Anderson was at the start and finish of the move, first sending Robert Snodgrass to the byline with a clever reverse pass, then entering the area to apply a decisive finish after Arnautovic, Hernández and Michail Antonio had all tried and failed to convert Snodgrass’s cross.\n\nA Mooy clearance off his line prevented Diop snatching a winner for West Ham, though even in the closing stages there were still chances for the home side to add a second goal. Erik Durm shot just wide from the edge of the area, before providing a cross from the left in the final minute that found Laurent Depoitre in space in front of goal. The substitute failed to connect decisively enough, which is beginning to look like the story of Huddersfield’s season."}, {"date": "10/11/2018", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32184, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nampalys Mendy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Rachid Ghezzal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Caglar Söyüncü", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It was a day heavy with emotion and one that nobody in the stadium will forget. There were so many deeply moving images, but none more so than the sight of Aiyawatt, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha’s son, walking around the pitch after the final whistle and fighting back the tears while the supporters were singing his father’s name.\n\nLeicester’s staff and players followed closely behind, along with Claudio Ranieri, Nigel Pearson and Craig Shakespeare, three of their former managers, as the club came together to applaud the fans and in particular to show their support for Aiyawatt, who looked overcome by it all as he walked towards the centre circle holding a Thailand flag.\n\n“Forever in our hearts” was the message of the day, with the sense of sadness overwhelming at times as tributes were paid to not just Vichai, Leicester’s former owner, but also the four others who lost their lives in a helicopter crash here a fortnight ago. In many ways it felt more like a public wake and, in the circumstances, the game itself was largely an irrelevance.\n\nLeicester City pay tribute to Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha Read more\n\nThe whole occasion pulled on the heartstrings. Leicester’s players and many of the staff at the club had paid their respects to Vichai when they travelled to Thailand last weekend to attend his seven-day funeral, but for the supporters this was their opportunity to say farewell and thank you to the unassuming 60-year-old who made their dreams come true. “Champions of England, you made us sing that” reverberated time and again.\n\nA march almost three hours before kick-off, from Jubilee Square, in the city centre, to the King Power Stadium, set the tone for the day. Thousands turned out to honour Vichai, including Harry Maguire, James Maddison, Andy King, Matty James and Hamza Choudhury, who were not part of Leicester’s matchday squad. The rainbow that followed the rainstorm as fans got close to the ground was another affecting and fitting image on a sombre day.\n\nPlay Video 0:37 Thousands of Leicester City fans march to honour Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha – video\n\nIn keeping with the dignified way Leicester have handled such a tragic story throughout, fans were given commemorative scarves, pin badges and a souvenir programme that was full of touching tributes from players and managers past and present. Kasper Schmeichel’s thoughts were particularly moving, as the Leicester goalkeeper recalled the harrowing picture that he has been unable to shake from his mind for the past two weeks.\n\n“I was on the side of the pitch standing, chatting with some of those closest to him that night and waved him off as he took off, like I nearly always used to do after home games. What happened next will stay with us forever. It has replayed through my head every minute since, wishing that there was something more I could have done. I stood for a long time at the police cordon at the back car park on the night of the 27th and again the next morning. Tears streaming down my face.”\n\nLeicester bid farewell to Vichai – ‘There will be tears on the pavement’ | Stuart James Read more\n\nThere was barely a dry eye in the stadium in the moments leading up to kick-off. Alan Birchenall, the club ambassador and former Leicester player, reflected on that remarkable Premier League title triumph as he stood in the centre of the pitch holding a microphone and with the crowd hanging on his every word. “Without him, none of it would have been possible,” Birchenall said. Every Leicester supporter applauded.\n\nWhen a beautifully edited video tribute to Vichai was played on the giant screens moments later, you could have heard a pin drop. The stadium fell silent again at the end of that clip, for two minutes, in respect to all those who lost their lives in the helicopter crash and also ahead of Remembrance Sunday. Thirty thousand Leicester supporters stood shoulder to shoulder, holding aloft scarves bearing that message, “Forever in our hearts”. It was such a poignant moment, impeccably observed by the Burnley supporters too, who could not have been more respectful throughout.\n\nIn truth, it was hard to think of a more difficult backdrop for a football match, for Burnley as well as Leicester, and it was no real surprise that the game ended goalless. Leicester had their chances, especially in the first half, when Jamie Vardy’s effort was cleared off the line by Matt Lowton, Rachid Ghezzal headed against the bar and Joe Hart saved at the feet of Demarai Gray. As for Burnley, Chris Wood profligately blazed a decent chance over in the second half.

Given the striker’s chequered medical history, that remains quite a big if, but on this compellingly persuasive evidence, Rondón’s highly disruptive penalty-area presence is capable of camouflaging all manner of deficiencies elsewhere in Rafael Benítez’s team.\n\nHis first two goals in a Newcastle shirt ensured the Tynesiders enjoyed marginally the better of an excellent, exhilaratingly attacking, contest as they recorded only their second win of the season.\n\nJosé Holebas piles pressure on Mark Hughes as Watford hold Southampton Read more\n\nThis alarmingly slow start to the campaign has coincided with a frustrating few months for Rondón as the West Brom loanee struggled to return to full fitness.\n\nFinally, though, he was in the right shape to terrorise Bournemouth’s defence. “Salomón can win in the air and hold the ball up and he has some ability as well,” said Benítez. “He’s not very fast but he’s very strong – and he scores goals.”\n\nWith Federico Fernández shining similarly brightly in Newcastle’s defence it was a day when St James’ Park regulars were reacquainted with a latterly elusive sense of optimism. Reassurance arrived as early as the seventh minute when it became abundantly apparent that Rondón’s long hours spent shuttling between treatment room and gym had paid dividends.\n\nAfter collecting Mo Diamé’s pass, DeAndre Yedlin accelerated beyond Bournemouth’s defence before crossing superbly for the Venezuela centre-forward. Rondón’s connection was true but his volley was well parried by Asmir Begovic only for the goalkeeper to be beaten by the striker’s right-foot finish from the rebound.\n\nUndeterred, Eddie Howe’s side swiftly saw a penalty appeal rejected following Fernández’s challenge on David Brooks and Fernández made a stellar tackle on Callum Wilson.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Salomón Rondón scores his and Newcastle’s second goal. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\nPlay was halted for several minutes as Adam Smith received oxygen in the wake of a knee injury which saw him suddenly crumple to the ground. “It looks serious,” said Howe. “We think it’s from an earlier tackle which left his knee unstable.”\n\nRondón then showed off his formidable aerial prowess. Goal number two was an imperiously powerful, Alan Shearer-esque flying header, directed beyond Begovic in the wake of Ki Sung-yueng’s crossfield pass and Kenedy’s fine left-wing cross. Nathan Aké was comprehensively beaten in the air.\n\nThe bad news for Howe was that Rondón’s confidence appeared to be increasing almost by the minute and he saw a penalty shout turned down following Wilson’s potential handball. Newly summoned to Gareth Southgate’s England squad, Wilson then very nearly scored at the wrong end, but Begovic repelled his attempted defensive header.\n\nYet in those moments when Rondón was not provoking panic among their rearguard, Bournemouth attacked dangerously and Martin Dubravka did very well to tip Steve Cook’s header to safety.\n\nFrom the resultant corner, Jefferson Lerma dodged Ki to reduce the deficit courtesy of a stooping header somehow squeezed past Dubravka . Registered deep in stoppage time at the end of the first half, it was Bournemouth’s record £25m signing’s first goal since arriving from Levante. Newcastle’s shoulders could easily have slumped but, instead, Ayoze Pérez immediately dragged a shot wide from Fabian Schär’s hooked pass.\n\nFelipe Anderson strike earns West Ham draw after

Yet, in the end, that only tells part of the story of what took place on a wet, windy and wild afternoon.\n\nThe man at the centre of it all was Simon Hooper, the referee who up until the 57th minute was getting on with his duties with little fuss. But then came the meltdown. First, he failed to award Watford a clear penalty following Ryan Bertrand’s rash tackle on Nathaniel Chalobah and, six minutes later, decided to ruled out a second Southampton goal for what turned out to be a wholly incorrect reason.\n\nSalomón Rondón’s double against Bournemouth keeps Newcastle going forward Read more\n\nHooper, taking charge of just his fourth Premier League fixture, deemed Maya Yoshida had got the final touch on the ball after Charlie Austin had struck it past Ben Foster from inside Watford’s area. Given the Southampton defender was stood in an offside position at the time, the goal did not count. The look of shock on the faces of the players in red and white said it all – Yoshida had not touched the ball.\n\n“We scored a perfectly good goal that was ruled out for offside. The officials cost us two points. That is a joke,” said Austin.\n\n“People go on about VAR – they clearly need help. If this is the best, most-watched league in the world then give them all the help they need. It is a joke.”\n\nHaving agreed with Austin that VAR needs to be introduced in the Premier League, Mark Hughes was no less sparing in his criticism of Hooper, before going on to criticise the PGMOL, the Premier League’s referring body, for putting a relatively inexperienced official in charge of this fixture.\n\n“It was a gamechanging decision they have got badly wrong,” he said. “For us, our game is as significant as the Manchester derby. Would the PGMOL have given that game to him [Hooper]? Absolutely not. For us to have a referee that today was not up to the standard required is hard to take. Over the years I have criticised referees and become known for that, but anybody who has seen the incident would say I have a decent case.”\n\nFelipe Anderson strike earns West Ham draw after Huddersfield’s rapid start Read more\n\nHughes agreed that Watford were also hard done by Hooper over the penalty, but insisted Austin’s disallowed goal was the bigger error.\n\nSouthampton played with a level of togetherness that suggests the players are behind the manager. The decision of the club’s owner, Gao Jisheng, to sack the vice-chairman, Les Reed, and the technical director, Martin Hunter, last Thursday is seen as a precursor for a change in the dugout. Hughes was in bullish mood about his job security here, but would have no doubt breathed a sigh of relief when Manolo Gabbiadini gave Southampton the lead with a close-range strike on 20 minutes.\n\nThe hosts looked good for a first league win since September when Hooper took no action against Bertrand for his challenge on Chalobah. But then came the goal that was not given and Holebas’s strike, deflecting off Cédric Soares and past Alex McCarthy.\n\nWatford were good value for a point and asked about Austin’s disallowed goal, their manager, Javi Gracia, was in somewhat playful mood. “If I didn’t see our penalty ...” he smiled."}, {"date": "10/11/2018", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25685, "home_team": {"name":

This week the 20-year-old was the man of the match, and scored his first career goal against Crystal Palace to take Spurs to within two points of the Premier League summit. That’s what you call a learning curve.\n\nFoyth was a fitting figurehead for this victory, which was Spurs’ season to date in microcosm. Mauricio Pochettino’s side grafted away against opposition set up to stop them playing and eventually found a way to win. There may not have been much in the way of sparkling football, but their determination throughout was vivid.\n\nCrystal Palace 0-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – live reaction! Read more\n\n“He is a centre-back and I was a centre-back and I am very pleased for him,” Pochettino said of Foyth, his fellow Argentinian. “You get involved in these circumstances [the penalties] but the confidence in him is massive and his quality and his ability can be very important for this team. For him to score his goal and feel like a Premier League player is a massive, massive feeling. Now he goes to join the national team.”\n\nThe goal arrived in the 66th minute and it came from a corner. For both sides, competing in the midst of continual, torrential rain, set pieces had seemed the most likely route to goal. Palace had had opportunities of their own, with James Tomkins heading wide when unmarked just minutes before.\n\nBut when Harry Kane met Érik Lamela’s delivery on the penalty spot he made a far better connection. The ball was flying towards goal only to take a deflection off Luka Milivojevic, but Foyth read its trajectory before anyone else, and headed it into the roof of the net.\n\nIt was not just the goal that marked out Foyth’s performance. His play throughout was characterised by a calm all the more remarkable given the baptism of fire he experienced at Molineux last week. Yes, he passed the ball out for a corner after a goal-kick in the first half but he literally laughed it off. A more common sight was the Argentinian reading Palace’s passing quicker than their own forwards, nipping in to rob possession, and, more often than not, doing something useful with the ball from there.\n\nHe was joined at the forefront of the Spurs ranks by Moussa Sissoko, another unlikely star of late. Sissoko used his physicality to great effect in a defensive capacity, and did the same with his pace going forward. It was his counterattack that should have led to Spurs scoring a second in injury time, only for Son Heung-min to delay his shot for too long and squander the opportunity.\n\nLeicester and Burnley hit impasse on afternoon of deep poignancy Read more\n\nSpurs lost Kieran Trippier to a groin injury early in the match. While Pochettino believes the injury is not serious, it seems likely to rule the full-back out of England duty over the next 10 days. When he was replaced Trippier became the ninth Spurs player to succumb to injury since taking part in the World Cup this summer. The statistic is striking and suggests that Pochettino has perhaps had to rely too much on his established stars at the beginning of this season.\n\nThis situation is perhaps beginning to change, however. The starting XI was without several regulars including Christian Eriksen, Eric Dier and Jan Vertonghen, but it had a cohesion about it and in the end Spurs deserved the three points.\n\nFor Palace this was a seventh league match without a win and they are still yet to score at home from open play. It was also another match lost without Wilfried Zaha: the 12th in succession. Palace’s leading scorer (with three goals) failed to recover from a hamstring strain sustained against Chelsea last week. You could almost hear the dejected sighs around the ground as the news filtered through before kick-off.\n\nPalace did not play like a team disheartened, however. They were just as committed to the cause as their opponents, just as tactically disciplined. As well as the Tomkins chance they had another great opportunity, this one falling to the substitute Alexander Sørloth in the 90th minute. A deflection left the ball at the Norwegian’s feet, unmarked 15 yards out. He powered a shot towards the near post only for Hugo Lloris to pull off the save of the game just when his team needed it most.\n\n“The mood in the dressing room is pretty much the same one you can read on my face,” said Roy Hodgson. “It’s very hard when a team does so many good things in terms of discipline, tactical work and effort, but ends up losing by a goal to nil.\n\n“We can talk all you like about the performance, but we could also just quote the same words I said against Arsenal and Chelsea because it’s exactly the same situation. In each of the three performances the team have done extremely well.\n\n“But that won’t stop anyone from countering to say: you didn’t win a game, you didn’t score a goal and because Wilf Zaha didn’t play you lost.”"}, {"date": "05/11/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 17082, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds":

showed, enjoyed their reward more. This was not just a first win of the season; not when they had gone 205 days without scoring a home goal, a 659-minute barren streak that threatened to make them the wrong sort of history-makers. Instead that mantle settles on Fulham. As Huddersfield avoided the ignominy of joining the Mansfield team of 1971-72 as the only English sides to fail to score in the first six home games of a league season, Fulham equalled Southampton’s divisional record by conceding 29 times in their first 11 games of a Premier League season.\n\nYet while the statistical distinction is unwanted, Slavisa Jokanovic has more immediate concerns after Fulham’s worst start to a top-flight season deteriorated further. A sequence of six straight defeats imperils his position. With a trip to Liverpool next he may approach the international break with some trepidation.\n\nHuddersfield Town 1-0 Fulham: Premier League – live! Read more\n\n“I personally trust in myself,” said Jokanovic. But he accepted his fate depends on those who let him down on Monday night. “It is outside of my control,” added the Serb. “It is not only in my hands. Part of the job is in the hands of my players.” They conducted a post-match inquest in the dressing room. “My players have some words after the game but it is a little bit late then.”\n\n“Really sorry everyone” was the message on the club’s Twitter feed at the end. Such apologies were probably not envisaged when Fulham spent £100m in the summer. This has the potential to be the most expensive relegation of them all and, given the resources, one of the more avoidable.\n\nFulham have the talent but showed little of the character the victorious manager, David Wagner, identified in his Huddersfield side. “They seem to be a little bit scared,” Jokanovic admitted. “Maybe we didn’t understand how important this game is. We were a little bit confused. We didn’t play the first 45 minutes with enough intensity.” Perhaps his most remarkable admission about a side with footballing principles was: “We started to kick the ball without any sense.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aleksander Mitrovic and Slavisa Jokanovic exchange words on another frustrating night for Fulham. Photograph: Jacob King/Mercury Press/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nGiven Fulham’s self-destructive tendencies it was sadly symbolic that they donated the only goal, Timothy Fosu-Mensah being debited with Huddersfield’s winner. Thereafter it was indicative of their fortunes that Kevin McDonald, who came on in a half-time double switch, lasted only 20 minutes.\n\nChange is a constant. Jokanovic has named a different defence every game this season and is no nearer to finding a formula for clean sheets. Fosu-Mensah inadvertently applied the finishing touch when two Germans combined, Christopher Schindler meeting Chris Löwe’s cross, to make it a happy anniversary for a third. “Sometimes everything comes together,” said Wagner, who was tasked with avoiding relegation to League One when appointed in November 2015. “Three years I am here, this was my 50th win and for sure one of the most important because, after such a long period, you need this feeling.”\n\nAll square at the Emirates, young debutants and bollards – Football Weekly Read more\n\nThe sensation of scoring at home was novel enough. Philip Billing had struck the bar with a thunderbolt and Alex Pritchard drew a fine save from Sergio Rico to add to their litany of near-misses. “If you hit the bar and post as often as we have, you think: ‘Come on, what is going on here?’ Huddersfield’s previous home goal came so long ago that the scorer, Thomas Ince, has since made 15 appearances for Stoke.\n\nWhile he has returned to the Championship Huddersfield approached their task in a manner to suggest they will not go down without a fight. “If you don’t bring passion and aggression you have no chance,” said Schindler. Huddersfield displayed both in considerable quantities. He, Billing and Aaron Mooy were outstanding. Their team mates were willing allies.\n\n“The guys delivered,” said Wagner. “We showed spirit and fighting intensity and in the second half, we were able to bring the result over the line.

From opening whistle to the last Pep Guardiola’s side made the contest a duck shoot on an afternoon when Raheem Sterling was sublime.\n\nThe forward scored twice and helped create three more, and at 23 is only going to improve. So, too, a City whose prevailing characteristic is the embodiment of their manager’s relentlessness. Guardiola’s assessment underlined this, agreeing that most opponents should be frightened of City – but only regarding their opening.\n\n“The first 20 minutes, yeah,” he said. “We were lucky to score the fourth goal at the last minute of the first half [to make it 4-1] because I had the feeling the game was not over. We played with the ball so good but not without the ball. We were not stable behind [defence]. The team showed me some signals that in some positions we are not stable enough.”\n\nGuardiola believes Sterling can be as fine a footballer as he wishes to be having overcome a fear of shooting during the Catalan’s first season. Then Sterling managed 10, before registering 23 last term, and he now has six in this one. “His head [mentality] has changed,” said the manager. “The first season, he was scared, was looking – who is the guy I am going to pass to? We spoke and said try to score goals. He is becoming a winning player.\n\n“He is stable and is focused on what he has to do to become a better player. He is a top player but still so young to consider [being] the world’s best. Still he can lose simple balls.”\n\nManchester City 6-1 Southampton: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nCity pinned their opponents back instantly from the kick-off. A moment of mild panic from Saints in the area was followed a few moments later by a free-kick. It was hit in from the right by David Silva and though it came to nothing the terms between the sides were about to change.\n\nIt took six minutes and already cast the contest as a mismatch of Anthony Joshua versus junior-flyweight proportions. Leroy Sané was Guardiola’s sole change from the XI that won at Wembley against Tottenham in their last league outing and promptly showed why he was back.\n\nAfter James Ward-Prowse stepped on the ball Sergio Agüero fed Silva and his pass slid Sané in along the left. In a flash the ball was whipped in and a hapless Wesley Hoedt smashed home for an own goal.\n\nMark Hughes’s men were still reeling when the champions doubled their lead. This time Sterling was provider. The winger appeared to have overrun the ball but managed to turn it across goal and there was Agüero to notch a 150th Premier League goal.\n\nThe 30-year-old has achieved this in 217 appearances, second only to Alan Shearer’s 212, and had time to miss a golden chance for a second – he hit Alex McCarthy’s legs – before City went 3-0 ahead. Sterling and Sané were again to the fore: the former chipped towards the German and when the ball bounced Silva volleyed it in.\n\nCity did not face a threat until the 26th minute and it proved an augury of Danny Ings’s penalty strike moments later. When Shane Long crossed, the visiting No 9 was unmarked but could not capitalise.\n\nHe was about to do better. Ings raced on to a Ryan Bertrand pass along the left and John Stones might have whacked the ball clear. Instead, perhaps due to an Ederson call, he left it to the goalkeeper and as Ings ran on he was pulled down by the Brazilian. The referee, Lee Mason, pointed to the spot and Ings converted for City to concede only a fourth goal in the league, and a first since Newcastle United scored here on 1 September.\n\nRiyad Mahrez’s early goal enough for Manchester City to see off Spurs Read more\n\nAs half-time approached the home side offered a telling sequence. This was a mesmerising display of passing that took place in the tightest of spaces inside Southampton’s area. Sterling to Sané to Sterling to Sané. He now fed Agüero who nutmegged Hoedt and found Silva. He in turn found Sané who relayed the ball to Kyle Walker who finally took aim, but to no avail.\n\nNow, though, came further hurt for the visitors. Agüero picked Cédric Soares’s pocket and turned the ball in from the left. It came to Sterling and his miscontrol worked to his advantage as he gained space and time to collect a fifth of his league campaign.\n\nIn the second half Guardiola switched Sterling and Sané to the opposite flanks and just after the hour reward nearly came. Agüero fed Sané on the right and the German had a shot that crashed back off McCarthy’s right-hand post. Sterling’s afternoon to remember became even better on 67 minutes when he beat McCarthy for a second time.\n\nBy the close Sané had made it 6-1 – courtesy of Sterling’s final assist – and City had signalled that they may be even better than last season’s record-breaking champions.

They are not even watertight on home territory these days, always offering opponents a hint of reward. Yet, for all Maurizio Sarri’s public utterances to the contrary, they are a side refusing to believe this is merely a two-team title race.\n\nThis was an impressive victory not least because Chelsea were challenged for periods, and even pegged back to parity, but they never panicked. It helped they could send on Eden Hazard from the bench in the aftermath of Crystal Palace’s equaliser to provide an assist within 91 seconds of his introduction, but their dominance through the last half-hour was total. Álvaro Morata would have finished with a hat-trick had he not taken the bold decision to attempt to chip Wayne Hennessey, at 6ft 6in, from point-blank range in stoppage time. The goalkeeper plucked that effort from the sky, but the damage had long since been inflicted.\n\nSarri equalled a Premier League record here by extending his unbeaten start in the division to 11 matches, and it is the Italian’s team who are sandwiched between the more fancied contenders at present. It is already hard to believe that Chelsea finished 30 points behind City last time round.\n\nSterling hits two as Manchester City thrash Southampton to go top again Read more\n\n“At the beginning, we knew very well that there was a gap,” said the head coach. “So, at the moment, we need only to try to recover the large part of this gap. I hope to recover almost all the gap, but I don’t know … It’s very difficult to recover 30 points in six months, but we are trying.”\n\nThose efforts have been impressive to date. It is of benefit that Morata’s confidence is returning, for all the late miss as he and two team-mates tore at Patrick van Aanholt, alone in Palace territory, after the visitors’ corner was cleared. The Spaniard’s spell in English football has largely been underwhelming, a flurry of early goals aside. But the last six games have yielded five to suggest a revival. There was class to his collection and conversion on the turn just after the half-hour mark after Pedro, so often the injection of energy this team requires, had twice fizzed crosses into the centre. When Hazard’s second-half free-kick veered across the penalty area with Palace unable to muster a touch, the 26-year-old was alone at the far post to guide a low shot across Hennessey and into the far corner.\n\n“He’s a little bit fragile, from the mental point of view,” said Sarri of Morata, once a club record £57m signing from Real Madrid. “But he’s very young and has great potential. He can improve very fast. Álvaro already improved the last month: improved for the confidence, improved for the personality, improved also from the technical point of view.\n\nChelsea 3-1 Crystal Palace: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“Now he’s able to play more with the team. But I think, also, that Álvaro has a very great physical and technical potential, so I think he can improve more. For him, goals have to be the consequence [of the hard work]. He has to play for the team, with his teammates, without thinking about goals. Goals are usually consequence of teamwork.”\n\nNothing summed that up better than Chelsea’s third, courtesy of Marcos Alonso’s trademark burst down the left and low centre which Pedro finished on the charge from around the penalty spot. Palace, competitive for an hour, were helpless to stifle such dynamism.\n\nThe last 20 minutes were played out with the home side’s work long since done, and thoughts already drifting to Bate Borisov in midweek – where many of this side can expect a breather – and Everton on Sunday.\n\nPalace have more wounds to lick ahead of a collision with Tottenham on Saturday, with this an occasion to sum up their season to date. Theirs had been the brighter start, when Max Meyer and Wilfried Zaha were wriggling peskily through Chelsea’s defence, only for a lack of a natural goalscorer in their ranks to leave them blunt. They had steeled themselves at the break, “to be more in their faces”, according to Andros Townsend, and duly conjured a riposte from nothing. James Tomkins’ slide-rule pass found the winger, who exchanged passes with James McArthur and, gliding past David Luiz, crunched a low shot beyond Kepa Arrizabalaga to register a first goal in 20 Premier League games.\n\nRegardless, Hazard’s introduction would send a ripple of apprehension through Palace’s ranks, and they were overwhelmed in what time remained. They have not won in six top-flight games, stretching back to mid-September, and visit Manchester United after the match against Spurs. “But it doesn’t really matter where you are at Christmas,” said Roy Hodgson. “We were rarely outside the relegation zone last season but ended up 11th, and only outside the top half on goal difference.\n\n“We’ve missed chances, yes, and been a bit unlucky, yes. We don’t have as many points as we should have, yes. But let’s see where we are after 38 games. It’s important to keep going irrespective of what happens in the next few games.” How he must crave a goalscorer such as Morata to ease them clear of danger."}, {"date": "03/11/2018", "arena":

luck after first-half ‘disaster’ Read more\n\nMourinho admitted he could hardly bear to watch at times but the United manager was thankful for Anthony Martial’s fifth goal in five games and Marcus Rashford’s late intervention, as his side followed up last Sunday’s home win against Everton with a second consecutive 2-1 victory that will come as a great relief to the Portuguese.\n\nThe United manager had predicted before the match that a run of positive results could still rescue their season after a slow start, yet any more first-half performances such as this and that optimism will soon evaporate. A more clinical side than Bournemouth could easily have been out of sight after Ryan Fraser saw his early chance saved by David de Gea following a mistake from Chris Smalling.\n\nBournemouth created three chances in a 60-second spell before finally making the breakthrough in the 11th minute when Wilson tapped home a cross from Junior Stanislas after a brilliant reverse pass from Lewis Cook. The former Coventry striker now has 50 goals since moving to the south coast in 2014 and was a constant threat throughout the first half, combining well with David Brooks – a boyhood United fan – and the impressive Stanislas, who was making his first league start of the season after injury.\n\nIn the absence of Romelu Lukaku, who picked up an knock in training on Friday, Mourinho handed Alexis Sánchez his first Premier League start since the 1-1 draw against Wolves six weeks ago and left Rashford on the bench in the week the England striker celebrated his 21st birthday.\n\nYet, in contrast to their vibrant opponents, United looked lethargic in attack until midway through the half when Sánchez started to make his presence felt. It was the Chile international’s persistence that created the equaliser as he won the ball in the centre circle before linking up with Ashley Young on the right to lay the ball on a plate for Martial. An impressive leap to beat Nathan Aké to a header almost resulted in United going in ahead at the break, only for Juan Mata to screw his shot wide of the goal.\n\nPlay Video 1:02 Manchester United 'very, very lucky' in first half says José Mourinho – video\n\nBut Bournemouth, who had accumulated 11 points from their five previous home matches this season, refused to lie down and would have retaken the lead had it not been for two important saves from De Gea. The second stop, five minutes into the second half, was an outstanding reaction to a clever flick from Brooks after Fraser had left Young for dead and picked out his teammate perfectly in front of goal.\n\nAt the other end, Luke Shaw tested Asmir Begovic in the Bournemouth goal but Mourinho had clearly seen enough and threw on Rashford and Ander Herrera in place of Mata and the ineffective Fred.\n\nThe switch seemed to have the desired effect as United started to dominate possession, with Sánchez drawing a good save from Begovic before Herrera slammed a shot just wide.\n\nYet a miraculous goal-line block by the outstanding Netherlands international Aké from Rashford’s shot after Young’s free-kick hit the woodwork hinted that it might not be United’s day. Paul Pogba had also failed to convert the rebound, with Brooks clearing off the line for a second occasion, and when Herrera curled another effort wide of the target it seemed their chance of victory may have gone.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nA brilliant flowing move started and finished by Brooks could have made it even worse for United but once more De Gea was equal to his shot.\n\nIt was to prove crucial as the clock ticked into stoppage time.

Leicester’s players, drained in ways only they will be able to convey, stood in communion with the travelling supporters who had packed into the east corner. Most of those in the stand were still wearing the white shirts handed out earlier in the day, which bore Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha’s image and a message in tribute to the club’s late owner; all were in full voice and, between a hymnbook-full of songs lauding heroes from recent years, one chant rang clear above them all: “Champions of England, you made us sing that.”\n\nThis was always going to be a difficult day, but it ended up feeling uplifting, too. In other words, it was exactly the note everyone touched by last Saturday’s tragedy would have hoped to strike and when Demarai Gray clipped in a neatly taken winner 10 minutes after half-time the emotional celebrations left no doubt about Leicester’s appetite to give Vichai a fitting send-off.\n\nThey will do that more formally over the next few days in Thailand, the majority of the squad having flown straight from Cardiff Airport to Bangkok after the game to attend Vichai’s funeral, but this turned into a celebration of eight transformative years in charge: an afternoon nobody had ever wanted but one in which everyone responded to their utmost credit.\n\n“We wanted to do it for him and his family today,” said Kasper Schmeichel, the Leicester goalkeeper, said. “Every single player wanted to get out there; there was no pressure from anyone but everyone jumped at the chance. We’re glad we’ve come away with a win that we can take to Thailand and we hope we did his family proud.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demarai Gray honours late Leicester chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha after scoring at Cardiff. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City via Getty Images\n\nSchmeichel embraced every one of his team-mates, holding his captain, Wes Morgan, for a telling extra few seconds, before they lined up around the centre circle for a minute’s silence before kick-off. The entire travelling staff and non-playing squad joined them to form a group of more than 40; that idea came from the players and, while the warm-ups had given a sound impression of business as usual, it presented an arresting image that struck home the extent to which Leicester’s collective has been shaken to the core.\n\nThey were received beautifully by Cardiff, whose task in staging an occasion clouded by such a ghastly pall was entirely unenviable. The host club met it with grace, reverence and class. Inside the match-day programme a dedication from the Cardiff owner, Vincent Tan, the CEO, Ken Choo, and the chairman, Mehmet Dalman, described Vichai as “a true pioneer and visionary‚ whose legacy will live forever”.\n\nDavid Squires on … Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Leicester City Read more\n\nA number of their fans gathered to applaud the Leicester squad as they arrived and the locals were generous with their acclaim, too, as they went through their drills an hour later. They joined their visitors in passing around a Thai flag banner before kick-off; a bouquet was also laid in Vichai’s memory and the sense was one of intense kinship, on a football level and several deeper.\n\nNeil Warnock and his players had made little mention of their own needs but would, on a normal day, have earmarked this as a game from which to take points for their relegation battle. On the pitch they showed no inclination to offer favours, dominating the first half-hour and hitting the woodwork through Victor Camarasa’s free-kick.\n\nPlay Video 1:29 Leicester City players attend Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's Bangkok funeral – video\n\nPerhaps Leicester had needed time to clear their heads or perhaps they had to earn the right for their quality to dominate; either way, they gained a foothold and should have won a penalty before half-time when Lee Probert failed to see Sol Bamba had flicked Jamie Vardy’s effort on to the bar with his hand.\n\nThat did not matter. Gray settled the issue, finishing Ben Chilwell’s cross clinically, and ripped off his shirt to reveal another reading: “For Khun Vichai”. Whether Probert really had to get out the yellow card that he sheepishly held up feels like too cheap a debate for the occasion; the rejoicing was prolonged and Leicester had few alarms after that.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“We had to find a good balance between emotion, self-control and desire,” said Claude Puel. “It was fantastic to share this good result with our fans at the end.

Both were outstanding in their creation and execution, in keeping with Everton’s overall performance, and while Coleman celebrated his fine finish angrily in front of the home fans‚ a response to recent criticism‚ his first goal since recovering from that horrific double leg fracture was a moment to savour.\n\nDemarai Gray strike gives unified Leicester emotional win over Cardiff Read more\n\n“An important moment for him and for the team,” Silva added. “I thought Coleman performed better today, his physical condition is growing and his confidence is growing too. Not just with the goal. In the first half we had good combinations with Theo Walcott and Séamus on the right. It was our best performance of the season. From the first minute we played fast and created chances. We could have scored more.”\n\nHughton did not disagree. His team arrived with the confidence of three consecutive top-flight wins for the first time since 1981, all delivered with clean sheets, but were on the back foot throughout as Everton impressed in every department. Michael Keane continued his good form in front of England manager Gareth Southgate while Idrissa Gana Gueye and Andre Gomes dominated midfield. Did you deserve anything, the Brighton manager was asked. “No,” came the reply. “We were up against a very good team that I think will push the top six. They made life pretty hard for us.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Séamus Coleman gestures to home fans after his second-half strike put Everton ahead. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nEverton were excellent, passing with intent and moving intelligently, and could have established a comfortable lead through Gylfi Sigurdsson and Kurt Zouma before Richarlison opened the scoring. Silva had said on Friday that his team gained and lost from switching the Brazilian from the flank to the forward line. The manager’s perseverance paid off when Sigurdsson exchanged passes with Bernard, threaded a superb ball into the Brazil international and he drove a first-time shot into the roof of Mat Ryan’s goal. It was the first goal Brighton had conceded in 321 minutes.\n\nHughton’s team threatened rarely, on account of Everton’s dominance of possession rather than a lack of adventure on their par‚ yet levelled swiftly from a well-taken corner. Beram Kayal caught the home side unaware with a short corner to Solly March who swept a dangerous cross into the six-yard box. Lewis Dunk, stepping away from Gana Gueye and Zouma, gave Jordan Pickford no chance with a powerful header from close range.\n\nNewcastle claim first win of the season as Ayoze Pérez header fells Watford Read more\n\nThe pattern remained unchanged after the interval. Gana Gueye struck the inside of a post with a daisy-cutter from 18 yards. Bernard returned the rebound to the far post where Walcott, at full stretch, volleyed wide. Bernard was also involved when Everton retook the lead early in the second half. He found Gomes, whose attempt to round Kayal was halted by the midfielder’s challenge. The ball rolled on to Coleman and the right back, having sized up his options, drove a low finish from the edge of the area into Ryan’s far corner.\n\nEverton’s goals were all easy on the eye but Richarlison’s second was the stand-out. It came from a rare mistake from Dunk who sold his central defensive partner Shane Duffy short with a undercooked cross-field pass. The Brazilian pounced in a flash. First he intercepted, then he rounded the former Everton defender, sprinted clear, weaved around the Brighton goalkeeper and slotted into an empty net from the angle.

He knew that Watford’s collective speed and wonderful change of pace was likely to unsettle Newcastle and encouraged his players to use the full width of the pitch against opponents who often defended too deeply and too narrowly.\n\nIt might have been very different had Deufoleu been wearing his shooting boots but Fernández held Newcastle together commendably, his presence serving as a form of gloriously adhesive super-glue.\n\nEven so, Watford had their chances to break that defensive seal. The moment when Kiko Femenía’s clever back-heel liberated the impressively creative Will Hughes emphasised their fleet-footed talent and it was not long before Hughes saw a goal-bound shot blocked. An Adrian Mariappa effort was cleared off the line and the same player dragged a shot narrowly wide before Martin Dubravka diverted another from Isaac Success.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watford had 15 shots on goal, but just one on target as they slipped to defeat.

With Watford dominating possession, Newcastle needed to make the most of such counterattacking openings and when they did have the ball they needed to move it faster. Instead, they were so heavily afflicted by debilitating nerves and increasing self-doubt that they tended to take a touch too many as they weighed up their options, and frequently overplayed.\n\nBy the 51st minute they had also used all three substitutes after losing the initially lively Yoshinori Muto, Jamaal Lascelles and Jonjo Shelvey to injuries. This apparent triple setback was to prove a blessing in disguise as Ki and Pérez combined for the goal and the reassuringly composed Fabian Schär, on for Lascelles, shone alongside Fernández.\n\nGracia, though, sensed opportunity as the crowd booed Pérez on to the pitch and the Watford manager jumped up and down in frustration after Success left DeAndre Yedlin on his backside only for Roberto Pereyra to curl in a shot that rebounded off the bar.\n\nDespite the quietly menacing and vastly improved Kenedy miscuing a rare inviting opening to test Foster, all the momentum seemed behind Watford. It was going to take something very special to change that but, at long last, Newcastle conjured one of those watershed moments that can change not only games but, sometimes, entire campaigns.\n\nFelipe Anderson double gives West Ham victory over Burnley in six-goal thriller Read more\n\nWhen Ki, on for Shelvey and looking encouragingly assured, whipped in a subtly curving free-kick, Pérez met the midfielder’s delivery and flicked a glancing header beyond Foster.\n\nPérez had begun the afternoon on the bench in the wake of some poor performances and was only on the pitch because of Muto’s injury. He celebrated pointedly by standing in front of those who had earlier jeered his introduction and sticking his fingers in his ears.\n\nSuddenly he and Newcastle had rediscovered their touch. Indeed they would swiftly have doubled their advantage had Salomón Rondón not headed wide from eight yards after connecting with Kenedy’s cross.\n\nIn the directors’ box, Mike Ashley, a regular here these days, smiled broadly but a reminder of the lead’s fragility arrived as Success crossed. The Watford substitute Andre Gray shaped to shoot and Geordie hearts stopped until Kenedy intervened with a brave, goal-preventing tackle.\n\n“We’ll enjoy it,” said Benítez. “But it’s one step in the right direction.”"}, {"date": "03/11/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56862, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabián Balbuena", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Issa Diop", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Grady Diangana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Felipe Anderson", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [68, 84], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [10], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fredericks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight McNeil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The West Ham Way is a nebulous concept that provokes both reverence and derision. In the absence of a cogent definition, this match gave suitably contradictory pointers. Manuel Pellegrini’s team were bold, thrilling and brittle, much superior yet not convincing. There was no doubt, at least, that they deserved to win and that most people in a crowd of more than 56,000 seemed highly entertained, even if the scoreline should have been more emphatic.\n\nPellegrini said it might have been the best performance since his arrival in the summer. His Burnley counterpart, Sean Dyche, described it as a “crazy game” and, completing the oddness, complained that a penalty was not awarded against his own team when Grady Diangana went down in the first half under a challenge by Steven Defour. “It was a clear foul,” said Dyche. “If he had rolled around and flung his arms about, it would have been given. But because he fell normally, it was not. We have to change that.” Dyche has made similar complaints when his own players have been denied justice, so his consistency is to be welcomed.\n\nDyche’s team are struggling to recreate the consistency they showed last season, when their solidity lifted them to unexpected heights. After heavy defeats by Manchester City and Chelsea, Burnley seemed racked by jitters here, making uncharacteristic errors against adventurous hosts.\n\nEverton click and Richarlison strikes twice to sink in-form Brighton Read more\n\nIn the 10th minute Marko Arnautovic, making a return after two games out with a stomach illness, took great pleasure in sickening James Tarkowski, who had hurt him with a tackle early on. When Tarkowski dithered on the ball outside his own area, Arnautovic took it off him and fired into the net, then belly-laughed in his face.\n\nWith Burnley looking hopeless, West Ham threatened to run away with the match. Arnautovic was excellent, as was Diangana, a tricky 20-year-old winger making his second league start. Joe Hart, back at the ground where he flopped while on loan last season, denied Arnautovic and Pedro Obiang with fine saves in the first half, while Ben Mee rescued his team with a sensational clearance off the line when Felipe Anderson curled a shot past Hart. Then, even more sensationally given the run of play, Burnley equalised. It was a nicely taken goal on the stroke of half-time, Ashley Westwood teeing up Johann Berg Gudmundsson for a smart finish.\n\nBurnley improved in the second half and Pellegrini chased victory by introducing another striker, Javier Hernández, after the hour. The Mexican would have scored almost immediately if not for a perfectly timed intervention by Mee.\n\nDemarai Gray strike gives unified Leicester emotional win over Cardiff Read more\n\nBurnley did not hold out for much longer. After lovely work by Arnautovic and Diangana in the 68th minute, Anderson fired the ball through the advancing Hart’s legs from 12 yards.\n\nDyche had to stimulate another improbable fightback – and did so. Two substitutes conjured an equaliser, Robbie Brady delivering a corner to Chris Wood, who headed powerfully into the net.\n\nWest Ham pulled away for a third time, but only after Anderson struck the post following more deft interplay by Diangana and Arnautovic. That pair combined again in the 81st minute to create another chance for Anderson. This time the Brazilian’s shot found the net via a deflection off Mee.\n\nIncredibly, Burnley almost equalised again but Wood’s header in the 85th minute bounced out off the crossbar. West Ham at last secured the victory when Hernández rounded off a counterattack with a fine finish in stoppage time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Javier Hernández strokes the ball beyond Joe Hart for West Ham’s fourth goal.

This was a test for the team because we twice had the advantage and they came back but we kept going.

It is one of his buzz phrases and he reaches for it at every available opportunity. On a frenetic night in north London, the club’s new manager could delight in a performance of intensity and old-fashioned guts.\n\nArsenal 1-1 Liverpool: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nWould the team of the later Arsène Wenger years have fought back to equalise in the closing stages? Would they have continued to believe against opposition as streetwise as Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool? The point was no more than Arsenal deserved and it came when Alexandre Lacazette nipped on to a pass from the substitute Alex Iwobi and outfoxed Alisson, who had been lured off his line, before curling home.\n\nBoldness has underpinned Emery’s tenure so far and he had rolled the dice on 80 minutes, replacing the left-back Sead Kolasinac with the forward Danny Welbeck. Emery had previously introduced Iwobi and now he asked the winger to drop in at left-back. It was hugely gratifying for the manager to see Iwobi play his part in the equaliser.\n\nKlopp said with a smile: “We’ve seen Arsenal do it already a few times this year, when they’ve brought on pretty much all their strikers – I was actually waiting for Van Persie and Bergkamp.”\n\nPlay Video 0:44 'It was a goal': Jürgen Klopp rues Sadio Mané's disallowed effort - video\n\nThe frustration for Arsenal was that they failed to win. This had been billed as the occasion for them to find a statement victory against a big-six rival. Instead, the statistics show that they have won only three of their last 28 such fixtures. Emery began his reign with back-to-back defeats against Manchester City and Chelsea. Yet the applause from the home support upon the final whistle told its own story. Arsenal had gone toe-to-toe with Liverpool throughout. The evolution under Emery is plain.\n\nLiverpool did not know what to make of it. They had seen what would have been an 18th-minute Sadio Mané goal contentiously disallowed for offside while the centre-half Virgil van Dijk could have had a hat-trick. The first of his chances was the best and he hit the post with the second.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liverpool celebrate after James Milner’s opening goal. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nFor all of their front-foot football, Arsenal did not have the same number of clearcut opportunities. Klopp’s team were in control at 1-0 on the back of James Milner’s goal and it is always a bitter pill to be pegged back late on. But, as their manager noted, a draw at Arsenal is “absolutely a good result”. Liverpool remain unbeaten in the Premier League.\n\nThe Mané incident represented the controversy because when he tapped home after Roberto Firmino’s shot had come back off the woodwork, he was onside in the second phase of play. It was the prompt for a Liverpool purple patch in which the big chance fell for Van Dijk but, from Mohamed Salah’s cross, he shot too close to Bernd Leno.\n\nJürgen Klopp laughs off super league plans and rues disallowed goal Read more\n\nArsenal had started the brighter. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang saw a shot diverted wide by Joe Gomez and Henrikh Mkhitaryan looped a header inches off target after Alisson had come for a cross and failed to get there. The home team pushed again after the half-hour, with Aubameyang going close and Lacazette dragging wide when well-placed. The first-half ended with Van Dijk beating Leno to a Milner free-kick only to see his header hit the upright.\n\nKlopp switched to 4-2-3-1 at the start of the second half, moving Milner to the right and asking Salah to play up top with Firmino in behind. It was Milner who got forward to break the deadlock. The goal was a bad moment for Leno, who Emery had started ahead of Petr Cech in the clearest sign so far that he is the club’s No 1. When Mané crossed low from the left, Leno’s footwork was not good enough and he stretched for the ball, pushing it out into a dangerous area. It flicked off Rob Holding and broke for Milner, who lashed home.\n\nThe impressive Lucas Torreira extended Alisson shortly afterwards but the tide had turned. Liverpool were in charge and they almost extended their lead. Firmino was off target with a header from one corner; van Dijk worked Leno from another.

coming back from 3-0 down to have their visitors hanging on grimly, Wolves made a notable contribution to a pulsating game.\n\nIf the Premier League is beginning to look a tougher prospect than it did a month or so ago for Nuno Espírito Santo’s side there is no need to panic just yet. Wolves will not have to face opponents of Spurs’ quality every week, even if Arsenal are up next. Wolves still play a slick brand of football and they were slightly unlucky at times, notably when peppering the Spurs goal at the start of the second half and seeing a goal chalked off for an incorrect offside at the close of the first. “It was a clean goal,” the Wolves manager said. “It was a fantastic move and it should have counted, but the officials have a tough job.”\n\nMauricio Pochettino admitted there was relief at the end. “It was tight,” the Spurs manager said. “We should not have been in that situation from being 3-0 up, but we need to be more careful. We made a couple of mistakes and conceded two cheap goals.”\n\nWolves 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nSpurs began without Dele Alli, rested for the Champions League, and had to reorganise further when Mousa Dembélé injured an ankle in a second-minute tackle on Hélder Costa, but with Harry Winks playing in a deeper role than first envisaged they adapted well and could have gone in front even before Érik Lamela opened the scoring. Wolves had already had a couple of goal attempts by then, but Raúl Jiménez’s shot over the bar was speculative from distance and Matt Doherty finished a promising run with a tame effort that was virtually a pass back to Hugo Lloris.\n\nThe visitors’ first real effort of the evening had a touch of quality about it, Harry Kane running on to a superbly weighted pass from Lucas Moura and predictably managing to send in a shot on target, only to see Rui Patrício keep it out with a one-handed save.\n\nThe Wolves goalkeeper was unable to come to his side’s rescue when Lamela struck just before the half-hour, however, the Spurs forward finding the net with a shot through Patrício’s legs. There may have been a touch of luck about the return pass from Son Heung-min that led to the goal, in that Kieran Trippier on the right touchline seemed the intended target, but when Lamela controlled the ball on his chest to stride into the box there was never any doubt he was going to take full advantage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Érik Lamela slots the ball beyond Rui Patrício to put Spurs ahead in the first half. Photograph: Peter Powell/Reuters\n\nSpurs doubled their lead within three minutes and this time Tripper was involved, sending over a cross from the right that Lucas, who had started the move, headed confidently past Patrício from the six-yard line.\n\nWilly Boly headed wide just before the interval as Wolves tried to get back into the game, which they might have done had Jiménez not been brought back for offside when stabbing a shot past Lloris. The flag was probably against Costa but replays confirmed both Wolves players were onside, a fact accepted by Pochettino afterwards.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette’s glorious goal earns Arsenal a point against Liverpool Read more\n\nWolves hit Spurs with everything they had when the second half began, only to find Lloris in inspired form. A terrific reverse pass from Costa to send Jiménez clear ought to have resulted in a goal but the striker’s shot was beaten out and when Costa attempted to follow up he slipped in the act of shooting. Costa’s next effort was denied on the goal-line by Lloris’s outstretched leg and when Rúben Neves thundered in a shot through a crowd of players the goalkeeper was able to get down to tip it round a post.\n\nSpurs’ response to being put under such pressure was simply to bring on Christian Eriksen to restore midfield control. Within four minutes the game looked safe, Kane beating Patrício at the second attempt after the effective Lamela had cut back from the right.\n\nNeves was able to make the scoreline more respectable from the spot after the debutant Juan Foyth fouled Jiménez following a mistake by Trippier, though Wolves were not satisfied with mere consolation. Persistent harrying forced Foyth into another naive mistake, this time putting an arm across Jonny Otto for Jiménez to put away the penalty.\n\nIt was hard in the closing stages to recall that Kane might have had a hat-trick but for two outstanding second-half stops by Patrício. With Dávinson Sánchez on as extra defensive insurance Spurs saw out the game, but only just. Better finishing by Costa when one on one with Lloris near the end would have earned Wolves a deserved point.

Wembley yawned with empty seats; the pitch looked like a pudding – a legacy of the NFL game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday – and, for long spells, there was a strange lack of intensity.\n\nTottenham continued to look disjointed, pockmarking their play with errors, and Mauricio Pochettino, who had said beforehand that he had never felt unhappier at the club, cut a frustrated figure on the touchline.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 0-1 Manchester City: Premier League player ratings | Paul MacInnes Read more\n\nManchester City scored early through Riyad Mahrez and they did enough to win although they, too, mixed in some erratic stuff. How about Kyle Walker’s jet-heeled burst in the second half, which was the precursor to him passing the ball out of play? Or Benjamin Mendy’s furious reaction to a perceived slight from Érik Lamela in stoppage time? Mendy aimed a slap at the Tottenham winger. In keeping with the tone of the evening, he missed.\n\nTottenham almost stole a point late on when the substitute Dele Alli – on his return from injury – teed up Lamela. He had to score. But he did not, scraping his shot high. Pochettino’s team could point to other openings but when Lamela, their most in-form player, fluffed his lines, they must have feared that it was not to be their night.\n\nWho can stop City? This performance had holes in it – they did not look completely secure at the back – and yet they have now kept six successive clean sheets in the Premier League. They are back on top of the table, courtesy of their goal difference and, most worrying for their rivals, they have ticked off away fixtures at Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham.\n\nRaheem Sterling’s moment of clarity lifts NFL-scarred Wembley spectacle | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThe scene that greeted everybody at kick-off was incongruous, to say the least, and it felt as though it set the tone. The NFL badge was still visible in the centre circle while the gridiron yardage markers could also be made out.\n\nEderson caught the vibe at the outset and he went downtown with the first action. It would produce the goal. Kieran Trippier erred twice; firstly, failing to read the City goalkeeper’s high punt and jutting it back with his head towards his own goal. Raheem Sterling raced on to it, up the inside left channel and, when he faced up the covering Trippier one‑on‑one, there would only be one winner. Sterling drifted past him as though he was not there and, when he pulled back low from the byline, Mahrez finished with the minimum of fuss. The former Leicester player celebrated by pointing his fingers to the sky – a tribute to Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who was killed in Saturday’s helicopter crash.\n\nThe surface at the national stadium looked awful, after three NFL games in two weeks and last month’s Anthony Joshua title fight, and the players reported that it was bone hard, the only softness in the worst areas coming from the liberally applied sand. It sowed doubts in their minds. Pep Guardiola said that Lamela would have scored on a better pitch. The upper tier of the ground, meanwhile, was virtually empty. Wasn’t this supposed to be a big game? The official attendance was 56,854.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 0-1 Manchester City: Premier League player ratings | Paul MacInnes Read more\n\nThere were times in the opening half-hour when it felt as though City were toying with their hosts. They manipulated the ball inside the Spurs area, probing for an opening and then a better one. Sterling crossed for Bernardo Silva, who shot wide; Mahrez had a snap-shot after another Trippier error that Hugo Lloris clawed on to his near post and away. Sterling revelled in yards of space.\n\nSpurs brought some comic cuts. Moussa Sissoko put so much zip onto one backpass that Davinson Sánchez assumed it was not for him and allowed it to whizz through his legs – and out for a corner. Lucas Moura was booked for a pratfall. Lloris picked out Sergio Agüero with a clearance.\n\nAnd yet Pochettino’s team had their moments. Harry Kane spotted Ederson off his line and tried to beat him with a dipping shot from distance. It would not come down for him. There was a poor cross from Sissoko when he was free on the right after a Mendy mistake – the Spurs midfielder had options in the middle but found none of them – and, on 34 minutes, Kane took a heavy touch when gloriously placed, allowing Ederson to clear.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nSissoko had started ahead of Christian Eriksen and his brawn was a feature of the evening. Could he batter City into submission? One thing is clear: there are no shades of grey with him and he provided a contrast to the twinkle toes of the City attackers; Bernardo Silva was particularly easy on the eye.\n\nGuardiola stomped in a rage when David Silva could not set his feet on 53 minutes from Bernardo Silva’s cross – Sterling ended up seeing a shot blocked – and Spurs exerted a little pressure towards the end.

few memories as Chelsea reinforced their title credentials in the shadow of the Pennine moors rising above Burnley’s home.\n\nAt the outset of the season few expected Barkley to force himself into Maurizio Sarri’s plans so effectively but in scoring a fine goal and creating two more, the midfielder emphasised why he is no longer the Premier League’s ,or England’s, forgotten man.\n\nHis incisively assured performance – also featuring an important block which surely denied Burnley’s Jack Cork a goal – helped a ruthless Chelsea into second place on a day when Sean Dyche’s players were simply not allowed to stick to a gameplan which, for a short while, promised to serve them well.\n\nCrystal Palace’s Luka Milivojevic holds his nerve to end Arsenal’s winning run Read more\n\n“I don’t know if it was our most complete performance of the season; we were in trouble in the first 10 minutes but we moved the ball very well, very fast,” said Sarri, whose unbeaten side’s goal difference is superior to that of the leaders, Liverpool. “We defended better too – and Ross Barkley’s doing very well. He scored a beautiful goal. He’s a very good technical player. He’s improving very much; in the physical condition and the defensive understanding. He’s complete now.”\n\nSarri’s Burnley counterpart is held in such high regard in this part of east Lancashire that a local pub has changed its name in his honour. Just down the road from Turf Moor the Princess Royal has become the Royal Dyche and its patrons would surely have been cheered by the home team’s initially ferocious tempo.\n\nWhen Kepa Arrizabalaga flapped at a couple of Robbie Brady crosses in the early-afternoon sunshine Dyche’s ultra aggressive tactics looked to be paying dividends. Chelsea appeared rattled, Sarri cut a pensive figure and those long diagonal balls which kept arrowing through the bluest of skies stretched David Luiz to the limit.\n\nThen the visitors began pulling themselves together and as if anxious to issue a reminder that they are far from a one-man team, started showing precisely how good they could be in the injured Eden Hazard’s absence. By the time Joe Hart did well to palm away an Álvaro Morata header, Chelsea were settling into a convincingly cohesive pass-and-move groove. Within minutes of Willian hitting a post Sarri’s side were ahead as Hart proved powerless to repel Morata’s right-foot shot unleashed in the wake of Barkley’s splendid through pass.\n\nAs a Morata shot whizzed marginally wide of a post the rugged moorland beyond Burnley’s terraced streets turned increasingly clouded. It seemed a metaphor for their team’s afternoon.\n\nTurf Moor’s collective mood was hardly improved by Morata’s penchant for falling over at the most fleeting of contact. Otherwise, the Chelsea striker played very well but how the locals booed as Morata collapsed in the face of a strong but decent-looking James Tarkowski tackle and demanded a penalty. Unamused Tarkowski and Matthew Lowton immediately squared up to him.\n\nCraig Pawson promptly booked Morata and Tarkowski and the referee was soon reaching for his yellow card again as Willian was sanctioned for a comically blatant dive.\n\nPerhaps channelling mounting annoyance, Burnley upped their concentration levels and began closing Chelsea down rather more assiduously. Albeit briefly, they succeeded in turning the game scrappy.\n\nUnfortunately for Dyche, Jorginho and, in particular, N’Golo Kanté responded as if deeply insulted. This reaction saw the two enforcers seize an iron grip on midfield and, having done so, the impressive Kanté cued up Barkley for an immaculately struck goal, shot left-footed from 22 yards.

At one stage, with the crowd’s celebrations of Crystal Palace’s late equaliser still echoing around the arena, he called Alexandre Lacazette to the touchline, cupped the striker’s face with his hands and bellowed his instructions from point-blank range, slapping him on the cheek for good measure.\n\nAnthony Martial dazzles to help Manchester United edge past Everton Read more\n\nIt had been Lacazette who had surrendered possession at the other end of the pitch so carelessly in the buildup to the home side’s second goal, and Emery was clearly disturbed by how chaotic this game had become and frustrated by his players’ inability to remain calm amid the maelstrom. The manager lamented the curtailing of an 11-match winning streak but he knew that, given the display, a point constituted something of a bonus.\n\n“This draw is not bad,” he insisted. “They are a good team, and here is not easy for any team [to go to].” Palace’s sloppy recent record rather counters that argument, but they are a side stirring again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Granit Xhaka celebrates his equaliser. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images via Reuters\n\nTheir point was secured seven minutes from time, a swift break up-field culminating in Wilfried Zaha bamboozling Granit Xhaka with a blur of step-overs and, having sensed the Swiss had unwisely planted his leg, drawing the contact to tumble. The slow-motion replays will spark the usual tiresome accusations levelled against the Ivory Coast international – only Jamie Vardy has won more than the 11 penalties secured by Zaha since the start of the 2014-15 season – but Xhaka, a makeshift left-back, had been clumsy in his attempt to block. Luka Milivojevic, denied from the spot at Everton the previous weekend, held his nerve to convert his second of the afternoon and Palace had their point.\n\nIn truth, they might have merited more. Zaha and the substitute Max Meyer both struck a post – this team have hit the woodwork seven times already this term, as many as they did in the whole of last season – with Andros Townsend also going close. Their first penalty of the afternoon, awarded for Shkodran Mustafi’s wild challenge on Cheikhou Kouyaté as the ball broke loose at a Townsend corner, had felt rather scant reward at the time. Milivojevic’s conversion ended a dismal run of 417 minutes without a home goal stretching back to the final game of last season, but there was an energy and aggression to Palace that was encouraging given their predicament near the foot of the table. They have entered a daunting run of games, but this was a performance more to Roy Hodgson’s liking.\n\nRoss Barkley makes his mark as Chelsea cut down ineffectual Burnley Read more\n\nHe had been left rather less pleased by Martin Atkinson’s failure to spot Lacazette’s handball, flicking Xhaka’s corner on to Jordan Ayew’s head for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to bundle in at the far post, which had forced the visitors ahead as the hour-mark approached. “It wasn’t a mere touch of the hand, but one which actually helped the ball on to the player who scored,” said Hodgson. The Palace manager had no complaints at the thunderous nature of Arsenal’s riposte early in the second half, a free-kick needlessly conceded but ripped emphatically by Xhaka on the diagonal into the far top corner via Wayne Hennessey’s fingertips.\n\nYet that four-minute flurry constituted the extent of Arsenal at their incisive best. A team whose frontline usually display such venom was largely kept quiet with Palace the more busier side. They lost Héctor Bellerín to a “muscular injury”, a worry with Liverpool due at the Emirates on Saturday, but had seen the rhythm in which they had become accustomed to revelling of late seriously disrupted by awkward opponents. Mesut Özil, captain for the afternoon, flung away his gloves in disgust having been substituted midway through the second period. It had been that kind of afternoon.

While there was another error from Paul Pogba, which led to Everton’s consolation, there were further spells of the quick and slick play United are showing more of as the season progresses.\n\nJosé Mourinho praised the performance but still bemoaned a lack of ruthlessness before goal – blaming Romelu Lukaku and Marcus Rashford – and a leaky defence. Those failings have resulted in only 17 league goals and 17 conceded in 10 outings.\n\nEverton’s Marco Silva accuses Anthony Martial of diving for penalty Read more\n\n“This [display] was complete,” he said. “But the result was in doubt until the last second. That was the consequence of a goal we conceded and some chances we miss. The performance was solid and in some moments beautiful with creative possession.\n\n“We are not as rock solid as I would like. We don’t have the killer instinct I would like. Some teams with three chances they score three goals. For us it is almost an impossible mission to keep a clean sheet even with the phenomenal goalkeeper [David de Gea] we have and to score goals is really difficult for us. In the last nine matches between Rashford and Lukaku we score one goal.\n\n“In terms of the philosophy and the mentality yes [it was a good display] but I would like a better Man United than we have.”\n\nLukaku was dropped for the first time in his United career, with Fred’s inclusion the sole change from the defeat by Juventus, as Marco Silva fielded the same Everton XI who beat Crystal Palace last weekend.\n\nBefore kick-off there was a minute’s silence to mark Remembrance Sunday and the helicopter crash at Leicester City’s stadium.\n\nThis was a pacy contest throughout. Rashford took Lukaku’s berth up front but his opening contributions did not augur well. The ball bounced away from him and one attempted back‑heel found no one.\n\nAnthony Martial showed how to contribute when skipping past Idrissa Gueye, who stuck out a leg, and over went Martial. Jonathan Moss awarded a penalty – a debatable decision, and Silva was left unhappy, while Gueye, already booked, was lucky not to be sent to the changing rooms.\n\nUnited’s designated taker is Pogba and, after his stuttering run-up, Jordan Pickford saved mid-height to his right but the Frenchman rolled home the rebound. This was his second miss of the season from the spot while Pogba has scored four in all for United.\n\nMourinho said: “The thing I like is the desire to take it. I don’t like Mickey Mouses, fragile, afraid to go, saying, ‘I don’t take penalties.’ I like the player that says, ‘I want to take it.’ Maybe he has to change his approach but I don’t want him to change his mental approach.”\n\nPogba agreed, saying: “Maybe I should practise to change it, if the keepers know my step [routine].”\n\nUnited were going at the visitors in a near-irresistible red wave with Fred taking aim from afar and Martial and Rashford threatening from close range. Yet sloppiness can be costly and, when Nemanja Matic was outmuscled by Gylfi Sigurdsson and the Icelander passed and continued his run to connect with a header, De Gea was grateful the ball was directed at him.\n\nMartial enhances case to be United’s best-value buy of post-Ferguson era | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nWhen the second half started Richarlison came close to capitalising on a typical Pogba error. From Luke Shaw’s throw-in the midfielder’s pass in-field went to Gueye. He hit the ball to the Brazilian forward and De Gea, yet again, saved superbly to his left.\n\nShortly afterwards United doubled the lead, this time via a peach from the outstanding Martial. Pogba swept the ball left and the attacker hit a right-foot shot that bent inside Pickford’s left post – a fifth in 11 games.\n\nTo explain Martial’s upturn in form Mourinho said: “When the players are playing bad, it is my fault. When they are playing well, it is my responsibility. Or we [should] go to the middle and when the player plays bad it is half me, half the player and when he plays well, it is half me and half the player.\n\n“He took quite a long time to understand what we want, quite a long time for his brain and body to be ready for how we want him to play. At the moment he is playing very well. Even if he doesn’t score, to create what he is creating [at the moment in games] it is a solid performance for the team.”\n\nRashford’s low confidence was illustrated when presented with a simpler chance. A clumsy touch made the angle difficult and his effort was too close to Pickford. On 65 minutes he was replaced by Lukaku.\n\nMourinho’s teams this season have been criticised for their ponderousness but there was a sweet rhythm to a sequence that took in Juan Mata, Matic, Shaw, Martial and Ashley Young and ended in a corner.\n\nPogba’s tendency to make pivotal mistakes – he also made one here against Wolves – showed itself when Everton pulled one back. A fancy, flicked reverse pass aimed at Mata was pounced on and an incisive move by Everton ended with Chris Smalling conceding a penalty for a late tackle on Richarlison. Up stepped Sigurdsson to make it 2-1. Lukaku fluffed a chance to register for the first time since mid-September before Martial spurned a one-on-one.

Once the unexpected news came through that the striker would start here despite being knocked unconscious in a clash of heads at Newcastle a week previously, it was no surprise to see the 35-year-old score the game’s only goal. With a sure finish early in the second half, he claimed his sixth goal of the season and his 100th for Brighton. How Wolves could do with a poacher of similar quality.\n\n“Glenn was adamant he was fine,” said Chris Hughton, when asked whether he hesitated to select Murray even though the player passed all the concussion protocols after a collision with Federico Fernández. “We knew that medically he was fine to play so then really it’s about whether there’s any reluctance or nervousness but we never got that feeling from Glenn.”\n\nSadio Mané scores twice as Liverpool ease past Cardiff on way to top Read more\n\nThus Murray was on hand to strike in the 48th minute, swivelling and shooting with one touch to bring his tally for the campaign to the same as that of Sergio Agüero, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Sadio Mané. His precise marksmanship enabled Brighton to convert their only shot on target and they protected their lead with some sterling defending by Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy and excellent goalkeeping by Mat Ryan. Those attributes earned a third consecutive clean sheet and a third win in a row for Brighton. Wolves were left to curse their impotent finishing.\n\nThe gridlock on the roads around the ground before kick-off could be explained by the match coinciding with an open day at the nearby Brighton University but when the game got going it looked like the hosts were going to get schooled by Wolves. The first half-hour was one-way traffic, all headed towards Brighton’s goal. Hughton’s sheepish side could barely figure out how to get out of their own half as Wolves put on a seminar in progressive possession football. But only up to a point.\n\nFor all their clever interplay, they could not plot a way to penetrate regularly. Matt Doherty made most inroads for Wolves, the Irish wing-back a frequent threat down the right. He fizzed several low passes across the face of goal and was integral to Wolves’ best chance in the first half. That came in the 33rd minute when Doherty swapped passes with Hélder Costa before performing a snappy one-two with Raúl Jiménez, darting into the box and feinting past the last defender, only to fire a low shot inches wide from 16 yards.\n\nWatford’s Roberto Pereyra sparks rout of woeful Huddersfield Read more\n\nOther than that, the closest Wolves came to a breakthrough in the first half was when Adama Traoré forced a save from Ryan with a low shot from the edge of the box. Traoré was playing because Nuno Espírito Santo altered Wolves’ starting lineup for the first time this season, introducing the £18m summer signing from Middlesbrough instead of Diogo Jota after a record nine consecutive league matches with the same starting personnel. That was presumably intended to give Wolves more punch to go with their nifty footwork. But things did not pan out like that.\n\nWolves were lucky to reach the break with the scores blank. Because despite being dominated, Brighton created the clearest opportunity of the first half. Duffy sent a towering header wide from three yards after a corner by Solly March.\n\nWolves failed to heed the warning and found themselves a goal down within three minutes of the resumption. This time fortune favoured Brighton, as a mis-hit shot by Bruno from outside the box wrongfooted the defence and goalkeeper and ran to Murray, who showed that his predatory instincts remained undimmed, as he swept the ball into the net from 10 yards.\n\nSanto made a double substitution on the hour, withdrawing Jiménez and Traoré, and Wolves piled on pressure. Ryan tipped away a rasping long-range shot by Doherty and also made a smart block from Rúben Neves. His best save came in stoppage time when he denied Ryan Bennett.\n\nWolves huffed and puffed but could neither knock down the door nor pick the lock. That is a persistent problem for a team who have got a lot right since their return to the Premier League but scored only nine goals in their 10 matches. “That’s something we have to improve,” said Santo. “But sometimes you have to give credit. The way Brighton defended, they were very brave and put themselves between the ball and the goal.”\n\nHughton also gave credit. “We can certainly play better, we had to rely on our determination and team spirit,” he said. “On more occasions than not, Wolves’ performance would have got them a victory.”"}, {"date": "27/10/2018", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 25071, "home_team": {"name":

final to win promotion to the Premier League is long gone. This 3-0 defeat to Bournemouth was their seventh of the league season, their 28th goal conceded and another day when Slavisa Jokanovic looked increasingly like a manager guessing his way through the season.\n\nDavid Bowie famously sometimes used the cut-up technique to compose lyrics, slicing up phrases then piecing them back together at random. There is an element of that to Jokanovic’s team selection: this game saw the 10th different defence of the season and Sergio Rico replaced Marcus Bettinelli in goal, their third keeper in 10 games. It is worth noting none of those changes have been due to injury.\n\nSadio Mané scores twice as Liverpool ease past Cardiff on way to top Read more\n\nShahid Khan, the club’s owner, was so keen to express his support for Jokanovic this week that he released his programme notes two days before the game. “I’m equal parts amused, astonished and disappointed,” he wrote about rumours that Jokanovic will be sacked, but one wonders how long his patience will last if this form continues.\n\nPerhaps it is harsh to excessively criticise Fulham, who finished the game with 10 men after Kevin McDonald’s dismissal. They were beaten by a Bournemouth side who did not look in trouble at any stage of the 90 minutes, a brace from Callum Wilson (four goals in the last five games for him) and one from the thrilling David Brooks. “We were very good in most disciplines,” said the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, a look of quiet satisfaction on his face. “Without the ball we were solid, we were good in possession, and good on the counterattack.”\n\nFulham started sparkily, if a little nervously, like someone trying to impress their in-laws, but that mood was punctured early on. Bournemouth took the lead in the 14th minute, when Wilson was clumsily knocked over in the box by Timothy Fosu-Mensah, and Wilson rolled home the penalty himself. “We made a mistake without needing to,” said Jokanovic, not mentioning Fosu-Mensah by name but expressing his frustration nonetheless. “The mistakes killed us.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fulham have conceded 28 goals in their first 10 Premier League games. Photograph: Alan Walter/Action Images via Reuters\n\nThe mood in the stands shifted from tense but encouraging, to plain tense, through to downbeat and despondent by the final whistle. Jokanovic claimed after the game that he had tried to set his side up to be more solid, and to stop conceding easy goals, so it is even more concerning that they still did exactly that.\n\nThe second came with 20 minutes remaining, when Adam Smith whipped the ball off Jean Michaël Seri’s toes, fed the squat, busy Ryan Fraser who in turn slid a beautifully weighted pass through to Brooks. The young Welshman barely broke stride in nutmegging Rico for his third goal of a seriously impressive nascent Premier League career.\n\n“We lost the first challenge, we lost the second challenge, we lost the third challenge,” was Jokanovic’s scathing review of how his side defended. “We have to be 100% concentrated to stop this kind of situation.”\n\nThe implausibly young and skinny-looking Brooks belied his age and girth with another superb performance. He was on his way to another goal when Kevin McDonald tripped him, and with his sending off went any loose hope of a Fulham recovery. Wilson killed that off entirely with four minutes left, slamming home with extreme prejudice when a huge chasm opened in the Fulham defence. Many home fans got up to leave, discouraged by the prospect of a long season ahead.\n\n“Bournemouth won easily,” conceded Jokanovic afterwards. “They were always one step ahead of us, a bit stronger, a bit faster. At the end, the result is completely fair. They were more solid, and punished us when we weren’t at a good level.\n\n“This is the Premier League – everything is faster, more powerful, stronger. We need to immediately adapt ourselves to this situation.”"}, {"date": "27/10/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53373, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson Ramses

"report": "Liverpool were so dominant, their return to the Premier League summit a foregone conclusion for 80 minutes, that it amounted to a shock when Cardiff City became the first opposition side since February to score a league goal at Anfield. “If we could have just hung on for another five minutes it could have been interesting,” mused Neil Warnock. His pre-match assertion that it would be impossible for Cardiff to win at Anfield was much closer to the mark.\n\nCallum Wilson hits double as Bournemouth trounce 10-man Fulham Read more\n\nFatalistic or simply realistic, the Cardiff manager was correct on the scale of the task confronting his team. Liverpool were on a different plane throughout. Even in those moments after Callum Paterson denied Liverpool a club record 10th consecutive clean sheet at home in the league, there was no genuine challenge to the hosts’ authority. Jürgen Klopp’s team simply killed Cardiff’s hope with two late goals through Xherdan Shaqiri and Sadio Mané, to add to the two delivered earlier by Mohamed Salah and the Senegal international, as they cruised through what was a contest in name only.\n\n“I think Liverpool have more of a chance in the Champions League and the cups,” said Warnock, whose team have now played and lost to all of the top five. “I think Manchester City have more week in, week out experience in the league but Liverpool are the most improved team in the league. They are really back in the big time now and heaven help us if he [Klopp] adds a few more next year.” Liverpool look in the mood now, and between them Salah, Mané and Roberto Firmino have scored more goals after 14 games in all competitions this season than at the same stage last year: 18 to 17. They now have a defence to match. Not that it was required here.\n\nLiverpool enjoyed 86% possession and completed 412 passes to Cardiff’s 35 in a ridiculously one-sided first half where the only topic of note was their inability to add to Salah’s opener. Given the hosts’ control and the Egypt international’s remarkable goalscoring record at Anfield it was no surprise when he pounced to give Liverpool a 10th-minute lead, although it was out of context with Cardiff’s belligerent defensive display before the break.\n\nSalah’s 33rd goal in 35 Anfield appearances stemmed from his alertness and the visitors’ failure to deal with Trent Alexander-Arnold’s low cross from the right. The right-back’s delivery, having been teed up by Salah initially, was intercepted awkwardly by Sol Bamba who diverted the ball on to Mané. His shot on the turn was blocked by Sean Morrison, Georginio Wijnaldum’s rebound was diverted across goal by Bamba and Salah reacted quickest to score from close range, with Morrison and Bruno Ecuele Manga floundering on the line.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Xherdan Shaqiri is congratulated by teammates after scoring Liverpool’s third goal. Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA\n\nAnfield sat back to enjoy the procession and the captain for the day, Virgil van Dijk, almost obliged with a towering header from a Salah cross that kissed the far post. The procession took a while to materialise. True, Liverpool’s authority was almost absolute and at times it appeared Van Dijk and Dejan Lovren were passing the ball via Alisson just to keep their goalkeeper occupied. Firmino even managed to prevent a corner with a back-heel nutmeg – while lying on the ground – and the body language of Cardiff’s forward players suggested they had taken Warnock’s impossible comment to heart. At least their defenders gave the impression that this was not a training exercise.\n\nThe visitors worked themselves into promising situations either side of the interval but lacked the quality and awareness to make the final ball count. They fell further behind when Firmino and Alberto Moreno combined to release Mané inside the area and both Manga and Víctor Camarasa made lame attempts to challenge. The Senegal international punished them with a sweeping shot beyond Neil Etheridge and into the far corner.\n\nRemarkably, and completely out of keeping with the flow of the game, the visitors ended Liverpool’s and Alisson’s proud record of clean sheets in the league at Anfield when Paterson reduced the deficit with 13 minutes remaining. Junior Hoilett’s low cross deflected into the striker’s path off Van Dijk and Paterson gave Alisson no chance by prodding the ball home from close range. It was the first time Liverpool had conceded a Premier League goal at home for 918 minutes, since Michail Antonio netted for West Ham United. There would be no comeback.\n\nThe in-form Shaqiri, rested for the anonymous Adam Lallana, injected greater urgency into Liverpool’s attack and scored a fine third late on. Fabinho released Salah down the right, he picked out Shaqiri inside the area and the substitute cut inside two defenders before stroking a calm finish inside the far post. Liverpool’s fourth was equally impressive with Salah again the provider. Collecting Mané’s pass deep inside the Cardiff half he read the striker’s mazy run to perfection and pierced the defence with a perfectly weighted ball that Mané clipped over the advancing Etheridge."}, {"date": "27/10/2018", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30736, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wesley Hoedt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elyounoussi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jannik Vestergaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stuart Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angus Gunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Martin Dubravka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Yoshinori Muto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Schär", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It was a match between two teams lacking form and looking over their shoulders.

In the second we struggled to counterattack but we had to defend because they put so many offensive players on the pitch.”\n\nAsked about the possibility of protests at St James’ Park next week, Benítez spoke directly to the fans. “We can help the atmosphere by winning games, and we have to try that,” he said. “It also means the fans coming to support the team for 90 minutes. That is the only way if we want to stay in the Premier League.”"}, {"date": "27/10/2018", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20457, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben

With the minutes ticking away, Leicester looked out of ideas. Damned by their lack of invention, they were on their way to a fifth defeat in seven league games. Yet Wilfried Ndidi rescued them with a fortunate goal in the 89th minute and West Ham, who lost Mark Noble to a red card in the first half, had to settle for a point after snatching the lead through Fabián Balbuena.\n\nA year on from Puel’s appointment as Leicester’s manager, the theory goes that the Frenchman is not going to make it as far as his second anniversary. He has struggled to dispel concerns that his tactics are too negative and although his team made a promising start against their vulnerable guests, they were blighted by carelessness at both ends of the pitch during the first half.\n\nLeicester City owner’s helicopter crashes in car park after match Read more\n\nThe pressure on Puel to inspire a dynamic display was immense, especially with Jamie Vardy sitting behind him in the home dugout, and Leicester certainly looked up to the task during the opening 10 minutes. The onus was on them to seize the initiative against opponents whose resources were stretched by the absence of nine senior players and how Puel must have been praying for the linesman’s flag to stay down when Kelechi Iheanacho converted Marc Albrighton’s cross in the second minute. It would have been a welcome boost after his surprising decision to pick Iheanacho instead of Vardy, but the Nigerian striker had strayed a yard offside and West Ham breathed a huge sigh of relief.\n\nLeicester were rampant for a while. Albrighton skimmed a shot wide from 18 yards and the sense grew that West Ham were there for the taking without the unwell Marko Arnautovic, who was replaced up front by Javier Hernández. West Ham looked like an accident waiting to happen at the back at times, not least when Balbuena almost headed Albrighton’s cross into his own net.\n\nLukasz Fabianski leaped to claw the defender’s botched clearance over the bar, however, and West Ham started to find their feet as Leicester’s early intensity faded. Felipe Anderson tested Kasper Schmeichel from the edge of the area and Robert Snodgrass saw a low effort dribble past the left post.\n\nLeicester had become increasingly nervous and they fell behind to a sloppy goal midway through the first half. Anderson chipped a free-kick to the far post from the right and when Declan Rice rose above Caglar Soyuncu to head the ball into the middle, Harry Maguire failed to spot that Balbuena had peeled away from him. The Paraguayan’s first effort came back off the post but there was still no reaction from anyone in blue and Balbuena had the easy task of scoring his first West Ham goal.\n\nWest Ham could argue that they were entitled to be ahead. They had taken control of midfield, where Rice was keeping a close watch on the dangerous James Maddison, and they were threatening on both flanks. Grady Diangana, a replacement for the injured Andriy Yarmolenko on the right, did not look overawed on his first start. The 20-year-old winger looked determined to justify a brave call from Pellegrini.\n\nJust when West Ham were starting to feel comfortable, however, the mood changed after a moment of madness from one of their most experienced players. There was no need for Noble to lunge into a challenge with Wilfried Ndidi after taking a heavy touch near the halfway line. West Ham’s captain should have known better than to go to ground and Pellegrini, holding his head in his hands, looked like he knew what was coming even before Michael Oliver, the referee, marched over to show Noble a straight red card.\n\nJavi Gracia hails ‘best squad in Premier League’ as Watford rout Huddersfield Read more\n\nOne poor decision had threatened to undermine West Ham’s good work and Leicester pressed for an equaliser before the interval, only for Fabianski to make a stunning save from Vicente Iborra’s header. The pattern was set – attack versus defence – and the home fans voiced their approval at Puel’s decision to replace the disappointing Rachid Ghezzal with Vardy at half-time.Pinning West Ham back, Leicester focused their energy on breaking down the claret and blue wall.\n\nAn equaliser felt inevitable. Albrighton tested Fabianski’s reflexes after slack defending from Arthur Masuaku, Maguire saw his looping header clip the top of the bar and Vardy wasted a wonderful opportunity, nodding over from six yards after losing Issa Diop.\n\nWest Ham thought they had escaped when Fabianski beat Vardy’s shot away. Moments later, however, Ndidi’s deflected shot spared Leicester’s blushes.

It is now 10 victories on the spin in all competitions for his energetically developing Arsenal – seven of them in the Premier League – and the manager owed it all to the maestro in the No 10 shirt.\n\nMesut Özil had one of those games in which everything came off for him and he was a joy to watch. When he was withdrawn towards the end, after scoring one and playing a central role in Arsenal’s other two – tapped home by the substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang – he received a stirring ovation. For the first time in his Arsenal career, Özil had worn the captain’s armband from the outset. How it inspired him.\n\nLeicester dominated the first 30 minutes or so and they could feel aggrieved about the non-award of an early penalty for handball against Rob Holding, which might have led to a second yellow card for the Arsenal defender. Wilfred Ndidi was also inches away from putting them 2-1 in front on 58 minutes only for his header from James Maddison’s corner to come back off the crossbar.\n\nIn the end Leicester were blown away by the attacking vigour of Emery’s team, which Özil helped to orchestrate. His goal that cancelled out Hectór Bellerín’s own goal was a beauty but he was only just beginning. It was Özil’s pass that released Bellerín to cross for Aubameyang’s first while his influence was all over the striker’s second.\n\nArsenal had scored a wonderful team goal through Aaron Ramsey in their previous game – the 5-1 win at Fulham – but Aubameyang’s second was one to rival it. Özil started the move with a flick for the substitute Matteo Guendouzi before he executed a dummy when Bellerín fizzed a pass up to Alexandre Lacazette, who then refound Özil.\n\nSign up for our daily football email, The Fiver.\n\nWith Aubameyang in the middle, Özil drew Kasper Schmeichel and dinked a pass with the outside of his boot for his teammate to finish.\n\nÖzil might even have contributed another assist before his substitution but when he crossed from the left Lacazette was thwarted by Schmeichel at close quarters. The playmaker had more than made his mark and it was difficult to argue with his assessment. “I think we played some sexy football,” Özil tweeted. For the Arsenal support, it feels as though the thrill is back.\n\nThe game followed a familiar pattern for Emery and it was a frustration to him that, once again, his team started poorly. By the time Leicester had opened the scoring just after the half hour, when Ben Chilwell’s cross deflected off Bellerín to wrongfoot Bernd Leno, they could already have scored twice.\n\nThe controversy came on 18 minutes and it was a mystery as to why the referee, Chris Kavanagh, chose not to penalise Holding. The Leicester bench erupted in a mixture of anger and disbelief and, had Kavanagh acted, he would have faced another decision.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mesut Özil chips the ball over Kasper Schmeichel to create Arsenal’s third goal. Photograph: Matthew Impey/Rex Shutterstock\n\nMoments earlier Holding had been booked for pulling back Kelechi Iheanacho as Arsenal held their high and risky defensive line and the Leicester attacker threatened to run clear. The Hand of Holding looked set to add up to a second yellow card. When he jumped with Ndidi his hand was high in the air and there was a clear movement from it towards the ball.\n\nSchmeichel described it as the clearest penalty he had ever seen while even Claude Puel expressed a strong opinion.\n\n“All the people in the stadium saw the penalty,” the Leicester manager said. “It was a penalty and a second yellow card.“\n\nLeicester finished with 10 men when Jamie Vardy had to sprint off in the 87th minute, having been gripped by a stomach bug. “He couldn’t digest the penalty decision,” Puel said.\n\nThe penalty was not Arsenal’s only let-off in the early running. Harry Maguire ought to have scored with a header from Maddison’s free-kick, with Arsenal’s defensive line in tatters – Leno sprang to his left to save – while Iheanacho had earlier seen one shot deflect over off Holding and another pushed out by the diving goalkeeper.\n\nArsenal 3-1 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nPuel had cause to reflect on his team’s lack of clinical edge because Arsenal roared back at the end of the first half. Schmeichel kept out a Granit Xhaka free-kick and an Alex Iwobi shot while Iwobi almost pulled down a high ball as he ran clear and Holding missed a flick header from Xhaka’s corner.\n\nÖzil’s finish for the equaliser was typically silky. He injected the urgency on halfway, swapped passes with Bellerín and, meeting the ball on the bounce, sent a low, left-footed shot in off the far post.\n\nPuel’s 3-4-1-2 formation asked questions of Arsenal in the first half, with Maddison impressing in the attacking central midfield role. Chilwell’s pace from left wing-back was also a feature.

He knew. His Crystal Palace team had been strong, they had been dangerous, but they were ultimately punchless and pointless. It is becoming the recurring theme of their season. Everton timed the execution to perfection.\n\nTwo goals in the final three minutes from the substitutes Dominic Calvert‑Lewin and Cenk Tosun, the former’s crucial breakthrough created by another substitute, Ademola Lookman, brought Marco Silva his first hat-trick of Premier League wins as Everton manager and a familiar lament from his opposite number.\n\nEverton 2-0 Crystal Palace: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nOnly Huddersfield Town have scored fewer goals than Palace this term and profligacy cost the visitors yet again at Goodison Park. Luka Milivojevic failed to beat England’s No 1 from the penalty spot with the contest delicately poised and, despite the vibrancy offered by Wilfried Zaha and Andros Townsend at the head of Palace’s attack, the absence of a genuine marksman was glaring when Hodgson’s team were ascendant. Pickford’s penalty save, Everton’s resolve and Silva’s substitutions combined to turn the game.\n\n“We came across a goalkeeper in form who made two outstanding saves in the first half as well as from the penalty,” the Palace manager said. “Then they scored in the 87th minute to aggravate things and then a second from a long clearance that made the scoreline even harder to take. The penalty would have made a difference. Instead it lifted the crowd, they really got behind their team, and it gave them fresh impetus going forward. They were able to risk a bit more but I still think it was harsh. I am sure people would not have begrudged us a result.”\n\nBy contrast, this was a hugely satisfying win for Silva, maintaining Everton’s recent momentum and demonstrating the improving depth of his resources with all three substitutes making a telling impact. There was a fresh, balanced look to the Everton team with André Gomes making his first appearance since a summer loan from Barcelona, and impressing, but until the final exchanges they found Palace obstinate and awkward opponents. Like others, however, they benefited from Palace’s limitations in front of goal.\n\nJames Tomkins was first to send Hodgson apoplectic in his technical area when steering a free header wastefully wide from Townsend’s inviting delivery. Minutes later his team were denied by a combination of Pickford and the crossbar. The Everton keeper foiled Milivojevic for the first time in the game from a 25-yard free-kick. From the resulting corner, Tomkins was unmarked at the back post and headed across goal for Cheikhou Kouyaté to head against the woodwork from close range. Kouyaté then headed a clearer opening wide.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everton’s Jordan Pickford celebrates after saving a penalty kick from Crystal Palace Luka Milivojevic (bottom). Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nPalace were physically strong, compact and disciplined – a recipe to frustrate – and should have opened the scoring when awarded a penalty on the hour. Zaha won it, much to the consternation of the home crowd who were incensed when he escaped a booking for diving seconds earlier. They could have no complaints on this occasion. Turning back inside the fit-again Séamus Coleman, Zaha was caught on the ankle by the Everton captain and referee Anthony Taylor was well-placed to spot the offence.\n\nMilivojevic struck the penalty hard and low but straight down the middle of Pickford’s goal. The keeper intervened with his feet, sending the ball skyward and Goodison into uproar. It was Pickford’s first penalty save since the shootout against Colombia and a turning point in Everton’s afternoon.\n\nLookman and Calvert-Lewin had only been on the pitch for five minutes, replacing Theo Walcott and Gomes respectively, when one fed the other for a late breakthrough. Found in space on the left by Richarlison, Lookman floated a delightful ball into the six-yard box where England under-21 international Calvert-Lewin was perfectly placed and unmarked to head beyond Wayne Hennessey.\n\nTwo minutes later, Palace were caught out when pushing for an equaliser. Jeffrey Schlupp was harried out of possession by Gylfi Sigurdsson and when Michael Keane launched a clearance upfield it sent Tosun racing clear of Mamadou Sakho. The Turkey international strode through confidently and applied a finish to match, beating Hennessey with a powerful low finish.\n\n“Sometimes you change and everything goes well, like this afternoon, and other times it doesn’t work the same,” the Everton manager said. “But the important thing is that we tried. We changed the formation when we brought on Dominic and they all did well. It is important when three players come on and they change the game. It is not just about 11 players. It is hard for me to do the squad list at the moment and that is good for the squad and for the club.”"}, {"date": "20/10/2018", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 40721, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Kepa Arrizabalaga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [21], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jorginho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mateo Kovacic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [13], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [55, 73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fred", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "As the game entered stoppage time, everything seemed so orderly. José Mourinho had kept to his promise that he would demonstrate restraint if his team were winning and, in fairness, Chelsea’s supporters had shown no appetite to hound him in the way they had on previous visits to his former club with Manchester United. But then the dramatic, extraordinary finale: 96 minutes gone, the moment when everything erupted, when Mourinho lost the plot and a confrontation in the tunnel that made it literally shake because of the number of people involved.\n\nMourinho was clearly incensed by the provocative manner in which Marco Ianni, of Maurizio Sarri’s staff, celebrated Ross Barkley’s late equaliser directly in front of him, fists pumping, and it was true the home team’s coach seemed unduly keen to rub it in.\n\nSarri says Chelsea to blame for sparking scuffle as Mourinho accepts apology Read more\n\n“Bad education,” Mourinho noted afterwards and until the stewards intervened he looked like he would happily throttle his antagonist. The FA is likely to want an explanation and in the circumstances it was almost a surprise Mourinho calmed down quickly enough to shake Sarri’s hand at the final whistle a few moments later.\n\nSarri was not impressed with Ianni either, describing it as a “big mistake” and instructing his assistant to apologise to Mourinho. “The situation is now between me and my staff, face to face,” Sarri said, indicating that would not be the last Ianni, who worked with him at Napoli, would hear of it.\n\nAt least Mourinho accepted the apology but it was an extraordinary finish to a match that left United’s manager complaining about an “awful result”, so convinced was he that his team ought to have won. He was clearly enraged and held up three fingers – signifying the number of league championships he won for Chelsea – in the direction of supporters who were baiting him as he made his way off the pitch. Nothing, however, will have hurt him as much as the final attack when David Luiz’s header hit the post, David de Gea kept out Antonio Rüdiger’s follow-up effort and Barkley scored from the second rebound.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest José Mourinho (centre) has to be restrained during a tunnel fracas. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nAs Mourinho pointed out, the goal originated from a set play, just as was the case after 20 minutes when Rüdiger scored. United have managed only one clean sheet all season and Chelsea’s first goal came from a standard corner routine: a ball delivered by Willian, a splendid demonstration from Paul Pogba of how to lose a man inside the penalty area, and a decisive header from eight yards out.\n\nChelsea had won all three of Mourinho’s previous visits as United’s manager, with a combined score of 6-0 and his exasperation was understandable given that, for the most part, his team controlled the threat of Eden Hazard, rarely encountered any problems from the listless Álvaro Morata and gradually took hold of the game courtesy of two second-half goals from a renascent Anthony Martial.\n\nIn those moments it must have been startling for Sarri to see the way his team lost their way and perhaps for the first time we saw hard evidence of why Chelsea’s manager has been saying since the start of the season that his team are not fully equipped to sustain a title challenge.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nUntil the last, dramatic twist United’s second-half improvement could probably be summed up by the sight of Mourinho stepping on to the pitch to give Martial a congratulatory slap on the back for chasing down an opponent.\n\nChelsea did at least have the force of personality to start pressing again in the final exchanges but it was a strangely subdued performance. Sarri was correct to say they were rarely threatened in the first half. Equally, it was unusual to see them create so few opportunities aside from those that led to the goals.\n\nSarri might also be intrigued to find out why, immediately before Martial’s first goal, Marcos Alonso made the curious decision to lie motionless in the penalty area – presumably hoping the referee, Mike Dean, might stop play – because of an apparent injury that did not appear to affect him in the slightest for the remainder of the game.\n\nChelsea 2-2 Manchester United: how the players rated at Stamford Bridge Read more\n\nChelsea could certainly have done with all their defenders on their feet. Kepa Arrizabalaga kept out Juan Mata’s shot but the home side never properly cleared their lines and when Ashley Young had a go from the other side the shot took a slight deflection off Jorginho and Marcus Rashford before reaching Martial, who fired in emphatically.\n\nMartial’s second goal was an even more accomplished finish: another thumping right-foot shot into the bottom corner after a quick, penetrative breakaway led by Mata and Rashford. At that stage United looked a decent bet to follow up their 3-2 defeat of Newcastle with another hard-won victory from a losing half-time position.\n\nUnlike Newcastle, however, Chelsea still managed to have the final word and Barkley’s opportunism means they have remained unbeaten in their first nine games for only the third time in the Premier League era – the other occasions being title-winning seasons in 2005-06 and 2014-15, both under Mourinho.\n\nSarri seemed dismayed that one of his coaches had set out to antagonise the opposition manager and it was probably for the best Ianni rather sneakily raced down the tunnel to avoid prolonging the argument.

Twenty four hours after Neil Warnock admitted he would not put any money on Cardiff staying up, his players responded by picking up their first victory of the season to climb out of the bottom three at the expense of a Fulham side in freefall.\n\nThere was a mixture of jubilation and relief in the loud cheers that greeted the final whistle as the home supporters celebrated their first top-flight win since April 2014, ending a run of five successive defeats and breathing fresh life into their season. “You look at the dressing room and it’s like we won the league last year,” Warnock said.\n\nManchester City hammer Burnley with Leroy Sané adding the finishing touch Read more\n\nFulham’s players, in contrast, looked shell-shocked. Slavisa Jokanovic’s side have won one of their nine league matches and, most alarmingly of all, conceded 25 goals in the process. Twelve have been shipped in the past three games and Jokanovic has his work cut out to find a solution.\n\n“The negative things kill us, we are not strong or solid enough in our box, we are conceding so easily,” the Fulham manager said. “It’s now mistakes from the beginning of the season.”\n\nThe sight of André Schürrle opening the scoring with a wonderful 30-yard strike that arrowed into the top-left corner should have given the visitors some confidence, yet they were an accident waiting to happen at the back and it was no real surprise when Cardiff struck twice in the space of five minutes to turn the game around. Calum Chambers, looking desperately uncomfortable at right-back, was at fault for the first of those two goals and withdrawn at half-time.\n\nCardiff, in fairness, deserve credit for exposing Fulham’s frailties. Josh Murphy, who scored their opener, was a constant threat on the left and Bobby Decordova-Reid, who registered his first goal for the club since joining from Bristol City for £10m in the summer, worked tirelessly as part of a three-prong attack.\n\nCallum Paterson was the focal point of that forward line and the makeshift striker – he joined Cardiff as a right-back – used his physical presence to unsettle Fulham throughout. His crucial goal midway through the second half was a case in point.\n\nBrighton’s Beram Kayal scrambles home to send abject Newcastle rock bottom Read more\n\nA goal feast had been on the cards from the start given the defensive records of the sides. Schürrle’s was the pick of the six, although that will be no consolation to Fulham, who will rue the way they allowed Cardiff to hit back immediately.\n\nChambers was caught out of position after carelessly giving the ball way and Murphy, running into the space that opened up on the Cardiff left, curled a right-foot shot into the far corner. In the blink of an eye Cardiff were in front when Decordova-Reid coolly converted after Schürrle lost possession deep inside his own half.\n\nAlthough Ryan Sessegnon neatly dispatched Aleksandar Mitrovic’s clever first-time pass to bring parity with 34 minutes gone – he has scored in all five of his appearances against Cardiff – that was never likely to be the end of the scoring in a helter-skelter game.\n\nSo it proved as Paterson screwed a 12-yard shot inside the far post after several Fulham players had failed to clear Bruno Ecuele Manga’s cross from the right.\n\nFulham still carried a threat and would have been level but for a superb save from Neil Etheridge to keep out Alfie Mawson’s downward header. Any Cardiff nerves in the closing stages were then assuaged by the sight of Kadeem Harris, who had been brought on for Murphy, turning in Victor Camarasa’s low centre in the 87th minute."}, {"date": "20/10/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54094, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [1], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Mendy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Foden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arijanet Muric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [11], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [32], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Raheem Sterling was an unused substitute in this game, granted a rest after rediscovering his scoring touch with England. As it was Manchester City did not need him against opposition as limited as Burnley.\n\nWith Pep Guardiola sending Kevin De Bruyne and Phil Foden on for cameo appearances in the second half, everyone in blue was happy in the end. The only possible complaint was that City might have won by an even greater margin, such was their total control, though when Riyad Mahrez and Leroy Sané added stylish goals in the closing minutes it hardly seemed to matter.\n\nChelsea’s late leveller against Manchester United sparks touchline chaos around Mourinho Read more\n\n“We could have scored more in the first half but in general it was a good performance,” Guardiola said. “It is normal to take a little time to settle after an international break but by the end everyone was at a high level.”\n\nToo high for the Clarets. Sergio Agüero went into this game with six goals from six games against Burnley, and it took him only 17 minutes to make it seven in seven. He could have scored much earlier than that but the first time Mahrez arrowed in a diagonal cross from the right after four minutes the striker seemed to lose his bearings and put a free header miles wide. That should have been a warning to Burnley, yet the next time it happened Agüero met Mahrez’s cross with his foot and Joe Hart made a point-blank save. Agüero acknowledged his former teammate’s reactions with a friendly pat on the back, though there was to be no respite for the returning goalkeeper. David Silva and Sané traded passes in the penalty area as they waited for an opening to present itself, and when it did Agüero had no trouble in holding off Charlie Taylor to reach Silva’s cross.\n\nCity made most headway down the left, where the trickiness of Silva and Sané backed up by Benjamin Mendy breached the Burnley back line with ease. Yet with the visitors rarely crossing the halfway line there was little urgency to the home side’s attacks. Guardiola has often complained his side are not clinical enough when on top, and the City manager was visibly aghast at the end of the first half when Hart kept out Silva’s header and Agüero missed an open goal from the rebound.\n\nAll Burnley had to offer before the interval was a Jeff Hendrick shot blocked by John Stones, though their most promising opening came in the first minute following a mistake by Aymeric Laporte. Vincent Kompany managed to snuff out the danger with a dangerously high tackle on Aaron Lennon. Starting a league game for the first time since August, the City captain found himself in the book after 35 seconds and was probably lucky to stay on.\n\nCardiff’s Kadeem Harris secures victory against a Fulham in freefall Read more\n\n“In the modern game that’s a red,” Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, said. “He was out of control, Aaron got a cut on his thigh that needed two stitches. But City are a top, top side. I’m not saying we would have won here even if the ref had sent Kompany off and disallowed the second goal because the ball was out of play.”\n\nThe bombardment Hart must have been expecting arrived early in the second half with two goals in two minutes. The initial breakthrough came as a result of quick thinking by Silva, who noticed as Jon Moss theatrically denied Sané a penalty after a collision with Jack Cork that the loose ball was not running out of play as quickly as Burnley seemed to be expecting. With the visitors standing still Silva played to the whistle, just about managed to reach the ball in time and crossed for Bernardo Silva to score. Burnley were so stunned they conceded again from the next corner, Ben Mee only managing a half-clearance that allowed Fernandinho to crash a shot through a crowded penalty area.\n\nEvidently convinced the game was safe, Guardiola sent on De Bruyne for the last half hour. This probably looked like unnecessary cruelty to Burnley and their supporters, though in fact it was Foden, a later substitute, who caught the eye. The teenage prospect played the slickest of one-twos with Mahrez to find space down for a cross that Gabriel Jesus headed straight at Hart, then combined with De Bruyne in the move that led to Mahrez’s goal. Sané appeared to have wasted a shooting opportunity by going for one pass too many but Mahrez rescued the situation by gathering the stray ball and producing an exquisite curling shot from just outside the area. When Sané added a fifth at the death from Mendy’s cross Hart was left kicking a goalpost in frustration, though as someone who knows both these clubs well he cannot have been all that surprised."},

Brighton to win it but the resigned boos and muted atmosphere at the final whistle reflected the reality that Newcastle lack the vision and incision to extricate themselves from the bottom of the table.\n\nA chronic lack of summer investment is largely responsible for Newcastle catching a debilitating autumn cold. “It’s difficult,” said Benítez, who is struggling with a nasty cough. “But I’m still confident. We just need to take our chances.”\n\nThe former Champions League-winning manager should not bear the brunt of the blame for his side’s plight but faces arguably the biggest challenge of his career.\n\n“It’s a difficult period for Newcastle but Rafa will be confident he can turn it round,” Hughton said. “They’ve had difficult periods like this before and got through them.”\n\nBrighton endured a concerning start when Glenn Murray required lengthy treatment following a sickening clash of heads with Federico Fernández. After a worrying hiatus, Murray was taken to hospital where he was soon fully conscious and undergoing precautionary scans. “Glenn’s OK, he’s been discharged, but he’ll stay up here overnight,” Hughton said. “There was real fear when it happened, though.”\n\nMurray’s injury set a sombre tone and it took a while to recapture an early momentum that had seen Ryan save brilliantly from Ayoze Pérez after Jonjo Shelvey had dispossessed a slapdash Gaëtan Bong.\n\nSouthampton hold Bournemouth but Manolo Gabbiadini blows chance of win Read more\n\nUp in the directors’ box, Ashley seemed to curse Ryan’s heroics.

if they continue to give the impression they have yet to hit their stride. They were the better team and had the best player on show in Érik Lamela, whose cute first-half header proved the difference.\n\nBut it was not plain sailing, with West Ham digging deep in the second half, playing with greater intensity and advertising the equaliser on three occasions through Marko Arnautovic. Yet the striker could not find a way past Hugo Lloris.\n\nBrighton’s Beram Kayal scrambles home to send abject Newcastle rock bottom Read more\n\nOne thing was clear. It is a good sign for Mauricio Pochettino that Spurs are winning without dazzling. The manager spoke afterwards of the obstacles that he and the club have had to face, some of them linked to the delayed White Hart Lane rebuild. They are finding various ways to keep going and are flying under the radar somewhat while doing so.\n\nThis was the start of a run of seven games in 21 days, during which Tottenham will need all of their powers of endurance. They resume on Wednesday at PSV Eindhoven in a must-win Champions League tie but here, Pochettino could bask in a hard-fought success.\n\n“It’s not a problem to me if the people don’t want to give us credit,” Pochettino said, in response to a question about his club’s title-winning prospects. “The most important thing is to win games and manage a lot of circumstances, which are not ideal. We suffered in the end but this was an amazing victory.”\n\nLamela is not an automatic selection – this was his first Premier League start of the season – but he is becoming increasingly influential and has five goals from eight appearances in all competitions. He caught the eye with his flair and acceleration, not to mention his industry. “He is more mature, more relaxed in front of goal,” Pochettino said.\n\nWest Ham consider Tottenham as their biggest grudge game, even if the feeling is not mutual. It did not feel like a big match, with the atmosphere subdued for long spells. As has been endlessly discussed and lamented, the London Stadium is not the cauldron Upton Park once was. After failing to show up in the first half, West Ham did push after the break but with Lloris suppressing Arnautovic, it was not a day for them to remember.\n\nTottenham flickered during a slow-burning start, with Moussa Sissoko watching a deflected effort loop off target and Harry Kane denied by an Issa Diop slide-tackle after Lucas Moura’s through-ball.\n\nSissoko played well on the right of Pochettino’s midfield three and he produced the moment of the match when he jinked inside Felipe Anderson and crossed with his left foot for Lamela to break the deadlock. The technique was wonderful – not something that has been said too often of Sissoko – and he would receive a great ovation when he was substituted in the last minute.\n\nTottenham might have been further in front at half-time but, after pushing out Lamela’s cross, Lukasz Fabianski got down to deny Davinson Sánchez at close quarters.\n\nRoberto Pereyra strikes as Watford stun Wolves with two goals in one minute Read more\n\nWest Ham could not get going before the interval, with Anderson particularly poor, flunking corners and struggling defensively. He was substituted before the hour, after an attempt to beat his man ended with him running the ball over the sideline.\n\nThe home team were also rocked by the loss of Andriy Yarmolenko to a nasty ankle injury. The winger got his studs stuck in the turf as he attempted to chase a ball following a corner and it was an ugly twist that left him writhing in agony.\n\nWest Ham were better in the second half, with Arnautovic central to everything they did. He sent a looping header towards the top corner that Lloris clawed to safety and then watched as the goalkeeper pushed a low shot from him around the far post. At the very end, Arnautovic wriggled free of Sánchez but Lloris left his line to block."}, {"date": "20/10/2018", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 31144, "home_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Conor Coady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Boly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Doherty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Rúben Neves", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "João Moutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Otto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Hélder Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raúl Jiménez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Diogo Jota", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ivan Cavaleiro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romain Saiss", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Vinagre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kortney Hause", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leo Bonatini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Masina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [20], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [21], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Ken Sema", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Domingos Quina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Navarro Ceciliano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Wilmot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Just when Wolves supporters thought this Premier League lark was easy. Two goals in 58 seconds during the first half, courtesy of Étienne Capoue’s long-distance effort and a deft finish from Roberto Pereyra, inflicted their first home defeat of the season to offer Nuno Espírito Santo’s side a timely reality check.\n\nThe Wolves manager had named an unchanged side in the league for the ninth match in a row – a run that had seen them go six matches unbeaten, conceding only six goals and picking up 15 points.\n\nÉrik Lamela the star as Tottenham hold on for narrow win at West Ham Read more\n\nBy contrast, Watford seemed to have spiralled into the kind of form they usually reserve for the end of the season after winning their first four matches in such style: since beating Tottenham at the start of September, they had picked up only a solitary point.\n\nThere was no Troy Deeney, owing to a hamstring injury, meaning Javi Gracia handed opportunities to Gerard Deulofeu and Isaac Success in attack, while the Italian Adam Masina made his first league start at left-back.\n\nIt all pointed to another home victory for a team who have been described as the best promoted side in Premier League history by Jamie Redknapp, but, in Pereyra and Abdoulaye Doucouré, Watford have players who would grace almost any team in the division.\n\nPereyra was the catalyst for the opening goal, with his pass to Doucouré then setting up Capoue for a daisy-cutter from 30 yards that deceived Rui Patrício after squeezing through the legs of Conor Coady. Wolves barely had time to react before it was 2-0. The dominant Doucouré won the ball back and was on hand to deliver another assist as Pereyra guided a sublime finish past Patrício with the outside of his left foot for his fourth of the season.\n\n“For me it was the key to the game,” said a delighted Gracia. “To score again so quickly gave us the chance to get a deserved victory. I’m very pleased for my players and the supporters. We had two tough weeks preparing and we had a good reward.”\n\nIt could have been even worse before the break for Wolves had Lee Mason decided Isaac Success had been brought down inside the box in a marginal decision but, to Espírito Santo’s relief, the referee signalled for a free-kick.\n\nThe hosts continued to stick to the principles that have brought such rewards so far yet they barely troubled Ben Foster in the Watford goal, as Doucouré and Capoue controlled midfield.\n\nManchester City hammer Burnley with Leroy Sané adding the finishing touch Read more\n\nThey simply had to improve, and the introduction of Rúben Vinagre as a second-half substitute saw Foster at last called into action to palm away a dangerous cross. For obvious reasons given his West Brom associations, the goalkeeper was a target for Wolves fans but he had to be alert to deny Willy Boly’s attempted backheel on the hour mark. After that, he was rarely troubled.\n\nA lightning break instigated by Pererya then almost settled the game for good, only for Rúben Neves to deny Doucouré what would have been a deserved goal with a brilliant tackle. Espírito Santo turned to super sub Adama Traoré in a bid to rouse his players but it was Ivan Cavaleiro who wasted the best opportunity when he headed over from 10 yards. Hélder Costa also blazed over from inside the box as Watford recorded their first win in four league games and climbed above Wolves in the table.\n\n“We didn’t perform,” Espírito Santo said. “It was a very bad first half but we showed some character in the second half. How you lose is important.

The good news for Jürgen Klopp’s side is that the cliche of grinding out wins can be evoked because they struggled throughout. While the three goals they have conceded is also a record for this stage of a campaign, the manager did admit concern.\n\n“The last pass wasn’t good. How can I explain that?” Klopp said. “I need to look back at the game. The players weren’t great with their last pass. The performance wasn’t 100%, it looked like we could have scored in six or seven situations.”\n\nBarcelona v Sevilla: La Liga – live! Read more\n\nThe Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, made one change, replacing Rajiv van La Parra with Florent Hadergjonaj as he searched for a first Premier League win. Klopp made three adjustments: Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana and Xherdan Shaqiri replaced Sadio Mané, who was injured, and Roberto Firmino and Georginio Wijnaldum, who were substitutes. It was Lallana’s first league start since New Year’s Day and Sturridge’s first for 11 months.\n\nLiverpool failed to dominate and Klopp was visibly upset at his side’s lack of composure and shape. He did though have reason to smile on 25 minutes when his side scored a slick opener.\n\nIt occurred in a flash: Joe Gomez played the ball inside from the right to Shaqiri. In turn he slid it forward to Mohamed Salah along an inside channel and his neat finish rolled in off Jonas Lössl’s right post for his fourth goal of the season and his 50th in all for Liverpool.\n\nStill Klopp remained unhappy due to the lack of press on the ball and that came close to costing Liverpool. In yards of space, Laurent Depoitre found Aaron Mooy and he switched play left. Erik Durm fashioned a cross and when Andrew Robertson cleared the ball fell to Jonathan Hogg. From 25 yards the captain beat Alisson but not his right post, the ball pinging off it and allowing Liverpool to escape.\n\nWhen half-time arrived Klopp will surely have urged his team to tighten up and wake up, because Huddersfield had posed a threat throughout the opening 45 minutes. A Philip Billing free-kick that went close, a James Milner handball in the area that was not given as a penalty, and Alex Pritchard’s offside strike all served as warnings.\n\nWagner said: “This handball situation was a huge situation and I don’t understand why it wasn’t a penalty. That could easily decide the direction of the match. But apart from this we limited them and they’re a top-class team. We were with them and we can take this forward with us.”\n\nJordan Henderson complained of a tight hamstring at the break so was replaced by Wijnaldum. When the second half began Liverpool launched an attack almost instantly. Although it ended with Sturridge’s swivel and shot going too high Klopp applauded what was a rejigged formation that had Sturridge on the right with Salah, who was now the No 9.\n\nHuddersfield 0-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nStill there were errant passes and a lack of sharpness from Liverpool. Milner hit one ball straight out and Mooy was able to race through a central area in a Huddersfield move that ended with Depoitre heading into Alisson’s arms. Klopp’s default expression had become an agonised look towards the bench as his charges again failed to adhere to his blueprint.\n\nThe problem for Wagner’s men was a lack of composure, a shortcoming vividly highlighted by a scuffed Billing effort from outside the area. When Lallana and then Milner were replaced – the former for Fabinho on 68 minutes and the latter for Firmino on 77 – it meant none of Liverpool’s starting midfield trio would finish the game, a sign of Klopp’s disquiet.\n\nWhile this was Fabinho’s Premier League bow, Firmino became the latest to baffle Klopp when he hit a pass to no one. Near the end Steve Mounié might have equalised when Virgil van Dijk failed to clear but the effort was mis-hit. Liverpool managed to cling on, but only just.\n\nOf still having only three points Wagner said: “It’s a wonderful challenge we face and it’s exciting.”"}, {"date": "07/10/2018", "arena": "Craven

midway through the second half here when the away following in the Putney end broke into a raucous chorus of: “We’ve got our Arsenal back.” That it had taken a goal that could have been lifted straight from the glittering pomp of the Arsène Wenger era to provoke such a reaction carried a certain irony, but their delight was understandable.\n\nThis was a ninth successive win in all competitions –only Herbert Chapman, George Graham and Wenger have achieved that for this club. Unai Emery is making quite the impression. The majestic third goal of a rampant display epitomised Arsenal’s most vibrant victory to date under the Spaniard, with a fluid frontline utterly irresistible for long periods and, by the end, slicing through their demoralised hosts at will.\n\nFulham 1-5 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWatching them conjure first-time passes in the buildup to shift the ball swiftly from the excellent Alexandre Lacazette to Héctor Bellerín, Aaron Ramsey to Henrikh Mkhitaryan, was to recall Wenger’s teams at their fluent best.\n\nThe Armenian’s reverse pass into space duly released Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang but it still required Ramsey, who had been on the pitch for less than 40 seconds, to improvise a backheel in supplying the finish. The ball kissed the far post with Marcus Bettinelli helpless before dribbling over the line.\n\nEvery win needs putting in context, and Fulham were obliging hosts – 21 goals shipped in eight league matches will have alarm bells ringing in these parts, not least because it does not feel surprising – but to see Arsenal revelling in this fashion is still restorative given the discord that has festered over recent years across north London. Lucas Torreira is imposing himself in central midfield but, as an attacking force, they would not be contained whether it was Alex Iwobi and Danny Welbeck leading the charge, or Mkhitaryan and Ramsey in the latter stages. “We knew we could win today if we were efficient,” said Lacazette, whose ruthless finishing had served to deflate the hosts and offered Aubameyang a platform upon which to revel late on. “We knew we’d create a lot of chances.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aaron Ramsey caps a wonderful Arsenal move with a delightful backheeled finish. Photograph: Javier Garcia/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThey actually created fewer than half of Fulham’s 21, but there was bite, energy and class to their attack that eased them home and ensured their 5,700-mile round-trip to Baku in midweek was less of a hindrance. The hosts could point to a bright start when Bernd Leno reacted smartly to turn away Luciano Vietto’s shot, deflected sharply off Rob Holding. Or the slickness of André Schürrle’s equaliser just before the break, the German lifting a shot over his onrushing compatriot from Vietto’s pass. They could even rue their own substitute Aboubakar Kamara’s fluffed header, which might have forced them level for a second time.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBut in truth they will stagger into the international break still contemplating how best to address the step up needed in terms of defensive discipline having been scythed apart far too easily for comfort. “We opened all the doors,” said Slavisa Jokanovic ruefully. “They finished the actions easily. I don’t believe in sitting deep in our own box, but we’re showing too many weaknesses defensively for Premier League level at the moment. This is realistic. We need to be more solid, more competitive. Arsenal showed the quality, the pace, the strength. This is what I missed.”\n\nFulham knew there would be difficult days like this following promotion. In the second tier, they could be confident of outscoring all-comers. At this level, Fulham will never be clear of trouble while they remain this porous. A clean sheet feels unthinkable at present.\n\nMahrez penalty miss leaves Liverpool and Manchester City at impasse Read more\n\nLacazette had wrecked their latest attempt at a shutout just before the half-hour mark, Iwobi and the overlapping Nacho Monreal having combined down the left for the striker to collect, hold off Tim Ream, spin and finish crisply beyond the wrong-footed Bettinelli. His second, just after the break, actually stemmed from a throw-in and innocuous punt upfield by Lucas Torreira, nodded down by Welbeck to the striker just outside the penalty area. He sensed Ream had offered him sufficient space to prosper and duly ripped a volley beyond an unsuspecting Bettinelli from distance.\n\nRamsey’s sumptuous contribution in effect settled the contest, with Aubameyang prospering in what time remained with any semblance of resistance having melted away. The substitute spun away from Maxime Le Marchand to convert from close-range, then skipped on to Ramsey’s pass to ram a fifth into the corner.\n\nMesut Özil, absent with a back spasm, was not missed in the slightest.

He insisted the gap is too big and that Chelsea will struggle to plug all of their holes in a single season. Even in victory Sarri refused to gloss over a couple of slips at the back and a few wrong choices in the final third. The Italian is proving a hard man to please.\n\nRoss Barkley attributes improved form for Chelsea to Maurizio Sarri Read more\n\nYet for all those misgivings, is it so ridiculous to call Chelsea contenders when their new manager has introduced himself to English football by winning six and drawing two of his first eight Premier League games? They are playing their football with a smile again and had a strut in their step when they rubbed salt in Southampton’s wounds with the kind of slick goal that suggests Sarri’s players are gaining an ominous understanding of his methods.\n\nThere were 93 minutes on the clock when Chelsea quickened the pace with an extended passing sequence. The 31st pass came from Eden Hazard and it left Álvaro Morata free to dink his shot over Alex McCarthy, Southampton’s goalkeeper. “We move the ball very quick,” Sarri said. “One touch, then we arrive in the goal so easily. The maximum at two touches. I can see my way of football in this situation.”\n\nSarri called it Chelsea’s best goal since his appointment in the summer and the former Napoli manager’s impact could also be seen in the change in Ross Barkley. The midfielder caught the eye on his first league start since August, providing the assist for Hazard to break the deadlock in the first half and killing Southampton off when he scored for the first time since joining from Everton in January.\n\nIt was a controlled display from Barkley, who has been called up by England for the first time in 18 months. “I am happy with him, for the goal, for the national team,” Sarri said. “I said from the first day that he had great physical quality but he had to improve from the tactical point of view. Now he has improved.”\n\nBarkley’s performance was one of several positives for Chelsea, who were rarely in danger of suffering a Europa League hangover. Jorginho pulled the strings in midfield and the visitors quickly discovered that Southampton, who languish three points above the bottom three, were obliging hosts.\n\nChelsea’s high press had a smothering effect. There were times when Southampton’s 3-4-3 system morphed into a 5-4-1 and they almost fell behind in the eighth minute. Cédric Soares raced back to deny Hazard, however, and Southampton breathed a sigh of relief when Willian’s deflected effort clipped the top of the bar.\n\nThe frustration for Mark Hughes was that the opening goal arrived just when Southampton were settling down. Chelsea, who host Manchester United after the international break, had found it difficult to create clear openings for Olivier Giroud. Yet they pounced when Southampton tried to play out from the back in the 30th minute. “We’ve been guilty of overplaying on the edge of our box,” Hughes said. “They set the trap and we fell into it.”\n\nSouthampton 0-3 Chelsea: Premier League - as it happened Read more\n\nWesley Hoedt sent a lazy pass to Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and the Danish midfielder was too slow to release the ball. Barkley won possession and registered his first assist for 18 months by releasing Hazard, who was never going to pass up the opportunity to score his eighth goal of the season.\n\nIt was a galling way for Southampton to concede, especially as Danny Ings had wasted a glorious chance five minutes earlier. They were on the front foot at that point and there were howls of disbelief when Ings volleyed over from close range after a fine cross from Ryan Bertrand. Hazard would show the Southampton forward how to finish, steadying himself before aiming high to McCarthy’s left.\n\nHughes switched to a back four at half-time, replacing Jan Bednarek with Oriol Romeu, but the gloom deepened when Bertrand squandered an easy chance to equalise.\n\nChelsea punished their former left-back’s profligacy in the 57th minute. Giroud’s acrobatic volley from Willian’s deep free-kick was going wide but Barkley was in the right place to bundle in his first goal since May 2017.\n\nSouthampton, who have won only one of their last 15 league games at St Mary’s, were done and Chelsea added a third when Morata scored for the second time in three days."}, {"date": "07/10/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 52117,

contest between the two sides who are widely assumed to have the outstanding players – the challengers versus the champions, according to the television blurb – is fit for a place in only the small print.\n\nDid Liverpool versus Manchester City, with all their attacking riches, really just finish in a 0-0 draw? Not many would have anticipated such an outcome and, for Riyad Mahrez, it will be remembered as a personal ordeal.\n\nLiverpool v Manchester City: Premier League — live! Read more\n\nIf nothing else, Mahrez at least showed the nerve to seize the ball when Virgil van Dijk’s maladroit challenge on Leroy Sané, one of City’s substitutes, gave Pep Guardiola’s team an 85th-minute penalty and the chance to win a strangely subdued match. By that stage Sergio Agüero, City’s usual penalty-taker, had been substituted. His replacement, Gabriel Jesus, wanted the glory but Mahrez was given the responsibility and City will regret the missed opportunity. Mahrez’s penalty was struck wildly, skyrocketed over the crossbar and still rising as it flew into the crowd.\n\nShould he have taken it in the first place? Mahrez has now missed five of his last eight penalties and, at the very least, it is a legitimate question bearing in mind the importance of that kick, with City trying to strike a significant early blow in the title race. Mahrez had the chance to secure City’s first win at Anfield in 18 attempts. As it was, Liverpool can reflect on a lucky escape on a day that was otherwise full of intrigue but low on incident and, for long spells, not far off being a bit of a stinker.\n\nIf that sounds slightly harsh, perhaps it is because of last season’s epic contest when Liverpool led 4-1, were pegged back to 4-3 in the final six minutes and City very nearly completed an improbable feat of escapology in stoppage time. Guardiola did not enjoy coming off second-best in a seven-goal thriller and this time his side were set up to play with restraint, to slow the game down and stop Liverpool rolling out the favourite Anfield tactic of sustained, often wild pressure. That left Liverpool with a different type of challenge and the most disappointing part for Jürgen Klopp must be that they did not have the wit or creativity to conjure up a single clear chance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riyad Mahrez reacts after missing his penalty. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nIt was certainly unusual to see the amount of time City’s players spent passing the ball around their own defence, often at little more than walking pace, while the Liverpool fans whistled their discontent. It did not help the match as a spectacle but Guardiola clearly thought it was worth trying something different and, however much it was out of character, perhaps he could be excused this one time.\n\nIt was May 2003 when City last won at Anfield, with Kevin Keegan in the dugout and Nicolas Anelka scoring the last-minute winner. If Mahrez had struck his shot on target, City might have been celebrating a brilliantly disciplined away performance – just not the tactics, perhaps, that would usually be expected of Guardiola.\n\nBy the midway point of the first half Liverpool had been subdued to the point that a triumphant cry of “Where’s your famous atmosphere?” could be heard from the away supporters. That brought a nice riposte of “Where’s your European Cups?” from the Kop, but on the pitch the home team were finding it difficult to fathom out what their opponents were scheming. Liverpool desperately needed one of their front players to seize the game by its lapels, liven up the tempo and encourage the crowd to turn up the volume. As it was, Mohamed Salah toiled away without any real joy. If anything, Salah was the pick of Liverpool’s attackers but he, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané have rarely looked so ineffective as a front three.\n\nNot that City were too potent themselves. Indeed, here is a question: when was the last time Agüero started for City without having a single chance to test the opposition goalkeeper? That was the problem with Guardiola’s tactics – by adopting this new, slower keep-ball they sacrificed some of the attacking qualities that make them such a dangerous team in their own right. City did control large spells of play but it was often bordering on risk-free football, with their full-backs rarely venturing forward, Bernardo Silva operating in a more withdrawn role than usual and Raheem Sterling, as often happens at Anfield, finding it difficult to have any positive impact.\n\nRoss Barkley scores first Chelsea goal in easy win over struggling Southampton Read more\n\nNonetheless City still looked the more rounded side. They also had another three penalty appeals throughout the match, two of them coming against Dejan Lovren for a first-half challenge on Agüero and, later, for swiping his hand into the face of Jesus to stop a promising run from the Brazilian.\n\nLiverpool, who lost James Milner to a hamstring injury, were also grateful the referee, Martin Atkinson, ruled that Van Dijk had been pushed by Fernandinho after the centre-half jutted out an arm to block the ball while defending a corner. The penalty Atkinson did award came from a needless challenge from Van Dijk.

Huddersfield at Turf Moor.\n\nThe Terriers climbed off the bottom of the Premier League table after Christopher Schindler cancelled out Sam Vokes’ opener but it was two off-the-ball incidents that provided the main talking points.\n\nThe game was delayed for more than five minutes in the second half while Schindler was treated after taking an elbow in the face from Vokes. The referee, Christopher Kavanagh, took no action so the Football Association may take a look. The German defender then blocked a shot from Ashley Westwood with his face and Huddersfield’s medical staff had to work hard to stop the bleeding from two cuts, one on the bridge of his nose and one under his right eye.\n\nMatt Doherty gives Wolves the edge over profligate Crystal Palace Read more\n\nWagner was inclined to give Vokes the benefit of the doubt in terms of intent but said: “This is nothing I like to see in football. I don’t like to say that opponents do it on purpose but they have to have better control over their bodies. This is too dangerous, this is ugly.”\n\nDyche did not feel it was anything more than an accident at the time and insisted it was not in Vokes’ character to make a deliberate action. Wagner felt the same about Laurent Depoitre’s second-half dive, which Kavanagh did punish with a yellow card and which left Dyche irate. The Burnley manager said: “A yellow card isn’t going to make a difference. Is anyone going to do it next week? Yes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sam Vokes headed Burnley into a first-half lead.

We’re not talking about gamesmanship, we’re talking about blatant dives, and today was cringeworthy. But no one wants to do anything about it apart from me it seems.”\n\nDyche wants players either to be red-carded or face retrospective punishment.\n\n“Ban them, every single time,” he said. “Because it’ll disappear. If he’s seen it well enough to book him, just send him off.”\n\nWagner said he would speak to Depoitre, adding: “This is, of course, something else that we don’t like to see. Like these ugly elbow challenges, we don’t like to see diving.”\n\nEric Dier fires home to steer Tottenham past 10-man Cardiff City Read more\n\nHuddersfield came away from the game with a fourth goal of the season and third point, but Wagner justifiably felt they deserved more after having more than two-thirds of the possession and 19 shots to Burnley’s six. “This was a very good, very strong performance,” the German said. “We looked brave, we looked confident, we played very good football, we controlled and dominated as well most parts of the game. We were able to come back from 1-0 down and the least we deserved was a point. We should have had three but we’ll take it.”\n\nDyche felt aggrieved that Vokes did not get a penalty in the first half when he appeared to be pulled back but accepted his side were below their best. The Burnley manager said: “First half, very good, game should have been out of sight, three golden chances at this level.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“Second half, they didn’t relent.

Last year’s Championship title was almost entirely stress-free and it would not be too much of a stretch to claim the same for this victory, a fourth in five Premier League matches. Wolves are ensconced in the top half of the table now, and they look comfortable there.\n\nWolves consistently play football of a high technical standard. They are comfortable in possession and lethal on the break. Matt Doherty’s decisive goal was consistent with the style, featuring a sweet switch of play and a swift one-two. But Nuno does not like to talk about that stuff too much. What he prefers to celebrate is the discipline of his team.\n\n“I’m really pleased with how we played and got this result‚“ he said. “If we make a quick analysis, Crystal Palace started stronger and created problems, but after the moment we adjusted some details, we got much better. In the second half we were really good. Really good\n\nJoshua King makes Watford’s Kabasele pay with double for Bournemouth Read more\n\n“Clean sheets are the beginning of everything,” he went on. “We did well and we won against a very good team, but it’s about the defensive organisation. Of course other teams will have chances, it’s impossible to avoid and that’s why the keeper is there to try and save it. But with a clean sheet you are always closer to winning a game.”\n\nThere was no quibbling with Nuno’s analysis. After weathering the opening 20 minutes, played out against a backdrop of howling rain, Wolves took command. They could and perhaps should have scored in the first half, with good chances for Raúl Jiménez and Diogo Jota.\n\nAfter taking the lead, they returned to soaking up Palace pressure, but with a confidence that never looked misplaced. In João Moutinho and Rúben Neves, they had not only the best technical players, but a pair who worked like dogs to protect their back line.\n\nEric Dier fires home to steer Tottenham past 10-man Cardiff City Read more\n\nRoy Hodgson tried to throw a different spin on events, and he probably had to. He claimed that his team’s opening period amounted to domination and that in the first half they had “not only the best of the possession but the best of the game”. But the phrase that stuck out in the Palace manager’s remarks regarded a lack of clear cut chances. This reflected the fact that however willing Palace were in the opening period they were unable to break Wolves down.\n\nDoherty’s goal came 10 minutes into the second half and started with a crunching tackle from Conor Coady that won possession. The ball ran to Neves, who did not need to look to know where the space was as he pushed the ball wide right to Doherty. The Irishman stood up to Patrick van Aanholt and then whipped the ball beyond him to Jiménez in the penalty area. The Mexican, with his back to goal, took a touch and played Doherty in again, his marker no longer on the scene. Falling to the ground, the wing-back hit a shot beyond Wayne Hennessey and into the net.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nHodgson said the goal allowed Wolves to sit in, but it did not seem like the visitors changed their game plan much. They had been happy to soak up Palace pressure throughout. The greatest danger to them came from quick crosses and one such delivery created Palace’s best opportunity in the 68th minute. It was Andros Townsend who sent the ball over and it was only cleared as far as substitute Max Meyer who drove a sweet volley back at Rui Patrício. The keeper not only saved that effort but Jeffrey Schlupp’s bundled follow-up too.\n\nPalace have now failed to score in their past four home games and there was a clear lack of goal threat here. Their reliance on Wilfried Zaha is well-established, but the talisman was quiet. Schlupp and André Ayew were more involved, but lacked the necessary quality at decisive moments. Hodgson must look at the options available to Nuno and feel a little envious.

Their team swaggered to a first away win of the season thanks to an attacking performance crackling with skill and speed and crowned by a wonderful long-range goal by Gylfi Sigurdsson. The Icelander’s spectacular strike in the 77th minute ensured that Marco Silva’s team left with the three points they deserved from a display in which their two Brazilians, Richarlison and Bernard, sparkled.\n\nJoshua King makes Watford’s Kabasele pay with double for Bournemouth Read more\n\nThat duo combined for the opening goal in the seventh minute and, although Leicester equalised with an excellent goal of their own in the 40th minute – Ricardo Pereira topping off a superb counterattack – the visitors always looked the more likely winners, especially after Wes Morgan was sent off shortly after the hour. The eighth match of their Premier League campaign may well prove to be the one in which Silva’s era as Everton manager began in earnest.\n\n“This is our image,” said Silva, delighted with the verve his team showed going forward. “It will be so in the future more and more, I don’t have doubts about that. But we have many things to do to keep improving. It is a very young squad and in some moments we have to be more mature. But we showed from the first minute how we wanted to win the match.”\n\nYes, they did. Bernard, given his first start of the league campaign since his free transfer from Shakhtar Donetsk, thrilled on the left wing while Richarlison thrived in a central striking role. Meanwhile Sigurdsson revelled just behind Richarlison, having been deployed in his most effective position by Silva after spending most of last season stationed on the left wing by Sam Allardyce.\n\n“Our style is completely different to the style from last season,” said Silva. “It fits really differently into his profile as a player. If you have a player like Gylfi and are always playing direct balls and preparing for the second balls, of course it is not for Gylfi. If you can create and build a style of play to fit, it will help him.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ricardo Pereira equalises for Leicester. Photograph: Craig Brough/Reuters\n\nThe Icelander could not have offered a more breathtaking vindication of that view. His goal here – his fourth in the league this season after scoring six in all of the last campaign – was good enough to settle any argument. After collecting a pass from Kurt Zouma midway inside the Leicester half, Sigurdsson fooled James Maddison with a Cruyff turn and dispatched a swirling drive into the top corner of the net from 25 yards. There was no way back for Leicester, especially with their numerical disadvantage.\n\nTheir manager, Claude Puel, did not welcome suggestions that there is no way back for Morgan, even though this was the second dismissal in four matches for a centre-back who turns 35 in January. “He is unlucky,” said Puel, indicating the referee could have been more lenient. “And his second yellow at Bournemouth [in September] was never a foul, so we need to make the right analysis.”\n\nEric Dier fires home to steer Tottenham past 10-man Cardiff City Read more\n\nThe two fouls that drew bookings for Morgan here were perpetrated on Richarlison, whose elusiveness tormented the defender for most of the match. Bernard, meanwhile, bewildered Ricardo Pereira and Daniel Amartey on the right-hand side of Leicester’s team, starting in the seventh minute when he darted past both of them before crossing. Kasper Schmeichel tried to cut out the delivery but only diverted it into the path of Richarlison, who volleyed home from eight yards.\n\nEverton’s intensive pressing continued to trouble Leicester but Jamie Vardy should have equalised after being sent clear by Kelechi Iheanacho. Five minutes before the break they did draw level through a lightning counterattack.

Tormented and taken apart by Barcelona here on Wednesday, they would have expected a visit from Cardiff to prove a far less stressful occasion, yet while they went on to secure a third successive Premier League victory it was by no means as comfortable as it should have been.\n\nThe hosts dominated possession, territory and chances created yet, having taken the lead through Eric Dier’s early goal, they could well have dropped points had Cardiff enjoyed more luck in front of goal.\n\nA team that arrived in London winless and without a player who is in the same galaxy, let alone planet, as Lionel Messi caused Spurs concern, with their manager, Neil Warnock, accusing Harry Kane of getting Joe Ralls sent off following the midfielder’s knee-high challenge on Lucas Moura on 58 minutes.\n\nKane charged towards Ralls and aggressively grabbed hold of him, for which he was booked by Mike Dean but only after the referee had shown Ralls a red card.\n\nCardiff’s players reacted furiously to the decision, as did Warnock, with footage appearing to show him calling Kane a twat as tempers frayed. He denied that but was not sparing in his criticism of the England captain.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson wonder strike gives Everton win over 10-man Leicester Read more\n\n“I wouldn’t say that [twat], it would be twit wouldn’t it?” said Warnock. “He plays for England, I love him. But I don’t think you should try to get other pros sent off. Just because he’s had a poor game and Spurs were having a poor game, he shouldn’t take it out on us.\n\n“It [the sending-off] was a very soft one. He [the referee] said violent conduct but I don’t see it being violent conduct. I think he went for his yellow but all afternoon there’s been busy people around him. He should have followed his instinct.”\n\nWarnock’s criticism of Ralls’s dismissal was somewhat one-eyed given the force with which the 24-year-old cut down Lucas as the Brazilian looked to drive past him. His criticism of Kane was also a little over the top, but he was undeniably right to suggest Spurs were far from their best, something Mauricio Pochettino conceded.\n\n“It wasn’t the best performance,”he said. “After the defeat against Barcelona it was difficult, but I’m happy because of the victory. We deserved it. But we can play better and we need to play better if we want to be a contender for the top four.”\n\nPochettino insisted his players were not suffering with tiredness following their seventh game in less than a month but there was an unmistakably leggy feel to their display against opponents who now find themselves rooted to the bottom of the table. They lacked sharpness in defence and attack with Kane looking less than his usual self.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joe Ralls was sent off after taking out Lucas. Photograph: Alex James/JMP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nHe arrived here with four goals in his past three appearances but generally struggled to make an impact in a surprisingly withdrawn attacking role. An arrowed shot on 56 minutes that went just wide of the post was pretty much as good as it got and ultimately he was as relieved as anyone in Spurs’ ranks that Dier did hit the target after eight minutes.\n\nThe midfielder found himself in the right place at the right time after Kieran Trippier’s cross from a left-sided short corner had ricochetted off Joe Bennett via a Davinson Sánchez header. Dier was a few yards from goal and lashed the ball past Neil Etheridge with ease.\n\nAs Tottenham celebrated, Warnock could be seen shaking his head, clearly annoyed with his side for conceding from a set-piece. But he was rightly proud of the way they refused to wilt and having kept their shape in a 4-1‑4-1 formation looked to push back their opponents with a direct and aggressive approach.\n\nIn the process, Cardiff created two huge opportunities, the first of which arrived on 23 minutes. Josh Murphy reacted quicker than Danny Rose to Callum Paterson’s flick on and having found himself one-on-one with Hugo Lloris lifted the ball over the goalkeeper and towards the back post, where Junior Hoilett would have been left with a simple tap-in had it not been for Toby Alderweireld’s hooked clearance.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe visitors went even closer on 64 minutes when Sean Morrison reacted to Víctor Camarasa’s free-kick with a diving header. The ball looked to be sneaking into the net only for Lloris to push it on to the post and for Alderweireld to clear again.\n\nThat chance came when Cardiff were down to 10 men. They were meant to lie down but instead kept fighting and for Tottenham the final whistle came as a relief. They have moved up to third having equalled their best start to a Premier League season after eight matches, but this was not an afternoon to remember."}, {"date": "06/10/2018", "arena": "Vicarage

handed a straight red for a “nasty” elbow on the Bournemouth goalkeeper, Asmir Begovic.\n\nBournemouth’s best start to a Premier League campaign has them fifth in the table, leaving Howe cautiously optimistic.\n\n“I just hope it gives us the confidence and belief that you need to win really difficult games in the Premier League,” he said. “We’ve got tough games to come and we’ll need all those mental qualities we showed today, and that we showed at the start of the season, to push on and get more results. Nothing’s a given in this league.”\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson wonder strike gives Everton win over 10-man Leicester Read more\n\nKabasele caught Begovic in the face with a stray elbow in the fist half, before conceding the penalty that King converted which saw him handed his marching orders.\n\nHowe praised his players for keeping their cool despite the ugly challenge on Begovic. “I’ve just very quickly seen it on screen and the first one is nasty, it looks a dangerous one for Asmir, the elbow coming across him,” he said. “That could easily have been a red in itself. I’m very pleased that our players stayed calm because at half-time, especially with the atmosphere in the ground, it would have been very easy for us to lose control in one moment and then the numbers would be level again.”\n\nJavi Gracia said Watford must now get down to work to ensure no repeat of their hefty defeat. “It has been the first game where we hadn’t competed at the same level as other games,” the Watford manager said. “Today we have conceded more chances, we’ve made more mistakes than in all the other games put together.”\n\nKing’s double took his tally to four goals in eight games, with David Brooks and Callum Wilson also scoring.

Ryan Fraser’s incisive pass sent King haring down the inside-left channel and the forward conjured a teasing low cross to the far post. Wilson slid in expecting his tidy deflection to open the scoring, only for Ben Foster to pull off a fine save. Brooks finished the job, however, sweeping home the rebound to give his side the lead.\n\nWatford kept pressing and should have levelled when Craig Cathcart sneaked free from a corner but the unmarked defender headed wide from six yards.\n\nWilson nodded wide from a teasing Brooks cross as Bournemouth continued to press in an open encounter and then the visitors took full control. King drove into the Watford area, pursued by Kabasele, and the Watford defender’s constant attentions eventually stretched too far. Kabasele wiped out King, forcing the referee, Jonathan Moss, into awarding not only the penalty but also a second yellow card.\n\nAs a shell-shocked Kabasele trudged off towards the tunnel, King stepped up and coolly slotted home the spot-kick, cementing Bournemouth’s grip on the game.\n\nKing’s deft header then extended their lead further on the stroke of half-time, the Norway forward taking the pace off Wilson’s inch-perfect cross, to leave Foster overcommitted and nod his second goal in the half.\n\nNo sooner had the second half started than Bournemouth made it 4-0, Wilson latching on to Fraser’s cross to chip Foster, then tap into the unguarded net.\n\nThe visiting fans almost begged Bournemouth for a fifth but, despite dominating the remainder of the contest, they were already

"There were chants of “José Mourinho” from the Stretford End as Manchester United left it late to win their first home match in five attempts. There was no such backing when the home side went two goals down inside 10 minutes for the first time in a Premier League game at Old Trafford, but just when he needed it most Mourinho and his team came through with the sort of stirring fightback supporters had begun to despair of ever seeing again.\n\nThe stadium was a happy place at the end, it had seen the first decent game in quite some time, and neither of those eventualities seemed on the cards when the match kicked off. In terms of Mourinho’s future the much-discussed manager looked a goner as Newcastle started the game like a runaway train, yet one thrilling recovery later – capped by a winning goal from the much-maligned Alexis Sánchez – it was clear his players are anything but demotivated and far from certain that the Manchester United hierarchy need to make any hurried decisions over the weekend.\n\nManchester United 3-2 Newcastle United: Premier League – live reaction! Read more\n\nIt was only possible in the end to feel sorry for Newcastle, who were a major part of this game’s entertainment factor and were worth at least a share of the points, but the home side inexorably wore them down in the second half, when all three Manchester United goals were scored.\n\nNewcastle were extremely impressive as they raced into a 2-0 lead inside 10 minutes, making a mockery of the fact that they arrived in Manchester without a win to their name this season and giving a huge amount of credence to Rafael Benítez’s claim they will not be going down any time soon. By contrast, Mourinho’s rather hollow programme boast about having more Champions League points than any other English club – while Liverpool and Spurs were losing to Napoli and Inter, United were beating Young Boys of Switzerland – made a manager who once bestrode Europe look rather desperate for attention.\n\nWhen the game commenced it was apparent straight away that Newcastle intended to try to seize an opportunity rather than put up one of their defensive blockades. Hurrying their opponents into mistakes, the visitors capitalised first time when Nemanja Matic lost the ball on halfway. Ayoze Pérez played an inspired pass to set Kenedy free, cutting out both centre-halves with his accuracy and obliging Ashley Young to come across to cover. The full-back was too late, Kenedy held him off easily and whipped a shot into David de Gea’s bottom corner.\n\nIf that was bad, things got worse for the home side in another couple of minutes, when Eric Bailly failed to cut out a cross and the ball fell to Yoshinori Muto, making his first league start in a Newcastle shirt but looking dangerous from the beginning. The former Mainz striker had his back to goal at first but deftly turned to beat De Gea with a firmly struck shot.\n\nEven when two up Newcastle showed no intention of dropping back to protect their lead. Jonjo Shelvey brought a diving save from De Gea, Muto headed straight at the United goalkeeper from close range and Young was lucky not to have a penalty awarded against him when he blocked a free-kick with his arm. Mourinho’s response to going behind so quickly was to yank Bailly and send on Juan Mata, though the only clear-cut chance created before the interval fell to Marcus Rashford, who headed wide from Romelu Lukaku’s cross.\n\nThe Fiver: Sign up for our free football email.\n\nUnited were not only two down, they now had Scott McTominay operating at centre-back. Mourinho made another adjustment at half-time, withdrawing McTominay in favour of Marouane Fellaini, this time sending Matic and Paul Pogba back to help Chris Smalling with the defensive duties. Both midfielders nevertheless found themselves far enough forward to threaten early in the second half, Matic shooting too high after Martin Dubravka had produced a terrific save to deny Pogba. Rashford headed over from a Pogba cross as United poured their efforts into reducing the deficit with, it ought to be said, rousing backing from a crowd that spent the first half in shock.\n\nWith 23 minutes remaining Mourinho deployed his third substitute and his last hope in the form of Sánchez. The former Arsenal player immediately played a small part in pulling a goal back, but only as a dummy runner for Mata to strike a free-kick past Dubravka after Anthony Martial had been clipped by Mohamed Diamé on the edge of the area. It was no more than the home side deserved, for Newcastle’s composure had been showing signs of wilting through being relentlessly pushed back.\n\nAfter that the full comeback was on, and though Dubravka performed heroically to deny Fellaini and Martial he was eventually beaten by the latter as shots rained in on goal. United kept surging forward and even as the game entered its final minute there was still a certain inevitability about the third goal and its scorer, Sánchez rising behind Martial to head firmly home from Young’s cross.

The veteran striker has now found the net six times against them in the Premier League and took his tally for the calendar year to 12 as Brighton secured their fourth top-flight victory at home over the east London side in as many attempts.\n\nHarry Kane and Jamie Vardy are the only English players to outscore the 35-year-old in 2018 and there is no doubting his value to Brighton, with Chris Hughton’s side not having won since beating Manchester United in their second match of the season. But even though Marko Arnautovic wasted a great chance to snatch a point at the death following Murray’s 25th-minute effort – his 99th in total for the club – it was a relatively comfortable night for a team who had looked in danger of being dragged into a relegation battle before the match.\n\nBrighton v West Ham: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“It’s what he does best,” Hughton acknowledged of Murray. “Glenn has always had the knack of being in the right place at the right time – he’s a player who has looked after himself really well and that enables him not only to get the goals but to have an impact in the game.”\n\nAsked if Murray should be considered for an England call-up, Hughton added: “All I can speak about is what Glenn gives us. For somebody at this stage of the season to have scored five goals in the Premier League for this club is a big achievement.”\n\nBrighton had previously failed to record a clean sheet this campaign – a statistic that would have troubled Hughton given last season’s success was built on defensive solidity. As if to underline his confidence in central defenders Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk, the news that they had both signed new five-year contracts was announced hours before kick-off, while the recall of the club captain, Bruno – now 38 – was also designed to strengthen a backline that has already conceded 13 goals this season.\n\nBruno, Duffy, Dunk and [Gaëtan] Bong may sound like a psychedelic 60s band but, as a defensive unit, have served Brighton well in gaining promotion and achieving 10 clean sheets last season. They were certainly expecting a test from a resurgent visiting side, with the attacking trio of Arnautovic, Felipe Anderson and Andriy Yarmolenko part of an unchanged side from last Saturday’s victory over Manchester United.\n\nPremier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more\n\nOne unfamiliar name on the Brighton team sheet was Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who was handed his first Premier League start after his arrival for a club record £17m in the summer. The Iran forward showed some bright touches but struggled to make an impression in a congested midfield area in the opening exchanges, although Anthony Knockaert did manage to produce a shot on target in Brighton’s only real chance of note until Murray’s opener.\n\nYarmolenko was slow to react to pressure from Beram Kayal and the Israeli’s brilliant cross left Murray with a simple tap-in.\n\nAfter losing their first four games of the season, West Ham had seemed to have found their feet under Manuel Pellegrini but lacked the intensity on display during the wins over Everton and United. Despite dominating possession in the second half, Arnautovic, who came into the game carrying a knee injury, was the only real attacking threat of note and he sailed close to the wind after arguing with referee Kevin Friend over his booking for a studs-up challenge on Kayal.\n\nIt was the Austrian’s prompting that saw Fabián Balbuena’s effort deflected wide for a corner, only for the defender to then waste a golden chance having freed himself from the attentions of Murray at the back post.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBrighton’s talisman will have been disappointed not to have hit the target with a free header 20 minutes from time, while another effort looped agonisingly over Lucasz Fabianksi’s bar. He did put the ball in the net in stoppage time but saw his effort correctly ruled out for offside, with Arnautovic then blasting over from close range on an evening that Pellegrini will want to forget.\n\n“It was frustrating because we knew we were playing a difficult team who are very strong at home but we created three good chances to draw so I cannot be happy,” he said.\n\n“Maybe in the first 45 minutes they played with more intensity but in the second half we had the pace and played some good football.

A late penalty, awarded after Mamadou Sakho flung an arm clumsily into Jefferson Lerma as the hosts swung a hopeful free-kick into the box, had lifted Bournemouth to within two points of the top four in the fledgling Premier League table. For Crystal Palace, now beaten four times, the picture looks grimmer.\n\nIt was the carelessness of the concession that must have infuriated Roy Hodgson. His team had fought their way back to parity, albeit with a goal that a VAR would have ruled out for offside, only for their tempo to drop just as the game was there to be won, inviting late pressure as a result. Wayne Hennessey had done wonderfully well to deny Callum Wilson with his left leg, the striker having scurried on to Ryan Fraser’s pass beyond a ramshackle backline, and then to parry Dan Gosling’s header from a centre. The pivotal free-kick was awarded against Alexander Sorloth in the confusion that followed, with Palace’s composure having drained away.\n\nBournemouth 2-1 Crystal Palace: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThat did not excuse the offence. Sakho had already shoved Lerma away as the teams jostled for position on the edge of the penalty area waiting for Fraser’s delivery, earning a warning from the referee, Mike Dean. Surely it was obvious the official would be scrutinising that duel when the dead-ball was eventually taken, yet the Frenchman still glanced and flung back his elbow and forearm to connect with the Colombian while the ball sailed harmlessly into the penalty area. Junior Stanislas, a substitute who had yet to have a touch, grabbed the ball and converted the spot-kick.\n\nEverything Palace mustered thereafter was played out through a red mist. Hodgson claimed the free-kick conceded had been “needless” but suggested Sakho’s misdemeanour had been clumsy rather than malicious. “Mamadou has no intention to elbow the player, or use the elbow to stop the player getting to the ball,” he said. “But I can’t deny that, when you see it on the television, he does catch the player and, as a result, the referee is quite within his rights to award the penalty.” Howe, relieved his team’s furious opening and energetic finale had secured the points, had not seen a replay of the incident.\n\nHe could revel in a hard-fought win, with the tweaks he had made to his side after Palace’s equaliser having had the desired effect. There was plenty to admire in their display through two spells of superiority. Their opening had threatened to blow the visitors away, when Josh King and Wilson were unsettling James Tomkins and Sakho, and Fraser and David Brooks drove Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Patrick van Aanholt back into their shells. Brooks in particular caught the eye and it was the Wales international – who won best player at the 2017 Toulon Tournament while with England – whose first Bournemouth goal had put Bournemouth ahead.\n\nThe winger had already fizzed one low centre across the six-yard box by the time Adam Smith, operating from left-back, scuttled down the flank and squared for Wilson five minutes in. The striker, with his back to goal, calmly laid the ball across the area where Brooks, in space away from Van Aanholt, whipped a fine first-time shot beyond Hennessey and in off the crossbar.\n\n“He’s a goalscorer in waiting, so that was a big moment for him,” said Howe of his £11.5m signing from Sheffield United. “He’s not been overawed or phased. He’s attacked it. That’s a very special thing to do at such a young age.”\n\nPalace at least recovered some poise, even if they only really clicked for a 20-minute period either side of the interval when their midfield, with Max Meyer eager to accept possession on his first top-flight start and Luka Milivojevic more like his old self at the German’s side, wrested back some level of control. That spell yielded their goal, Wilfried Zaha spinning in possession to slip Van Aanholt beyond Simon Francis. The Dutchman was in an offside position as he glided free but, with no assistant’s flag forthcoming, checked back inside and ripped a right-foot finish emphatically into the top corner via Asmir Begovic’s fingertips.\n\nYet that was only this side’s fifth of the campaign and, with Zaha swamped by markers and not given a presentable opportunity all evening, they appear worryingly toothless. Jordan Ayew is industrious but hardly a predator. James McArthur, asked to push forward from midfield, has snatched at his half-chances to date this season. It is at times like these when a Christian Benteke-shaped hole gapes in their lineup, even if he is a player whose confidence is brittle after only three goals in 34 top-flight appearances. There is currently no presence to alarm opposing defenders. The hope is the knee injury which has hampered the Belgian of late will have cleared up after the international break. For all that his critics will protest, Palace are weakened without him."}, {"date": "30/09/2018", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 30411, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sol Bamba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Greg Cunningham", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Josh Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Paterson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kenneth Zohore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jazz Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kadeem Harris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Madine", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brian Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [27]}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [51], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [27], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "These are still early days but the season is already shaping up to be a slog for Cardiff City. Burnley at home felt like a welcome fixture on the face of it, especially on the back of conceding 12 goals against Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City, but there is no respite for Neil Warnock’s team, who fell to a fourth successive defeat that leaves them joint bottom of the Premier League.\n\nJohann Berg Gudmundsson did the damage, scoring Burnley’s first and setting up the winner for Sam Vokes on a day when Cardiff were entitled to feel the very least they deserved was a point. That they failed to pick up anything says much about their shortcomings at both ends of the pitch. Toothless up front and nowhere near good enough defensively, Cardiff were picked off by a Burnley side who scored from their only two attempts on target.\n\nCardiff City 1-2 Burnley: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe bigger picture is worrying for Cardiff. They have now failed to win in eight games in all competitions this season – the first time that has happened since the 1964-65 campaign – and it is hard to see things improving for Warnock and his players any time soon. They travel to Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday and the away trip after that is Liverpool.\n\n“It’s a cruel game sometimes,” Warnock said. “But I can’t fault the effort. I’m disappointed to concede from the only two opportunities that they got. At the level we’re talking about you shouldn’t concede goals like that. I thought it epitomised the whole game that Joe Hart got man of the match. It’s a tough defeat to take.”\n\nHart was certainly impressive in goal and made a particularly important save in the context of the game when he tipped Josh Murphy’s curling shot over the bar.\n\nTwo minutes later Burnley went up the other end and scored when Vokes, who was making his 100th Premier League appearance, stooped to head in Gudmundsson’s cross.\n\nIt was a goal that came against the run of play – all the momentum was with Cardiff after Murphy registered his first goal for the club on the hour with a superb side-foot finish from Bruno Ecuele Manga’s cut-back – and exposed the defensive weaknesses that left Warnock so frustrated. Sean Morrison, the Cardiff centre-half, allowed Gudmundsson to run in behind him and Vokes made the most of the generous space he was afforded in the penalty area.\n\nBurnley’s opening goal was a similar story. Cardiff were caught sleeping when Charlie Taylor took a throw-in quickly, Ashley Westwood stood up a cross at the far post and Gudmundsson, climbing above Greg Cunningham, squeezed his header inside Neil Etheridge’s near post via a touch off the goalkeeper’s left boot.\n\n“We’ve been beaten by two lapses of concentration,” said Warnock, who also felt Cardiff should have been awarded “a clear penalty” for handball when Callum Paterson’s shot was blocked.\n\nBurnley had plenty of problems of their own until recently but back-to-back victories have lifted them to 12th place. In truth they looked way off the pace here for long periods and would have gone behind in the first half but for a fine one-handed stop from Hart, who kept out Kenneth Zohore’s stabbed left-footed shot.\n\nSean Dyche, however, took encouragement from “a resolute performance” and the way Burnley defended so doggedly, especially after losing James Tarkowski to a groin injury in the first half. “It’s very difficult coming here,” Burnley’s manager said. “They play on the front foot and put balls towards the box from virtually everywhere.”"}, {"date": "29/09/2018", "arena": "London Stadium",

And yet for Manchester United, the death or otherwise of their title challenge on a torturous afternoon at West Ham, felt like a footnote.\n\nTheir problems were written large on the open spaces of the London Stadium and on the back of last Saturday’s home draw with Wolves and the Carabao Cup exit at the hands of Derby at Old Trafford, not to mention the civil unrest between José Mourinho and Paul Pogba, this was yet another low.\n\nWest Ham have stabilised after their four-game losing streak at the start of the season and it is worth remembering the anxiety that gripped after that final defeat – at home to Wolves – and in advance of fixtures against Everton, Chelsea and United. Yet Everton were beaten at Goodison Park and there was encouragement to be taken from the home draw against Chelsea.\n\nThis was another polished performance, but they did not need to be outstanding to ease past United.\n\nMourinho dropped the out-of-sorts Alexis Sánchez, although he made him travel, and he demanded a reaction from his stuttering team. What he got only intensified the sense that something is broken at Old Trafford and he does not have the tact or tactics to find the solution.\n\nUnited’s biggest problem remains their inability to break down well-organised defences; to pull them out of shape with front-foot football and that was once again in evidence.\n\nThere was no coherent offensive strategy, they did not move the ball quickly enough and they sleepwalked to a defeat that looked on the cards from the moment Felipe Anderson scored his first West Ham goal in the fifth minute.\n\nManuel Pellegrini, the West Ham manager, said he did not “remember feeling any danger situations in our box” and while there were a few it was plain from United’s point of view that there were not enough.\n\nPobga was anonymous and Mourinho’s decision to substitute him on 70 minutes will invite further scrutiny of their relationship. But the marquee midfielder was not alone in showing a basic lack of hunger and drive.\n\nThe players in the pale pink could be questioned over their attitude, almost to a man and it was easy to wonder whether they were still giving their all for their manager.\n\nWith confidence low, United needed a good start. They did not get it. Mourinho argued that Pablo Zabaleta was offside when he took Mark Noble’s pass and crossed for Anderson, who flicked home brilliantly with his trailing leg. It was difficult to tell, even after watching the replays.\n\nMourinho had included Scott McTominay on the right of a back-three and there cannot have been too many United line-ups over the years that boasted more height and physicality. The trade-off came in the lack of speed and movement. Where were the options for the player in possession when United ventured into West Ham territory? It was all so one-paced and the frustration could be seen in some of Pogba’s reactions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest United players look dejected at the final whistle. Photograph: TGSPhoto/REX/Shutterstock\n\nWest Ham sat back on their lead and United dug out a foothold, flexing their muscle, pushing them back a little. But they laboured to get in behind and the sum total of their first-half efforts was a Romelu Lukaku header that came back off the outside of a post from Ashley Young’s cross.\n\nWest Ham deserved credit for their grit and organisation, even if this was no rearguard action, and they went further in front when Andriy Yarmolenko stood up Nemanja Matic and jinked to the left before shooting. The ball deflected off Victor Lindelöf to loop in for an own goal.\n\nMourinho made an attacking substitution when he withdrew Lindelöf, introduced Marcus Rashford and switched to 4-1-4-1. Rashford’s goal was a beauty – a back-heeled flick from Luke Shaw’s corner.\n\nSeven minutes earlier, Marouane Fellaini had extended Lukasz Fabianski with a header. Was there a way off the canvas for United?\n\nThe answer was no. With Mourinho screaming for a foul by Zabaleta on Rashford, the excellent Noble set Marko Arnautovic free for the third.\n\nThis has been United’s worst start to a Premier League season. The greater worry is what history shows when things begin to unravel for Mourinho.\n\nWest Ham United 3-1 Manchester United: Premier League – live reaction!

The reserve he has tended to show went out of the window. This one, compared to the winning sequence that preceded it, seemed to count that little bit more, to mean something that bit deeper.\n\nOnce Mesut Özil tapped in Arsenal’s second goal and the result swung in their favour, Emery could allow himself to wonder whether the new ideas are slowly beginning to fall into place.\n\nSeven successive wins is a helpful statistic, but Emery was as impressed to see how Arsenal mastered their most difficult test since the first week of the season – when they lost to Manchester City and Chelsea. This was a true test of their mettle, with Watford starting the day ahead of them in the table thanks to their well‑organised ambition, and threatening to take all the points until Arsenal scored twice in three high-energy minutes in the late summer sun.\n\nHarry Kane scores double as Tottenham send Huddersfield bottom of table Read more\n\nIt was a blow for Watford, who competed diligently and Javi Gracia could not disguise his disappointment to see his team again perform well and be unrewarded. “What can I say? I am very upset for my players because they deserved more, a better result. We had a very good performance with more shots, clear chances to score, and if you don’t score you can lose.”\n\nArsenal maintained their habit of winning games in the second half, and Emery complimented the players who came on at both ends of the pitch to make an impact. Bernd Leno made his debut, coming on in first-half stoppage time after Petr Cech injured a hamstring taking a goal-kick. The injury is expected to rule him out for up to three weeks. Cech’s replacement made a couple of eye-catching saves.\n\nAlex Iwobi brought some thrust to Arsenal’s attack and helped to make the difference by taking responsibility in creating both goals.\n\nAlthough they were on a winning streak, the feeling persists that Arsenal’s attacking groove still needed some polishing, with most of their recent results dependent on flashes of forward play rather than a clearly defined strategy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernd Leno of Arsenal makes a save from Watford’s Troy Deeney.

For much of the game only Lacazette was able to influence play, leading the line with aggression and getting into scoring positions numerous times.\n\nThree chances came his way in the first half. He was unlucky with a penalty incident in the fifth minute as he drove into the box and was tripped by Christian Kabasele, and then failed to make the best contact with Ben Foster to beat.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson makes amends to fire Everton towards victory over Fulham Read more\n\nIn the second half, Watford grew in confidence, finding a smart balance between shielding their own goal and trying to crack it at the other end. Leno made a quick impression with a superb stretch to deny Troy Deeney from close range and Gracia rued the fact Roberto Pereyra and Isaac Success were not quite clinical enough.\n\nWith 10 minutes to go, Arsenal managed to pause the Watford pressure and do damage of their own on the break as Iwobi’s centre was tucked past Foster via Cathcart, who was trying in vain to deal with the threat of Lacazette. The points were sealed as Iwobi and Lacazette combined well to tee-up Özil.\n\n“We need more moments to control the game over 90 minutes,” said Emery. “But the reason I am happy is we are getting more

"report": "A £45m price tag has weighed heavily on Gylfi Sigurdsson and missing a penalty with the game goalless and the home crowd on edge could have been cue for fresh introspection. His reaction was worthy of a club-record signing, two fine finishes helping his side to their most emphatic victory of the season.\n\nMarco Silva needed that contribution with his forwards continuing to falter, although ultimately it was Slavisa Jokanovic who had cause to lament poor finishing. Fulham were the more threatening team before half-time. Everton, easily opened and lacking creativity, were suffering for the third home game in succession. The roles reversed after the interval.\n\nCenk Tosun’s introduction for Dominic Calvert-Lewin improved the home team’s potency and he scored his first of the season as Everton finally kept a clean sheet. But it was Sigurdsson who was instrumental in the overall improvement and but for floating his spot-kick against the Fulham crossbar he would have had a hat-trick.\n\n“He showed fantastic character and personality is important,” said Silva. “He missed the penalty but within one or two minutes he was working hard. Football was fair with him after he missed the penalty. He works hard every day to produce good football.”\n\nThere was little evidence of that from Everton initially and Fulham, who lost Timothy Fosu-Mensah to a serious shoulder injury after only eight minutes, should have established a comfortable first-half advantage. Andre Schürrle wastefully side-footed over from Ryan Sessegnon’s inviting pull-back and the 18-year-old smacked the bar from close range having been released behind a chaotic home defence by Jean Michaël Seri.\n\n“We paid an expensive price,” admitted the Fulham manager. “We showed some quality, we were brave with the ball and we created chances but it is going to be so hard for us if we are going to give away two goals.”\n\nSilva is no ranter or raver but his half-time instructions worked to perfection. “I told them we had to be more aggressive and be more calm in our attacking play,” he said.\n\nSigurdsson’s penalty miss came after Calvert-Lewin was pushed over in the area by Denis Odoi. Soon afterwards, with Tosun having replaced Calvert-Lewin, the Iceland international made amends in fine style. Having released Jonjoe Kenny, down the right Sigurdsson regained possession when the cross was deflected into his path. The No 10 curled a precise left-foot finish into the far corner and Everton were on their way to a much-needed victory.\n\nIt could have been different when the hosts were caught on the counterattack from their own corner but Luciano Vietto’s poor touch from Schürrle’s ball enabled Jordan Pickford to save at his feet. The Everton keeper, who signed a new six-year contract this week, pumped a fist in celebration and Goodison roared in recognition of a key moment.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nTosun doubled the home side’s lead when Kenny released Theo Walcott and the former Arsenal winger floated a perfect cross to the back post for the unmarked striker to head home.\n\nAnother incisive Everton move, this time when substitute Bernard was released down the left by Idrissa Gueye, brought a third goal and a second for Sigurdsson in the final minute.

Smith’s Stadium one of the most pleasant places to spend an autumnal Saturday afternoon, and the appetite for Premier League football among proud and impassioned supporters remains undimmed. Yet with Huddersfield still bottom of the table and now going into October without a win, the script is badly in need of a change.\n\nTottenham were 4-0 winners in this fixture last season and the home side were lucky the scoreline had not reached similar proportions by half-time. The pattern of the game was established early on, with Huddersfield working the ball diligently around midfield without finding any real focus to their attacks, and Spurs doing exactly the opposite, keeping their defensive shape and relying on the pace of their tricky front three to make inroads when given the chance.\n\nArsenal’s Mesut Özil completes slick move to sink Watford Read more\n\nHuddersfield being Huddersfield, they were given the chance quite often. Danny Rose headed wide with Spurs’ first opportunity to score after seven minutes. It was the first time the visitors had ventured over the halfway line with any conviction, and Harry Kane should really have done better with a marvellous pass from Lucas Moura that picked him out unerringly right in front of goal. Five minutes later the home defence was breached again when Christopher Schindler missed a defensive header. Kane was behind him in a flash to bear down on goal, and it took a good stop from Jonas Lössl to rescue the situation.\n\nThe deadlock was clearly not destined to last very long. Even when facing a third-choice goalkeeper in Paulo Gazzaniga the home side did not manage to put him under any sort of pressure, whereas when Lucas broke free down the right it was immediately obvious Huddersfield did not have enough defenders in position to deal with the danger. The marauding Lucas was eventually halted but was still able to lay the ball back to Kieran Trippier, whose precision cross allowed Kane to score with the sort of header he probably puts away in his sleep.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson makes amends to fire Everton towards victory over Fulham Read more\n\nTerence Kongolo injured a knee in the attempt to stop Lucas, and was replaced by Florent Hadergjonaj on the half hour, a change that proved significant a few minutes later when the defender caught Rose to give away a penalty. Hadergjonaj would still have been adjusting to the pace of the game, and the actual contact with Rose may have been slight, but Craig Pawson had a good view when Rose was put through on goal by the slickest of passes from Son Heung-min. Kane scored his fifth league goal of the season with a confidently struck spot-kick.\n\nHuddersfield stepped up their efforts to get on the scoresheet with Gazzaniga making a scrambling save from Chris Löwe’s long shot, though luck deserted them on the stroke of the interval when Laurent Depoitre’s volley from Löwe’s cross came back off the bar. It was a good effort, worthy of a goal, and a couple of inches might have made a difference – an accumulation of tiny margins could be what costs Huddersfield at the end of the season.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nDavid Wagner did what he could in an attempt at a salvage operation, sending on Isaac Mbenza for Schindler, and while the substitute did manage to bring a fine save from Gazzaniga before the end Huddersfield could do with a few more attacking alternatives. All they really have to hurt opponents are Depoitre, Aaron Mooy’s set-piece delivery and Philip Billing’s long throws. The story of this game was that even with Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembélé failing to appear for the second half, Spurs were comfortable without them.\n\n“It was tough, the ball was in the air more than on the grass, but we showed we were ready to fight for a win,” Mauricio Pochettino said, the Tottenham manager also confirming that the hamstring injury that sidelined Dele Alli here will also keep him out of Wednesday’s Champions League meeting with Barcelona and in all probability the internationals that follow.\n\n“We are performing to a good level against very strong teams without getting much luck,” Wagner said. “We have to keep our focus on our work now and believe the reward will come.”"}, {"date": "29/09/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54152, "home_team":

at Chelsea, was decorated by a superb Sergio Agüero goal. Midway through the second half, the striker traded passes with David Silva near the centre circle and slalomed towards goal with some soft-shoe shuffle skill that had him nutmegging Lewis Dunk before he found Raheem Sterling to the left. The England forward twisted and sent the ball back to the Argentinian who was never going to miss from eight yards out, scoring his fifth league goal of the campaign.\n\nCity’s fans, already buoyed by West Ham’s lunchtime victory over José Mourinho’s Manchester United , taunted their rivals delightedly with chants of: “Don’t sack Mourinho.”\n\nPep Guardiola, though, revealed Agüero is carrying a heel problem. “Sergio is struggling a bit with some problems in his feet,” the City manager said. “He is not 100%. He has not recovered from what happened against Newcastle [on 1 September] and we spoke about to play 55-60 minutes. We were lucky he scored at the right moment.”\n\nOn Tuesday, City are at Hoffenheim in the Champions League and then travel to Liverpool next Sunday for the final league match before the international break. “Hopefully he can do the two and then recover,” Guardiola said.\n\nLiverpool defeated City three times last season. “If they beat us three times, they are a good side,” he said. “After Hoffenheim we are going to prepare.”\n\nAs expected, Guardiola made wholesale changes with only David Silva, Nicolás Otamendi and Oleksandr Zinchenko surviving from the 3-0 defeat of Oxford United in the Carabao Cup.\n\nBrighton were eliminated from that competition in August. So their most recent outing was last Saturday against Tottenham. Chris Hughton made two changes from that line-up as Jürgen Locadia and Beram Kayal were drafted in.\n\nCity often start at full tilt here and thereby force an early goal. If the former was true, Guardiola’s men hogging ball and territory, the visitors could be content at reaching the quarter-hour mark still level.\n\nThe problem is the sublime quality that runs through them. City drove forward at speed and so it was when opening the scoring via a fluid sequence. Agüero dropped back to take the ball and passed to Leroy Sané. The German raced through on the left and hit a skidding pass across the six-yard box to leave Gaëtan Bong flailing. There was Sterling to turn the ball into an empty net for his fourth goal of the season.\n\nThe same player came close to doubling the advantage as the break neared. This time he displayed snake hips to create time and space as Bong neared and Mathew Ryan had to produce a sharp save to his left. The Brighton keeper was just as agile when throwing himself to his right from Fernandinho’s 25-yard strike, seconds before the break.\n\nBrighton were lucky to trail by one goal as the second half started. Guardiola’s advice to his men may have been to keep on keeping on and they were first to show, Kyle Walker blazing wide after a buildup involving Otamendi, Aymeric Laporte and Fernandinho.\n\nThe contest was more or less being played in Brighton’s final third. Any time the visitors managed a foray out of their half City cleaned up with ease, as when Anthony Knockaert chased the ball along the left only to see Laporte come across.\n\nSané bounded on to a laser of a Bernardo Silva diagonal from the right, but his header went into the ground and over.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nAs City turned up the tempo Agüero’s shot was blocked, then David Silva smashed the ball at goal and Ryan did well to repel it.\n\nEver the perfectionist, Guardiola stalked around from his seat to the technical area looking to aid his side. At one point, he offered Zinchenko enthusiastic encouragement and when Agüero scored, the Catalan punched the air and gave the Argentina striker a prolonged embrace.\n\nCity did not add to their tally but managed the match expertly to seal another convincing victory.\n\nJosé Mourinho criticises players’ mentality during West Ham defeat Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raheem Sterling opens the scoring for Manchester City.

energised by the bright early autumn sunshine and azure blue Tyneside sky, their hosts seemed to have gone into hibernation, retreating into their shell as they remained both winless and trapped in the relegation zone.\n\nBenítez’s team have collected only two points this season and this worrying start perhaps explained the presence of a rare visitor in the posh seats.\n\nNewcastle’s owner watched his first game at St James’ Park since May 2017 and received a permafrosted welcome. After introductory choruses of: “We want you out of our club,” home fans segued into: “Stand up if you hate Mike Ashley.”\n\nMany supporters duly rose to their feet, with those in the main, Milburn, stand turning their backs to the pitch in order to face their bete noire. Seated alongside his PR adviser, Keith Bishop, an outwardly unconcerned Ashley was pictured laughing and joking. A rather less amused home manager has long been unhappy with the owner’s parsimony and clearly believes recent results reflect inadequate summer recruitment.\n\n“I’m disappointed,” said Benítez, whose side visit Manchester United next Saturday. “We’re lacking confidence. We knew it would be very difficult but we have to carry on.”\n\nRealistically, the only hope of the Spaniard staying beyond next summer could be Peter Kenyon’s proposed buyout succeeding. Although the lack of discretion surrounding such plans triggers all sorts of alarm bells, the fact Newcastle declined to comment on the matter indicate Ashley has not dismissed it. “I have no idea about anything,” said Benítez, who seemed unclear as to whether the sports retail tycoon would drop in on a January transfer summit scheduled for .\n\nHis team appeared awkward and edgy in the face of the hostile soundtrack, a state exacerbated as Leicester took the lead after DeAndre Yedlin blocked Harry Maguire’s shot with an arm following James Maddison’s corner. Despite Martin Dubravka diving the right way, Newcastle’s goalkeeper could not prevent Jamie Vardy’s low penalty squirming beneath his body. Gareth Southgate, apparently in Toon to assess Maddison’s England potential, looked on approvingly.\n\nWith Kenedy struggling as an ersatz left-back in the injured Paul Dummett’s stead, Claude Puel’s side were in control but rode their luck slightly as an unmarked Mohamed Diamé headed wide and Jonjo Shelvey almost eluded Kasper Schmeichel courtesy of an audacious 60-yard lob.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBenítez replaced Matt Ritchie with Jacob Murphy, prompting an apparently deeply unimpressed Ritchie to voice his displeasure as he walked off.

minute after coming on as a substitute.\n\nThe Portuguese midfielder’s celebration befitted a man making his first appearance of the campaign following a back injury and the festivities intensified when Jonny Castro Otto added a second goal to propel the promoted club up to eighth in the table.\n\nWolves have a strong chance of staying there if they convert chances more consistently. For a long time here, they, like Southampton, were guilty of being irritatingly polite: well mannered in their play, easy on the eye but toothless. Nuno Espírito Santo’s side, in particular, have had onlookers cooing about their cultured build-ups this season but cursing their inability to turn chances into goals with often enough. The manager insisted it was just a matter of time before his team upped their strike rate and he was vindicated here. Eventually.\n\nHarry Kane scores double as Tottenham send Huddersfield bottom of table Read more\n\nAfter naming the same starting lineup for a seventh successive league match – a record in the Premier League era – Nuno saw his side begin well. Castro Otto brought a spectacular save from Alex McCarthy with a shot from 14 yards after a fine Wolves move but, in truth, he should have scored. At least his effort was better than the header that Matt Doherty sent wide from a free-kick a few minutes earlier.\n\nWolves controlled the early exchanges thanks partly to the class of Rubén Neves and João Moutinho in midfield. But when the visitors grew more bold, Mario Lemina and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg got the upper hand there. Southampton started to threaten around the half-hour, Nathan Redmond playing a dainty pass to Mohamed Elyounoussi but Rui Patrício hurried off his line to block the forward’s weak shot.\n\nArsenal’s Mesut Özil completes slick move to sink Watford Read more\n\nMcCarthy made a decent save in the 39th minute to foil Raúl Jiménez after good work by Doherety and Neves.\n\nWith both sides sensing victory was within their grasp, there was more bite to the second half. But still neither looked truly dangerous where it mattered. Southampton had more possession, Wolves were restricted to counterattacks.\n\nAlmost as soon as Nuno replaced Diogo Jota with Cavaleiro, Wolves made the breakthrough. Adama Traoré created the opportunity with a low cross from the right, which Jiménez laid back to Cavaleiro to shoot into the roof of the net from 10 yards.\n\nWolves sealed victory when Matt Doherty drove through flimsy challenges and pulled the ball to Castro Otto to net from close range.\n\n“We are happy but know it’s only the start of the season,” said Nuno. “We have to improve. Tough moments will arrive and we have to be ready.”\n\nMark Hughes, meanwhile, is going through a tough moment, with one win from seven league matches. “Frustration is the emotion we feel,” he said. “It was a decent away performance but at the end of the day you have to get your reward, you have to go take it.

Liverpool had given everything to conjure up an equaliser and Sturridge struck just as it had started to seem futile. His goal was a beauty and the body language of Jürgen Klopp’s players at the final whistle made it clear they could live with giving up their immaculate run in the Premier League.\n\nNobody could argue, either, that it was undeserved, bearing in mind the number of chances Liverpool passed up before Sturridge deceived Kepa Arrizabalaga, the Chelsea goalkeeper, with the swerve and trajectory of his high, angled shot.\n\nMohamed Salah, one of the repeat offenders, had already left the game by that point, substituted on an evening when he missed more chances than he will probably wish to remember. His replacement, Xherdan Shaqiri, proceeded to squander his side’s most inviting chance and, at that stage, it seemed as though the only consolation for Liverpool could be that it was another six months before they were due to face Eden Hazard again.\n\nTwice, they have faced Chelsea in four days and on both occasions Hazard has advanced the point that, while Liverpool have their own elite performers, none is currently playing with his level of expertise. Again, Hazard scored a classy goal to emphasise the point.\n\nChelsea 1-1 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHe was always alive, the game’s outstanding performer, and on this evidence Chelsea’s supporters should probably just cherish him while they can. In one television interview, Hazard acknowledged what everyone probably knew anyway: that, yes, he had wanted to leave after the World Cup and it was still his ambition to play in Spain.\n\nChelsea clearly have their work cut out to keep hold of him beyond this season but, if this is his final year at Stamford Bridge, he seems determined to leave a wonderful portfolio of memories.\n\nUltimately, though, Hazard was playing for a team that struggled to match Liverpool’s authoritative passing. The visitors certainly moved the ball in the manner of a team with serious aspirations to finish the season with Manchester City, not just Manchester United, in their rearview mirror. They never seemed too disheartened as their missed chances racked up and there was something profoundly impressive about the way they took the game to their opponents.\n\nA lot of visitors to Stamford Bridge, facing a side that had won all their previous home games, might have set off with a measure of restraint. Not Klopp’s men. They attacked in numbers and the only possible criticism, much like their previous away game at Tottenham, was that they did not accept a greater percentage of their chances.\n\nFor that, Salah was not the only culpable player, but it was unusual to see him being so profligate, and tempting to think that increasingly familiar facial expression – a look of smiling disbelief, eyes raised to the skies – displayed the telltale signs of fraying confidence.\n\nTo say Salah is falling short of last season’s heights would be to omit the fact he is still stretching opposition defences, always showing for the ball and, for long periods, a difficult, elusive opponent. It is true, nonetheless, that some of that precious magic has temporarily deserted him. Not all the subtle flicks and touches are coming off. A few passes are going astray that he would normally expect to have completed as a matter of routine.\n\nTwice, at 0-0, Salah let Chelsea off the hook and when he did go round Arrizabalaga, shortly after the half‑hour mark, Antonio Rüdiger had sprinted across to clear from the goal-line.\n\nHazard, on the other hand, oozed confidence. The Belgian was a constant threat, continuing where he left off in the Carabao Cup match at Anfield on Wednesday, and the excellence of his goal should not be underappreciated.\n\nJürgen Klopp backs out-of-sorts Mohamed Salah to overcome tough spell Read more\n\nThe low, diagonal shot to pick out the corner of Alisson’s net, connecting with the ball on the run and firing in left to right, was impressive enough, but Hazard had actually set everything in motion 40 yards back with an elegant flick in the centre circle. He was on the move immediately and, in this slick exchange of passes, Mateo Kovacic’s through ball provided the shooting opportunity. Hazard’s speed and movement took him away from Joe Gomez, who is hardly a slouch, and Liverpool had conceded a first-half goal for the first time in the league this season.\n\nAlthough the away team had the better of the game, Chelsea could always be encouraged by the problems Hazard was creating and the gaps that occasionally appeared in Liverpool’s defence.\n\nIt was the home side who were playing on the counterattack but they did so effectively and can reflect on two fine chances of their own when Willian and then Hazard sprung the Liverpool defence. For the first one, the 50-yard pass from David Luiz to send Willian clear was one of the game’s outstanding moments.\n\nHazard’s chance originated from N’Golo Kanté’s quickly taken free-kick. On both occasions, however, Alisson was quickly off Liverpool’s goal-line to block the resultant shots.\n\nFor the most part, it was Liverpool on the front foot and Klopp was not exaggerating when he said that his team could have won, never mind drawn.\n\nShaqiri could not get a clean connection when Andy Robertson’s cross left him with the chance to equalise. Sturridge, however, caught his shot beautifully. Klopp had brought him on after 86 minutes. It was Sturridge’s first effort at goal and a wonderful moment for a player whose previous appearance at this ground, in April, could hardly have been a greater contrast: on loan at West Brom, and lasting only four minutes before he was taken off injured."}, {"date": "23/09/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56875, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Issa Diop", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabián Balbuena", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andriy Yarmolenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Felipe Anderson", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fredericks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Kepa Arrizabalaga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jorginho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mateo Kovacic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chelsea, for the first time under Maurizio Sarri, have blinked. Their pristine record was checked across the capital, the visitors running aground on West Ham United’s industry on a day when Eden Hazard’s flicks and darts into space did not quite come off, the monopoly of possession did not translate into drive through midfield, and the crosses lofted into the middle tended to find N’Golo Kanté, at 5ft 6in, rather than the towering Olivier Giroud.\n\nIt all felt rather forced and awkward, an occasion to leave the Italian grumbling in frustration. Maybe that delayed flight back from Thessaloniki, pushed back 12 hours to land on Friday afternoon, had left them jaded after Europa League exertions. Certainly they lacked the guile to disrupt a resolute West Ham side who were effectively and efficiently organised by Declan Rice, the teenager who had spent seven years at Chelsea’s youth academy and sat in front of a rugged back four with tenacious teammates contributing eagerly at his side.\n\nManuel Pellegrini’s hosts will have taken huge heart from making life so uncomfortable for a team who had started the weekend atop the table. Yet they might have claimed more than a mere point given that they had prised out the better chances, as rare as they were, amid their huff and puff. None was more appealing than the one that came 13 minutes from time as the substitute Robert Snodgrass swung over a cross from the left that found Andriy Yarmolenko, free beyond a distracted Marcos Alonso at the back post. The winger, summoning his best Mamadou Sakho impression, somehow headed wide to the disbelief of the majority in the stadium. That the Ukrainian was later awarded the sponsors’ man of the match award felt rather curious.\n\nIn that context, and considering the chances passed up by Michail Antonio in the first half, Chelsea’s point might actually be considered a bonus. Yet the frantic nature of their late push for a winner betrayed the reality that this was a wasted opportunity. Perhaps it all served to justify Sarri’s consistently downbeat assessment of his team’s title chances this term, reiterated in the aftermath of Sunday’s stalemate. It only takes Chelsea, and Hazard, to be slightly off colour to leave them looking flawed as challengers to Liverpool and Manchester City. They are a good team with some exceptional individuals but still a work in progress, a team in need of time to develop.\n\nHazard’s display summed it up. Where he has been offered space in recent weeks to exploit behind a front man, he has thrived. Here he was crowded out on the left flank and, invariably, by Rice when he drifted centrally. Pellegrini admitted his gameplan had been to funnel Chelsea down their right rather than left, where Hazard and Alonso have been their most potent attackers this term. It proved successful until the Belgian swapped wings for the fraught latter stages and finally found some joy – though by then desperation was prompting overelaboration. When offered his clearest sight of goal, he chose to backheel in the hope of finding a teammate.\n\nIf he is shackled, or simply not at his spritely best – he had missed the midweek game because of fatigue, after all – then the group appear diminished. They control the ball comfortably enough, as illustrated by Jorginho’s club-record pass completion tally in midfield, but the threat came only in fits and starts with Giroud swamped and peripheral. Álvaro Morata, striking Lukasz Fabianski in the face with a close-range flick, and Ross Barkley injected urgency late on. Sarri bemoaned an inability to move the ball quicker.\n\nThe satisfaction should have been West Ham’s, and they would have celebrated their point more wholeheartedly had they not passed up clearcut chances themselves. How they cursed the absence of the injured Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernández. Yarmolenko’s miss was the most mind-boggling, but Antonio, standing in at centre-forward, might have scored twice around the half-hour mark. First Felipe Anderson spun away from César Azpilicueta and slipped a pass beyond a backtracking Antonio Rüdiger – who would later retire hamstrung – which sent Antonio through only for the striker to clip the angle of post and bar with his shot.\n\nMoments later Rice exploited Alonso’s desire to push upfield by clipping a pass into the space vacated by the Spaniard, on to which Yarmolenko tore. The Ukrainian drove at David Luiz with the ball eventually running through to Antonio, in the six-yard box, but Kepa blocked his shot from point-blank range.\n\n“When you have such clear chances against a big team, you must score at least one of them,” said Pellegrini. “You must score.”\n\nWest Ham did not, but a first clean sheet of term was still something to be cherished.

Yet this was an afternoon when the margins were fine and the result could just as easily have gone the other way if Everton had turned up with their shooting boots on.\n\nPetr Cech was the star turn and Emery’s decision to persist with the goalkeeper ahead of the summer signing, Bernd Leno, was more than vindicated. Cech made five stops in the first half that ranked from decent to excellent and, more than anyone, it was the 36-year-old who created the platform for victory. He went on to save brilliantly from Michael Keane at 2-0 and again from the substitute, Cenk Tosun, to ensure a first clean sheet of the Emery era. Everton felt chiefly frustration and not only because Aubameyang’s goal that killed the game ought to have been disallowed for offside. It was not even a borderline call. The Arsenal forward was a full yard in front of Jonjoe Kenny, the last defender.\n\nThe visitors had been the better team before the break and, on another day and against another goalkeeper, they might have been comfortably in front. The positive aspect for the manager, Marco Silva, was the fluency his players showed and how, initially, they knocked Arsenal from their stride. There was little wrong with his gameplan. The bad news was that it was not the first time Silva’s players had been guilty of profligacy; it was a similar story in the home defeat by West Ham last weekend. Everton have taken six points from their opening six fixtures and this was their 21st defeat in 25 visits to Arsenal. They have drawn the other four.\n\nIt was noticeable to see the Emirates Stadium was pockmarked by empty seats, particularly in the middle and upper tiers, and the atmosphere could best be described as subdued for long spells. Nobody quite knows what to make of this Arsenal team yet; they are waiting to judge them.\n\nThere was the sense of square pegs in round holes, with Aubameyang shoehorned in on the left and Mesut Özil stationed on the right – and struggling to suppress the urge to drift inside. The natural width must come from the full-backs Héctor Bellerín and Nacho Monreal.\n\nThere were times when Arsenal lacked imagination but it would turn out well enough after Lacazette had turned the contest on its head. The irony was that – wonderful finish aside – the centre-forward was peripheral and Emery admitted afterwards he was about to substitute him when he scored. Alex Iwobi was stripped and ready. Everton were more coherent in the first half, more threatening – particularly through Richarlison – while their pressing panicked an Arsenal defence in which Shkodran Mustafi endured a couple of wobbles and Sokratis Papastathopoulos was forced off with a knee injury.\n\nArsenal 2-0 Everton: Premier League – live reaction! Read more\n\nSilva’s team could curse Cech from the second minute, when he made his best save. The Everton captain, Tom Davies, set Dominic Calvert-Lewin clean through but, one-on-one with Cech, the striker could not trick past him. Richarlison – back in the team after suspension – was in the mood. He took a lovely touch, rolled away from Bellerín and extended Cech while he would be denied again by the goalkeeper on 44 minutes. Everton could point to the Lucas Digne free-kick that Cech tipped over and the Gylfi Sigurdsson pass that released Theo Walcott in on goal. Cech was off his line to block.\n\nArsenal’s only clear first-half chance came in the 12th minute when Aubameyang touched back Bellerín’s lovely cross for Monreal. His connection was not the cleanest but it still required a good stop from Jordan Pickford. Arsenal worked Lacazette into an inviting position on 41 minutes only for him to take a heavy touch while Aubameyang’s overhit cross kissed the top of the crossbar.\n\nEmery gave Lucas Torreira a first Premier League start and the defensive midfielder had some nice moments, although he got himself booked early on when he jumped into a tackle on Sigurdsson.\n\nSilva felt his team started the second half brightly but they would be floored by a one-two punch. There was amazement when Aubameyang’s goal was allowed to stand – he converted from Aaron Ramsey’s flick, which the midfielder executed with his trailing leg after a little stumble. Arsenal had snapped forward through Özil after a mistake by Kurt Zouma.\n\nLacazette’s opener was marked by the highest class. Arsenal were chuntering over a non-penalty award, after Aubameyang had headed against Kenny’s hand at close quarters, but the moans were overtaken by smiles when Lacazette collected Ramsey’s pass, took a touch to set himself and picked out the far, top corner with his right foot."}, {"date": "22/09/2018", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 23418, "home_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup":

identical Premier League team selection, Watford ended their lunchtime engagement looking weary and not a little battered.\n\nThey might even have conceded a last-minute winner when the Fulham goalscorer Aleksandar Mitrovic forced a save from Ben Foster and nodded the resultant corner against the crossbar.\n\nIn the relief of escaping a second successive defeat, Gracia’s team were also left to rue a first half after which they might have been out of sight. Fulham should also have been down to 10 men; Timothy Fosu-Mensah’s rash and high challenge on Troy Deeney did not receive the red card it deserved from Martin Atkinson.\n\nWatford’s captain now appears likely to be Gracia’s first enforced change of the season, having left Craven Cottage with his right leg in a protective boot and revealed he will require an X-ray after Fosu-Mensah’s 32nd-minute tackle.\n\n“I may have a broken bone or two but we crack on,” Deeney said. He had still completed the 90 minutes. “I am a tough, ugly boy so it will be all right.”\n\nGracia was sporting, saying that he preferred to “respect the referee’s decision” rather than rail against officialdom, while for his part, Fosu-Mensah later made a social media apology to Deeney and to fans for his first-half performance.\n\nFulham 1-1 Watford: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFosu-Mensah was hardly alone in being guilty. Watford scored within 90 seconds of the kick-off when Andre Gray slotted home after Will Hughes had been the beneficiary of lax play from Jean Michaël Seri. Slavisa Jokanovic’s reintroduction of Fosu-Mensah and Calum Chambers into his defence had paid whatever the opposite of instant dividends is.\n\nWith one win from their five previous matches, Jokanovic has struggled to blend a squad on which more than £100m has been lavished. His team conceded even earlier than last week, when it took Leroy Sané 97 seconds to score for Manchester City.\n\nWith £20m central defender Alfie Mawson enduring a crisis, Watford were presented with repeated chances to extend their lead. Mawson looked to have fouled Hughes, excellent in the first half, for a Watford penalty but Atkinson waved away claims.\n\nThe break gave Jokanovic opportunity to regroup and rethink. Two of his starting XI, Mawson and Kevin McDonald, were given the hook, as Denis Odoi and Floyd Ayité were introduced. “I made two changes,” said Jokanovic “I would have made four if I could.”\n\nIf Fulham are going to survive life back in the Premier League, their second half showed a route to security. Odoi and Ayité excelled and Seri was at last able to exert midfield influence, especially after the 64th-minute introduction of André-Frank Zambo Anguissa. Meanwhile, André Schürrle, Fulham’s main attacking threat in the first half, presented constant problems for Watford.\n\nLiverpool v Southampton, Man Utd v Wolves and more: clockwatch – live!

Instead, the Serb’s decisive changes and the attacking quality he can call on had Gracia’s team rocking on their heels.\n\n“We didn’t change anything,” said Gracia. “We kept on creating chances but we made a defensive mistake and they scored a goal.

Within another couple of minutes they had a second goal, a much‑needed first victory was on the way and suddenly high-flying Bournemouth were the ones looking quizzically at each other after being caught in possession or passing to opponents.\n\nWith two late Ashley Barnes goals wrapping up the points, Sean Dyche was able to admit to relief at the end. “There’s a nervousness you can feel when you are still waiting for your first win,” the Burnley manager said. “This is only a start, we still expect a lot more of ourselves, but we want to be winning games again.”\n\nConcerned after a start to the season that left them propping up the Premier League table, Dyche made a few proactive changes, principally dropping Barnes and Chris Wood and granting Matej Vydra a first start. “When you are in our position you can’t just wait for things to happen, you have to push and make them happen,” he said.\n\nMohamed Salah strikes as Liverpool cruise to victory over Southampton Read more\n\nPushing Vydra up the pecking order was a plan that worked. He did not exactly terrorise Bournemouth with his skill or his physical presence, as for the first half-hour of the game the visitors were the ones who looked most likely to open the scoring, but Vydra was in the right place when a couple of Ashley Westwood shots were blocked and he tucked away the loose ball with confident aplomb to register his first league goal for his new club.\n\nIf Burnley taking the lead was slightly against the run of play – Callum Wilson had earlier narrowly failed to get on the end of a Josh King cross after Bournemouth had opened up the home defence with the best move of the first half – they lost no time in pressing their advantage.\n\nBournemouth wrongly assumed Sam Vokes was the only danger when Jóhann Gudmundsson swung over a deep cross from the right in the striker’s direction, so that when the ball flew over the head of its intended target there was no one to prevent Aaron Lennon sneaking in behind to sweep the ball in at the far post.\n\nLennon has begun to exasperate Burnley supporters with his inability to end a promising run with a telling pass or shot, but here was an example of quick thinking and an instinctive finish.\n\nBournemouth might have considered themselves unlucky after some good moments while the game was still scoreless, Nathan Aké seeing a shot deflected on to the bar and David Brooks skipping easily past Ben Mee to set up a chance in the penalty area. Yet the visitors showed little real appetite for a second-half fightback.\n\nVokes nearly increased the lead with a shot that went close shortly after the restart and when Wood came on he headed wide from a good position. Brooks had a chance to reduce the deficit when Bournemouth finally broke through the Burnley rearguard, only to find Joe Hart equal to his shot.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic keeps up hot streak as Fulham and Watford share points Read more\n\nWith the aid of Jack Cork’s intelligent distribution and James Tarkowski’s resolute defending Burnley hung on for the points. Junior Stanislas missed the most inviting Bournemouth opportunity by ghosting in at the far post just as Lennon had done in the first half but he failed to make contact with the ball.\n\nWhen Lennon set up Gudmundsson five minutes from time for a volley that came back off the post, Barnes was on hand to make the scoreline more emphatic, before the same player struck again for a late fourth. This time Lennon popped up in the right to cut back for Barnes to score and Burnley could celebrate more goals in a single afternoon than they had managed in their previous five matches. With Cardiff and Huddersfield to come, they can suddenly see a way to climb the table.\n\nEddie Howe was left feeling philosophical. “I don’t think the final score reflected the game, but football is

extinguished any fears of a European hangover to blow away Cardiff in style with five magnificent goals, as they strolled to victory in south Wales. An imperious away performance left the hosts exasperated with Sergio Agüero opening the scoring on his 300th appearance for City before Riyad Mahrez’s double completed the rout, with his first goals for the club since a £60m summer switch coming after beautiful goals by Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gündogan.\n\nAs Neil Warnock said before kick-off, it was good news that his side have to play them only twice this season. On a dank afternoon this was a harrowing experience for Cardiff – an ordeal. By half-time, by which point City had established a three-goal lead, it was a case of damage limitation. Things could have been worse for Cardiff, too, with Joe Ralls fortunate to avoid a red card for a poor first-half challenge on Gündogan. Long before the final whistle, City stroked the ball around at will, safe in the knowledge they had sealed a 10th win in 12 Premier League matches and hoisted themselves up to second in the table.\n\nWolves frustrate Manchester United on Sir Alex Ferguson’s return Read more\n\n“We were more dynamic,” Pep Guardiola said. “After not a good result in midweek [against Lyon], we responded again to the same level that we had in the past 12 or 13 months.\n\n“We made a good performance, but after one or two goals, it was easy. At 0-3, you are relaxed and we were consistent. We didn’t suffer too much and created a good game.”\n\nWarnock always knew the difficulty of the task at hand. The cost of the two starting lineups would remind him as much; Cardiff’s a paltry £25.9m compared with Guardiola’s team, worth £405.2m and counting. For Cardiff, revved up by a thumping pre-match playlist consisting of Metallica and Darude, the chasm in class was absent until City’s slick opener; Gündogan fed Silva, whose slide-rule pass found Agüero, with the striker firing into the bottom-left corner first time. It was the result of a sweeping counterattack, which stemmed from Ederson rolling the ball out to Gündogan after gathering a Cardiff corner.\n\nAs Agüero, one of three changes from the Lyon defeat on Wednesday, celebrated, an animated Guardiola pulled his centre-backs, Nicolás Otamendi and Aymeric Laporte, over towards the touchline for a pep talk in search of perfection.\n\nThree minutes later, City had doubled their lead, with a short-corner routine between Gündogan and Leroy Sané teeing up the latter to flight an inviting cross in from the right. When it arrived into the box, Silva sent a looping backward header into the far corner. By this point, the champions were purring; Agüero had another effort deflected wide by Bruno Manga after Raheem Sterling danced his way to the byline, before Fernandinho drove wide.\n\nJames Maddison leads Leicester to victory over struggling Huddersfield Read more\n\nThe best was still to come though. Gündogan seized possession on the edge of the box and after a give-and-go with Sterling the midfielder emphatically arrowed the ball into the top-left corner. It was a special goal, one that had even home supporters gasping in awe and lifted the City bench off their feet.\n\nThe hosts were powerless as City turned on the style. Cardiff’s frustration spilled over just before the interval with Ralls lucky to return for the second half. Studs showing, the midfielder jabbed Gündogan with his left boot, but his knee-high challenge earned him only a booking.\n\nIn cruise control, Guardiola summoned Mahrez, and then Phil Foden, from the bench, after the former had added City’s fourth, with the effervescent Gündogan again influential. Sterling slid the midfielder in down the left channel, and he pinged a crisp ball across the box for Mahrez to slot home. The winger then curled another beyond Neil Etheridge after Manga gifted him the ball inside the box.\n\nIn the end, the scoreline could have been anything the visitors wanted it to be, with Sané’s header kissing the post and Sterling forcing Etheridge to palm over.\n\n“It’s a disappointment, but it’s not going to define our season,” Warnock said. “It’s just going to knock our chins a bit and the lads have got to get on with it again next week against Burnley.”"}, {"date": "22/09/2018", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25679, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup":

Although on this evidence it is easy to see why he stays away.\n\nOn the day that Kevin Keegan revealed he is no longer welcome at St James’ Park after falling out with Newcastle’s widely detested owner, it was just like the Sports Direct chief executive to attend his first game for almost 18 months on a damp and dreary day in south-east London that reflected the levels of entertainment on display.\n\nHe was treated to a backs‑to‑the‑wall performance that earned Rafa Benítez’s side their second point of the season but also laid bare the challenge facing their beleaguered manager. Only Mamadou Sakho’s glaring miss late on following a disappointingly flat display from a Crystal Palace side struggling to find their form spared Newcastle from a fifth defeat, with supporters making their displeasure with Ashley known throughout. The club may face sanctions after one fan threw a bottle which hit the Palace defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka.\n\nJames Maddison leads Leicester to victory over struggling Huddersfield Read more\n\n“If the owner wants to support the team – fine. That is positive,” said Benítez. “Our supporters are quite clever and they know if we are going to be stronger, then we need the fans behind us. That is the best chance for us to stay in the Premier League. Everybody knows what we have and that we will give it everything until the last minute.”\n\nReferring to the bottle thrower, Benítez said: “We had almost 3,000 fans here and one made a mistake. But the rest were fantastic.”\n\nAfter a week when he was a hot topic of conversation, Wilfried Zaha’s participation had been in doubt before kick-off after he left the warm-up clutching the back of his neck. His emergence from the tunnel was greeted with a collective sigh of relief around Selhurst Park given Palace’s awful record without their talisman – no points from 11 matches stretching back to the start of last season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Newcastle fans hold up a banner in protest at Mike Ashley, who attended the game at Selhurst Park. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA\n\nBenítez had stirred the pot earlier in the week by expressing his confidence that the referee, Andre Marriner, would “deal with the situation in a normal way” following Zaha’s demands for more protection from officials. The Newcastle manager even suggested the FA should “deal with these comments” and there was no doubting who the pantomime villain was for the travelling supporters, who booed their target at every opportunity in the first half.\n\nBut with all the attention on Zaha, Palace should still have been in front at half-time against opponents who showed little interest in attacking despite the presence of their owner in the stands. James McArthur, Jordan Ayew and Cheikhou Kouyaté all had opportunities to score, with Luka Milivojevic’s free-kick – which eluded everyone in the penalty area before bouncing away off a post – the closest they came to breaking the deadlock.\n\nAyoze Pérez earlier wasted Newcastle’s best chance when he dispossessed James Tomkins midway in Palace’s half but could only shoot straight at Wayne Hennessey. At least they improved slightly after the break, with the substitute Joselu producing an air shot from DeAndre Yedlin’s ball in.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic keeps up hot streak as Fulham and Watford share points Read more\n\nThe bottle incident briefly distracted Palace from their task before Sakho somehow contrived to miss an open goal from Townsend’s cross. Zaha, who Roy Hodgson admitted could have been affected by the media attention and his pre-match injury, almost set up McArthur in the dying moments but it was not to be.\n\n“It was a frustrating afternoon because we played well enough to win the game,” said the Palace manager. “It was a good performance from start to finish and we came across a very organised and disciplined Newcastle

"report": "Huddersfield glimpsed a first league win of the season here when Mathias Jørgensen swept them into an early lead, but that turned out to be a cruel mirage. Leicester soon reintroduced them to reality by equalising through Kelechi Iheanacho before taking control of the match.\n\nThey sealed victory in the second half thanks to goals by the former England striker Jamie Vardy and the excellent James Maddison, a 21-year-old who will become a valuable part of England’s future if he continues to perform as he has done for Leicester since his arrival from Norwich this summer for £24m. It is a fee that already looks more than reasonable.\n\nThis was an important win for Leicester after two defeats. Maddison was instrumental in it even though he was deployed from the left wing rather than in his more familiar position behind a central striker. That adjustment was to accommodate Claude Puel’s switch to a 4-4-2 formation, with Iheanacho partnering Vardy, and the hosts initially looked disjointed. Huddersfield deserved their early breakthrough.\n\nMohamed Salah strikes as Liverpool cruise to victory over Southampton Read more\n\nIt came via a long throw-in by Philip Billing, which Laurent Depoitre flicked on at the near post before Jørgensen swept into the net from close range. A failure to convert chances had undermined promising displays by Huddersfield in their past two games so this was an ideal start.\n\nHuddersfield played with poise immediately after that and fleetingly looked the superior side, Depoitre heading wide when given a chance to increase their lead. Perhaps the lack of a threat from the hosts lulled the visitors into a false sense of safety, but that is no excuse for the way they allowed Puel’s team to equalise.\n\nThe goal in the 19th minute originated from a Huddersfield corner. That was cleared and as the ball bounced midway inside the Leicester half, two Huddersfield players rushed forward to try to collect it, vacating their defensive posts like bank guards rendered giddy by the arrival of an ice-cream van. Maddison got to the ball first and Leicester acted quickly to loot the vaults, Maddison feeding Vardy, who served Iheanacho, who fired low into the net from the edge of the box.\n\nEqualising inspired Leicester and they began to enjoy the majority of possession. Set pieces brought their best chances to go in front, thanks to admirable inventiveness. Maddison duped the defence by dinking a pass over the wall when most were expecting him to shoot from a 20-yard free-kick, but that wheeze was undone as Vardy volleyed wide from 10 yards. Harry Maguire then had a header saved by Jonas Lössl following another clever free-kick.\n\nAshley Barnes double seals thumping Burnley win over Bournemouth Read more\n\nHuddersfield’s ventures into opposing territory grew rare. But they should have regained the lead in the 62nd minute, only for Maguire to dispossess the hesitant Depoitre after Rajiv van La Parra sent the striker lumbering clear. Four minutes later, Maddison fired Leicester in front with a splendid free-kick.\n\nThere was nothing especially innovative about this one – it was just a viciously struck dead ball that whizzed over the wall and past Lössl, who got a hand to it to no useful effect.\n\nIn the 75th minute, Iheanacho seized on a loose pass and sent Vardy running clear from halfway. The striker left Jørgensen in his wake before dinking the ball over Lössl and into the net.\n\n“We made a miss-pass in an area where everybody knows you can’t do a miss-pass against Leicester,” said David Wagner. “We’ve seen Jamie score this goal 100 times.”\n\nPuel was understandably more enthused, if still cautious in his praise. “We have to correct our starts but the second half was amazing

"report": "As Jürgen Klopp is fond of telling, it takes greed, aggression, talent and a phenomenal work-rate to succeed on his terms yet Liverpool are making the hard art of victory look routine. The Premier League summit was reclaimed with ease against Southampton, a seventh straight win stretching a flawless start as well as the idea that healthy competition exists between the best and the rest.\n\nLiverpool ended the contest before half-time as a Wesley Hoedt own goal, Joël Matip header and Mohamed Salah tap-in brought an emphatic interval lead over Mark Hughes’ visitors. If Charity Shield results are included, this is now the finest start to a campaign in Liverpool’s illustrious history. They are raking up wins while in second gear, have kept eight consecutive clean sheets at home in the Premier League and have two points more than Manchester City did at the corresponding stage of last season. Not that anyone at Anfield is looking too far ahead, of course.\n\nRiyad Mahrez brace caps five-star Manchester City’s rout of Cardiff Read more\n\n“I once lost seven games in a row and that felt much different,” said Klopp. “Yes, it is a surprise but the performances we showed so far were good enough to win all the games. Different styles and different opponents but the boys were always there.”\n\nLiverpool’s formation was even more adventurous than usual with Xherdan Shaqiri handed his first start in a floating role behind Salah, who was deployed as the central striker with Roberto Firmino left and Sadio Mané right. The summer signing was given only 45 minutes to impress against his former Stoke City manager. It was enough. Shaqiri instigated the breakthrough when he collected Mané’s piercing pass following a corner, cut inside Cédric Soares and shot for goal. It would have sailed wide but for a deflection off Shane Long which diverted the ball on to Hoedt’s thigh and in.\n\nKlopp’s changed system – worked on for only one rain-interrupted training session on Friday – offered Southampton space to attack Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson in numbers. It was an invitation the visitors accepted regularly but the absence of Danny Ings, ineligible against his parent club, and the commanding presence of Virgil van Dijk ensured there was no end product. Van Dijk would exit in the second half with a rib injury that Klopp described as “not cool but not too serious”. His replacement, Joe Gomez, was equally impressive. Southampton paid a high price for the absence of any such authority in the heart of their defence.\n\nLiverpool doubled their lead from another corner, conceded by Soares’ superb challenge on Salah as he shaped to convert Firmino’s return pass. Alexander-Arnold swept the delivery deep and Matip towered above Jannik Vestergaard to head his first Anfield goal into Alex McCarthy’s top corner.\n\nThe game provided a further demonstration of the widening gulf between the Premier League’s leading lights and their supposed competitors. Southampton did not play particularly badly and Liverpool were a long way short of their intensive, dominant best; yet they still strolled off at half-time three goals to the good. “It would seem so,” said Hughes when asked if the gap was growing. “I’d like to think that, on our day, we can give the best teams a good go. Hopefully we will prove that along the way but you have to acknowledge that Liverpool have a settled way of playing, personnel who have been here a long time and a manager who has been here a long time as well. They are clearly building something here.”\n\nAshley Barnes double seals thumping Burnley win over Bournemouth Read more\n\nNumber three was a simple but important tap-in for Salah. Klopp had played down concerns over the Egypt international’s form ahead of the game but, evidently, the source of 44 goals last season has not yet recaptured his sharpness. Salah went close several times, with one audacious backheel beating McCarthy but trickling agonisingly wide of the far post, before reacting more quickly than anyone to convert from close range after Shaqiri had struck the bar with a free-kick from 25 yards.\n\nShaqiri was replaced by James Milner at half-time as Klopp reverted to his trusted 4-3-3 formation and Liverpool coasted. “I told him I’d never substituted such an influential player at half-time before who wasn’t injured,” said Klopp.\n\nThe Fiver: Sign up for our free football email.\n\nThe second half was flat by comparison although

At the close Wolves came close to stealing victory when David de Gea saved a shot from Adama Traoré with a foot and the winger then blasted wide in added time.\n\nThis left José Mourinho again bewailing his players’ mindset, stating those of Wolves possessed a “World Cup final” attitude and his did not.\n\n“They play like I like to play, which is like the World Cup final,” the manager said. “That is the attitude I like my teams to have in every match. We didn’t have that. This is something you learn when you are a kid in the academy. You don’t need experiences at the highest level to learn that. It is a basic law of football.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson receives emotional ovation on return to Old Trafford Read more\n\n“I can’t explain the difference of attitude because I never had a difference of attitude. For me it is difficult to explain that.”\n\n“I could say we were tired, Champions League [in mid-week], awful pitch [at Young Boys] – the body suffers the different impact on an artificial rather than actual grass – not coming home after the match. I could go in this direction but Alexis Sánchez and Jesse Lingard didn’t play. [Marouane] Fellaini played 20, 25 minutes, Fred played 60 minutes, [Antonio] Valencia also didn’t play.”\n\nThe visitors signalled early on they would push forward when possible, creating two chances for Raúl Jiménez, the attacking spearhead in Nuno Espírito Santo’s 5-4-1 set-up. Both times United were breached along Luke Shaw’s left corridor but Jiménez failed to take full advantage. He miscued the first and De Gea saved smartly from the second.\n\nMourinho paired Victor Lindelöf and Chris Smalling in central defence for a fourth successive game and Alexis Sánchez replaced Anthony Martial on the left. In all there were four changes by United’s manager. By contrast his Portuguese compatriot fielded the same XI he has for all Wolves’ league matches this season.\n\nMourinho’s faith in the Smalling-Lindelöf combination was hardly repaid by what occurred from two João Moutinho corners. When he floated the first over from the right, Ryan Bennett headed over. Then, moments later, Willy Boly forced a superb De Gea save with neither centre-back anywhere near.\n\nIt was reflective of how United were pinned back in virtually all of the opening passages. Yet after 20 minutes they were in the lead.\n\nShaw wandered forward, close to Wolves’ area and pinged in a cross. Eventually the ball fell to Paul Pogba and he continued his fine form from midweek with a cute reverse-flick to Fred, whose weak right-foot shot beat Rui Patrício.\n\nOn 27 minutes the stadium again rose to acclaim Ferguson, who could be seen beaming his appreciation – the timing a recognition of his number of years in charge of the club.\n\nPlay Video 0:49 Sir Alex Ferguson gets standing ovation on his return to Old Trafford – video\n\nSánchez continues to struggle for consistency but Ferguson would have approved of how he drove along the left and flipped a clever ball in toward the galloping Pogba and Romelu Lukaku as half-time neared.\n\nOn the touchline Espírito Santo was a frustrated man due to some of the decisions awarded against Wolves and, when Patrício dawdled and had to hoof the ball out as Jesse Lingard closed in, his frustration turned to fury.\n\nUnited began the second half with a raking Pogba pass that Lukaku controlled expertly with a knee and for a moment Patrício’s goal looked threatened but the centre-forward’s shot was blocked.\n\nRiyad Mahrez double caps five-star Manchester City’s rout of Cardiff Read more\n\nIt was a sign of the home side’s ascendancy, though too often they ceded the ball via clumsy touches, with Fred a chief culprit. This failing led to the visitors’ equaliser, although it was Pogba to blame.\n\nThe Frenchman attempted a fancy turn near halfway and lost the ball to Rúben Neves as the onlooking Mourinho reacted with concern, knowing what might now happen. It did: when Wolves tore forward, Jiménez passed the ball back inside United’s area to Moutinho, who smacked the ball home.\n\nMourinho’s reaction was to remove Fred and the ineffective Sánchez for Juan Mata and Martial on 62 minutes. Martial combined with Shaw for the latter to swing in a far-post cross from which Fellaini should have beaten Patrício. Instead the ball was diverted into the goalkeeper’s hands.\n\nMourinho’s last throw of the dice was the removal of Lingard for Andreas Pereira. The midfielder won a free-kick in a central area, 30 yards out, but it came to nothing and United’s run of victories ended.\n\n“I am proud of the way we played,” said Espírito Santo.

The vultures had been circling after three defeats and the historians leafing all the way back to the spring of 2004, the last time they lost four consecutive games in a single season. Mauricio Pochettino needed his players to stand tall at what has become one of the Premier League’s more testing venues for the bigger clubs; they did that and, while this performance fell some way short of their fluent best, a few suggestions of a return to form flickered, too.\n\nForemost among them was their second, ultimately decisive goal, scored by Érik Lamela after the kind of rapier-like attack Tottenham have made their trademark under Pochettino. Lamela had replaced Son Heung-min eight minutes before taking possession just inside the Brighton half and, via Lucas Moura, working the ball to Danny Rose. He kept running and was rewarded with an accurate cutback that, without breaking stride, he swept beyond Mat Ryan.\n\nBrighton 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League — as it happened Read more\n\n“That is how we want to play, how we feel football,” Pochettino said of the goal’s construction, although Spurs showed another side that made him even happier. He had pointedly questioned their resolve after Tuesday’s late capitulation at Internazionale and here, amid filthy conditions against a team that had taken 10 points from their previous four home games against last season’s top six, they faced down the kind of challenge tailor-made for anyone curious about their response.\n\nThey were slightly lucky that Glenn Murray, needlessly handballing Kieran Trippier’s free-kick, gave Harry Kane the chance to dispel the cobwebs that had gathered during an increasingly ponderous first half. They were fortunate, too, that Anthony Knockaert shot straight at Paulo Gazzaniga in the 66th minute when he should have equalised. There was even an improbable wobble at the end after Knockaert, a mite too late in proceedings, got his bearings right with an excellent finish.\n\nBut Pochettino saw enough to feel Tottenham had recovered something that, even if only for three weeks, had been lost.\n\n“I think the spirit we showed today is the spirit I wanted to see in all the games,” he said. “The team was fantastic in how it defended; this mentality to fight and always give your best. That’s what pleased me the most today.”\n\nRiyad Mahrez double caps five-star Manchester City’s rout of Cardiff Read more\n\nTottenham began authoritatively and might have taken the lead when Toby Alderweireld, meeting Trippier’s corner with a thudding header that flicked off Gaëten Bong, drew a flying one-handed save from Ryan. Both players had been recalled after missing the game at San Siro for what Pochettino had termed “technical reasons”; Trippier was heavily involved early on but, after that initial encouragement, their tempo slowed and the doubts set back in.\n\nBy the half-hour they had seen 78% of the possession but there had been little to show for it; the speed of thought required to unlock opponents who were evidently happy to play out a goalless first half was, not for the first time this month, scarcely evident.\n\nThen Murray, jumping in the wall and repelling the ball with his arm when the adjacent Davy Pröpper had been poised to take one in the face for his team, opened the door for Tottenham and Kane beat Ryan confidently from the spot. The home crowd howled with derision; in reality there was no disputing Christopher Kavanagh’s call, although Chris Hughton felt the award of the free-kick itself had been soft.\n\nHughton also felt Brighton should have had their own penalty in the second half when Eric Dier appeared to have grabbed Lewis Dunk’s shirt. But the bigger frustration was that, during a ferocious spell of pressure, Knockaert fired straight at Gazzaniga after doing the hard work by cutting inside Jan Vertonghen. In a frantic period of added time Knockaert scored, watched Ryan save a one-on-one from Kane, and drew another stop from the keeper with the last action of the game. A foot to his right and, suddenly, those proclamations about Spurs’ resolve would have looked far weaker.\n\n“For me he was man of the match,” Pochettino said of Gazzaniga, a late call-up in place of

It was not for long, admittedly, given it took Brighton a little under two minutes to set home nerves jangling again. Saints’ players may struggle to recall that blissful century of seconds when the stuffing appeared to have been knocked out of their opponents and they were coasting serenely towards only a second home league win in 10 months. In the end the overriding sensation was one of familiar, numbing disappointment, of the kind they endure too often on their own patch.\n\nThat was soon overtaken by livid frustration. “We were 2-0 up against an opponent we have to beat … it’s not good enough,” grumbled Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, scorer of the game’s most spectacular goal far earlier in the match. As panic gripped in stoppage time, he watched aghast as James Ward-Prowse was penalised for fouling Shane Duffy and the referee awarded a penalty.\n\nSouthampton 2-2 Brighton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nBrighton are making a habit of eye-popping comebacks but that was no consolation for Southampton. They have dropped 26 points from winning positions in the Premier League since the start of last season, and 13 in 13 matches under Mark Hughes.\n\nIt was Glenn Murray, inevitably given his penchant for scoring against Saints, who maintained his composure to convert the penalty, stroking his 98th Brighton goal beyond Alex McCarthy to complete a second successive two-goal comeback.\n\nThe goalkeeper must still have been staggered that it had come to this given his excellent save to deny Jürgen Locadia seconds earlier only for Ward-Prowse, one of the smaller players on the pitch and seeking to block off Duffy at the set piece, to commit his offence at the resultant corner. Hughes pointed out the centre-half is “a big boy and has gone down a bit easily” but his real exasperation centred on the wastefulness of it all. Brighton might have been buried by the break. They should certainly have been seen off at 2-0.\n\nTo have claimed some kind of reward from such an anaemic first-half display said much about the character of Chris Hughton’s side. It had been Hojbjerg whose goal had left them winded, the Dane taking a touch as he collected 30 yards out and, with Yves Bissouma slow to close him down, cutting across the ball with the sweetest of connections to rip his shot towards the far corner where it swerved beyond the sprawling Mat Ryan.\n\nThat merely confirmed Saints’ dominance given the excellence of Ryan Bertrand and Nathan Redmond down the left. Mohamed Elyounoussi and Danny Ings should already have scored by then. Southampton had departed at the interval mystified by their lead being still so slender.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pierre-Emile Højbjerg scored a sensational opener, striking his shot from 36 yards out into the corner. Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIngs would earn himself a clearer sight of goal after the break after darting into the penalty box and slipping in a tangle of legs under Gaëten Bong’s challenge. A third reward in four games was claimed from the penalty spot, with Gareth Southgate watching on from the stands and presumably more inclined than ever to recall him to the England fold. As the players ambled back into position from their joyous huddle, Southampton dared to dream they had done enough.\n\nBrighton had already offered flashes of renewed urgency even before Ings’ goal but Duffy’s immediate reply, nodding Anthony Knockaert’s free-kick down and beyond McCarthy, pepped the visitors’ belief and punctured Saints’ optimism.\n\n“After the way we performed in the first half we got away with one,” Murray said. “We were poor, under par, but the second half was a different game.”\n\nLocadia and Alireza Jahanbakhsh injected pace, buzzing disconcertingly at the striker’s back, with Jahanbakhsh flicking a shot on to the post. Knockaert, unleashed, tormented his markers and in the end Saints cracked.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nHughes, slumped in his dugout, had seen this all before too often. He praised his team’s “progressive approach” and pointed to their initial urgency as evidence they can play with confidence in a stadium where winning has become so elusive. But he was left to bemoan an inability to close out contests “when opponents say: ‘Sod it, let’s throw people forward and take a few risks.’”\n\nThey had somehow preserved a lead at Crystal Palace in their previous game, McCarthy denying Christian Benteke from point-blank range before the visitors scored a second with virtually the last kick, but that felt like an exception. This late wilt has long since become their norm.

"Wolverhampton Wanderers’ impressive adaptation to life in the Premier League continues to gather momentum as Raúl Jiménez scored the only goal of a one-sided game to secure their first top-flight home victory since December 2011, back in the days when Mick McCarthy was in charge and the Midlands club were destined to be relegated in humiliating fashion.\n\nHow times have changed. Backed by the wealth of the Fosun group, their ambitious Chinese owners, and aided by Jorge Mendes’s contacts book, Wolves have put together quite a team and, on the evidence so far, will be doing much more than making up the numbers this season. They are the only side to have taken points off Manchester City and are now up to ninth place in the table after a win that was far more comfortable than the scoreline suggests.\n\nMatt Doherty is finally feeling at home in the company of Wolves Read more\n\nBurnley, who are enduring a miserable run that stretches back to last season, were outplayed and outclassed for long periods, and on another day could have taken a hiding. Sean Dyche talked afterwards about the need “to lift the fog” that has descended on his team, who have now won only five of their last 26 Premier League matches and lost the last four.\n\nTo put Wolves’ superiority into context, they registered 30 shots to Burnley’s seven, leaving home manager Nuno Espírito Santo, the home manager, throwing his arms around in despair on the touchline at times as so many chances to put the game to bed were squandered.\n\nBurnley’s goalkeeper Joe Hart deserves credit for keeping the score down by making a few instinctive saves but generally Wolves only had themselves to blame for failing to turn their dominance into goals.\n\nThe sight of Léo Bonatini missing a simple opportunity deep into injury time, when the substitute shot wide with the goal yawning invitingly, summed up Wolves’ finishing.\n\nIt would be unfair, though, to dwell too much on their profligacy in front of goal, especially when there is so much to enjoy about the way this Wolves team plays.\n\nWith Helder Costa and Diogo Jota providing craft and penetration on the flanks, and Rúben Neves and João Moutinho passing the ball intelligently in central midfield, Wolves are blessed with so much creativity. Throw the pace of Adama Traoré into the mix too – the club-record signing caused havoc when he came off the bench – and it is clear that Wolves will be quite a handful this season.\n\nWolves 1-0 Burnley: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe only question hanging over them at the start of the campaign was whether they had a centre-forward who was good enough to take advantage of that supply line.\n\nJiménez, who signed on a season-long loan from Benfica, has not been a prolific goalscorer in the past but he now has two in his first five games for the club.\n\nThe Mexican was rewarded for his persistence against Burnley. Hart and James Tarkowski, who headed off the line, denied him in the first half and a golden opportunity was wasted early in the second period when Jiménez lifted the ball over the bar after Jota pounced on Phil Bardsley’s poor backpass. Jiménez accepted his next chance, though, when he guided a low right-footed shot in off the far post, after Matt Doherty had burst into the area and cut the ball back.\n\nIn a role reversal, Doherty should have added a second 15 minutes from time when he swapped passes with Jiménez and continued his run, only to drag his shot well wide with only Hart to beat. Bonatini, on for Jiménez, then wasted several excellent chances that could have been costly on another day.\n\n“We’re going to work on finding this final touch,” Espirito Santo said. “But I think the most important thing from the first game is we are improving.”\n\nBurnley are unable to say the same. Apart from the substitute Matej Vydra’s angled volley, which was deflected narrowly wide, they created next to nothing against Wolves and that will be the biggest concern for Dyche.\n\n“The positive for us is that we looked much more like ourselves defensively in terms of blocks and the keeper played great. But that’s the only thing I can pick out really, because offensively we were nowhere near it,” the Burnley manager said. “We gave the ball away so many times, in so many cheap positions, and you can’t do that. But credit to them, they’re a good side.”"}, {"date": "16/09/2018", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39161, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Digne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [44]}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [18], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cenk Tosun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernard", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [44], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Dowell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabián Balbuena", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Issa Diop", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andriy Yarmolenko", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11, 31], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Felipe Anderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}], "subs": [{"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "With media duties over and free to commence birthday celebrations, Manuel Pellegrini was asked what West Ham’s players had given him for his 65th. “Three goals,” he beamed. They gave him so much more: a first Premier League win of the season, a release from the pressure and a performance to dispel the doubts that had developed in the early weeks of his reign, to be precise.\n\nSubstitute Lucas Pérez was not ready, says West Ham’s Manuel Pellegrini Read more\n\nWest Ham’s losing run felt like a trick of the mind as they confidently condemned Everton to the first defeat of Marco Silva’s tenure and executed Pellegrini’s pre-match instructions to perfection. “I told the players that Everton must feel from the start that we have come to get three points, not just have a good performance,” the Chilean said. In Andriy Yarmolenko and Marko Arnautovic the visitors possessed the quality necessary to punish an error-strewn Everton performance and disorganised defence. Yarmolenko struck twice on his full league debut to demonstrate his fitness is improving in tandem with West Ham’s appreciation of their new manager’s ideas. Arnautovic added a merited third before departing with a knee injury that will be assessed on Monday.\n\nEven accounting for several notable absentees in the Everton ranks the manner of West Ham’s win confirmed four consecutive defeats had left no lasting damage on team morale. By contrast this was a weak and worrying display for Silva, littered with individual errors from Jordan Pickford in goal to Cenk Tosun in attack. Everton started crisply but, without the suspended Richarlison, they lacked threat and balance. It was they, not the team who started the day at the foot of the table, whose confidence shattered with the first telling mistake of the game.\n\n“We didn’t perform to a level to win this match,” said the Everton manager, who has overseen a mediocre start at Goodison Park. “I already told our players that at this level you cannot make mistakes like we made and when you create chances you have to score. After the first mistake we didn’t react like we had to react and the game changed completely. We lost our confidence.”\n\nYarmolenko was in the mood to punish Everton’s catalogue of mistakes. The Ukraine international, one of six changes made by Pellegrini, once helped Dynamo Kyiv dismantle Roberto Martínez’s Everton in a Europa League tie and was a transfer target for the Goodison Park club before moving to Borussia Dortmund. The 28‑year‑old gave Everton further cause for regret by sweeping West Ham into a comfortable first-half lead. His opener came after Tosun was brushed off the ball by Fabian Balbuena. Pedro Obiang released Arnautovic clear of a chaotic Everton defence – one missing Séamus Coleman, Yerry Mina, Phil Jagielka and Michael Keane through injury – and the Austria international selflessly squared with only Pickford to beat for Yarmolenko to convert from close range.\n\nEverton were static, careless and posed minimal threat as they served a reminder that last season’s failings will not be eradicated easily. They were two goals down when Pickford, under no pressure, pinged a clearance straight to Mark Noble with his defence exposed. Noble released Yarmolenko on the right and the winger was invited to cut inside by Kurt Zouma, duly accepted, and curled an unstoppable finish beyond Pickford. Everton’s keeper punched the pitch in frustration, as well he might.\n\nEverton v West Ham United: Premier League – live!

The summer signing Bernard replaced Morgan Schneiderlin, playing after the death of his father in midweek, and improved the energy and distribution from the home midfield immediately.\n\nSeconds before the break Gylfi Sigurdsson rose impressively to head Jonjoe Kenny’s inviting cross beyond Lukasz Fabianski and Everton were spared the half-time jeers. Tosun should have done so earlier when Lucas Digne’s cross found him unmarked in the area but, at full stretch, he headed tamely at Fabianski. The West Ham keeper also saved from Theo Walcott’s volley in what was a rare moment of danger for the visitors.\n\nThe timing of Sigurdsson’s goal offered unexpected hope to Everton. Other than an optimistic penalty claim when the goalscorer was shouldered aside by the influential Obiang, however, the prospect of a comeback was remote. It became non-existent when Arnautovic restored West Ham’s two-goal advantage just after the hour.\n\nOnce again Everton applied minimal pressure on the ball as Obiang twice exchanged passes with the lone striker – despite having five royal blue shirts around him on the edge of the area. The midfielder’s second ball was perfectly weighted for Arnautovic to convert under Pickford.\n\nTosun missed another good chance while his replacement, Oumar Niasse, volleyed against the crossbar but there could be no denying West Ham a belated and well-deserved first Premier League win. Slowly they are adapting to Pellegrini’s methods."}, {"date": "15/09/2018", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 80188, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Michel

"report": "These may still be the embryonic stages of the new Premier League season but Liverpool firmly leave the impression they want to see the view from the top of the table, judging from their superiority here against another of the teams who will switch their attentions to the Champions League in the next few days. It was Liverpool’s fifth straight win, only the third time they have started the season so immaculately, and perhaps the most frightening thought for the teams playing catch-up is that Mohamed Salah has still not quite found his most exhilarating form of last season.\n\nLeroy Sané strikes early as dominant Manchester City brush Fulham aside Read more\n\nNot that Salah was too shabby during those long spells when Liverpool overwhelmed their opponents and repeatedly opened up what is supposed to be one of the better defences in the top division. Once again, the front line of Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané shimmered with menace. Yet there is also growing evidence that Liverpool can no longer be considered a lopsided team. The partnership between Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk is flourishing and until the five minutes of stoppage time, when the substitute Erik Lamela scored for Spurs, it was difficult to think of another period when Alisson, the away team’s goalkeeper, was in sustained danger.\n\nIt was certainly unusual to see Spurs being outplayed this way and a particular ordeal for Michel Vorm, deputising for the injured Hugo Lloris in goal. Vorm’s frailties were exposed for both of Liverpool’s goals, scored by Georginio Wijnaldum and Firmino, and his mind seemed scrambled during parts of the second half. If anything, it was a surprise Liverpool restricted themselves to no more goals, the only criticisms being that their final pass was often lacking and their finishing not clinical enough. The final score hardly does justice to the gulf that existed between the sides. “The performance was better than the result,” was Jürgen Klopp’s take. “This was by far the best performance of the season.” The manager was troubled by an injury to Firmino, who went to hospital after being accidentally caught in an eye by Jan Vertonghen’s fingers, but he was discharged and may face PSG on Tuesday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roberto Firmino had to go off after suffering an eye injury in a clash with Jan Vertonghen. Photograph: Visionhaus/Getty Images\n\nFor Spurs, it was the first time since the closing stages of the 2015-16 season that they have lost successive league fixtures. Lloris may have disgraced himself recently off the pitch but, if Vorm continues being this vulnerable, Spurs will long for their first-choice goalkeeper to return. Harry Kane’s performance did little to shift the perception that he needs a break and Mauricio Pochettino could not possibly argue it was deserved when Lamela, a substitute, caught out Alisson with a low, angled shot in the third minute of added time.\n\nAlmost inconceivably, Spurs could have salvaged a draw, with Mané lucky not to concede a penalty in the final seconds for tripping Son Heung-min, another substitute. Spurs were entitled to grumble because it was a clear foul. A draw, however, would have been a travesty. “This type of game shows we need to improve – a lot – if we want to be a contender,” Pochettino said.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\n\nKlopp talked about Liverpool having “85 brilliant minutes” and Pochettino must be acutely aware his team could have lost far more heavily. Klopp could also reflect on the incident, inside the opening 40 seconds, when Firmino turned James Milner’s cross into the far corner only for the goal to be disallowed, harshly, for an offside decision against Mané, who did not get a touch but was deemed to have been interfering with play.\n\nArsenal’s Mesut Özil leaves Ciaran Clark and Newcastle too much to do Read more\n\nWhen Liverpool did take the lead, in the 39th minute, Klopp could have been forgiven for thinking it was overdue. Pochettino, in turn, must have been alarmed by how often his players were making life difficult for themselves and even Christian Eriksen, such an elegant mover of the ball, will have to take some culpability bearing in mind it was his carelessness that gave away possession close to the penalty area and led to the corner.\n\nAll the same, Vorm should have done much better when Milner swung the corner into the six-yard area. Did Milner deliberately aim it so close to the goalkeeper? It felt that way and Vorm’s attempted punch succeeded only in flicking the ball towards the back post. Eric Dier could not get enough distance with his defensive header. Wijnaldum looped his header over Kieran Trippier and when Vorm clawed it away the goalkeeper was a foot behind the line.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Spurs’ keeper Michel Vorm claws away Georginio Wijnaldum’s header from behind the goal-line. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Observer\n\nIn fairness to Vorm, he did spare his team, at 0-0, when Dier got a backward pass horribly wrong and left Salah with a run on goal.\n\nThat period of the game was also notable for Jan Vertonghen trying to chip Alisson from just inside the Liverpool half. It was nowhere near coming off and felt strangely symbolic of his team’s dishevelled performance.\n\nLiverpool, in stark contrast, looked full of confidence, chasing down their opponents and encouraged by the sheer number of times that Spurs gave up the ball inside their own half. Mané set up the second goal with a surging run on the left. Vertonghen’s attempt to cut out the cross succeeded only in turning the ball against the post and Vorm was on the floor as the rebound rolled his way. He could not adjust in time, the ball squeezed through his hands and Firmino had a simple finish."}, {"date": "15/09/2018", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10543, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [81], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Rico Salguero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Brooks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Jefferson Lerma", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [19, 37], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [41], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricardo Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [45], "reds": [69], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [12], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nampalys Mendy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rachid Ghezzal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "James Maddison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Ryan Fraser scored twice and made another as Bournemouth continued their impressive start by blitzing Leicester.

At first glance, they had done another fine job of undermining Maurizio Sarri’s pleas for patience. The irrepressible Eden Hazard had the match ball under his arm, the sun was shining on Stamford Bridge and Chelsea were on their way to the Premier League’s summit after maintaining their impeccable start to the season.\n\nBournemouth’s Ryan Fraser sparkles before Leicester’s late show Read more\n\nWith Liverpool pushed into second place on goal difference, all was sweetness and light in west London. Or so it seemed. For while the final score made it look like a rout, the reality was more troubling for Sarri. He could not be entirely pleased after watching Chelsea strain to overcome a tough challenge from Cardiff City, who dared to dream after Sol Bamba’s early goal, and it was unsurprising to hear him maintain that his team are not title contenders.\n\n“I cannot change my mind because of one match,” Chelsea’s manager said. “My target is to be the best team in England, but not in one month. Maybe one season. Maybe a little more. But at the moment, in my opinion, Liverpool and Manchester City are better than us.”\n\nSarri is striving for perfection and it brought him limited satisfaction to hear that he has emulated Carlo Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola and Craig Shakespeare by becoming the fourth manager to win his first five Premier League games. He was more interested in the poor defending that led to Bamba’s opener in the 16th minute, especially after warning his players about Cardiff’s threat from set pieces, and it summed up his mood that he responded to Hazard’s hat-trick by pointing out that Chelsea’s main man still needs to spend more time near the opposition’s goal.\n\n“I think Hazard can improve more,” Sarri said. “When he went to the ball in our half and touched the ball five or six times, in his actions he spent a lot of energy. I think Hazard can score 30 or 35 goals.”\n\nNot that Sarri was minded to focus too much on the negatives when it came to analysing Hazard’s performance. Chelsea had toiled before the forward’s electrifying seven-minute burst at the end of the first half and it had threatened to become an awkward afternoon after Cardiff’s fearless start.\n\nNeil Warnock’s side adopted a direct approach, surprising their illustrious hosts with the intensity of their high press, and the visitors sent the big men forward from the back when David Luiz needlessly steamed into Danny Ward near the halfway line. Joe Ralls pumped a deep free-kick towards the far post, Marcos Alonso failed to prevent Sean Morrison from heading back across goal and Bamba capitalised on slack marking from Jorginho by volleying past Kepa Arrizabalaga from close range.\n\nThe hosts sought an instant response and Etheridge, a former Chelsea youth player, denied Mateo Kovacic with two excellent stops. Yet while Cardiff defended with impressive discipline for long spells, they could not contain Hazard. Players of the Belgian’s stature tend to pick the lock eventually and he located Cardiff’s weak point by drifting inside to combine with Olivier Giroud in the 37th minute. Joe Bennett’s challenge was weak, infuriating Warnock, and Hazard punished the left-back by beating Etheridge from 20 yards.\n\nPalace end losing run as Wilfried Zaha shows his class at Huddersfield Read more\n\nChelsea’s relief was immense and Giroud was involved again in the 44th minute, steering Pedro’s cross to Hazard, who smuggled the ball underneath Etheridge. “He’s a good player, isn’t he? Warnock sighed. “He’s unplayable at times.”\n\nTo their credit, Cardiff refused to stop hunting for their first victory since winning promotion from the Championship last season. Bobby Reid went close in the 67th minute and David Luiz was fortunate not to concede a penalty after colliding with Callum Paterson.\n\nYet Sarri had the luxury of bringing Willian off the bench and the Brazilian had a telling impact, surging into the area in the 80th minute and winning a penalty after tumbling over Bamba’s desperate lunge.\n\nJorginho generously gave the ball to Hazard, who sent Etheridge the wrong way from the spot, and there was still time for Willian to rub salt into Cardiff’s wounds."}, {"date": "15/09/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 23696,

Huddersfield, like the rest of the Premier League, know all about the importance of Wilfried Zaha to Crystal Palace and the danger he poses to opponents, but still they could not stop him from deciding the outcome of this fierce match.\n\nThe home team played well, but Palace made off with the points thanks to a wonderful solo goal by their most precious player.\n\nArsenal’s Mesut Özil leaves Ciaran Clark and Newcastle too much to do Read more\n\nThe result leaves Huddersfield without a win in five league matches, while Palace celebrated the end of a three-game losing streak.\n\nZaha was cast straight back into Palace’s side, after missing the home defeat by Southampton because of an injury from which he has not fully recovered. Roy Hodgson agreed to risk him.\n\n“He deserves enormous credit because the groin injury he picked up would have kept many a player out for longer, but he is so determined to get back on the field that the doctors and physios can’t keep him back,” Hodgson said.\n\nHe may have been stationed on the left wing, but Zaha was always going to be at the forefront of both teams’ minds. Palace had complained about the robustness of Huddersfield’s attempts to subdue him when the sides met last season but, this time, the visitors began as if intent on firing pre-emptive strikes.\n\nJames McArthur was booked early for crunching into Mathias Jorgensen, while Cheikhou Kouyaté and Luka Milivojevic were lucky that the referee, Lee Mason, opted for leniency when they committed similar fouls. But when Jorgensen brought down Zaha after the winger intercepted a slack pass by Christopher Schindler in the 27th minute, Palace players lobbied angrily for a red card. Mason settled for a yellow while the home crowd denounced the perceived hypocrisy of the visitors.\n\nThe atmosphere turned febrile. An aggrieved Zaha made a hot‑tempered challenge, clattering into Florent Hadergjonaj to earn a booking.\n\nHodgson said his player was frustrated at being fouled and by accusations from home fans that he is prone to exaggeration. “Unfortunately for Wilf, he’s got a strong sense of justice and doesn’t think people should treat him that unfairly, but he’s learning.”\n\nSoon after his booking, Zaha made his mark more skilfully. In the 38th minute, he received the ball on the left and glided forward before cutting between Hadergjonaj and Elias Kachunga and into the box and lashing a shot high into the net from a difficult angle. It was a spectacular goal and Zaha’s celebrations suggested it was a particularly satisfying blow to land.\n\nUntil then, Huddersfield had created the better chances. Most of them came via Philip Billing’s long throw-ins, which regularly triggered chaos in the box. But the clearest was the product of an elegant move, as Aaron Mooy swept a crossfield pass to Chris Löwe, whose delivery was well met by Steve Mounié. The striker’s header from 10 yards out flew over.\n\nLeroy Sané strikes early as dominant Manchester City brush Fulham aside Read more\n\nHuddersfield came out even stronger in the second half and outplayed Palace with Löwe continually making gains down the left and Mooy and Billing controlling midfield. Mooy almost made that point with graceful power just before the hour but his volley from 20 yards out hit the post. Wayne Hennessey saved the follow-up from Hadergjonaj.\n\nPalace had a couple of chances to score on the counter, notably when McArthur slashed wide after service by Zaha.

owner, Sheikh Mansour, suggested Manchester City are merely “halfway up their Everest”. They are already out of sight to Fulham, who by the same calculation must be observing events from somewhere between base camp and a hole in the ground. Even though there were half as many goals, this was as much of a mismatch as Huddersfield being hit for six last month.\n\nTo say City won with something to spare would be to risk serious understatement. They had John Stones, İlkay Gündoğan, Riyad Mahrez, Gabriel Jesus and Phil Foden on the bench, with no place for Benjamin Mendy in the squad. Whatever the reason for the absence of one of the better performers this season – Pep Guardiola mentioned a minor injury in training – the France international was not missed.\n\n“Three-nil is a good result but we created enough chances to score five or six goals,” he said. “We probably need to be more clinical but I give a lot of credit to Fulham. They will surprise a few people this season and I think they will still be in the Premier League the next.”\n\nSlavisa Jokanovic was equally magnanimous. “We didn’t make it easy for ourselves but the result was completely fair,” the Fulham manager said. “City showed they are one of the best teams in the world.”\n\nChelsea go top after Eden Hazard’s irrepressible hat-trick sees off Cardiff Read more\n\nThe visitors were behind after two minutes and the contest would have been as good as over within a quarter of an hour had Raheem Sterling’s erratic finishing not come back to haunt him. Leroy Sané marked his first start of the league campaign with one of the easiest goals he will ever score after a heavy touch by Jean Michaël Seri in his own half was mercilessly punished by Fernandinho. The Brazilian intervened decisively as soon as the Fulham midfielder failed to control a pass from Marcus Bettinelli, galloping into space behind a nonexistent defensive line to find Sané up in support with a cross that required only a tap-in.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nWith Fulham already obliged to chase the game, Bernardo Silva held the ball up well before releasing Sterling for a run on goal. The winger looked odds-on to score with only Bettinelli to beat but ended up putting his shot too close to the goalkeeper, who pushed it on to the bar.\n\nAt least Sterling made amends five minutes later with a hand in City’s second goal, finding Bernardo Silva in space for a cross from the byline. Sergio Agüero was on to it first, only to see Seri block his shot – but with City players queuing up on the six-yard line, David Silva calmly tucked away the loose ball.\n\nBournemouth’s Ryan Fraser sparkles before Leicester’s late show Read more\n\nFulham did manage a couple of goal attempts in the first half, both from André Schürrle and both saved by Ederson, the second requiring a far more acrobatic stop than the first. Yet with City in control from such an early stage the afternoon inevitably resolved itself into a question of how many more they might score. They could easily have gone further ahead before the interval but for Bettinelli spreading himself to keep out a shot from the energetic Sané and then ending the half with a one-handed save to deny Sterling.\n\nThe visitors’ defensive resolve at the start of the second half lasted about as long as it did in the first, Agüero cutting in from the right to beat Alfie Mawson and leave Sterling with an unmissable chance from a couple of yards out (albeit one made more difficult by a late touch from Seri on the way through).\n\nAgüero departed after that, warmly applauded even though it had not been one of his most productive outings. His replacement, Gabriel Jesus, then almost scored with his first touch when David Silva crossed to the near post.\n\nWith no further goals and little urgency on show from either side, the last half-hour was soporific, if not downright tedious. Bernardo Silva should have made it four but blasted high over the bar when unselfishly set up by Jesus. “You’re just a crap Man United,” the Fulham supporters chanted unsympathetically.

"report": "Arsenal’s Mesut Özil leaves Ciaran Clark and Newcastle too much to do\n\nMidway through an initially awkward afternoon, Unai Emery was quite possibly bracing himself for the sort of uncomfortable post‑match scrutiny with which Arsène Wenger eventually became so wearily familiar.\n\nEmery’s Arsenal ended the first half seemingly barely able to string two passes together and apparently struggling to embrace their new philosophy of advancing with intricacy right from the very back.\n\nWith Newcastle United pressing their guests into flustered submission, Rafael Benítez was winning his battle of wits with Wenger’s successor.\n\nChelsea go top after Eden Hazard’s irrepressible hat-trick sees off Cardiff Read more\n\nYet as good as Benítez’s tactical plan appeared, he lacked a striker sufficiently predatory to polish off Matt Ritchie’s stellar crosses and his playmaker Jonjo Shelvey was only fit enough for the bench.\n\nThe scene was consequently set for Granit Xhaka to secure an ultimately restorative win by reminding everyone that a moment’s inspiration is sometimes all it takes to undo any amount of perspiration.\n\nIf Emery’s introduction of Lucas Torreira helped Arsenal get a belated grip on midfield, Xhaka’s stunning free-kick changed the narrative entirely, prefacing an important – and judging by Emery’s body language, evidently stress-busting – visiting victory.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Granit Xhaka’s free-kick flies over the Newcastle wall and into the net to give Arsenal the lead. Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images\n\nWith an elegant swipe of a Swiss boot, the harsh glare of the Premier League spotlight had switched to Benítez and his Newcastle United side’s haul of only one point from five games. That equals the team’s record bad start under Ruud Gullit in 1999-2000, but the context is entirely different; 19 years on, no one expects Benítez, whose side have already faced four of the division’s top six, to emulate Gullit by resigning.\n\n“We’re not happy, but I’m not concerned because I know my team really well,” said Newcastle’s manager. “We’ve been close, but now we have to make the difference in the final third.”\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nEmery agreed it had been a chameleon-style Arsenal performance. “In the first half, we couldn’t control the match,” he acknowledged. “We couldn’t impose our ideas and we conceded a lot of counterattacking chances. The key was the first goal, but maybe Lucas gave us better balance.”\n\nEarly-season top-tier statistics indicate that no goalkeeper has been more involved with his feet than Petr Cech but, despite this win, Emery’s commitment to playing out from the back remains a work in progress.\n\nAccordingly, Cech and his defence frequently looked hesitant as Newcastle bombarded their box.\n\nBenítez has a habit of approaching games against the division’s elite with extreme caution but, here, he made a radical tactical departure that resulted in his unusually aggressive side harrying their visitors out of possession by pressing them high up the pitch and rudely interrupting their goalkeeper’s efforts to initiate those patient buildups.\n\nIn marked contrast, Benítez’s side have played more long balls than anyone in the division – Neil Warnock’s Cardiff included – and have enjoyed the least possession of any team.\n\nSuch no-frills directness has, so far, hardly paid dividends, yet with the decibel level rising every time Mesut Özil was bundled unceremoniously off the ball, it initially seemed the ideal way to thoroughly faze Arsenal.\n\nLeroy Sané strikes early as dominant Manchester City brush Fulham aside Read more\n\nYet, although Jacob Murphy’s diving header forced Cech into a splendid save, it tellingly represented the closest either side came to scoring during an opening half punctuated by the lack of a killer final ball. Murphy frequently accelerated behind Héctor Bellerín but he and his team-mates lacked the necessary subtlety to capitalise.\n\nReprieved, Emery replaced Mattéo Guendouzi with Lucas in the midfield holding role and, shortly afterwards, all Benítez’s homework – and his team’s hard work – went to waste, as Federico Fernández fouled Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Xhaka stepped forward to curl a free kick, which Martin Dubravka touched but could not hold, into the top right corner from considerable distance.Significantly it was the afternoon’s first shot on target.\n\nThe time had come for the suddenly influential Özil, liberated by Lucas’s arrival, to silence his doubters. When Alexandre Lacazette’s shot was blocked, the rebound fell for the German to apply the, typically accomplished, finishing touch.\n\nPerhaps disrupted by the injury-induced loss of Jamaal Lascelles, Newcastle were unable to sustain their early energy. They could easily have fallen further behind before Clark’s stoppage-time header afforded the scoreline a semblance of respectability, but provided zero Geordie consolation."}, {"date": "15/09/2018",

everyone is obsessed with him, the Manchester United manager may be able to put what the rest of the world thinks to one side when he wakes up on Sunday morning and enjoy instead the simple satisfaction that comes with three points.\n\nMourinho was chirpy as he mused on the ramifications of a narrow victory over Watford – one he acknowledged was a fragile win given how his team followed a dominant first half with a more passive second which required a trademark intervention from David de Gea deep into stoppage time to keep hold of the points. In keeping with their high-fashion kit, this result was coloured with a blush of pink relief.\n\n“Very happy with the points. Very happy with the spirit. Very happy with something that represents the spirit of the team – Romelu Lukaku’s sliding tackle after 50 metres running back to help the team,” noted Mourinho. His comments emphasised how much graft was required to get this particular result over the line.\n\nChelsea go top after Eden Hazard’s irrepressible hat-trick sees off Cardiff Read more\n\n“I am a bit frustrated because we had everything in the first half to win the game. Then we stopped being aggressive with and without the ball, gave them a chance to be reborn and give us a difficult match.”\n\nWatford’s qualities showed their flying start to the season has been no fluke. Their state of blissful cohesion – so in the groove Javi Gracia has not felt the need to tinker with their starting XI at all so far – created a feelgood factor that was tangible.\n\nThe stage was set for teams in slightly different moods to trade opportunities, to chase chances, to make the difference. Full commitment was on show. When one attack fell to Abdoulaye Doucouré, his shot shuddered straight into Marouane Fellaini’s block. It was a moment when you almost winced for the ball, caught as it was between two giants competing so earnestly.\n\nThe game ebbed and flowed until United forced the issue and found a breakthrough in the 35th minute. It all started with a free-kick, won when Jesse Lingard was hauled back by Étienne Capoue. A scruffy affair ended up with Ashley Young’s whipped pass catching out Watford’s defence. The ball brushed Lukaku’s torso and drifted past Ben Foster and in. A goal off the stomach? They all count.\n\nUnited suddenly slipped through the gears and had a period during which they really sparkled. The second goal was delivered by Chris Smalling, who cushioned the ball on his chest before swivelling to slam the ball home.\n\nMourinho’s touchline celebration was vigorous. “We trained the corner during the week and the best thing that can happen to coaches is you train and then see it happen during a match.”\n\nDuring the 15-minute spell leading up to half-time Paul Pogba did his utmost to extend United’s lead with three dazzling attempts. Foster had to impress to keep the deficit at two.\n\nThis was a huge test of Watford’s newly honed spirit. But their task was made even more complicated by United coming back out after the break intent first and foremost on staying solid. Pogba swaggered. Lukaku maintained a physical presence. Fellaini protected.\n\nWatford 1-2 Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nMourinho had particular praise for the latter: “We made defensive mistakes against Brighton and Tottenham – six goals [conceded], and then go to two difficult matches away at Burnley and Watford. I felt my central defenders in this moment of instability need somebody to support them, to give them the first wall. Marouane is giving us more than that, also quality and simplicity in his football.”\n\nIn fairness to Watford their endeavour and approach in trying to build positive football did not let up even if the barrier was a difficult one to overcome. They were rewarded with a foothold back into the game, engineered by a smart passing move which culminated in the excellent Doucouré shimmying and picking out a perfect reverse pass for Andre Gray to plant past De Gea.\n\nWatford came again, and a warning light flashed for United when Smalling nudged at Troy Deeney as he looked to make inroads in the penalty area. Once upon a time a 2-0 lead for a Mourinho team was a dead game but this was prised back open, chances cropping up at both ends.\n\nIn the dying moments Nemanja Matic was sent off for clattering Will Hughes, and from the free-kick De Gea took centre stage to keep out Christian Kabasele’s header. It was not to be for Watford but Gracia was proud of his team’s attitude and direction. “The most important [thing] was we made a very big effort. If we have to lose we have to lose this way – fighting until the end, showing our spirit and character – our fans have to be proud of us. I think the players did that.”"}, {"date": "02/09/2018", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 32316, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sol Bamba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kadeem Harris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Peltier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kenneth Zohore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Paterson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Greg Cunningham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Madine", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brian Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sokratis Papastathopoulos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Guendouzi", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [81], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Torreira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephan Lichtsteiner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Holding", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernd Leno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It was a thrilling game, full of goals and riddled with mistakes, and by the end of it Unai Emery must have breathed a sigh of relief as he clenched his fist to celebrate a second successive victory. After all the talk of a new era this was like watching the Arsenal of old as some terrific attacking football was undermined by familiar defensive frailties on an afternoon when Petr Cech strayed close to becoming a danger to his own team.\n\nCech, quite simply, is not comfortable enough with the ball at his feet to adapt to the style of play Emery is demanding from him and on another day Arsenal would have been punished for the mess their 36-year-old goalkeeper got himself in at times. To compound matters, the defenders in front of Cech did little to instil confidence against a Cardiff team who registered their first Premier League goals of the season and came close to snatching a point in the 90th minute.\n\nMesut Özil orchestrates for Arsenal – but can offer so much more Read more\n\nNow for the good news for Arsenal. Things are starting to click at the other end of the pitch, where Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette scored their first goals of the season and produced some lovely link-up play, in particular with the way they combined for Arsenal’s second. Shkodran Mustafi got Arsenal’s other goal with a thunderous header from a set piece, to set the tone for one of those games when the art of defending seemed to go out of the window.\n\nAlthough Cardiff never pressed the self-destruct button in the same way that Arsenal did by repeatedly trying to play out from the back, Neil Warnock was left to rue the goals they conceded. Sol Bamba allowed Mustafi to get away from him for the first and gave Lacazette too much room to thump home the third. Although Aubameyang’s goal in between those two was a beautifully placed shot, Sean Morrison may well reflect that he could have done more to close the forward down.\n\nGenerally, though, there was plenty of encouragement for Cardiff to take from a match in which they twice came from behind to peg Arsenal back. Warnock told his players he “didn’t want to park the bus” and that approach came close to paying off as Danny Ward scored Cardiff’s second with an excellent header and Bobby Reid, his strike partner, stretched Arsenal with his pace.\n\nCardiff, though, were also helped by the sight of Cech panicking within 30 seconds of the kick-off as he got in a tangle dealing with a backpass. There was another awkward moment for him to endure before a calamitous error in the seventh minute when he passed the ball straight to Harry Arter. The Cardiff midfielder blazed profligately over the bar but Cech’s unease was obvious to everyone in the stadium. “We had to get the crowd going and that’s how we did it,” Warnock said.\n\nPlay Video 0:59 Cardiff's Neil Warnock after 3-2 loss to Arsenal: 'I don't want to park the bus' – video\n\nEmery tried to encourage Cech in the moments afterwards but it is hard to escape the feeling that his tactics are an accident waiting to happen with the former Chelsea player in goal. “He has experience. He is intelligent. He is doing like we want to do, to adapt,” Arsenal’s manager said. “If you play every time long balls, you’ve lost your personality. We take in this moment in the match a little risk but, when you break their pressing, you can find space for attacking the opposition.”\n\nMustafi’s bullet header from Granit Xhaka’s corner five minutes later was just what Arsenal needed but they failed to build on that lead. Although Lacazette hit the post, Cardiff responded well to going behind and got their reward on the stroke of half-time. Xhaka carelessly gave away possession with a wayward pass and there was an alarming lack of conviction from the Arsenal defence when it came to dealing with Joe Bennett’s cross, leaving Victor Camarasa free to thump home at the far post.\n\nArsenal then restored their advantage with the goal of the game. Mesut Özil, returning to the starting lineup, threaded a pass into the feet of Lacazette, whose clever flick found Aubameyang. With Morrison retreating, Aubameyang shifted the ball on to his right foot and curled a splendid shot into the corner from 18 yards.\n\nArsenal being Arsenal there was always likely to be another twist and so it proved. Bennett’s free-kick picked out Morrison, who towered above Ramsey to nod across goal for the unmarked Ward to send a superb header in off the post. Arsenal, to their credit, responded again. Lucas Torreira, who impressed as a second-half substitute, released Lacazette and the Frenchman thrashed a rising shot inside the near post. Morrison then squandered an opportunity to equalise at the end, when he headed over after Cech had gone walkabout.

Marcus Rashford received a straight red card within 10 minutes of coming on for pressing his head into Phil Bardsley and Paul Pogba had a penalty saved by Joe Hart. After the events of recent weeks, Mourinho will consider these minor drawbacks.\n\nJosé Mourinho dedicates Manchester United’s victory to Ed Woodward Read more\n\nThe only sound during a respectfully observed minute’s silence for Jimmy McIlroy, the late Burnley legend whose funeral was held at Turf Moor on Friday, was the drone of a plane circling overhead. “Ed Woodward a specialist in failure” read the banner trailing behind it, the protest paid for by a United fans’ group called “A Voice from the Terrace”. The voice from the away section at Burnley was loud and unified as the travelling support chanted Mourinho’s name throughout.\n\nUnited’s manager acknowledged the welcome show of support, although even his most ardent admirers must find it bewildering that a coach who has enjoyed so much success from a solid, defensive base has a centre-half pairing of Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelöf in his third season at the club. Of course, it would have been different had Mourinho got his wish for a new central defender in the summer but, with Lindelöf and the substitute Eric Bailly bought on his watch, the blame cannot be pinned entirely on United’s vice-chairman.\n\nFortunately for those wearing garish pink, Burnley lacked the pace and quality to stretch the United defence as Tottenham did at Old Trafford on Monday. In Lukaku and Alexis Sánchez, the visitors also had the strength and ingenuity to continue Burnley’s difficult start to the new campaign.\n\nSean Dyche made four changes to the team that exited the Europa League at the play-off stage against Olympiakos on Thursday. The search for fresh energy and the defensive discipline of last season was fruitless, however. Burnley have not won a game inside 90 minutes since April, a sequence that now stands at 15 matches, and they were on the back foot from the first whistle here as United controlled possession and the tempo of the contest with ease. Jesse Lingard had three shots at Joe Hart’s goal in the opening 10 minutes alone but was unable to find the target. Burnley’s reprieve only ever felt temporary.\n\nPlay Video 1:05 'Some of you must be disappointed': Mourinho takes swipe at media after win – video\n\nSánchez has struggled to justify United’s heavy investment so far but showed here what an influential figure he can and should be for Mourinho’s team with a commanding display on the left. The breakthrough stemmed from a delightful cross by the Chile international who collected Luke Shaw’s pass outside the Burnley penalty area and swept the ball with the outside of his boot over the head of Ben Mee. Lukaku, taking a crucial step away from the Burnley defender, was perfectly placed to beat Hart with a powerful close-range header.\n\nLukaku almost doubled United’s lead minutes later following an incisive one-two with Sánchez but the former Manchester City goalkeeper produced a fine save to thwart the Belgium international. The Belgium striker did get his second of the game, and third of the season, when fortune favoured the visitors on the stroke of half-time. United can argue they merited the break after a fine flowing move saw Shaw and Sánchez link up once again to find Lukaku in the box. Lukaku teed up Lingard for a shot that struck Charlie Taylor, rebounded off the head of Ashley Westwood and dropped perfectly for the No 9 to sweep under Hart.\n\nCraig Cathcart heads Watford past Tottenham to maintain perfect start Read more\n\nUnited were comfortable without illuminating Turf Moor. This was a victory built on industry and flashes of inspiration from Sánchez rather than a great leap forward in performance, although the margin of success should have been far greater. The visitors were awarded a penalty for Aaron Lennon’s clumsy challenge on Rashford as the substitute attempted to turn inside the area. Paul Pogba approached the spot-kick with a slow, hesitant run but his effort was telegraphed for Hart who saved comfortably to his right. The routine looks cool when it ends with a penalty converted but self-indulgent and ill-advised when it does not.\n\nComposure deserted United in the minutes that followed, not least when Rashford invited his red card by foolishly pressing his forehead into Bardsley having been fouled by the Burnley right-back. The former United defender was undoubtedly the instigator of the flare-up, kicking out at the young striker off the pitch, but Rashford gave referee Jon Moss no option but to reach for red. He had been on the pitch for only 10 minutes.\n\nHart had a fine game against his old Manchester rivals and Lukaku in particular. He foiled the £90m forward again after he had brushed aside Mee to power into the penalty area. Lukaku also escaped both Mee and Hart only to be caught by the defender’s covering challenge and a possible push, but two late headers from Sam Vokes apart, United eased to an eventful, crucial and potentially restorative win."}, {"date": "02/09/2018", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20141, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [76], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [53], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Masina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ken Sema", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Lucas Moura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Mauricio Pochettino could not contain the frustration. The Tottenham manager had spent much of the time since last Monday’s 3-0 win at Manchester United warning his players that they could not be taken in by the result.\n\nThere was a difference, he said, between the perception that Spurs were flying and the reality that they could just as easily have lost at Old Trafford. They had not played well in the first half. The bottom line was that they had to impose themselves from the first whistle against Watford and remain strong throughout.\n\nThe message rang hollow after Spurs played, to quote Pochettino, as if the first half were a “friendly” and, after they had been handed the boost of a freakish Abdoulaye Doucouré own goal, they proceeded to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nIn short, as Pochettino made clear, Tottenham cannot be considered as Premier League title contenders on this evidence.\n\nWatford 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHis angst was Watford’s joy. They had been even worse in the first half, having attempted to match their better-heeled rivals in footballing terms. But they found the fire in their bellies after they fell behind. They bullied Tottenham on a couple of José Holebas set pieces, with first Troy Deeney and then Craig Cathcart meting out the punishment with fine headers.\n\nTo the delight of Elton John, who sat in the posh seats, and every one of their other supporters, it was Watford rather than Tottenham who maintained their 100% start to the season. It is four wins out of four for them in the league and, for the first time since 1987, Watford triumphed in this fixture.\n\n“It’s so painful to concede two goals like we did and it’s so painful that the first half looks like a friendly,” Pochettino said. “We needed to go out there like a lion. But it was like: ‘OK, we play football, we play football.’ Show aggression!\n\n“When you score, you keep going, playing the same way but we started to change and play long balls. Then we conceded two goals that if you want to be a contender, you cannot concede. You need to show your strength. The reality is that if you want to be a contender, today we needed to win. And win easily because everything was ready to win the game.\n\n“We need to show more respect to this competition and compete much, much better. It’s difficult for me to understand. It was very painful. I think it’s a good wake-up call for everyone.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Troy Deeney heads Watford’s equaliser. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nWatford’s best-ever start to a top-flight campaign goes on and they will now have the international break to bask in what they have achieved. Having beaten Brighton, Burnley and Crystal Palace, they knew that Tottenham would represent a test from a higher level. Despite being below their best until the Doucouré blunder, they passed it.\n\n“We just went away from our game,” Deeney said. “We tried to out-football them and made silly mistakes. But we cause people problems, we are big lumps and people don’t like it.”\n\nDeeney is one of the biggest lumps and he helped to spark Watford after the own goal. Having won a shuddering shoulder-to-shoulder challenge with Davinson Sánchez, he crossed and Toby Alderweireld’s diving header back across his own goal beat Michel Vorm only to come back off the top of the far post.\n\nWatford sensed there was something in this for them and their goals were marked by more than Holebas’s fiendish delivery from first a free-kick and then a corner. Deeney and Cathcart simply wanted it more than their markers who, it had to be said, resembled a sorry bunch.\n\nLukaku double gives Manchester United victory but Rashford sees red at Burnley Read more\n\nThe first half was dull, with Tottenham in control but never truly stretching Watford, despite the occasional flickers from Lucas Moura and Dele Alli. The latter looped a header off target after fastening on to a high Alderweireld ball, with Ben Foster off his line, while he also threatened when Christian Eriksen whipped in a cross following a short free-kick routine. Alli touched wide and he was relieved when the offside flag went up.\n\nThere was just one shot on target before the interval and it was entirely reflective that it was a tame pea-roller from Deeney in stoppage time. He had earlier headed over from Daryl Janmaat’s cross.\n\nThe breakthrough goal followed an Alli chip into the box and a poor clearing header from the otherwise impressive Christian Kabasele. It reached only Lucas on the right and what followed seemed to unfold in slow motion. His cross was cut slightly backwards of square; it thumped into Doucouré, who was running back to goal, and spun inside the near post, agonisingly out of Foster’s reach.\n\nWatford roused themselves in spectacular fashion, igniting the atmosphere in the process. Andre Gray snatched at an opening from the edge of the area and, after Kabasele had cut out a low Harry Kane cross with Lucas in space behind him, Watford drove the comeback.\n\nTottenham almost snatched a draw at the end when Kane hung in the air to meet Kieran Trippier’s cross only to head high.

We have to learn to use him in the right way. Play the pass at the right moment.\n\n“Joe Gomez could have cleared the situation and then Virgil [van Dijk] for sure could have done it.

Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nKlopp said the way the match unfolded after that gave him encouragement that his players had learned their lesson, especially Alisson. “His reaction was interesting. We still used him in the right situations and the crowd tried to make him nervous but he wasn’t.”\n\nThe pre-match indications had been that this would be Liverpool’s most stringent test of the season to date and so it proved. They had hinted at fragility against Brighton and Leicester had the smarts to probe awkwardly for weaknesses even without the suspended Jamie Vardy.\n\nIn recognition of the threat posed by Leicester, Klopp made his first alteration to the starting XI this season, fielding Jordan Henderson instead of Naby Keïta in midfield. Klopp is well aware that if Liverpool are to fulfil their quest for the Premier League title, they must offer more than devastating offensive storms. They must also show stability. Keïta is no flake but Klopp suggested Henderson was fresher for this duel. The change, however, deprived Liverpool of the midfield thrust Keïta has added since his keenly anticipated arrival in the summer.\n\nAny concerns looked unfounded early on. Liverpool cut through their hosts after four minutes and should have capitalised with a goal. Firmino was denied by Kasper Schmeichel after a lovely pass by Mohamed Salah, then Salah botched the rebound, sidefooting wide from eight yards.\n\nKyle Walker strikes winner to help Manchester City maintain solid start Read more\n\nLiverpool made amends three minutes later. Andy Robertson ran through Nampalys Mendy down the left before crossing for Mané, who stabbed into the net from seven yards.\n\nFor the next 15 minutes Leicester looked helpless, unable to touch the ball as Liverpool circulated it with almost regal splendour. Test? This was a doddle.\n\nBut then Leicester got to grips with them. Alisson had to make a good save from Gray in the 22nd minute and for the next 20 minutes the deft interplay between Ghezzal, Demarai Gray and James Maddison flustered the visitors, while Ben Chilwell made regular incursions down the left. Now Liverpool lacked control in midfield and Klopp made vexed gestures from the sidelines. Those pre-match concerns were justified.\n\nA goal on the stroke of half-time was what Liverpool needed – and Leicester were sickened by how easily they got it. After Schmeichel pushed a shot by Salah out for a corner, James Milner delivered an outswinging cross and Firmino did not even have to jump to meet it, giving Maddison the slip before guiding a downward header into the net. “We lost concentration,” said Claude Puel.\n\nLeicester took the fight harder to Liverpool from the start of the second half.

Aleksandar Mitrovic has nothing to apologise for after his inexplicable handball cost Fulham two points against Brighton. The in-form striker was under little pressure when he conceded a penalty with six minutes remaining at the Amex Stadium, allowing Glenn Murray to convert and snatch a 2-2 draw for the hosts.\n\nThe Serbia international looked to have put his side on course for victory on the south coast after his fourth Premier League goal in four games added to Andre Schürrle’s opener. But Brighton, who missed a first-half spot-kick through Pascal Gross, battled back thanks to Murray’s double, which included the late penalty.\n\n“He didn’t need to ask for any apologies. I interpret it as bad luck, a mistake,” Jokanovic said of Mitrovic’s infringement. “He knows. I don’t need to explain to him that he doesn’t need to touch the ball in this situation. At the end, he’s a strong enough lad to keep going, he made one mistake, OK.\n\nDanny Ings stuns Crystal Palace as Southampton claim first league win Read more\n\n“And from another side, he scored the goal, he was fighting really well, he played at the level like he started in the Premier League and I don’t want to complain and point the finger at my player, I cannot find any sense [in doing so].”\n\nFulham would have been only the fifth team to leave the Amex with three top-flight points. They looked like joining Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Leicester in that exclusive club when Schürrle finished a superb pass from Jean Michaël Seri minutes before the break and Mitrovic dispossessed Lewis Dunk to finish at the second attempt in the 62nd minute.\n\nThey were unable to hold on, though, and Murray – 35 this month – halved the deficit with a shot which squirmed through the legs of the visiting goalkeeper, Marcus Bettinelli, before smashing home his second from the spot.\n\nJokanovic admitted to having conflicting feelings about letting the two-goal advantage slip. The Fulham manager said: “We have some mixed sensations. At the end, we must be satisfied after winning our first point away from home in the Premier League. In the first hour, we showed personality, we were solid, we were waiting for our chance and scored the goal, scored the second too.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andre Schürrle opens the scoring for the visitors. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Reuters\n\n“At the end, we made some sloppy mistakes and paid an expensive price. Being unsatisfied after winning our first point in the Premier League away from home shows our ambition.”\n\nChris Hughton was pleased with the fightback but rued his side’s profligacy. The Seagulls began the game brightly and, after Gross’s 25th-minute penalty was kept out by Bettinelli following Luciano Vietto’s foul on Murray, Solly March squandered an excellent opportunity at 1-0.\n\n“Irrespective of any balance of play or chances, when you’re 2-0 down in the Premier League, I think to come back from that there are certainly more positives than negatives,” the Brighton manager said.\n\n“I think it’s still relief because when you’re 2-0 down, on the law of averages, are you going to come back from that? Probably, the answer is no. But definitely we deserved it. If our game had been a little bit more clinical, then it’s a game we would have won.”"}, {"date": "01/09/2018", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 40178, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Kepa Arrizabalaga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [33], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jorginho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mateo Kovacic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [72], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Jefferson Lerma", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [20], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Rico Salguero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Brooks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Maurizio Sarri has been at pains to insist Chelsea are a work in progress under his stewardship to date and, for large periods of this contest, he would have taken little delight in appearing to be proved right. Yet, a month into the new campaign, his team’s perfect record remains intact, his players are familiarising themselves with his demands and each of their victories is being decorated by the brilliance of the man they might have lost.\n\nEden Hazard, having accepted any move to Real Madrid will have to wait, is already thriving under the new regime. His scuttling energy was never quelled by a well-drilled Bournemouth team and, if teammates are still finding their feet, he has hit the ground running. He remains the player who spreads panic among opponents and sets this side’s tone. “I’m confident, I’m enjoying my football, we have a new manager and lots of good players,” offered the Belgian before taking his children on to the turf for a post-match kickabout. “And I know when I play good, the team play good.”\n\nAlisson’s blushes spared as Liverpool edge to nervy win at Leicester Read more\n\nAt present he is playing well, and, if not quite with the desired fluency as yet, they are too. Sarri’s decision to leave the 27-year-old among the substitutes until late in the wins over Huddersfield and Arsenal, with one eye on his exertions deep into the World Cup, had felt risky at the time, but such caution is paying off already. He looks refreshed and eager to impress, a player who demands the ball and is happy to play a 40-yard pass and then scurry upfield in support of his teammate to collect a return.\n\nHazard’s combination play with Marcos Alonso has lost none of its precision from the last two years, as evidenced near the end as they exchanged passes on the corner of the Bournemouth penalty area with the forward skipping on to the Spaniard’s return. His finish was fizzed low and through Asmir Begovic to complete the victory and ensure the last few minutes were devoid of anxiety. The tension had long since been lanced.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri. Photograph: AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images\n\nAlonso, too, warranted praise. The left-back is exposed defensively at times but he has won two penalties, provided a pair of assists and scored a goal himself in this first batch of Premier League matches. Sarri described him as “maybe the best left-back in Europe”, before adding: “If he improves in the defensive phase, he could be the best left-back in the world.” Bournemouth might argue a player who had already been booked for a foul on Adam Smith could actually have been shown a second yellow for deliberately delaying the same player’s attempt to take a quick throw-in just before Chelsea made the game safe.\n\nIn truth, their frustrations lay elsewhere. So effectively had they performed from the outset that, aside from Alonso scuffing a right-foot shot on to the post in stoppage time at the end of the first half, the visitors boasted a measure of control for more than an hour. Flurries of frustration were starting to flit around the ground and the most threatening openings had been theirs, whether eked out from Diego Rico’s centre towards Callum Wilson, beyond back-tracking centre-halves, or from the same player’s second-half corner which reached Nathan Aké in the six-yard box. Both opportunities were skied high and wide on the half volley, to leave Bournemouth saddled by a sense of dread as to what might follow.\n\nAdama Traoré strike in injury time earns Wolves victory at West Ham Read more\n\nAs soon as the hosts drummed up some tempo to their passing, they were rewarded. A flowing move, all pinged close passes through the middle with Bournemouth momentarily slack in closing space, culminated in the substitutes, Pedro and Olivier Giroud, combining just outside the visitors’ penalty area. Pedro’s shot flicked from Steve Cook to veer beyond Begovic into the corner.\n\n“A cruel deflection,” said Eddie Howe. “Chelsea are a different team this year, with a totally different way of playing, and they’ll improve as the season goes on.” His own side’s resilience, even in defeat, was still encouraging.\n\nYet the real optimism lies in this corner of south-west London. On four of the last five occasions Chelsea have won their first four league fixtures, they have gone on to claim the title. Sarri was dismissive of any talk of a repeat, the instinctive caution kicking back in with reminders that this group finished 30 points off the top last season, but everything about their start has been promising.\n\nPerhaps there is still a little too much reliance on Hazard but leaning on a world-class talent is no chore when he delivers form this dazzling. Most worrying for the rest is the acceptance, from inside and outside the club, that they will get better as the campaign progresses. “We can improve,” added Sarri. “We will improve.” Even now, the

would have happened had Wilfried Zaha been fit to play in this game? Would his appearance have lifted a subdued Selhurst Park crowd? Would his presence have given confidence to teammates who otherwise struggled? More specifically, might he have tucked away one or even all the good chances that fell to his colleague Christian Benteke? Or would a combative Southampton, who very much deserved this victory, have turned Palace over all the same?\n\nZaha failed a fitness test hours before this match after tweaking his groin in training on Friday. In his absence, a poacher’s finish from Danny Ings and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg’s breakaway goal gave Saints their first league win of the season. In turn, it meant Palace continued an astonishing run: it’s now nearly two years since they last won without their talisman in the team.\n\nPedro and Hazard help Chelsea beat Bournemouth to maintain 100% record Read more\n\nRoy Hodgson rarely gives much credence to statistics or streaks. He believes his players shouldn’t need Zaha to win. But even he had to acknowledge that the numbers look telling: 707 days since the last win without him, the last 12 of those matches defeats.\n\n“Of course I’m aware of the record, but I’m not sure what I can do about it,” he said. “Until we win without Wilf everyone will be entitled to bring it up and beat the rest of the squad over the head with the paper bag carrying that record. It’s a fact: he didn’t play again and we didn’t win. We have to work very hard to put that fact and situation behind us because there will be games when he doesn’t play.”\n\nFrom Mark Hughes’s point of view, he said he didn’t discuss Zaha’s absence with his players “to any great extent”. That sounded like an acknowledgement that he had, and it must surely have given Southampton’s players a boost. But the manager didn’t want the chat to drift too far from the performance of his team. “In hindsight I don’t know if he would have made much difference,” Hughes said. “The way we played, even he would have struggled to get a foothold in the game.”\n\nSouthampton certainly set about the match with a greater level of performance, that much both coaches admitted. Fielding a side unchanged from their home defeat to Leicester, Saints looked compact and forceful in a 4-4-2 formation, Danny Ings and Shane Long on each other’s wavelength up front. The best chance of the first half fell to the former, his cute volley from the edge of the area blocked from going in by the latter.\n\nNo matter. Ings opened the scoring within two minutes of the restart, poking through Wayne Hennessey’s legs after a cross from the halfway line by Cédric Soares had caught out Palace’s centre-halves (distracted by a dummy run from Long). A quarter of an hour later and Southampton should have had two but Charlie Austin, on for a hobbling Long, put his penalty straight at Hennessey after Aaron Wan-Bissaka had handballed.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin rescues point for tepid Everton against Huddersfield Read more\n\nThen there was Benteke. The giant Belgian has been struggling for form for almost as long as Palace have been reliant on Zaha and he missed one one-on-one chance and two headers – one from point-blank range – as Palace battled to get back in the match. “I can’t fault him for effort or desire and he’s certainly not hiding,” said Hodgson of the £26m striker who has two goals in 2018. “But we’re still waiting for that happy day when one goes in.”\n\nSaints made the matter academic with a second goal in added time. It was another early cross, this time from the substitute Matt Targett, which was turned home by Højbjerg. It capped a strong performance from him and quite a few of the visiting team hit levels higher than their fans have become accustomed to in recent times. “I just thought it was a really good, solid away performance,” said Hughes.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email."}, {"date": "01/09/2018", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38767, "home_team": {"name": "Everton",

The substitute came closest to conjuring a winning goal in the second half when his cross was almost touched in by Gylfi Sigurdsson, though that is not to suggest a player on loan at RB Leipzig last season proved a point or confirmed the wisdom of Everton keeping hold of him.\n\nThe only reason for mentioning him is that the cheer when he took to the field was easily the biggest of the second half, which says everything about the mundanity of what went before. Huddersfield were worth their point here, they are well organised defensively and often dangerous when breaking quickly on the counter. They can cope with opponents like Everton all day because Marco Silva’s side seem to have forgotten how to create any danger at all.\n\nAlisson’s blushes spared as Liverpool edge to nervy win at Leicester Read more\n\nWith even local heroes such as Séamus Coleman and Tom Davies surrendering possession with aimless, unreadable passes the quick, slick football the new manager wants to see was conspicuous by its absence.\n\n“The communication and the understanding was there, we deserved a point,” David Wagner said, unintentionally putting his finger on what was missing from Everton’s performance. “With a little more calmness on the ball we might have done even better.”\n\nSilva, meanwhile, accepted his side had been below par. “We found it tough,” he said. “We have to put more creativity into our game, we have the quality to do different things.”\n\nTwo goals in two minutes livened up a first half that was sorely in need of life. Before Philip Billing put the visitors ahead just past the half-hour there had been nothing to stir the crowd, just two teams passing the ball around painfully slowly and failing to come up with anything inventive or threatening.\n\nSome within the stadium might even have been asleep by the time Huddersfield took the lead from a corner. While that does not necessarily include the Everton defence, questions will have to be asked about how a 6ft 4in beanpole came to be allowed a free header on the six-yard line.\n\nChris Löwe’s cross was touched on instead of cleared at the near post, and standing right in front of the goalkeeper Billing reacted quickly to steer the ball past Jordan Pickford.\n\nEverton could not complain after 34 minutes of insipid football, though to everyone’s surprise they responded almost immediately, Lucas Digne crossing from the left after a mistake by Adama Diakhaby for Dominic Calvert-Lewin to head across Jonas Lössl and find the bottom right corner.\n\nThe goalkeeper got a touch on the ball with his outstretched left hand, though not a firm enough one to keep the header out.\n\nThe goals were created by left-backs, which was at least appropriate for a game dedicated to the memory of Ray Wilson, who played with distinction for both these clubs.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Philip Billing opens the scoring.

With Cenk Tosun putting a late, difficult chance over the bar from Oumar Niasse’s hooked cross, the home side’s only accurate effort all afternoon was the goal they scored in the first half.\n\nThe noise at the end came from the travelling support, happy to pick up an away point.

The Wolves winger has rarely been noted for his composure in the final third and it was difficult to shake off the suspicion he would fluff his lines when he ran through in the third of four added minutes.\n\nYet he kept his focus and fired a low shot past Lukasz Fabianski, sparking delirious scenes in the away end and a mass exodus in the home sections. Wolves had their first victory in the Premier League and, by leaving it so late, Nuno Espírito Santo’s jubilant side deepened Manuel Pellegrini’s growing unease.\n\nThis is the first time West Ham have lost their opening four fixtures since 2010-11 and it will not have escaped their attention that they finished that campaign in 20th place, relegated with a game to spare and wondering what on earth possessed them to hire Avram Grant as their manager.\n\nDanny Ings stuns Crystal Palace as Southampton claim first league win Read more\n\nPellegrini, of course, has a much better track record than Grant and it remains difficult to envisage the Chilean leading West Ham into a survival scrap. Yet the Chilean’s new side already find themselves in an awkward position: bottom of the league despite spending £100m on nine players in the summer. They walked off to boos after yet another demoralising afternoon at the London Stadium. “We need to reduce the amount of mistakes,” Pellegrini said.\n\nThe problem for West Ham is they might have to wait a while before they get off the mark. They will have visited Everton and hosted Chelsea and Manchester United by the end of September and Pellegrini will be confronted by a major crisis if he cannot inspire an improvement soon.\n\nPellegrini did not attempt to defend this uneven performance. West Ham had secured their first competitive win under him earlier in the week, fighting back from a goal down to beat AFC Wimbledon in the Carabao Cup, but they failed to muster any intensity in the first half and Wolves had already spurned a couple of glorious opportunities before Traoré scored his first goal since his £18m move from Middlesbrough last month.\n\nThe home fans had roared during the early stages, sensing Wolves were vulnerable when Felipe Anderson forced Rui Patrício to make a fine save in the fourth minute. Yet it was a flawed start from both sides and Anderson’s influence quickly waned. The visitors refused to be cowed after that early flurry and they were dangerous on the right, taking advantage of Michail Antonio’s failure to protect Aaron Cresswell.\n\nBuoyed by holding Manchester City at Molineux last weekend, Wolves looked slick in their 3-4-2-1 system and it was not long before they heard the first rumblings of dissent from the stands. The groans were audible as West Ham conceded possession with alarming regularity.\n\nPellegrini paid Wolves a compliment by replacing Robert Snodgrass with Andriy Yarmolenko during the interval. The change led to a brief period of improvement, Patrício clawing Antonio’s looping header away after a cross from the Ukrainian.\n\nYet while Yarmolenko saw a goalbound volley blocked by the excellent Conor Coady with 20 minutes remaining, it would be pushing it to say that West Ham dominated the second half. Wolves had their moments because they kept attacking. “It is special for the boys because we didn’t change since day one last season,” Espírito Santo said. “I don’t know any other way to play football. When it is in your character to want to achieve things, you have to believe.”\n\nPedro and Hazard help Chelsea beat Bournemouth to maintain 100% record Read more\n\nWhen Raúl Jiménez tore down the left, Leo Bonatini looked certain to score. Fabianski sped from his line to deny the substitute, however, and West Ham would breathe another sigh of relief when Jiménez tripped over his own feet after being released by Rúben Neves.\n\nWolves survived a scare when Patrício denied Arnautovic and they pounced when West Ham took a quick free-kick near their own box, with Carlos Sánchez guilty of dawdling on the ball. Neves and Bonatini combined to release Traoré and his shot was too powerful for Fabianski.\n\n“We need to defend better and score more goals,” Pellegrini said.

Vincent Kompany took a microphone to tell the crowd “this is just the beginning” and, ultimately, it was another freewheeling win for the reigning champions to usher in their first decade of Abu Dhabi ownership.\n\nNo surprise, either, given that Newcastle’s record at this stadium is so calamitous. This was their 10th successive league defeat on this ground and, for City, that equals a club record going back to the 1930s when they did the same to Wolves. Newcastle have conceded 34 goals in the process and the differing fortunes of these clubs could be explained via the songbooks of the two sets of supporters. From the home fans, there were tributes to the sheikh to mark the 10th anniversary of his takeover. As for Newcastle’s followers, their discord manifested itself in mutinous chants against Mike Ashley, a very different kind of owner.\n\nManchester City 2-1 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWorse sides have visited this stadium but not many have played with such a lack of adventure. It was disappointing that Rafael Benítez’s team offered so little, attacking-wise, once DeAndre Yedlin’s equaliser had offered Newcastle hope on the back of Raheem Sterling’s early goal.\n\nNewcastle held their own in the first half but, such is the lopsided nature of the Premier League, it did not matter greatly in the end that City’s performance rarely ventured above six out of 10. They could afford to have an off day when the opposition was so inferior and the narrow margin of victory felt like a deception: this was a comfortable win once Kyle Walker had restored the home side’s lead with a firecracker of a shot early in the second half.\n\nGuardiola noted afterwards that while his team had defended “very, very bad” for Newcastle’s goal, they did not concede another meaningful chance against a side whose tactics were based entirely on playing on the counterattack. He also addressed the fact that Leroy Sané was left out of the squad, though if there is a problem between the two then Guardiola was reluctant to say what it was.\n\nSané has not started a single game so far this season, his only contributions being three substitute appearances, and his omission from the bench was apparently because Guardiola had detected slackness on the training ground.\n\nThe German struggled during a brief appearance in the 1-1 draw at Wolves last weekend but when Guardiola was asked if the player’s attitude was in question he denied the suggestion, stating it was simply a consequence of City’s squad size. “In the last game, Phil Foden was not in the squad and I was so sad for him, just as I’m so sad for Leroy.”\n\nInstead, Sterling was operating on City’s left wing, with Riyad Mahrez on the right and David Silva in the space directly behind Sergio Agüero and Gabriel Jesus. This was Sterling’s 100th league appearance for City and his goal was a fine finish, cutting inside Yedlin before aiming a diagonal shot past Martin Dubravka from the edge of the penalty area. Jamaal Lascelles, Newcastle’s captain, had given the ball away with a slack pass, and at this level no team can expect to get away with that kind of carelessness.\n\nDanny Ings stuns Crystal Palace as Southampton claim first league win Read more\n\nAfter that, Newcastle might well have been surprised by how few problems they encountered through the rest of the first half. Again, they spent long periods pinned in their own half, just as they did against Chelsea last weekend. There were, however, encouraging signs for Benítez’s team on the few occasions when they did venture forward and their new striker Salomón Rondón looked eager to impress, laying on the decisive pass for their 29th-minute equaliser.\n\nRondón had picked out Yedlin’s run to the far post and when his low delivery went through John Stones’s legs there were no other defenders in position. Instead, it was Jesus, a striker, trying to catch Yedlin inside the penalty area. Yedlin reached the ball first and City were punished for their disorganisation.\n\nIt was unusual to see City looking as lethargic as they did in the opening half and Jesus, in particular, found it difficult before his substitution after 56 minutes. City, in short, looked like they missed Kevin De Bruyne, but a wonderful shot from Walker from 30 yards out put them back in front, fizzing the ball into the bottom corner for his first Manchester City goal.\n\nBenítez might reflect that his goalkeeper should not have been beaten from that distance.

He still heard his name being sung and at the final whistle Old Trafford was not too unkind on the manager or his players. He milked it, too, marching over to the Stretford End to thank them for their generosity. Yet the ground was half-empty by that stage and the mass walkout, after the third goal, was probably a better reflection of Manchester United’s night.\n\nThis is the first time England’s biggest club have lost two of their opening three fixtures for more than a quarter of a century and, to put it into context, that is as many defeats as Manchester City encountered during the previous title-winning campaign in its entirety. The last time it happened, at the start of the 1992-93 season, Sir Alex Ferguson recovered to win the league. But who, realistically, could imagine history repeating itself with today’s accident-prone team?\n\nJosé Mourinho demands ‘respect, respect, respect’ after Spurs defeat Read more\n\nThe problem for Mourinho is that chants of “you’re not special any more”, audible from the corner housing the victorious Tottenham Hotspur supporters, are threatening to become the soundtrack to United’s season.\n\nHe has never lost a home game so heavily at any of his clubs and was reduced afterwards to holding up three fingers, one for each goal, in the post-match press conference and asking his audience what else that number might signify. “Three-nil but also three Premier League titles,” he explained, eyes blazing. “I won more, alone, than the other 19 managers together. Three for me, two for them.”\n\nMourinho wanted “respect” and made that point very loudly, repeating the same word over and again, as he stomped out.\n\nPlay Video 0:29 José Mourinho demands reporters show him 'respect' after Manchester United defeat – video\n\nIt was some performance, even by Mourinho’s standards, but his argument was undermined by the simple fact that the season has not even reached September and the club’s title ambitions may already have suffered irretrievable damage. It is straying dangerously close to a crisis and, defensively, their second-half performance here was so wretched it was difficult to recall another 45-minute display when a Mourinho-managed side have looked so vulnerable.\n\nIn the process Spurs joined Liverpool, Chelsea and Watford as the only teams with an immaculate record from their opening three games. Mauricio Pochettino’s side took a while getting to grips with Mourinho’s new 3-3-3-1 formation but their improvement in the second half was rewarded with a brilliantly taken header from Harry Kane and two fine finishes from Lucas Moura.\n\nSpurs had lost their previous four visits to Old Trafford without scoring a goal but they took full advantage of United’s shortcomings and, on this evidence, Lucas can compensate, perhaps, for the club’s lack of summer signings. Pochettino made a point afterwards of thanking the scouting staff who had identified the Brazilian last season.\n\nAmid all the references to his previous trophies, Mourinho had a fair point when he argued that United were the better team in the first half. It would also be unfair to say their confidence looked broken. Yet Mourinho also admitted he did not know his best defence, prompting his decision to switch to the new formation.\n\nThat system had Ander Herrera, a central midfielder, operating as a right-back in a defence featuring recalls for Phil Jones and Chris Smalling. Antonio Valencia and Luke Shaw were deployed as wing-backs while Paul Pogba and Fred had modified roles either side of Jesse Lingard in the positions directly behind Romelu Lukaku. In total that meant half a dozen changes from the side that lost so abjectly at Brighton, with Anthony Martial not even warranting a place on the bench. Eric Bailly was also left out of the squad and Juan Mata was another notable by his absence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Romelu Lukaku rounded Hugo Lloris but was unable to find the empty net from a tight angle. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nMUTV, United’s in-house channel, was so confused by all the changes it announced before kick-off that Matic would be playing as a centre-half. Yet the home side started brightly and the night might have taken a different complexion entirely if Lukaku had been more clinical, a quarter of an hour in, when Danny Rose’s back-pass to Hugo Lloris fell short. A goal seemed inevitable once Lukaku had eluded Lloris but the striker had taken the ball wide and his diagonal shot, right to left, rolled wide of the far post.\n\nAccording to Mourinho, United should have been winning 3-0 at half-time. A more realistic view was that Spurs often looked dangerous despite being under concerted pressure, with Lucas, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli working busily in the spaces behind Kane. The away side might also have had a first-half penalty after Jones barged Lucas over and, after the break, it must have been startling for Mourinho to see how easily Spurs cut through his team.\n\nKane’s goal came from Kieran Trippier’s corner and a brilliant piece of centre-forward play to out-jump Jones, leaning back but keeping his eye on the ball, then bracing his neck muscles to direct a looping header past David de Gea.\n\nJosé Mourinho’s change of formation fails to live up to Spurs challenge | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nThe next goal arrived within two minutes, with Eriksen supplying the pass from the right and Lucas firing in a low shot; but an honorary mention should also go to Lloris for his save, at 1-0, to deny Lukaku an equaliser. Pochettino’s decision to retain Lloris as his captain will divide opinion, a few days after the goalkeeper was arrested on a drink-driving charge, but that save changed the course of the evening.\n\nMourinho brought on Alexis Sánchez and Marouane Fellaini to give his side more presence in attack. The ploy failed to work and Victor Lindelöf, who replaced the injured Jones, almost gave away another goal with a back-pass that Alli intercepted. De Gea saved that one but soon afterwards Kane sent Lucas running through the middle. Smalling’s challenge was weak and, when Lucas buried his shot, the night air was filled with the clanking of thousands of red plastic seats being emptied.

They will have taken particular pleasure in this scalp given how feisty meetings with Crystal Palace, and brushes with Wilfried Zaha in particular, have become in recent years.\n\nThe Ivory Coast forward’s influence has tended to decorate this fixture, whether winning key penalties or accruing bookings for perceived dives, and invariably driving Watford and their support to distraction.\n\nWatford v Crystal Palace: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThere was an inevitability he would leave a mark on this contest too with a rasped late consolation, ripped through Ben Foster, even if it was the manner in which Watford had sought to quell his threat that rather drew the focus.\n\nThe tone had been set in the opening four minutes when, with an ugly little jump and hardly any hope of reaching the ball from behind, Étienne Capoue raked Zaha’s achilles to leave him sprawled on the turf. The referee Anthony Taylor, only a few yards away and surely aware of recent history, instantly brandished a yellow card. Zaha would be cautioned himself within minutes for a follow-through on José Holebas – Daryl Janmaat escaped sanction for an arguably clumsier foul on Patrick van Aanholt seconds later – and has now been booked on each of his last four visits to Vicarage Road, yet his rather peripheral first-half showing suggested he had been unnerved by the earlier challenge.\n\nIt was a sinister way to start. Graeme Souness, working as a pundit for Sky and never averse to the odd bone-crunching warning tackle in his playing days, suggested Taylor had either “completely bottled it or he doesn’t understand football” by failing to produce a red card. “Capoue’s trying to hurt him badly,” he said. “There’s leaving a bit on someone and then there’s real malice and trying to injure someone for a really, really long time.”\n\nRoy Hodgson, at first glance impressed at the official’s eagerness to clamp down on rough treatment, changed his tune after seeing a replay of the incident. “At first glance when the referee jumped in and gave the yellow card, I thought that was good,” the Palace manager said.\n\n“He didn’t wait to give him a free hit. With hindsight, having seen the replays, he could have sanctioned him even harder. At the time I thought it was a bad challenge. I had no idea quite the degree of severity. But we have to get used to that. Players of Wilf’s match-winning ability do get targeted. He was targeted by that foul.”\n\nJavi Gracia, even post-match, was reluctant to comment on a challenge he had apparently yet to witness close-up.\n\nHe had reason not to dwell on the afternoon’s principal controversy. Watford had survived a sloppy first half, when Palace thrived in the greasy conditions as the rain poured down, courtesy of Foster’s excellence in goal. His saves from Christian Benteke and James McArthur, both via strong blocks with his outstretched right hand, maintained parity, and Watford’s bright start to the second period duly changed the complexion of the game. Abdoulaye Doucouré and Capoue grew into the contest, the latter bursting from deep inside his own territory and beyond McArthur and Milivojevic eight minutes after the break before shifting the ball on to Roberto Pereyra.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wayne Hennessey of Crystal Palace attempts to save the second goal scored by Jose Holebas. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nThe Argentinian has epitomised Watford’s bright start to the campaign, and his cut-back inside Ward and Andros Townsend was followed with a gloriously curled finish beyond the diving Wayne Hennessey into the far corner. It was his third goal of the season and a sumptuous finish, though the side would require greater breathing space to prevail. Holebas, again cutting inside Townsend, would provide it with a cross shot which arced gloriously – albeit possibly fortuitously – over Hennessey and Van Aanholt, retreating on to the goal-line, to nestle in the corner.\n\nWatford would survive Zaha’s riposte and Ward’s late chance to force an equaliser thereafter to nestle behind Liverpool and Chelsea at the top, with Gracia left to preach caution after an historic start. “We are enjoying the moment knowing it’s only the beginning,” he said. “You can see the table and our position but also the date and that there are many steps still to make.

There was little on but, losing Jeff Hendrick in one movement, he set his sights and sent an achingly clean 25-yard drive arrowing into Joe Hart’s top corner.\n\n“He’s great,” said Slavisa Jokanovic, whose five changes from a 3-1 defeat at Tottenham had looked a gamble. “He scored a fantastic goal, he fits well for the style of how we want to play football and he’s one of the guys who is important for our possession of the ball.”\n\nFulham’s control was jolted when Hendrick, finishing at the second attempt after they had been exposed by an Aaron Lennon-led counter, injected some life into Burnley’s heavy legs. But Fulham regained their composure quickly enough and, by half-time, a sodden afternoon’s other star turn had made his mark.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic’s two headers, the first from a tantalising Tom Cairney delivery that spun up beyond Hart and the second arising when Vietto was allowed a barely credible amount of time to cross, came within as many minutes of each other and were emphatically taken. The Serb led the line superbly throughout and would have been worth a hat-trick; James Tarkowski and Ben Mee never had the measure of him and Jokanovic was right in saying his performance disabused any notion that he is that common breed of nearly-man: too good for the second tier but not fit for the top flight.\n\n“Some people thought he can only be a Championship player but no, he’s showed his quality at the highest level,” Jokanovic said. “He’s a really important player for us, a young man who has huge room for improvement.”\n\nFor all the fine work of those further forward, Fulham’s defence falls into that latter bracket. They were undone again when Tarkowski, who looked offside, bundled in the game’s fifth goal shortly before half‑time and will surely suffer anew when better attacking units exploit the gaps they leave. Burnley failed to provide any further examination of that theory after the interval, instead finding themselves pulled apart on the break.\n\nAndré Schürrle, who had shot on sight all afternoon with wildly varying degrees of menace, eventually scored from his 11th attempt after Hart had tipped Mitrovic’s effort on to an upright. Doubts eliminated, Fulham could bask in their first win of the season.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nHow Burnley need three points of their own, whether on a Sunday afternoon or not, to ensure those concerns about their schedule avoid self-fulfilling. “Players get barraged now with news stories and it’s mostly negative about the Europa League and games and things like that,” Sean Dyche said. “But that’s the reality now: can we keep going in different competitions?” He might ask himself whether it really is worth finding out."}, {"date": "26/08/2018", "arena":

rain had a drearily English persistence about it but for long periods Maurizio Sarri must have felt convinced he was back in Serie A.\n\nRafael Benítez preceded Chelsea’s manager at Napoli and, clearly remembering that schooling in Catenaccio, very nearly succeeded in choreographing his Newcastle United side to a tactically astute draw against possession-monopolising visitors.\n\nInstead DeAndre Yedlin’s late own goal dictated that Sarri’s side boarded their return flight to London with three wins from three Premier League games. They stand second in the table, behind Liverpool on goal difference.\n\nAt the end of an afternoon enriched by Eden Hazard’s bewitching skills Chelsea’s win was arguably deserved but it still took a disputed penalty and that own goal to secure the three points.\n\nFive at the back may contradict Sarri’s football principles – a philosophy otherwise known as Sarri Ball – but Benítez had no compunction about deploying three centre-halves in an uber-defensive 5-4-1 formation.\n\nWith his captain, Jamaal Lascelles, and the playmaker Jonjo Shelvey apparently injured, this home starting XI featured debuts for Salomón Rondón, Fabian Schär, Ki Sung-yueng and Federico Fernández. Of that quartet Fernández, recruited from Swansea, shone at the back on what was turning into a day of denials.\n\nIn the morning Chelsea rebutted a report that Roman Abramovich wants to sell the club and, later, Benítez played down suggestions of a training‑ground row with Lascelles, reportedly over his refusal to offer his captain the sweeper role.\n\nWhile the cool, wet conditions were sufficiently unpleasant to prompt Newcastle’s manager – who maintains Lascelles has an ankle injury – to suppress his inner Geordie and take the rare step of wearing a coat, Sarri ignored the rain in a lightweight tracksuit and Tony Pulis-style baseball cap.\n\nThe conditions were ideal for Sarri Ball’s intense pressing and high defensive line but, with Newcastle closing down Chelsea with minimal regard for preserving personal space, this visiting system was unable to operate at anywhere near like maximum power.\n\nSarri acknowledges his tactics carry “risk” but the downside of Newcastle’s ultra-cautious configuration was that it frequently left Rondón and friends looking far too timid to get behind that high line.\n\nBenítez’s aim was to circumvent it courtesy of accurate counter-attacks yet on the two early occasions when Chelsea’s defence was breached, Jacob Murphy dispatched a cross into the arms of Kepa Arrizabalaga and then shot straight at the keeper when it would have been better to pass to his better placed captain, Paul Dummett.\n\nQuickfire Aleksandar Mitrovic at the double for Fulham to stun Burnley Read more\n\nAlthough Sarri’s players had the ball for 81% of the game they were not permitted sufficient room for manoeuvre to do too much of note with it.\n\nAdmittedly Jorginho was often impressive at the heart of their 4-3-3 formation and Hazard, making his first League appearance of the campaign following the World Cup, ran through a wonderful repertoire of dexterous ball manipulation, defender-spinning swivels and delicate touches but, tellingly, Martin Dubravka was largely underemployed in Newcastle’s goal.\n\nIndeed, while Álvaro Morata saw a shot deflected wide following a lovely one-two with Hazard and Pedro curved a miscued half-chance off target after dispossessing Ki, the best opening of the first half fell counter-attacking Newcastle’s way.\n\nIt came from a set piece and involved Matt Ritchie’s corner being half-cleared before being curled back into the box by Fernández. Rondón made a decent connection before dispatching a header wide when the West Brom loanee centre-forward really should have scored.\n\nHad the unloved Sam Allardyce or Alan Pardew presided over such apparently negative home tactics they would have doubtless been pilloried by Gallowgate Enders but Benítez can do no wrong – locals are convinced he is capable of walking on the Tyne – and, in truth, the coach who led Chelsea to Europa League triumph surely had his strategy spot on.\n\nPereyra and Holebas deliver historic win for Watford over Crystal Palace Read more\n\nWhile permitting Hazard and friends to strut their stuff might have made for a more entertaining spectacle, it would surely not have done too much for a Newcastle goal difference which, come the end of the season, could potentially prove the margin between survival and relegation.\n\nWith Fernández indicating Lascelles will have to fight for his place and even Hazard was unable to blow the black and white house down, things were proceeding to plan for a Benítez ensemble which menaced at dead balls.\n\nHuffing and puffing on the touchline, Sarri began pressing every available tactical button and replaced the ineffective Morata and Pedro with Olivier Giroud and Willian. The visiting tempo increased and Antonio Rüdiger hit the bar with a ferocious 30-yard shot before Marcos Alonso collapsed under Schär’s penalty-area challenge.\n\nChelsea manager Maurizio Sarri surprised by Newcastle United’s tactics Read more\n\nDespite Schär winning quite a lot of the ball Chelsea, somewhat contentiously, enjoyed the benefit of what was probably a 50/50 refereeing decision. Dubravka guessed right but Hazard’s penalty was far too good and, finally, Sarri smiled.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nIt did not stick. When Yedlin swept past Giroud, temporarily filling in at left-back, the substitute striker protested that the right-back had elbowed him in the face. With such complaints falling on deaf ears, Yedlin crossed superbly for Joselu, who had replaced Rondón, to head an imperious equaliser.\n\nGiroud did not stop scowling until Willian’s free kick was only semi‑cleared and Yedlin redirected Alsonso’s volley past Dubravka."}, {"date": "25/08/2018", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 31322, "home_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup":

Pep Guardiola’s side had racked up seven successive top-flight wins on their travels since drawing at Burnley six months ago but Wolves were in no mood to roll over just because the champions were in town.\n\nNuno Espírito Santo’s side played with tremendous energy, belief and courage, and fully deserved a point that was celebrated like a victory at the final whistle. “We’re on our way back” reverberated from the massed ranks of gold shirts inside Molineux and it was hard to disagree at the end of a thrilling game of football.\n\nWolves 1-1 Manchester City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThere was a slice of good fortune with Willy Boly’s goal, which clearly went in off the central defender’s arm and should also have been disallowed for offside, but it was hard to begrudge Wolves that bit of luck on a day when they caused City plenty of problems with their pace on the counterattack.\n\nGuardiola’s side dominated the ball – they had 79% of possession – but Wolves certainly could not be accused of parking the bus. They were prepared to commit players forward at the right time – the pace of Hélder Costa and Adama Traoré caused plenty of problems – and Wolves may even have snatched three points at the end, when Diogo Jota’s ferocious shot flashed inches over the bar.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aymeric Laporte heads the equaliser past Wolves goalkeeper Rui Patrício. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nHaving levelled through Aymeric Laporte’s first goal for the club, City could also have won it at the death, with the relief among the home supporters almost tangible when Sergio Agüero’s 25-yard free-kick hit the top of the crossbar. That was the second time Agüero hit the woodwork and the third occasion for City in total, with Rui Patrício producing an outstanding save in the first half to tip Raheem Sterling’s swerving half-volley on to the bar.\n\nYet the champions were far from freeflowing here and although Guardiola said he was happy with the chances City created against a 5-4-1 system that has proved difficult for them to break down in the past, the Spaniard admitted his side were nothing like as comfortable without the ball. Vincent Kompany had a particularly poor opening 45 minutes.\n\n“We didn’t control the counterattacks quite well today, but it is a good point because of the quality of the opponent,” Guardiola said. “I think we created enough chances to win the game. But I’ve not too many regrets. Maybe a bit of a lack of rhythm sometimes. But in general I am satisfied with the performance.”\n\nBournemouth’s Nathan Aké seals comeback in thrilling draw with Everton Read more\n\nAlthough Guardiola could be seen speaking to Martin Atkinson, the referee, immediately after the match, the City manager had no desire to discuss Boly’s controversial goal or get involved in a debate about whether the Premier League should have implemented video assistant referee technology. City also had a couple of penalty appeals turned down, although on one of them Agüero was lucky not to be booked for diving.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nFrom Espírito Santo’s point of view, his gameplan worked perfectly. “I think it was a good performance overall,” the Wolves manager said. “We were playing against the best team, so we had to stick together, cover, reduce the space and always have balance. There are tasks for the players – rules – that give you order and safety and confidence to play. So when we had the ball we created chances and played good football. If there’s a but, after we score we should manage better the next few minutes that put City in control of the game.”\n\nIn a bright opening 25 minutes that set the tone, Raúl Jiménez had a goal ruled out for offside before City went straight up the other end and hit the woodwork twice in quick succession. Agüero swept a low shot against the upright and then came that Sterling effort, which was swerving towards the top corner until Patrício, stretching every sinew, flicked it on to the bar.\n\nBoly’s dubious goal arrived after Costa, scampering clear on the left, saw his angled shot pushed into the side-netting by Ederson. City seemed to be caught out by the short corner that followed, with João Moutinho’s delivery exposing some poor marking.

After three matches Arsenal’s post-Arsène Wenger era is finally up and running thanks to a comical own goal from Issa Diop 20 minutes from time after West Ham – inspired by the excellent Felipe Anderson – missed a series of chances that left their new manager shaking his head at the final whistle.\n\nArsenal were missing Mesut Özil through illness yet again and this comeback after Marko Arnautovic had given the visitors the lead was the perfect fillip for Emery following a difficult first few weeks in charge. However, given how they struggled at times to contain their opponents on the break even after Nacho Monreal’s equaliser, this Arsenal side remain very much a work in progress.\n\nUnai Emery denies rift with Mesut Özil after Arsenal midfielder left out Read more\n\nÖzil’s absence allowed Aaron Ramsey to return after being left out for the defeat against Chelsea last Saturday, amid continuing doubts whether the Wales midfielder will sign a new contract at the Emirates. That cloud hung over Jack Wilshere for the majority of his final season in north London and his decision to join West Ham was based on the belief he would be a regular starter. Three successive appearances would seem to have borne that out and so far he has worked tirelessly – albeit in a third successive lost cause.\n\n“I’m very unhappy with the result but very pleased with the performance,” said Pellegrini. “We played the correct way and I’m sure this team will win more matches than we lose.”\n\nWilshere was one of seven summer arrivals in a team that featured four changes for the second successive week after opening defeats by Liverpool and Bournemouth. The addition of Carlos Sánchez – who took only 150 seconds to register his first foul – alongside Wilshere added much-needed steel in the middle, although Wilshere was given a rude awakening in an early clash with Arsenal’s latest teenage midfielder, Mattéo Guendouzi.\n\nA flowing move in the 11th minute almost ended with the hosts taking the lead but Ramsey’s header was correctly ruled offside after Lukasz Fabianski saved brilliantly from Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s drive following good work from Héctor Bellerín.\n\nBut with Anderson thriving in his free role West Ham looked dangerous on the break and almost went ahead straight afterwards, only for Arnautovic to hit the side netting from Robert Snodgrass’s pass. The Austrian made no mistake with his second attempt 13 minutes later after being set up by Anderson, drilling the ball home from the edge of the penalty area with a first-time shot.\n\nArsenal responded well and were level within five minutes. The influential Mkhitaryan played in Bellerín and his cross was palmed by Fabianksi straight into the path of Monreal, who tapped home.\n\nYet if a failing of Arsenal under Wenger was their defensive naivety, then the last 15 minutes of the first half showed Emery still has plenty to do. Michail Antonio fluffed his lines following an excellent through-ball from Anderson while Snodgrass was denied by Petr Cech on the stroke of half-time when it seemed easier to score.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe introduction of Alexandre Lacazette for Alex Iwobi after the break at least showed Emery knew things had to change, and efforts from Shkodran Mustafi and the substitute inside the first 10 minutes forced saves from Fabianksi.\n\nWest Ham still threatened, though. Arnautovic, who limped off moments later, passed up a golden opportunity to score his second after another superb ball from Anderson but failed to muster the requisite power behind his shot.\n\nBournemouth’s Nathan Aké seals comeback in thrilling draw with Everton Read more\n\nPellegrini then threw on Javier Hernández and, in Lucas Pérez, another Arsenal old boy and it came close to paying off immediately when the Mexican curled an effort just wide after being afforded acres of space by the Arsenal defence.\n\nCech almost handed West Ham the lead when he spilled Anderson’s shot from the edge of the area and looked relieved to see the ball fall to an Arsenal player to clear.\n\nIt was another defensive error that was to prove decisive. Diop – a France international signed for a club-record £22m from Toulouse in the summer – inexplicably booted the ball high and not very far, and ended up turning the ball past his own goalkeeper after good work from Lacazette.\n\n“We are happy with the first three points – we needed a win but it is clear we need to improve,” said Emery. “We conceded too many chances and West Ham showed they are a good team. We need some balance between defence and attack but we improved in the second half after the substitution.”\n\nAnother replacement, Danny Welbeck, rounded things off in injury time with a simple finish after more good work from Bellerín to give the scoreline an extra sheen. It was not pretty.

make sense of their emotions.\n\nThey had taken part in a contest that defied logical analysis, with Richarlison’s brainless red card summing up the chaos, and the only thing that felt predictable in the end was Bournemouth reminding everyone why they deserve to be regarded as the Premier League’s escape artists.\n\nEddie Howe’s side have earned 20 points from losing positions in 2018 and they pulled off their latest high-wire act in challenging circumstances, fighting back from two goals down against Everton thanks to a late flurry from Josh King and Nathan Aké. Yet for all that he praised his team’s ability to cope with adversity, Howe could not be entirely pleased with how an afternoon of relentless drama unfolded. “The frustration is letting it get to that position,” Bournemouth’s manager said. “With the numerical advantage, you expected us to come out and pin Everton in. That never happened.”\n\nHowe knew that he should have been celebrating a third consecutive win, not breathing a sigh of relief at snatching a spirited point. Everton, after all, were there for the taking after losing Richarlison for a butt on Adam Smith in the 41st minute. Yet the visitors rallied in the second half and Bournemouth seemed to be heading for an avoidable defeat after Smith received his marching orders for a foul on Theo Walcott.\n\n“We had a fantastic first 25 minutes of the second half and we really believed when we had the ball,” Marco Silva said. “We scored two fantastic goals. At 2-0, though, we had to keep the balance.”\n\nEverton could not shut up shop. They allowed the game to remain ragged after taking control with goals from Walcott and Michael Keane, who was said to be in an improved condition after being taken to hospital after a late clash of heads with Idrissa Gueye, and Silva had to be content with his new side maintaining their unbeaten start to the season.\n\nSilva was unhappy with a point, although the Portuguese had to accept that Bournemouth were the better side for much of the first half. They set a brisk pace and ought to have taken the lead in the 15th minute, only for Callum Wilson to blaze over from 12 yards after a perceptive assist from Ryan Fraser.\n\nFour minutes before the interval, Richarlison let his teammates down with an act of breathtaking stupidity. One moment Leighton Baines was about to take a throw deep on the left, the next the fans behind Bournemouth’s goal were up in arms. Richarlison had turned to bicker with Smith and, when the pair advanced on each other, Everton’s £40m winger made an aggressive movement with his head, leaving Lee Probert with no option but to send him off.\n\n“It’s something I don’t like to see,” Silva said. “You see it many times.\n\n“Maybe there was minimal contact but he did it. If you are 18 or 19 or 33 you have to keep your balance, even if you are provoked.”\n\nEverton no longer had the Brazilian’s pace as an outlet and Silva changed his team’s shape at half-time, moving Gylfi Sigurdsson to left midfield.\n\nYet they had coped in similar circumstances two weeks ago, drawing at Wolves after losing Phil Jagielka to a red card, and they went ahead in the 56th minute. Cenk Tosun’s pass caught out Bournemouth’s high line and Walcott sprinted away from Aké before firing past Asmir Begovic.\n\nJonathan Hogg sees red but Cardiff fail to take their chances at Huddersfield Read more\n\nLate Danny Welbeck effort adds gloss to Arsenal scramble past West Ham Read more\n\nThat was the cue for a Bournemouth implosion. Five minutes later, Jordan Pickford’s long clearance bounced all the way through and the Everton fans chortled at Smith, who was the last man back, seeing red for clipping Walcott’s heels. “I think it’s a foul,” Howe said. “I think he’s just brushed Theo. The referee just has to make a decision about whether it’s red or yellow.”\n\nWalcott’s speed unsettled Bournemouth and it was his quick thinking that led to Everton’s second goal in the 66th minute. He tapped a free-kick to Sigurdsson on the right and Keane met the Icelandic midfielder’s cross with a firm header.\n\nHowever, Bournemouth earned a penalty when Baines bundled into Wilson in the 75th minute. King snuck the ball past Pickford and Howe’s men were level four minutes later, Wilson heading against the right post and Aké gobbling up the rebound. Everton, who have loaned Yannick Bolasie to Aston Villa, could only reflect that this was the Premier League in all its eccentric glory."}, {"date": "25/08/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium",

He whipped off his shirt and wheeled away in celebration to bask in the delight of the delirious away supporters as the home fans emptied. His team-mates may affectionately refer to him as Slabhead but Maguire’s lasting act here was all the work of his right foot, with the defender shuffling inside before driving from distance beyond Alex McCarthy. For Claude Puel, this was part two of his sweet revenge on the club who ruthlessly sacked him last summer.\n\nThe Frenchman recorded a 4-1 win here in December and this was another joyous return as his team came from behind to defeat Saints, who had Pierre-Emile Højbjerg sent off after receiving a second yellow card for a laughable dive under pressure from Daniel Amartey. As Maguire ran off shirtless, Puel raced on to the pitch, punching the air with both fists. Asked about breaching the perimeter of his technical area, Puel said: “It’s good sometimes, you know? It’s fantastic, Harry took the space, and he had enough energy to cover the pitch and then to shoot. It is a fantastic feeling and I was happy for my players.”\n\nThere was plenty of food for thought for the watching England assistant manager, Steve Holland. As well as Maguire, outstanding for his country in Russia last month, he will have doubtless been impressed by Demarai Gray, who cancelled out Ryan Bertrand’s opener, while this was also the perfect chance to cast his eye over the silky James Maddison and McCarthy, who may feel he could have done better with both goals.\n\nGray’s equaliser four minutes after Bertrand lashed home came after Kelechi Iheanacho stood up a cross towards the back post, which bobbed up in the air from Cédric’s failed headed clearance. If that was galling, the winner which fizzed through the legs of Oriol Romeu and whispered past the towering frame of Jannik Vestergaard from 25 yards totally deflated Southampton.\n\n“I was quite pleased to see Harry Maguire taking a shot on from there, I’m thinking ‘Go on then, shoot from there’ because we will just jog over and pick it up, but it’s ended up in the corner of our goal and we’ve lost a game I didn’t feel we deserved to,” Hughes said. “We can’t believe it’s gone in, to be honest. I’m more than pleased with the level of performance we were able to produce, albeit without an end product.”\n\nThe numbers make increasingly grim reading: Southampton have won just three of their past 28 league matches, with Hughes having won two matches since taking charge in March. Regularly reminded of Southampton’s shortcomings on home soil Hughes’ players made the fast start he demanded, with Nathan Redmond earning a corner out of Wes Morgan, the Leicester captain, within 12 seconds. Down Saints’ left flank Redmond’s pace exposed Amartey, again playing in an unorthodox right-back role, but in midfield the destructive Leicester pairing of Wilfred Ndidi and Nampalys Mendy gladly gobbled up. Ben Chilwell, the marauding Leicester defender, impressed on the opposite wing and he twice fuelled attacks, with Gray and Iheanacho going close.\n\nBut despite heading down the tunnel goalless at the interval Southampton started the second half with a promising intensity, with Bertrand bombing down the left before playing in Danny Ings, whose effort was saved by Kasper Schmeichel. Saints again broke forward, this time down the right as Højbjerg slid an inviting ball across to Elyounoussi, only for the winger to lose his footing at the crucial moment. But as the home crowd gasped at Elyounoussi’s slip there was the onrushing Bertrand to crash the ball home. Four minutes later Iheanacho’s hanging cross should have been straightforward for Southampton to deal with but Cédric headed up into the air and when the ball landed, Gray snatched it, sashayed infield and rattled his effort inside McCarthy’s near post.\n\nBut when Højbjerg burst into the 18-yard box with Amartey for company, he got himself in a tangle and fell in search of a penalty. Already booked for a foul on Maddison the midfielder headed down the tunnel after picking up a second yellow card for simulation. Hughes was incensed and, as his side toiled, Leicester kept pushing for a winner. Through Maguire they were duly rewarded.\n\nManchester City rely on Aymeric Laporte to share spoils with Wolves Read more\n\nLate Danny Welbeck effort adds gloss to Arsenal scramble past West Ham Read

side for the third time in three matches and watched his players collect a third win, moving to the top of the Premier League in the process. Klopp has been there before, though it was almost two years ago and only a brief visit. In each of his three previous seasons in England the German has had to witness teams either running away with the league (Manchester City and Chelsea) or proving uncatchable (Leicester City). This time Liverpool are understandably keen to be the ones staying a step ahead, and though there is a long way to go they are setting the pace, with some room left for improvement.\n\nLiverpool v Brighton: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nPep Guardiola has just claimed his Manchester City side are below maximum efficiency after a World Cup summer, and the same appears to be true of Liverpool, who put several passes astray and made too many poor decisions in the final third for their manager to be completely happy. Or perhaps they simply found an organised Brighton side difficult to break down. There was never much doubt about the result once the home side had taken a first-half lead, but Brighton were by no means overwhelmed and will kick themselves over the lapse of concentration that ended up costing them the game.\n\n“We gave away a very poor goal but I was proud of the way we played after that,” Chris Hughton said. “We put ourselves in a great position to get something, in fact I’m a little disappointed that we didn’t.”\n\nLiverpool could have gone in front as early as the fifth minute after Sadio Mané played Mohamed Salah into space behind Gaëtan Bong and moved into the penalty area to accept the return pass, only to sidefoot narrowly wide of goal. Brighton set themselves up to contain, Hughton revealing special measures were necessary against a team of Liverpool’s firepower, but quickly discovered that the problem with five men across midfield and only Glenn Murray as a token outlet was that it made it hard to break out of their own half. Liverpool just kept swarming forward and it took a good one-handed stop from Mat Ryan to keep out a Roberto Firmino header from Andy Robertson’s cross.\n\nBournemouth’s Nathan Aké seals comeback in thrilling draw with Everton Read more\n\nFor all that the home side had a let-off when Alisson came out of his area to deal with a ball from Yves Bissouma and failed to make any contact. Solly March was left in possession near the corner flag with the goalkeeper stranded but he miscontrolled to let the ball run harmlessly dead. Trent Alexander-Arnold hit the bar with a free-kick after Naby Keïta was fouled on the edge of the area before, almost inevitably, Salah struck midway through the first half.\n\nThe visitors will not enjoy the inquest at the training ground. From a Brighton free-kick in their own half a mixture of careless passing and Liverpool’s determined press left Bissouma caught in possession by James Milner. Mané lost no time in transferring the ball to Firmino, whose precise pass in turn allowed Salah the space to find Ryan’s bottom corner with a confident left-foot finish.\n\nBrighton opened the second half with a chance to equalise when Anthony Knockaert shot wide. Liverpool’s inability to put the game out of reach encouraged their visitors to get forward, without producing much in the way of end-product. Liverpool’s best chance of a second goal came through their two full-backs. When Robertson thoughtfully turned the ball back Alexander-Arnold saw his effort deflected past a post.\n\nIt is probably just as well Liverpool can take solace from the league table, for they might have been embarrassed late on when Alisson had to make virtually his only save of the game to keep out Pascal Gross’s header.\n\n“We had a good mindset in the first half but we didn’t show the same patience in the second,” Klopp said. “I wouldn’t say we were under pressure but Brighton had their moments. Alisson had to make a big save at the end but there is no need to be negative about nine points from three games.”"}, {"date": "20/08/2018", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25750, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [75], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Luka Milivojevic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Max Meyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexander Sørloth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Guaita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson Ramses Becker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Naby Keita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Jürgen Klopp will have taken far more satisfaction from this narrow victory than the emphatic dismissal of West Ham on the opening weekend. Crystal Palace, always awkward opponents, were eventually seen off in south London to maintain the Merseysiders’ pristine start to the campaign and leave their manager chest-bumping his coaching staff as he celebrated on the sidelines. They have plenty of cause for optimism.\n\nThis was never comfortable, even after the home side had been reduced in number after the otherwise excellent Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s right knee illegally thwarted Mohamed Salah’s counterattack on the edge of the Palace penalty area with a quarter of an hour still to play. It was also controversial inasmuch as the home side were incensed at Michael Oliver’s award of a penalty as half-time approached, even if Mamadou Sakho’s stuttered and desperate lunges at the loose ball might have done enough to send Salah to the turf.

In Virgil van Dijk they boasted the dominant defensive force on display, a colossus who matched and, mostly, dwarfed Christian Benteke in the air, with each tackle, interception or booming header a source of inspiration for his teammates. He certainly brought the best out of Joe Gomez at his side. The last time this team had visited Selhurst Park on a Monday night, in May 2014, they had retained vague hopes of claiming the title in a campaign’s death throes, only to capitulate dismally and ship a three-goal lead in the bedlam of the latter stages. With Van Dijk in their ranks, the current crop should never suffer such indignity.\n\nThen, at the Dutchman’s back, there was Alisson who, when an aggrieved Palace stirred after the interval in pursuit of parity, was imposing where previous Liverpool goalkeepers have merely wilted away. The Brazilian simply did what was required of him, but few of his recent predecessors have managed even that much.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Milner sends Wayne Hennessey the wrong way from the penalty spot.

This defence will have thrilled at a clean sheet thoroughly well earned.\n\nGiven the thrashing inflicted by Manchester City on Huddersfield the previous day, and the relatively innocuous look to the schedule at the start of the champions’ title defence, Klopp’s team could ill afford any kind of slip here. He could bemoan the lack of rhythm in too much of their attacking play, and pinpoint his full-backs for failing to inject the required zest to their approach work, but they still retained bite. Their counterattacking always felt fluent and incisive. Witness Naby Keïta’s spin away from Townsend deep inside his own half, then run and lofted pass beyond Sakho to send Salah bearing down on goal.\n\nThe Egyptian’s attempt was too heavy on that occasion, and ballooned over the bar, but he would still be decisive in each of Liverpool’s rewards. Hodgson was incensed by his first involvement, Roberto Firmino having slipped him into the box for Salah to hurdle Sakho’s initial panicked challenge – there appeared to be contact at that point – and the centre-half’s second stretch in vain for the ball, before crumpling to the turf.\n\n“It’s not a penalty,” offered the Palace manager. “I’ve been in football a long time and, if that’s a penalty, then the game has changed beyond all recognition.

Burnley are not used to losing at home and Watford are not used to winning away, but Javi Gracia’s first victory on the road since taking over at Vicarage Road means his side now have a maximum points return after two games while Sean Dyche must be wondering what happened to the defensive solidity that took the Clarets into Europe.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\n“We gave the game away in the first few minutes of the second half,” the Burnley manager said. “I warned the players that Watford would be quick out of the blocks, but we made a couple of expensive mistakes and it seemed to unnerve us for the rest of the match. We never got amongst Watford in the way that we should.”\n\nGracia paid tribute to his strikers. “When you score three times it makes it easier to manage the game,” he said. “I know it is not easy to get points here, but I can only be pleased at the start we have made.” Gracia had not even seen an away goal since becoming Watford manager but he had to wait only three minutes for his side to nose in front, Andre Gray scoring against his old club after pushing the ball out to Troy Deeney on the right and moving up to meet the return with a sweetly struck right-foot volley.\n\nWhat the visitors needed to do then was sit on their lead for a little while and make Burnley work to get back into the game, though perhaps through unfamiliarity with such situations they caved in at the first time of asking. Johann Berg Gudmundsson swung over a corner, Ben Foster tried to come out and claim but found his route to the ball blocked by Abdoulaye Doucouré, and it was a simple matter for James Tarkowski to head in from close range. So simple, in fact, it was a surprise to discover it was the big defender’s first goal for the club. Tarkowski usually goes up for set pieces but is rarely allowed a free header in the six-yard box.\n\nAfter that eventful opening the game settled into something more routine once the scores were level. Burnley had the better of the rest of the first half, Gudmundsson bringing a save from Foster from a free-kick and Jeff Hendrick being foiled in the act of shooting by Craig Cathcart, though Deeney brought an agile stop from Joe Hart with a speculative effort five minutes from the break. By the time the interval arrived Watford could consider themselves a little fortunate to still be level. Burnley produced their best move of the half at its close, and Hendrick might have scored with a more determined finish rather than the instinctive flick that allowed Foster to save. Still the danger was not cleared and José Holebas had to move quickly to stop Aaron Lennon pouncing on the loose ball in front of an unguarded goal, and when Ashley Westwood tried to bring matters to a close from the edge of the area his firm drive flew wide.\n\nManchester City 6-1 Huddersfield Town: Premier League – live reaction! Read more\n\nWatford must have been glad of that reprieve because they started the second half in exactly the same way they had begun the first. Doucouré slid a cleverly disguised pass to Deeney after Ben Mee had got in the way of a shot and, presented with the ball and only Hart to beat, there was no way the striker was going to miss from three yards out.\n\nThis time Watford did not let Burnley back in the game but increased their lead after another three minutes, though the home side had only themselves to blame after momentarily switching off in defence. From a Burnley throw near halfway Matthew Lowton contrived to send a sloppy infield pass straight to Will Hughes and before Mee and Tarkowski had reacted to the danger the midfielder had caught Hart too by surprise with a clean strike from the edge of the area.\n\nHart was hardly at fault. Twice in the second half he had been left exposed by the defenders in front of him, though that did not stop the travelling fans in the Cricket Ground end mocking him with chants of “England’s number four.” Commendably, the goalkeeper retained enough concentration to prevent Ken Sema making it four in the closing seconds. The fact that Watford would not have been flattered by such a scoreline is a measure of how far Burnley are from the pace they set last season.\n\n\n\n"}, {"date": "19/08/2018", "arena": "Etihad

knee injury began with him witnessing another mesmeric Manchester City performance. On days like these the sense is that Pep Guardiola’s finely tuned team can do precisely what they wish, when they wish: on Sunday it was to trounce Huddersfield Town 6-1.\n\nA display of near perfection featured the superb Benjamin Mendy and David Silva and was crowned by Sergio Agüero’s ninth Premier League hat-trick. The marksman now has 14 goals in his last eight home league appearances.\n\nManchester City’s smart band of gold seems to have scrambled fans’ minds | Barry Glendenning Read more\n\nThis left Guardiola purring and ready to joke. Asked if the striker might still be more clinical, he said: “More clinical? It is OK. Three goals a game is OK. I am not going to demand he’s more clinical. Since he came back [to training], I saw him from the first second, from the first minute: wow. He came back perfect.”\n\nGuardiola pointed to the operation Agüero had towards the end of last season on a damaged knee. “I think the surgery from the doctor helped a lot. He feels free now. He suffered last year with some problem. It’s not just scoring goals – the space, creating chances, moving, assists, chances, fouls. He never stops.\n\n“When this happens, he is one of the best strikers in the world, without a doubt. What can you say? So, chapeau. In this period, since he arrived, Community Shield [scoring twice in 2-0 win over Chelsea], Arsenal, today – it’s perfect.”\n\nGuardiola’s XI had caused some head-scratching regarding the formation. Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Gabriel Jesus were selected in place of Kyle Walker, Riyad Mahrez and Raheem Sterling and, with John Stones, Aymeric Laporte and Mendy the other recognised defenders, this suggested a back three and so it proved.\n\nDavid Wagner also made three changes from Town’s opening weekend defeat at Chelsea. In came Jon Gorenc Stankovic, Tommy Smith and Abdelhamid Sabiri as out went Mathias Jørgensen, Jonathan Hogg and Aaron Mooy in a 3-5-1-1.\n\nTwenty-three minutes had passed before Wagner’s men threatened – Steve Mounie passed the ball back to Stankovic but his 20-yard attempt ballooned over.\n\nThere was no such direction issue for Ederson from the resulting goal-kick. The Brazilian struck a sweet 70-yard pass to the roving Agüero and, as Ben Hamer advanced, the goalkeeper found himself the victim of a cute lob and City led 1-0.\n\nNow Jesus, partnering Agüero, was about to join the Argentinian on the scoresheet. Once more Mendy drove at Huddersfield. When a pass to Jesus was returned, the ball ricocheted off the Frenchman back to No33 and he made it 2-0.\n\nMendy was also the man behind City’s third. This time he sent in a skidding cross that Hamer spilled and there was Agüero to add his second and the champions’ third.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sergio Agüero, right, watches the ball find the far corner after a superb flick for Man City’s fifth goal. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nWagner said: “He made some mistakes today but some great saves as well.”\n\nThis came on 35 minutes, which meant that three strikes in a 10-minute burst had surely put Town in damage-limitation territory. Except, no: City switched off from a Philip Billing header, Mounie headed on and Stankovic got ahead of Stones to force home.\n\nSoon after the break, though, David Silva restored the three-goal cushion. A cross-field run from the excellent Agüero ended in him winning a free-kick. Silva danced forward and bent a 20-yard peach past Hamer.\n\nIn De Bruyne’s absence the Spaniard pulled the strings in his own expert fashion. “He made an outstanding performance, his first game after the summertime. Of course, he was so motivated because his family, parents, wife and especially Mateo were here,” said Guardiola of Silva’s son, who was born in December, 15 weeks premature. “He scored an amazing goal for him. His son will never forget the first time he saw his father play football; he scored this outstanding goal.\n\n“We met him the first time two days ago. Today [after the game], he was in the locker room with all the team, all the squad. Last season was a tough moment for all his family. Fortunately, the little boy fought a lot and he is here. It’s a special day for him, for us, for David.”\n\nAs it was for City fans, too, watching their team. At just past the hour mark Mahrez replaced the impressive Silva for his home debut. It illustrated the depth of Guardiola’s squad, particularly as Sterling, Leroy Sané, Walker, Nicolás Otamendi and Phil Foden remained on the bench.\n\nManchester City 6-1 Huddersfield Town: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nCity continued to press to the end. Agüero drew another stop from Hamer. Jesus – not for the first time – raced back to dispossess and initiate another attack while Mahrez flew along the right to send Town scurrying.\n\nThen came Agüero’s hat-trick. Mendy capped his best City display with a cross which the striker hit first time past Hamer and Sané forced City’s sixth as the keeper deflected the ball on to the unfortunate Terence Kongolo and into the net.\n\nGuardiola explained why he paired Agüero and Jesus. “Last season we did it once or twice. We suffered last season a lot against Huddersfield [0-0 draw]. We had the problems against teams who had four or five at the back and their strikers going back to help holding midfielders. So we decided to play two strikers.\n\n“We have a guy like Mendy who is clever in the final third to see the pass. Today it works but it doesn’t mean in the next game we are going to play the same way. Important is the desire without the ball. Today was much better in terms of football and consistency During 90 minutes [against] Chelsea and Arsenal we survive.”\n\nCity did more than survive on Sunday.

The game was played in a boisterous atmosphere and the pace was frenetic, with Chris Hughton’s players quick to the ball, strong in the challenge and brave enough to commit players forward, particularly when Anthony Knockaert and Solly March found space on the flanks.\n\nThere was nothing revolutionary about the home team’s tactics. They were efficient in their simplicity, hunting in packs as they sought to make up for last week’s meek defeat to Watford, although there was also much to admire about the move that led to Glenn Murray breaking the deadlock in the 25th minute. Knockaert had given United a warning moments earlier, bursting on to a long ball before slashing wide from an awkward angle, and it was March who provided the assist for the goal with a sharp cross from the left.\n\nUnited’s lax defending must have enraged Mourinho although he spent a lot of money to bring Bailly and Lindelöf to Old Trafford. Gaetan Bong slipped a pass behind the outnumbered Ashley Young, who was entitled to wonder why Juan Mata was not protecting him, and Bailly’s decision to vacate his position in the centre gave March the room to find Murray, who stepped in front of Lindelöf before turning a clever flick past David de Gea.\n\nSign up for The Fiver, the Guardian’s daily football email.\n\nUnited were pulled apart with astonishing ease and Brighton pulled clear when Shane Duffy capitalised on more atrocious defending two minutes later. Perhaps the most shocking aspect of the goal was that Duffy had just gone close to forcing home Pascal Gross’s corner. The ball came back to the German and he drilled it back into the area, where it reached Duffy again thanks to a touch from the excellent Knockaert. With nobody in a red shirt minded to react, the centre-back set himself before making it 2-0.\n\nMourinho stood alone in his technical area, clapping furiously and urging his players to lift their heads. Seven minutes later Romelu Lukaku used his to halve the deficit, nodding Luke Shaw’s bouncing volley past Mathew Ryan after Brighton failed to clear their lines from a corner. The fans in the away end fleetingly sensed that a comeback in keeping with United’s dashing traditions was on the cards. In the event, however, little changed. United were outplayed by Dale Stephens and Davy Propper in midfield, where Fred gasped for air and Pogba showed the hunger of a man wondering what he would look like in Barcelona’s colours, and Martial’s failure to step up in the absence of the injured Alexis Sánchez was a notable disappointment.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos Read more\n\nAfter seven minutes Martial spread anxiety in Brighton’s defence by running at Martin Montoya, who had a fine debut at right-back, and moments later Lukaku ought to have scored after Lewis Dunk, who would be replaced by Leon Balogun, injured himself conceding possession on the edge of the area.\n\nYet the first half ended with Martial receiving a yellow card for fouling Knockaert, who had hustled his fellow Frenchman off the ball, and the winger would make way for Marouane Fellaini after an hour.\n\nhe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nMourinho had already replaced Mata and Andreas Pereira with Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard at half-time, by which point Brighton had restored their two-goal cushion. Bailly committed a rash foul on Gross, who hammered his spot-kick in off De Gea’s legs, and there was no way back for United despite Pogba’s late penalty. They had two shots on target in open play and awarding them one star would be generous."}, {"date": "18/08/2018", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 30720, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sol Bamba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Kenneth Zohore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jazz Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Smithies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Paterson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Greg Cunningham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Mendez-Laing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Madine", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Martin Dubravka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [3], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}], "subs": [{"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jacob Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoshinori Muto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Hayden", "yellows": [], "reds": [66], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Kenedy concealed his face with his Newcastle United shirt, but black and white stripes could not mask a dreadful day. Rafael Benítez’s side, reduced to 10 men after the dismissal of the substitute Isaac Hayden, should have smuggled victory out of south Wales, but the Brazilian’s stoppage-time penalty was devoid of any conviction and capped a miserable performance; he became the first player to fail to complete a single first-half pass since 2010 and will be fortunate to escape retrospective action from the Football Association for a lurid kick out at Victor Camarasa, the Cardiff City midfielder.\n\nCardiff City 0-0 Newcastle United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nNeil Warnock questioned whether the moment when his captain, Sean Morrison, handled Yoshinori Muto’s cross six minutes into stoppage time was inside the 18-yard box, but Neil Etheridge made his second penalty save in two matches to earn Cardiff a priceless first point of the season. Asked if it was his decision for Kenedy, re-signed on loan from Chelsea this summer, to take the penalty, Benítez replied: “Not really. The first taker was [Matt] Ritchie, who was not on the pitch, and Kenedy the second one. He is a good penalty-taker, but it was poor. He is not happy, but we win as a team, draw as a team and lose as a team.”\n\nIt would have been a cruel defeat for Cardiff to stomach. Warnock informed his squad of his team on Monday and his side demonstrated as much, proving a slick operation. They dominated from start to finish but failed to put the finishing touches on an otherwise flawless performance, with the summer signings Camarasa, Harry Arter and Josh Murphy particularly influential.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Newcastle’s Isaac Hayden was shown a straight red card for a foul on Josh Murphy of Cardiff. Photograph: Rebecca Naden/Reuters\n\nMurphy feasted down Newcastle’s right, with Javier Manquillo repeatedly backpedalling in an attempt to get to grips with the speedy winger. By the time Manquillo was replaced and Hayden sent down the tunnel, Murphy was duelling with his twin, Jacob, who was tasked with stifling his brother.\n\nPleas for Usmanov’s riches may add to Big Six but result in Glasgow United | Paul Doyle Read more\n\n“We had problems with the right-full-back position; DeAndre Yedlin was injured, we played [Javier] Manquillo, who was injured at half-time, we had to put on [Isaac] Hayden and after he was sent off,” Benítez said. “We had too many problems and in the end, it could be better, but we cannot complain too much.”\n\nKenneth Zohore, one of four Cardiff changes from the opening-day defeat at Bournemouth, enjoyed his return to action after injury and the striker had a series of half-chances before Kenedy’s 33rd-minute fireworks. With Cardiff on the front foot, Kenedy swung a wild left boot at Camarasa, but the referee, Craig Pawson, seemingly missed it. Arter, an endearing, ubiquitous presence throughout, was equally fortunate to stay on the pitch after a lunge on Joselu, the Newcastle striker. Arter shone on debut, though, recoiling the ball from the feet of Ayoze Pérez in one breath and picking out Zohore in another. Murphy later slipped in Zohore, who tried and failed to tee up Junior Hoilett. After his wayward free-kick, there came an inevitable riposte from the away fans. “You’re just a shit Jacob Murphy,” they sang.\n\nNewcastle grew weary of chasing the game, huffing and puffing without the ball and stop-start with it. When Hayden, 22 minutes after replacing Manquillo, crumpled through the back of Murphy’s legs, his frustrations were clear and Benítez was seething. Another substitute, Muto, fashioned an improbable lifeline, but Kenedy punted his effort straight at Etheridge.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“It would have been

the first home game of Marco Silva’s Everton reign from what had preceded it, but the adventure, energy and enjoyment that accompanied a hard-fought defeat of Southampton. “Everything is different,” the new manager said. Goodison Park will be consumed by relief if that proves the case.\n\nNot everything is different – referees continue to get it in the neck from Mark Hughes, who claimed Lee Mason should have dismissed Jordan Pickford for catching Danny Ings – but the change in Everton’s approach under Silva is marked.\n\nThere was only one new face in the Everton lineup – Richarlison, the £40m acquisition in question, scored his third goal in two games for his new club to add to Theo Walcott’s fine opener – but the hosts were unrecognisable from last season’s sterile side under Sam Allardyce.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson and Idrissa Gana Gueye also played their part in a deserved but ultimately tense win after Ings opened his Southampton account early in the second half.\n\n“Results support everything in football but the players are doing a fantastic job to try to understand everything we ask of them,” said Silva. “Now we are playing 50 metres further forward. Last season they were defending in their own box. The players are working hard, but the important thing is they are enjoying it as well.”\n\nHughes accused Mason of allowing Everton to disrupt Southampton by going to ground too easily in the closing stages. He also claimed that England’s goalkeeper should have been sent off for cleaning out the ball and Ings– in that order – late on. It was wasteful finishing that left Southampton pointless, however, Ings and Charlie Austin both missing clear openings.\n\n“He got the ball but he took Danny clearly,” Hughes said. “Everton had a man sent off for less last week. My assistant has been to see the referee and his assistant and they said it happened too quick. In my view he didn’t need to follow through as he did. It’s not sour grapes but you’ve got to be consistent.” He certainly sounded sour.\n\nHarry Kane breaks August goal drought in Tottenham win over Fulham Read more\n\nThe first Goodison goal of the Silva era was exquisite – a set-piece routine straight from the training ground but exquisite all the same. Sigurdsson and Leighton Baines stood over a free-kick awarded for a foul by Wesley Hoedt on the former. The latter pinged the ball to Morgan Schneiderlin on the edge of the area and he released Walcott with a perfectly weighted flick. Alex McCarthy was completely exposed in the visitors’ goal and well beaten when Walcott poked the ball beyond him.\n\nThe opening goal was not the only thing that was impressive. They harried and pressed Southampton relentlessly. They did so in numbers and their industry was polished by quality in a team that was clearly enjoying itself in the first home game of the season.\n\nGueye’s commitment and distribution in central midfield set the tone and it was his fine ball into Walcott that led to Everton’s second. The winger combined well with Séamus Coleman on the right before delivering a cross that invited an emphatic finish. Richarlison provided it, muscling in front of Jack Stephens to beat McCarthy with a downward header.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everton’s Theo Walcott scores their first goal.

Doherty was unable to continue and Vardy will serve an automatic three-match ban.\n\nRicharlison’s fast start continues as Everton see off Southampton Read more\n\nFor Wolves there was no way back into a game that had drifted away from them towards the end of the first half, when James Maddison marked his home debut with a deflected goal that doubled Leicester’s lead and gave Claude Puel’s side much-needed breathing space.\n\nWolves kept pressing, with the introduction of the electric Adama Traoré adding a new dimension to their attacking play; yet it rather summed up their afternoon when Jonny Castro Otto became the third visiting player to hit the woodwork when he struck the outside of the post 10 minutes from time.\n\nEspírito Santo spoke later about the need for his team to be more “ruthless and clinical‚“ – Doherty had a great chance inside the opening five minutes when Ben Chilwell blocked his close-range shot from Raúl Jiménez’s cutback – and the Wolves manager also expressed his frustration that his players failed to put Leicester under more pressure in the final 20 minutes or so, when they never made their numerical advantage count.\n\n“Disappointed with the result,” he said. “We started the game very well, we were totally in control, creating chances, playing good, managing the game.\n\n“But in that moment we should score, we had chances enough to do it, so we have to work on that – it’s one thing that we have to improve because it totally changes the dynamic of the game.\n\n“And in the other box we didn’t have luck – the game is like that. But the second half, playing against 10 men, we should do more.”\n\nPuel suggested Leicester have no intention of appealing against Vardy’s red card and said the striker, who was stretching for a ball that was running away from him when he went into the tackle with Doherty, showed “too much enthusiasm”.\n\nIt was the sort of challenge that may well have gone unpunished 20 years ago but the game has moved on. “It was not aggressive and he has been unlucky,” the Leicester manager said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Vardy was sent off in the second half for a foul on Matt Doherty. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nWolves were certainly unlucky in that promising spell at the start. João Moutinho swept a right-footed shot from 20 yards against the crossbar, then came that Doherty opportunity little more than 60 seconds later.\n\nIt was a reprieve for Leicester and there was another when Jiménez, afforded the time and space to turn, thumped a rising 22-yard shot that cannoned off the near post with Kasper Schmeichel beaten.\n\nLeicester looked a little shell-shocked in that opening period but they got the break they badly needed shortly before the half-hour mark.\n\nMarc Albrighton flung a hopeful cross into the area from wide on the right, Conor Coady could only glance the ball on and Doherty, the Wolves right wing-back, was unable to react quickly enough and sent a bullet header beyond Rui Patrício.\n\nHarry Kane breaks August goal drought in Tottenham win over Fulham Read more\n\nCoady, rather unfortunately, was also involved in Leicester’s second goal. Ricardo Pereira, Leicester’s £20m summer signing from Porto, burst forward from right-back and chose the perfect moment to release a pass inside to Maddison, whose curling shot from the edge of the area brushed off Coady to take the ball beyond the goalkeeper.\n\nIt was a blow from which Wolves never recovered."}, {"date": "18/08/2018", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 58297,

over Fulham. Unfortunately for Spurs, playing like a side who finished fourth in Russia is not what Mauricio Pochettino is after.\n\nA superb free-kick from Kieran Trippier and Harry Kane’s first Premier League goal in August turned the match in Tottenham’s favour after Aleksandar Mitrovic had cancelled out Lucas Moura’s first-half strike. For Pochettino this was not good enough and he demanded his side become more clinical if they are to become winners rather than just gallant runners-up.\n\nSteve Cook header seals Bournemouth comeback win over West Ham Read more\n\n“In football we are here to win, not to come third or fourth,” he said. “Having a good World Cup increases your confidence and the trust in yourself. But it is important to understand that while many of our players had an excellent World Cup only Hugo Lloris won it.”\n\nTrippier, making his first start for Spurs since starring for England in Russia, was at the heart of everything Tottenham did. If his delivery had been better, in the first half in particular, they would have won the match at a canter. Still, he managed to score the goal of the day, a sweet free-kick from 25 yards that bent inside Fabri’s right-hand post.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kieran Trippier scored Tottenham’s second of the afternoon. Photograph: Javier Garcia/BPI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAs for Kane, he sealed the victory with a typical goal 13 minutes from time, stepping inside Calum Chambers and firing low with his right foot into the far corner. The captain has found himself in the odd position of having won the Golden Boot in Russia while apparently struggling for form. Here he was back to something closer to his best, looking sharp in and around the box and providing a stern physical challenge for Fulham’s centre-halves.\n\nRicharlison’s fast start continues as Everton see off Southampton Read more\n\n“I am very happy for Harry,” Pochettino said. “It was important for him to feel the net in this period. If not we might have made a big trauma for him. He came up to me after the game to tell me: ‘Gaffer, I have done it!’ We have a little disadvantage in fitness and pre-season but if you have a good mentality you can compete.”\n\nLucas scored the opening goal, his first in the league for the club, curling home inside the far post after another cross from the right had been blocked. But Fulham came out the better side after half-time and Mitrovic had already hit the post before he equalised, stooping low to head home after a cute layoff from Ryan Sessegnon.\n\nPochettino responded to the goal immediately with a change of formation. Ironically, an England-style 3-3-2-2 with Lucas alongside Kane went to a 4-2-3-1 with Mousa Dembélé replacing Davinson Sánchez. Soon Spurs were on the front foot again. As Fulham tired openings began to spring up and Spurs enjoyed another period where they might have scored many more than two goals.\n\nFor Slavisa Jokanovic there were no lessons to be learned from this match that were not apparent already. “We know where we are,” the Fulham manager said. “We played a complicated away game against one of the top Champions League teams.\n\nFulham need time to find feet in Premier League, says Slavisa Jokanovic Read more\n\n“They showed quality but on the other side they showed they’ve been playing for three years together. We’ve played two and a half weeks together. We are a Premier League team in a building process. We are going to need the time. We showed a few positive things but without any doubt we need to fix our problems. The only way I know how to do that is to work hard.”\n\nThere were positive signs, not just the Mitrovic goal and the Sessegnon assist but in the combination of £40m central midfield recruits Jean Michaël Seri and André-Frank Zambo Anguissa. Fulham’s next match is at home to Burnley, another big challenge. Spurs, meanwhile, travel to Manchester United where a Pochettino team have yet to win in the league, or even score a goal.\n\n“I am disappointed but I am also happy,” Pochettino said in summary. “Old Trafford will show us whether we are ready to challenge at the top or not.”"}, {"date": "18/08/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56888, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup":

Bournemouth made it another one of those trying afternoons at the London Stadium, dampening the mood with an excellent fightback from a goal down, and on this evidence it is not going to be easy for Manuel Pellegrini to tackle the gloom that falls over this troubled ground in times of adversity.\n\nHarry Kane breaks August goal drought in Tottenham win over Fulham Read more\n\nBy the time it was over Pellegrini had a better grasp on why West Ham’s home form has been so mediocre since they left Upton Park two years ago. His new side have started the campaign with two defeats, despite a busy summer in the transfer market, and it was striking to hear the Chilean say that his players are still carrying mental scars from last season’s uncertainty. It was an accurate diagnosis given how easily West Ham collapsed when Bournemouth raised their level in the second half and earned their second consecutive win thanks to goals from Callum Wilson and Steve Cook.\n\n“We made mistakes,” Pellegrini said. “The first goal was one Bournemouth player against four of our players. We need to forget last season and recover the trust of the club. Is last season still on their minds? Yes. That’s why in the second half we tried to keep it 1-0. It’s a lack of confidence.”\n\nPellegrini had displayed his ruthless side after last week’s 4-0 defeat by Liverpool, dropping Michail Antonio, Ryan Fredericks and Declan Rice, but his decision to start without a defensive midfielder would have disastrous consequences. West Ham grasped for cohesion in vain and it was a sign of their discomfort that they did not threaten until Javier Hernández forced Asmir Begovic to save at his near post in the 26th minute.\n\nRicharlison’s fast start continues as Everton see off Southampton Read more\n\nBournemouth were tough to break down and it was interesting to consider how Eddie Howe’s side have benefited from stability since winning promotion to the Premier League in 2015. They have been a model of consistency under Howe, providing an example for scattergun clubs like West Ham to follow. “We know each other very well,” Bournemouth’s manager said. “We have our style of play.”\n\nGiven that they are integrating 10 newcomers in their squad, it was unsurprising to see West Ham playing like strangers. They were tentative in defence and attack, Felipe Anderson and Robert Snodgrass made little impact in the wide areas and Hernández rarely clicked with Marko Arnautovic up front, allowing Bournemouth to maintain a solid shape in front of Begovic.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nHowever, the hosts started to dominate when Jack Wilshere began to dictate the flow in midfield and they took the lead when Anderson offered a flash of the ability that convinced West Ham to make him their record signing. While the former Lazio wingerflattered to deceive for much of the contest, it was the Brazilian’s lovely pass that led to Hernández winning West Ham’s penalty in the 31st minute. Nathan Aké’s lunge was desperate and Stuart Attwell, the referee, penalised the Bournemouth centre-back after consulting his assistant.\n\nArnautovic, West Ham’s top scorer last season, took spot-kick duties off Mark Noble and the Austrian slammed a low penalty past Begovic. Yet Pellegrini’s side could not relax despite their advantage. Wilson had aimed a shot too close to Lukasz Fabianski while the game was goalless and Bournemouth pressed inventively for an equaliser. Josh King had a goalbound shot blocked on the stroke of half-time and David Brooks, who was bright and dangerous cutting in from the right, lacked conviction when he found himself alone in the box on two occasions.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Frustration for Manuel Pellegrini. Photograph: AFC Bournemouth/AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images\n\nBournemouth had identified central midfield as a weakness in West Ham’s 4-4-2 system. Noble and Wilshere provided no protection for their defence, with the former lucky not to concede a penalty for a push on Dan Gosling, and Pellegrini’s expansive tactics backfired.\n\nWest Ham were ragged without enough defensive balance in midfield and Bournemouth levelled when Wilson took a pass from Cook, surged past lamentable challenges from Fabian Balbuena and Pablo Zabaleta and rolled a confident finish past Fabianski in the 60th minute. “Callum’s individual moment of brilliance really swings the game in our favour,” Howe said. “I fancied us from that point.”\n\nHowe was right to be confident. Six minutes later Angelo Ogbonna tripped Brooks on the right. Ryan Fraser clipped the free-kick into the middle and it summed up West Ham’s day that it was Ogbonna who failed to stop Cook from heading the cross past Fabianski."}, {"date": "18/08/2018", "arena":

a derby to have the juices flowing, but also a vindication of all the downbeat caution expressed publicly by Maurizio Sarri and Unai Emery through the campaign’s early days.\n\nChelsea, so relieved to have a player of Eden Hazard’s calibre to fling on and make a difference, triumphed at Arsenal’s expense but, for all the blistering entertainment this derby whipped up, it also provided evidence aplenty as to why these teams are outsiders in the title race.\n\nMaurizio Sarri emerges with points from new boys’ wild helter-skelter | Amy Lawrence Read more\n\nThe chaos of the opening period summed it up. Whether it was Arsenal obligingly presenting their hosts with a healthy lead or, having revived, carving them open at will only to fluff their lines in front of goal, or Chelsea wilting at the back as if defensive responsibilities had been discarded with Antonio Conte, deficiencies were to the fore.\n\nSarri declared the last 15 minutes of the first half “horrible” and time in which it would have been “better to go for a cigarette”. The confusion made for a frenzied match but both managers appeared to age in their dugouts at the glorious mess they were witnessing. What ultimately set Sarri’s team apart was the magician on the bench to whom they could turn.\n\nHazard returned late from the World Cup and had spent most of the contest clad in his tracksuit, trotting up and down the touchline while suffering the goading of the travelling Arsenal fans behind one goal. There had been a period this summer when Chelsea, expecting Real Madrid to formalise interest in their prized asset, had fretted over the 27-year-old’s future at the club.\n\nSarri had admitted as much on the eve of the game, with Hazard having suggested on the conclusion of Belgium’s World Cup campaign that the time might be right to move on. Yet here he was still in blue, asked to restore some order with 29 minutes remaining, and driving Arsenal deeper and deeper into their shells at the end.\n\nIt was his isolation of the visitors’ panicked substitute, Alexandre Lacazette, which was key to coaxing Chelsea’s winner. Hazard darted to the byline far too easily beyond the static forward and, while Arsenal desperately attempted to clutter the penalty area with bodies, Marcos Alonso meandered on to the cutback to finish past Petr Cech.\n\nChelsea 3-2 Arsenal: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nHazard, not content with that impact alone, would force his former teammate into two smart saves in what time remained, and should have supplied Olivier Giroud with another. “I’d rather be out on the pitch than watching from the bench,” he offered through a smile. “But, when I did come on, I did good.”\n\nLife without Hazard is unthinkable, and the club’s priority should be to convince him to buy into Sarri’s project and commit to the club. All that talk of a £300,000-a-week contract has gone rather quiet.\n\nSarri is already acutely aware of Hazard’s significance to this team’s good health. How Emery, slumping into his dugout as his side were breached for a third time, must wish he had a game-changer who could provide similar gloss to his own work in progress.\n\nArsenal, soundly beaten by Manchester City last Sunday, have now lost their opening two top-flight fixtures for the first time since 1992, though the new manager will still cling to the positives from this occasion. Some of their approach play in that opening period had been scintillating, and far too good for Chelsea to repel, for all that it was also undermined by profligacy.\n\nThey would score twice, through Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s skimmed finish and Alex Iwobi’s shot from the Armenian’s cutback, and took heart from the recovery, but it was the memory of all the misses that lingered.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang reacts after missing an open goal. Less than a minute later Chelsea were 2-0 up. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Mkhitaryan and Iwobi would all sky shots over the bar from around the penalty spot. Other fine opportunities were spurned by Mesut Özil and Aubameyang – who will surely score far harder chances this season – with such wastefulness combining with uncertainty at the back as to have alarm bells ringing early. There are already question marks over both centre‑halves and whether they possess the pace to thrive in Emery’s high‑press system.\n\nLikewise, discipline was lacking at times. Héctor Bellerín, such a threat in the attacking third, was upfield and absent as Jorginho slid Alonso free early on. The Spaniard’s centre was converted crisply by his compatriot Pedro in the centre.\n\nHarry Kane breaks August goal drought in Tottenham win over Fulham Read more\n\nThen there was the ease with which Álvaro Morata trundled on to César Azpilicueta’s lofted pass over Nacho Monreal – maintaining the Spanish theme – to score for only the second time in the Premier League since Boxing Day.\n\n“Calm,” preached Emery. “I know we need to improve things and push the players to work. But, for me, the team competed well and had chances in the match.”\n\nNeither side expect to challenge for the title. Sarri admitted that starkly – “No, not in this moment” – in the aftermath of this victorious start to life at Stamford Bridge.

The first one was thoroughly convincing. West Ham United were swatted aside as Liverpool recorded their biggest opening day win at Anfield for 86 years. With four goals on the board, and Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané on the scoresheet, Klopp’s team slipped back into the old routine seamlessly.\n\nA reassuring sense of the familiar was provided by Salah, who opened the scoring before Mané struck twice and Daniel Sturridge registered with with his first touch after replacing the Egypt forward. Liverpool scored four or more goals 14 times last season – a record bettered only once in the club’s history in 1895‑96 – and this was their biggest opening day victory on home soil since Wolves were beaten 5-1 in 1932. Liverpool ended that season in 14th place. It does not rate as the boldest prediction to state that will not be the case this time.\n\nJoe Hart clean sheet helps Burnley hold off Southampton surge Read more\n\nFor Manuel Pellegrini and his new-look team this was a punishing afternoon. They will not be the last to suffer at Anfield in the months ahead and judgment on West Ham’s prospects must be reserved given Liverpool’s evident superiority. “It was a tough game before the game, during the game and after the game,” said the West Ham manager. “Before the game because we knew we were playing one of the best teams in the Premier League. During the game we had two or three clear chances to make it 1‑1 in the first half but came in 2‑0 down. The third goal was offside but I am not complaining because they deserved to win.”\n\nLiverpool fielded two new additions in the impressive Naby Keïta and the underemployed Alisson and continued where they left off by dominating and demoralising their opponents. West Ham, with five of their summer signings in the starting XI, looked sharp and threatening only in flashes. They spent most of the contest pinned on the edge of their penalty area and relying on a well-drilled offside trap to frustrate Salah and company. It succeeded early on but never looked likely to succeed completely. The breach was inevitable as the identity of the man who launched Liverpool’s season.\n\nIf there is a pressure on Salah to reproduce the phenomenal form that yielded 44 goals for Liverpool last term then he appears extremely comfortable with it. The forward oozed confidence throughout pre-season and needed 19 minutes to reopen his Premier League account. A tap-in from two yards was the end-product of a fine team goal with Liverpool working the ball out of defence and Keïta driving through midfield before releasing Andy Robertson on the left of the area. The full-back delivered his low cross to perfection and there was Salah at the back post to convert.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Naby Keïta takes on West Ham’s Andriy Yarmolenko during an excellent debut for Liverpool. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLukasz Fabianski saved well when Trent Alexander-Arnold curled a free-kick towards his top corner. Georginio Wijnaldum prodded wide after Keïta had weaved his way through several challenges in the area. The West Ham keeper also produced a point-blank save to deny Salah after another excellent Liverpool move around the box when Roberto Firmino escaped to the byeline.\n\nLiverpool 4-0 West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe visitors had opportunities to lift the siege but Marko Arnautovic dragged two decent openings wide. His first came from a long ball played over Joe Gomez by Angelo Ogbonna, and a deflection off the Liverpool defender brought a corner that Fabián Balbuena headed straight at Alisson. His second stemmed from the referee Anthony Taylor, who inadvertently blocked Wijnaldum’s attempted pass and was spared further embarrassment by the striker’s wayward finish. Rare opportunities that West Ham could ill-afford to squander.\n\nLiverpool scored a second in first- half injury time when the visiting defence switched off. Robertson was again instrumental, the left-back floating a delivery to the back post after Salah’s attempt was blocked, and James Milner reacted quicker than any opponent to ghost in and pull the ball back from the by-line. Mané was one of three Liverpool players left unmarked behind the West Ham defence and he diverted the ball into an empty net.\n\nMichail Antonio hooked an awkward volley over Alisson’s crossbar moments after the restart but Pellegrini’s attempts to turn the tide by introducing Robert Snodgrass for Declan Rice, then Javier Hernández and Andriy Yarmolenko, were to no avail. Liverpool continued to pour forward and, though a third goal was a fair reflection of the game, Mané was offside when he extended the advantage.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe Senegal international’s second of the afternoon owed much to the ingenuity of Roberton Firmino, who cut across the West Ham defence before flicking a delightful pass to the unmarked striker. From an offside position Mané spun and fired low beyond Fabianski. It encapsulated West Ham’s visit that their appeals for a reprieve went unanswered.\n\nThere was still time for Sturridge to convert Milner’s corner at the back post with his first touch of the game.

It was certainly a better game than the scoreline suggests and Burnley return home from the South Coast after a week of extensive travels with a sense of satisfaction. For the hosts, meanwhile, feelings of disquiet will not be too far from the surface.\n\nThe visitors were the better side in this match. They controlled the first half at St Mary’s; their crisp passing football a pleasant surprise, their physical commitment nothing less than you would expect from Dyche’s side. They created several chances and should have scored at least once. It was only after another golden opportunity went begging at the start of the second half that Mark Hughes intervened, ditching the three-man defence that had scrapped Saints to safety last season and securing a point from this match in the process.\n\nSouthampton hopeful of major net contribution from Danny Ings Read more\n\n“The only thing I would say is that they’ve had a change of shape to the team and we wondered if we could catch them,” said Dyche when asked about his approach to the match. “We thought OK: what can we do? We didn’t go far away from what we believe in and I was really pleased with that. All you can do is prepare properly, which we did, and the balance today was in our favour.”\n\nMaking just four changes from Thursday eight’s encounter with Istanbul Basaksehir in the Europa League qualifying rounds, Dyche saw his men react to the opening whistle like greyhounds catching sight of a lure. They had a goal disallowed in debatable fashion in the seventh minute, Jack Cork adjudged offside after curling his shot inside the far post from 10 yards (“I’m a fan of VAR,” said Dyche). Minutes later, Alex McCarthy had to dash from his line to deny Aaron Lennon after a simple flick over the top had caused chaos in the Southampton backline. The Saints keeper finished the half turning Jeff Hendrick’s effort round the post from a similar distance. These were all good chances.\n\nHughes said he spoke to his team at half-time about raising the tempo, putting more pressure on the visitors in possession, particularly in midfield. When the game resumed, however, there was still no sign of it, but an injury to new signing Stuart Armstrong just minutes into the half forced Hughes’s hand. He made a double substitution, with more summer additions in the shape of Danny Ings and Mohamed Elyounoussi entering the fray. The formation switched to a 4-4-2. Suddenly Southampton were asking questions of their guests.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nBoth subs made an impact, but Ings in particular looked sharp. He found space across the pitch, even in Burnley’s typically congested 18-yard box. In the 72nd minute the on-loan Liverpool man drifted out of the area and chipped a great ball to the back post. The defender, now full-back, Jack Stephens, got the ball under control but Joe Hart got down to block the resulting shot. There was also a scramble after Ben Mee’s header had to be cleared off his own line by Ashley Westwood, but Stephens’s chance was Southampton’s best effort. A second clean sheet in two Burnley appearances was never really in doubt for Hart.\n\n“We finished stronger than we started,” said Hughes who kicked a water bottle during the game – a reprimandable offence under new Premier League rules – but avoided incurring a warning. “Perhaps there was some apprehension ahead of a new season, ahead of a match against good opposition who will test you. But we couldn’t get our pressing right, we were erring on side of safety. After we made the changes we had total control of the second half and created plenty of chances.

The fixture list was unkind to the new Arsenal manager and Pep Guardiola’s team duly continued where they left off last season, winning with something to spare and providing confirmation that it will require an exceptional effort from any other team to deny them another league title.\n\nBy the time it was all done Emery had become the first Arsenal manager to lose his opening game since Terry Neill took charge of a team that went down 1-0 to Bristol City at Highbury in August 1976. It was the first time since 1936 that City have won back-to-back away matches against these opponents in the top division and perhaps the most startling part, as far as the other title challengers are concerned, is that it was achieved with Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sané restricted to substitute roles, no place for Vincent Kompany or Nicolás Otamendi and David Silva working on his fitness back in Manchester. It is a frightening level of squad depth.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read more\n\nFor now at least Guardiola is going through his own period of experimentation. Bernardo Silva justified his selection with a peach of a goal and some brilliantly subtle link-up play. Raheem Sterling’s goal came from the left wing, rather than his usual position on the right, switching flanks so Riyad Mahrez could be accommodated. The fit-again Bernard Mendy was among the game’s outstanding performers and, on this evidence, City’s new central defensive partnership of John Stones and Aymeric Laporte will take some shifting.\n\nGuardiola’s side did not reach their most exhilarating peaks but it was still fairly convincing and the awkward truth, in these getting‑to‑know-you stages with Emery, is that it was difficult at times to understand what Arsène Wenger’s successor was thinking.\n\nArsenal’s supporters will have known their new manager wanted to do things differently. What they perhaps could not have imagined was that he would start with Aaron Ramsey operating as a centre-forward, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on the right of the front three and Mesut Özil in a much more withdrawn role than usual.\n\nQuick guide Arsenal player ratings Show Hide Peter Cech His fine saves gave a level of respectability to the scoreline, for all that his distribution felt risky. 6 Héctor Bellerín Thankless task as City overloaded on the wing.

Other changes followed, yet none had any real effect. It all felt rather chaotic and jumbled and it was tempting to wonder whether the crowd would have been so understanding if Wenger had been responsible for these tactics. A new manager always gets a bit of leeway and, in this case, that is just as well.\n\nAt least Emery will have a better idea now why these sides were separated by 37 points last season and of the shortcomings in his side’s defence. Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi frequently looked vulnerable as Arsenal’s new centre-back pairing. Héctor Bellerín found Sterling a difficult opponent and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, deputising for Nacho Monreal at left-back, lasted only 35 minutes before picking up an injury of his own. That meant Stephan Lichtsteiner, a right-back by trade, coming off the bench to join an experimental back line. Emery will need time to achieve a more settled dynamic.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nIn the meantime he will have to analyse whether it might be time to ease Petr Cech out of the team. Cech did produce a splendid save in the second half to deny Sergio Agüero in a one-on-one breakaway but the Arsenal No 1 was also badly at fault for the opening goal and, not for the first time, there was clear evidence that he is no longer the goalkeeper he once was. Bernd Leno joined the club from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer because of that exact point and, unfortunately for Cech, these are not new concerns.\n\nThe only possible mitigation for Sterling’s goal, 14 minutes in, was that Cech was slightly unsighted as the City attacker, cutting in from the left, eluded a couple of wishy-washy challenges and fired a right-foot shot through a congested penalty area.\n\nThe ball was near enough to Cech to be saved but his reflexes were poor and there was an even more startling moment, midway through the first half, when a pass was played back to the goalkeeper and he tried to switch play to the right, got it horribly wrong and nearly put the ball in his own net.\n\nJoe Hart keeps another clean sheet as Burnley frustrate Southampton Read more\n\nCech was lucky to get away with conceding a corner, rather than scoring a comedic own-goal, and on the next occasion he found one of his teammates there were ironic cheers. Much more of this and Emery will surely have to conclude it is time for Leno to get a chance. Arsenal’s next game is at Chelsea, Cech’s former club, and it will be intriguing to see what the new manager decides.\n\nIn all it was not a hugely encouraging start to the post-Wenger era at Arsenal and Mattéo Guendouzi, a 19-year-old central midfielder, found out the hard way that playing against City is a lot different from turning out for Lorient in the French second division.\n\nGuendouzi did show some neat touches but he and Bellerín were guilty of losing Sterling before the opening goal and it was the teenager’s mistake that let Agüero run free later in the match. Cech saved that one but in City’s next attack Mendy exchanged passes with Sterling before sending over a low cross from the left. Silva swivelled to strike the ball first time and send an elegant, left-footed shot into the top corner. The ball was still rising as it hit the net and City will take some stopping."}, {"date": "11/08/2018", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51749, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle

led to the government receiving an emergency $50bn International Monetary Fund bailout. It makes the UK’s own travails seem rather tame but Tottenham’s manager has nevertheless said he feels “sorry for the English people” as Brexit looms. Moreover, Pochettino blames the Leave vote for the fall in the pound which prompted a rise in the costs of building the new White Hart Lane and, apparently, precipitated his club’s failure to buy a single player during the transfer window.\n\nEven by football manager standards it is a creative excuse but the good news is that Pochettino is infinitely more convincing as a coach than an economist, and his young squad were arguably not really in need of reinforcement anyway.\n\nHuddersfield v Chelsea, Fulham v Palace and more: Saturday clockwatch – live! Read more\n\nAlthough Spurs were most definitely not at their best in the warm Tyneside sunshine they still enjoyed an opening-day victory, with Jan Vertonghen and the quietly impressive Dele Alli both scoring on an afternoon of excellent crosses, towering headers and dodgy defensive cameos.\n\n“Newcastle showed massive energy and it was difficult for us but I feel so proud,” said Pochettino, whose side included five players, Harry Kane among them, who resumed training only last Monday after returning from post-World Cup holidays. “Everyone showed their commitment to the club.”\n\nTottenham’s manager looked irked when someone suggested the hard-working if seemingly ring-rusty Kane had lost his edge. The England striker “is at his best”, Pochettino replied, “but Harry can’t score a hat-trick every week”.\n\nRafael Benítez said he believed Newcastle at least deserved a draw. He did, though, acknowledge that merely competing with Spurs necessitated his team being at full throttle throughout. “A difference of quality made the difference between the teams,” explained the home manager pointedly. “When you have money and you buy players you buy quality.”\n\nThe day began with Newcastle fans staging a protest against Mike Ashley’s stewardship of the club outside a city centre outlet of his Sports Direct chain, chanting: “We want Ashley out.” Although the distribution of 200 chocolate bars to shop workers by the organisers emphasised the demonstration’s peaceful nature, targeting Ashley’s business signified an escalation of long-festering discontent. It seems a transfer market profit of around £20m was a watershed for protestors who want to see Benítez receive the funding required to pursue silverware.\n\nFor now Newcastle’s manager says avoiding relegation is the target and he looked suitably dismayed as Spurs took a ninth-minute lead from a corner. Christian Eriksen’s outswinger was flicked on by Davinson Sánchez for Vertonghen to direct a header against the underside of the bar. Goalline technology confirmed the ball crossed the line.\n\nJoselu equalised within three minutes. The Spanish striker – preferred, controversially, to the West Brom loanee Salomón Rondón – was cued up by a fabulous left-footed, right-wing Matt Ritchie cross. Joselu dodged the suddenly dozy Sánchez before powering a header beyond Hugo Lloris. The intense glare Pochettino shot his errant centre-half spoke volumes. The same applied to Ritchie’s expression when he was later replaced by Christian Atsu and was caught on camera mouthing an expletive.\n\nSpurs restored their lead thanks to the defensively vulnerable Serge Aurier’s excellent cross and a fine header from Alli, who timed his late run to perfection. That goal prompted yet another glare, this time directed at DeAndre Yedlin by Martin Dubravka. Alli’s clever movement had thoroughly deceived the former Spurs right-back.\n\nNewcastle United 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAlmost imperceptibly Pochettino’s players took their foot off the pedal and regressed. Where previously they had manipulated the ball with dexterity and calmed Newcastle’s ferocious tempo now every other pass suddenly seemed badly weighted. Benítez’s players duly forced their way back into things and Mo Diamé’s 12-yard left-foot shot hit a post.\n\nA fine Joselu through-ball might have created a goal for the Brazilian Kenedy, had the Chelsea loanee’s touch not let him down.

Ryan Fraser and Callum Wilson, who had a first-half penalty saved, swept home to register their first opening-day win since 2015, but for Cardiff this was a reminder of the size of the task at hand.\n\nWarnock said his squad were still pinching themselves following promotion. A palpable naivety and a bluntness in attack, as the Cardiff manager had feared, ultimately came back to bite them. “I thought they were a little bit more clinical than us, but overall I’ve got to be pleased with that,” said Warnock. “I thought we went right until the end and I’m disappointed one or two things didn’t go for us. At the start of the game one or two were really nervous, but as the game wore on we thought: ‘Bloody hell, we haven’t got to fear anything really.’ A little bit more clinical, a little bit more quality in certain areas, and I think we could have tested them a lot more. But that has to be worked on, really.”\n\nHuddersfield v Chelsea, Fulham v Palace and more: Saturday clockwatch – as it happened Read more\n\nThey may be reunited in the same division but these teams are at different junctures of their Premier League odysseys. This is Bournemouth’s fourth consecutive top-flight season and the last time Cardiff won this fixture in a league match, in 2002, Eddie Howe and his assistant manager, Jason Tindall, were at the heart of the defence.\n\nThis summer Warnock was blown out of the water in pursuit of his primary target, Jefferson Lerma, who joined Bournemouth for a club record £25m, with Cardiff spending little more than that on six new faces. Harry Arter, a deadline-day arrival from Bournemouth, was ineligible to play against his parent club and Warnock, reluctant to rock the boat, handed only the bustling Bobby Reid his bow from the off.\n\nHowe, meanwhile, stuck with the same team that mesmerised Marseille here last weekend, allowing David Brooks to dance through his debut in front of the Wales manager, Ryan Giggs.\n\nOnce Bournemouth got into their stride they were difficult to stop. Wilson bamboozled Sol Bamba before jinking inside and firing wide and then Joshua King nutmegged Joe Bennett to make a surge into the box. Cardiff did not heed the warnings, though; Wilson faced up Bruno Manga before sliding the ball across to Fraser, who arrived late to tuck it home.\n\nWolves, Fulham and Cardiff: the best-prepared trio of promoted clubs ever? Read more\n\nAs much as Bournemouth probed in search of a second, had they prospered from 12 yards it would have been harsh. Wilson won a soft penalty, tumbling after a brush with Manga’s right boot, but the Cardiff goalkeeper, Neil Etheridge, went the right way, diving low to his left to keep the visitors in touch. That was a dose of justice for Cardiff but Warnock had to find a way to hurt an otherwise unblemished Bournemouth back line, having failed to register a shot on target until long after the hour mark.\n\nHe summoned Josh Murphy and Danny Ward from the bench and the former immediately had the hosts on the ropes. Junior Hoilett swung in a dangerous corner, with Murphy hooking the ball goalwards and, with the Cardiff captain Sean Morrison lurking, Asmir Begovic, the Bournemouth goalkeeper, intervened to clamber the ball to safety. The same Cardiff recipe conjured up more problems moments later, when Hoilett swung in a deep corner and Morrison nodded across goal.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nCardiff never caved in, and could count themselves unlucky when Hoilett tricked his way past Dan Gosling without winning a foul late on. Reid, too, was cruelly pulled up for a challenge on Fraser. But just as the fourth official had indicated five minutes of stoppage time, Simon Francis teed up Wilson to roll home and seal a near-perfect start.\n\nFor Cardiff, this proved a punishing Premier League homecoming. “This league is so tough, so unforgiving,” Howe said. “But they have got unique things about them, a way of playing that they stick to, a great team spirit and a very experienced manager. They have a lot of things going for them and I wouldn’t write anybody off after the first game.”"}, {"date": "11/08/2018", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 24821, "home_team": {"name":

return, the raucous and joyful pre-match atmosphere an outpouring of four years of frustration spent on the outside looking in. Yet, where Fulham showcased some of the qualities which had helped them thrive in the second tier, this ended something more akin to a wake-up call: an education in just how unforgiving this division can be.\n\nRoy Hodgson, who had taken Fulham to a Uefa Cup final, offered Slavisa Jokanovic a hug on the final whistle as the home side digested the defeat. They could bemoan the non-award of a penalty after Mamadou Sakho went to ground on the hour mark and appeared to take André Schürrle with him. They could curse Wayne Hennessey, often much maligned, for a flurry of smart saves. But they would also acknowledge that Palace, weathering an early storm and then picking their opponents apart as soon as the tempo dropped, ended up comfortable. None of their own summer signings had started. Familiarity did them some good.\n\nFulham are not at that stage yet and their lavish transfer outlay – Shahid Khan was in the stands here to witness what his £100m had bought – will surely yield rewards. They had six debutants in their starting lineup, and only three players who had previously played in the Premier League. While they whipped up that feverish opening, with Jean Michaël Seri making his mark, that disruption in personnel did not seem so much of a problem.\n\nBut as soon as Palace forced their way ahead, reality started to bite. “We showed some positive things but need to improve many things too,” said Jokanovic. “We were up against more power, more speed and more quality.”\n\nIt might have been different had Mike Dean penalised Sakho for diving in on Schürrle, but the referee’s extravagant denial rather summed up Fulham’s afternoon: dramatic but unfulfilling. Wilfried Zaha should have doubled Palace’s lead moments later, but it mattered not. When the outstanding Aaron Wan-Bissaka held off Aleksandar Mitrovic’s challenge 10 minutes from time to burst upfield and slip the Ivorian free, Palace had their opportunity. Zaha took a touch to create a kinder angle as Fabri sprinted out to block, then slid his team’s second under the goalkeeper and in.\n\nIt had taken Palace until mid-October to register even a goal, let alone a point, last season, but this was a team maintaining momentum. A fourth win in succession either side of the summer had a familiar feel, with their collective laced with pace and power, and Wan-Bissaka, an England under-20 international who successfully doused the threat posed by Ryan Sessegnon for long periods, a revelation from right-back.\n\nYet retaining Zaha this summer was Palace’s best business. “Many teams have a player who is a talisman and upon whom they depend,” said Hodgson. “I wonder if Pep Guardiola, Mauricio Pochettino and José Mourinho have to ask the same question about their Kanes, De Bruynes and Hazards. We are lucky to have a game-changer like they have.”\n\nTheir opening goal had been plucked from Fulham possession and pressure. Even with six debutants in their lineup, and Mitrovic a seventh after completing a permanent move from Newcastle, the hosts had carried a threat. The Serb would twice be denied by Hennessey. Some of Fulham’s upbeat attacking play had been excellent, particularly when Sessegnon squeezed space from Wan-Bissaka, or when Tom Cairney liberated runners beyond Patrick van Aanholt on the opposite flank.\n\nYet, where Championship opponents might have wilted, Palace held firm. Sakho and James Tomkins have now played alongside each other 13 times and have yet to endure defeat. Frustration was starting to mount when, four minutes from the break, Palace built patiently from the back and Fulham failed to sense the threat. Van Aanholt slipped a pass in to Jeffrey Schlupp who, having squeezed a yard of space from Calum Chambers with his first touch, rasped a finish from a narrow angle up and beyond Fabri at his near post.\n\nFulham will improve as their new recruits gel. Two of their lineup here had had a solitary training session with new team-mates. “Look, I’m confident still,” added Jokanovic. “I trust we will play better than we played today. We’ll work hard and adapt ourselves for the games ahead. We must be optimists and trust in ourselves.” They can learn from this."}, {"date": "11/08/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24121, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Terence Kongolo", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philip Billing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Diakhaby", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramadan Sobhi Ahmed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rajiv van La Parra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Stankovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Kepa Arrizabalaga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jorginho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "That will do for starters. Chelsea were far from perfect, even shaky at times during the first half, but they improved as the game progressed and made off with maximum points from their first league match under Maurizio Sarri. N’Golo Kanté, Jorginho and Pedro scored and the visitors could have added more goals but Huddersfield had their moments, too, and there were times when Sarri seemed to chew particularly hard on the item he had in his mouth throughout the match, which looked suspiciously like a cigarette filter.\n\n“If you look at the result you think about an easy game but in the first half we were in trouble against a very physical team,” admitted Sarri. “The best part was we showed our capacity to suffer. Then in the second half the opponents were a bit tired and it was easier.”\n\nThe last match between these teams concluded with Huddersfield celebrating rapturously, as May’s 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge confirmed they would compete in the Premier League again this season. Survival is their primary aim again and this was a reminder that the challenge remains formidable. They played well but were well beaten. Yet there were moments when another upset seemed feasible. “If you want to create a sensation you need the small margins to go for you but they did not,” said the manager, David Wagner.\n\nMaurizio Sarri believes he will need time to transform Chelsea Read more\n\nThe goalkeeping debutants highlighted the difference in the way these clubs operate. Ben Hamer made his first appearance for Huddersfield following his free transfer from Leicester City while Chelsea gave an immediate start to Kepa Arrizabalaga after this week’s world record £71.6m move from Athletic Bilbao. The visitors also gave a Premier League debut to Jorginho, who struggled during last Sunday’s Community Shield after joining from Napoli for £50m. That is more than Huddersfield’s total outlay on eight summer signings. And, of course, Chelsea had a recently crowned world champion in their ranks, though few would have foreseen Kanté opening the scoring. Yet that is what the Frenchman did, finding the net in the 34th minute to claim his first goal in nearly a year.\n\nPerhaps Sarri did envisage that. The manager assigned Kanté a slightly more advanced role than he has filled in previous seasons, appointing Jorginho as the deep scavenger in Chelsea’s midfield trio and allowing Kanté to probe down the right, often combining with Pedro. The breakthrough goal came, however, after a period in which Chelsea’s midfield had been overrun by their more dynamic hosts.\n\nHuddersfield had also made regular incursions down the flanks, as Florent Hadergjonaj and Chris Löwe exposed Chelsea’s back four, with Marcos Alonso in particular difficulty.\n\nThe visitors were lucky not to concede a penalty when David Luiz handled after trying to use Alex Pritchard as a springboard as he leapt for a header. The referee decided the Chelsea defender had been fouled, a decision he might have reversed with the benefit of VAR.\n\nUp until then Arrizabalaga had been the busier of the two keepers, slashing at a couple of attempted clearances and making a routine stop from a shot by Pritchard. Despite their spluttering, Chelsea took the lead 10 minutes before the break.\n\nPremier League 2018-19 preview No 10: Huddersfield Town Read more\n\nThe move that created the opportunity was slick even if Kanté’s finish was scruffy. Jorginho began it in midfield before Pedro fed Willian, who skittered down the left before crossing. Kanté mishit a volley from nine yards, perplexing the keeper and sending the ball bouncing into the bottomcorner.\n\nHuddersfield almost equalised within two minutes but Steve Mounié’s terrificheader rebounded out off the inside of the post – small margins.\n\nChelsea struck again just before the interval thanks to their best move of the half. Jorginho and Barkley combined on the edge of the area to slip the ball through to Alonso, who had made a burst into the box. Christopher Schindler tried to poke the ball off the left-back’s foot as he shot but the referee judged that he caught the player. Jorginho ignored the boos to convert the penalty with outrageous audacity, duping Hamer with a delicious feint before rolling the ball into the net.\n\nFor the second half Wagner introduced Laurent Depoitre, who scored against Chelsea in both matches last season. But the visitors had found a groove and never looked like losing their lead. Antonio Rüdiger tried to increase it but Hamer pushed away his header from a corner. Two minutes later another header by Rüdiger was going wide until Alonso hooked it against the bar. Alonso threatened again from a long-range free-kick, missing by a couple of yards. Sarri’s side were not quite dominant but were definitely the more dangerous, and there was no need for the manager to disrupt Eden Hazard’s rest on the bench until the 76th minute.\n\nThat was in response to a spurt by Huddersfield, for whom Mounié went close with another header. It took less than five minutes for Hazard to make an impact. After receiving the ball he skedaddled forward and flipped it through to Pedro, who finished with a neat dink over the advancing Hamer."}, {"date": "11/08/2018", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20051, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [35, 54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Masina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ken Sema", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [26]}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Fernandes da Silva Junior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [18], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}], "subs": [{"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [26], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yves Bissouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jürgen Locadia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Balogun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Button", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "If, as most bookmakers have predicted, this is the season Watford’s stay in the Premier League comes to an end, then somebody had better tell their players. Judging by the manner of their victory here, they have not seen the odds or have done so and been fuelled by a sense of defiance.\n\nJavi Gracia’s men fully deserved to get their fourth successive top-flight campaign off to a perfect start, having delivered a display against Brighton & Hove Albion brimming with intensity, togetherness and, from the feet of Roberto Pereyra, eye-catching quality. The Argentinian forward scored both of Watford’s goals with a level of expertise and panache that suggests two years after arriving from Juventus for a fee of £13m and amid much expectation he is finally ready to deliver on a consistent basis.\n\n“He doesn’t surprise me with what he did; he is able to do it,” said Gracia of his match-winner. “He’s a high-quality player and important for us.”\n\nHuddersfield v Chelsea, Fulham v Palace and more: Saturday clockwatch – as it happened Read more\n\nPereyra’s importance to Watford has grown following the departure of Richarlison to Everton and the club’s failure to sign a much-needed striker during the summer. And while it remains too early to judge the impact he will have this campaign, the signs on a cool summer’s afternoon in Hertfordshire were undeniably encouraging.\n\nThe 27-year-old forward was a penetrative presence from the left side of a 4-2-2-2 formation and more than made that felt on 35 minutes with what has to go down as an immediate contender for goal of the season.\n\nLurking in space at the far side of Brighton’s area, Pereyra waited for José Holebas’s left-wing cross following a short corner from Abdoulaye Doucouré to reach him. As soon as it did, he lashed a right-footed volley past Mat Ryan that was as venomous as it was accurate, rising at speed into the top corner of the net. Ryan was able to get a hand to the ball but powerless to keep it out.\n\nPereyra’s second goal, a curling finish into the far corner of the net from an acute angle on the left side of Brighton’s area, was not as breathtaking as his first but still deserves admiration and, crucially, it all but sealed victory for Watford with more than half an hour remaining.\n\n“It is important to start with a win but the way we did it was more important for us,” said Gracia. “We played really well, not only with the ball but also without the ball. We showed quick reactions and played as a team.”\n\nSummer transfer window verdict: how every Premier League club fared Read more\n\nWatford were stronger than Brighton in every department, with the power and purpose displayed by Doucouré and Étienne Capoue in central midfield and the persistence and link-up play of Troy Deeney and Andre Gray up front particularly impressive. Doucouré’s performance was especially noteworthy given the midfielder, Watford’s player of the 2017-18 season, came into this contest having not featured for a single minute of pre-season due to appendicitis.\n\nWatford’s run of season-opening games without defeat has now stretched to 12, yet it would be wise for everyone at the club to keep feet on the ground for there is no doubt that tougher days lie ahead. Here they faced startlingly lacklustre and disjointed opponents in Brighton and it was telling that Ben Foster, the only one of Watford’s summer’s arrivals to be named in Gracia’s starting XI, did not have to deal with a single shot on target from those in white and blue.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n“I have no complaints with the result. We lost to the better side,” said Chris Hughton, the Brighton manager. “We knew this was going to be an intense game and we never had an effect on it, which is obviously a concern.”\n\nHughton gave a start to one of his summer acquisitions, the Brazilian full-back Bernardo, and brought on another two in Yves Bissouma and the record signing, Alireza Jahanbakhsh. Bissouma was the only one who did anything of note, a low shot on 71 minutes that caused mild panic in Watford’s ranks, and overall this was an afternoon to forget for the visitors, especially as it contained a first-half hamstring injury to the captain, Bruno, that threatens his involvement in next week’s visit of Manchester United."}, {"date": "11/08/2018", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance":

A seesawing match packed with plenty of incident including a straight red card for Phil Jagielka and four goals ended in a draw after brilliant performances from two 21-year-olds on either side.\n\nMore than a few eyebrows were raised when Everton paid £40m to Watford to sign Richarlison a few weeks ago but the Brazilian showed exactly why he is rated so highly with two goals that seemed to have secured an opening day victory for his manager, Marco Silva.\n\nYet in Rúben Neves, who scored a stunning free-kick before setting up new boy Raúl Jiménez for a late equaliser to earn a deserved point for his side, Wolves have a real gem. Purchased for £15.6m from Porto last summer, despite his tender years Neves is already the fulcrum of the team built by Nuno Espírito Santo that, on this evidence, look good enough to do more than merely survive.\n\nWilfried Zaha seals Crystal Palace win and teaches Fulham harsh lesson Read more\n\nThe Wolves manager said: “Rúben has this kind of talent but it is all about the organisation of the team. That is what is fundamental to our side. He came last season and adapted well to English football but this is a player who was captain of a big club when he was 17. At 21 now he still has a lot of things to improve.”\n\nIn their first match in the top flight since 2012, Wolves fielded four new faces including goalkeeper Rui Patrício and João Moutinho in midfield, who boast almost 190 caps for Portugal between them. The club’s last Premier League campaign ended in relegation with 25 points after Mick McCarthy was sacked in February but – after the low point of spending a season in League One – Molineux is a different place these days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Richarlison scored two goals on debut for Everton. Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters\n\nFosun, the club’s Chinese owners who are estimated to be worth around £60bn and have a stake in super agent Jorge Mendes’s Gestifute company, already invested heavily in the playing squad before the arrival of the likes of Patrício, Moutinho and Adama Traoré, who joined from Middlesbrough for £18m this week. The intention – as witnessed by the fireworks that preceded kick-off here – is clearly to make quite a bang.\n\nSilva was taking charge of his first match after replacing Sam Allardyce at the end of May, having been unceremoniously dumped by Watford four months earlier, and was delighted to see Richarlison pounce in the 17th minute after some sloppy defending from a Leighton Baines free-kick.\n\nRoberto Pereyra double helps give Watford the perfect start Read more\n\nThat certainly was not in the script for the home supporters and Everton seemed to be coasting towards victory until disaster struck four minutes from half-time. Jagielka was under minimal pressure from Jota as he allowed a pass to run across his body but after a slip of concentration the former England defender was shown a red card for clumsily bringing down his opponent. “It was a really harsh decision,” said Silva. “Maybe the game would have been different if we had 11 men.” Neves stepped up and curled the resulting free-kick into the top corner to rub salt into their wounds.\n\nJordan Pickford will have been disappointed to have conceded after seeming to take a step in the opposite direction at the crucial moment, although there was no doubting the quality of the strike from a player who made a knack of scoring spectacular goals in the Championship last season. With Gylfi Sigurdsson sacrificed in favour of Mason Holgate in an attempt to shore up his defence, Everton retreated deep into their own half and it seemed only a matter of time until they conceded again. The Mexico striker Jiménez wasted the best chance when he failed to finish off Ryan Bennett’s superb through-ball, failing to find a way past Pickford as he charged off his line.\n\nThey were made to pay when Richarlison combined with Baines and Cenk Tosun to curl a wonderful finish into the corner of the net to set up a frantic finale. “We had very good organisation in the second half and looked like we could score more goals after that,” acknowledged Silva.\n\nIt was not to be. Espírito Santo threw on Léo Bonatini and Rúben Vinagre as Wolves poured forward in search of an equaliser and they were rewarded when Jiménez touched home another pinpoint cross from Neves 10 minutes from time.

They struggled to impose themselves for long spells against a robust and adventurous Leicester side and, briefly, it was a wave of apprehension engulfing the stadium when Jamie Vardy’s stoppage-time header gave the away side the opportunity to pull off a dramatic feat of escapology. The drama finished with a Leicester corner from which Kasper Schmeichel, their own goalkeeper, won the header, having made the kind of forward foray that must have reminded the Old Trafford crowd of his father’s time in the same profession. If that header had gone in, we can only imagine what Mourinho might have had to say afterwards.\n\nAs it was, he restricted himself to only a couple of veiled digs towards the club’s hierarchy – his latest line being that perhaps he should be known as a head coach, rather than the manager, if the club did not want to go after his transfer targets - and United could reflect on a satisfying though unspectacular evening’s work, as it often is on his watch. Paul Pogba, the game’s outstanding performer, carried on where he left off in the World Cup. Fred, the £52m acquisition from Shakhtar Donetsk, had a competent debut and Luke Shaw’s confidence should be soothed from hooking in the goal that ultimately decided the match.\n\nLeicester, meanwhile, have not started a top-division season with an away win since beating Aston Villa in 1933. They have won only one of their last ten opening-day fixtures and made life unnecessarily difficult for themselves with the silly handball from Daniel Amartey that gave Pogba the chance to open the scoring with a penalty inside the opening three minutes.\n\nManchester United veto José Mourinho’s transfer wishlist Read more\n\nAt other times, however, Claude Puel must have been encouraged by the way his team took the game to their opponents. Indeed, it would not have been absurd if the visitors had left with a draw bearing in mind the balance of play when the score was 1-0. James Maddison showed why his new employers were willing to pay £24m to sign him from Norwich City. Demarai Gray seemed keen to explore the theory that Matteo Darmian, deputising as United’s right-back, might be vulnerable and at one point late in the first half the away end could even be heard taunting Mourinho with the “park the bus” song favoured by Manchester City’s followers.\n\nIn truth, it was not quite that troublesome for the home team but, equally, United’s supporters might have been entitled to expect more from their players. Marcus Rashford, in particular, looked rusty. Alexis Sánchez has rarely shown Old Trafford the gifts he once displayed for Arsenal and perhaps it was inevitable that United would endure some difficult moments at the back bearing in mind their defence was made up of four players who were largely used as understudies last season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Pogba scores from the penalty spot after a slow, deliberate run-up, to give Manchester United the lead in the third minute at Old Trafford. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nHarry Maguire, one of the centre-backs Mourinho coveted over the summer, was playing for the opposition, reminding us why Gareth Southgate had eulogised in the World Cup about the player’s knack of “getting his bonce on everything.” Southgate was here, too, and no doubt will be pleased to see Shaw back in the United team, looking fit and confident. Yet the attention of the England manager might also have been drawn to the opposition left-back, Ben Chilwell, who had a fine game.\n\nShaw had one awkward moment when Vardy dispossessed him close to his own penalty area but he got away with that one and made amends in the 82nd minute by surging forwards, controlling Juan Mata’s pass and bustling past Ricardo Pereira before turning a diagonal shot past Schmeichel.\n\nManchester United v Leicester City: Premier League – live!

Wes Morgan got in the way of the shot but the next Leicester player to touch the ball did so by jutting out his arm to bring it under control. Pogba was wearing the captain’s armband in the absence of Antonio Valencia and, after one of the slowest run-ups imaginable, it was an elegantly struck penalty to send the ball into the top corner.\n\nPogba’s selection might have come as a surprise given that he returned from his post-World Cup break only four days earlier but that, perhaps, is the attitude that Mourinho wants to see from his most expensive player. Pogba lasted until the 84th minute and Mourinho described him as a “monster”. The nutmeg from Pogba on Ricardo Pereira was a joy. Andreas Pereira, back from his loan arrangement with Valencia, fitted in neatly as a deep-lying midfielder, but United were let down too often in attacking positions by their final pass. They won, and they were happy, but when Mourinho talked about the “complete performance‚“ he was meaning Shaw, rather than the team as a whole."}]
