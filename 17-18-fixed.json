The amount of effort, the amount of work, the discipline and dedication to the cause they’ve put in.”\n\nBurnley have been all but certain of finishing seventh for several weeks but have ended the season on a five-game winless run. Dyche added: “The last couple of weeks have been difficult because, whatever you think of players, there’s usually got to be some form of stimulus on the game. The players are human.

The home fans in the Holmesdale end waited until early in the second half to unfurl their banners of appreciation, with the ground then united in chorusing the former England manager’s name. He looked almost sheepish acknowledging all the adulation.\n\nManchester City hit 100 points with late Gabriel Jesus winner at Southampton Read more\n\nWest Bromwich Albion remember Hodgson fondly from his time at the Hawthorns, where he ensured survival and then consolidation over a 15-month tenure before taking up the reins of the national side. He has galvanised Palace in similar fashion, with a team who were goalless and pointless after seven matches ending the campaign outside the top half only on goal difference. The rise has been remarkable. Hodgson, Croydon-born and content in familiar surroundings, can plan progression from now.\n\nThe first task will be to guard against complacency. “We mustn’t start thinking that, just because we’ve finished 11th, that’s our level,” said Hodgson. “That has only really been a product of the last three games [which were all won] otherwise it might have been us going down, and not West Brom. So we have to plan and build on this success. We need a philosophy and a clear idea of where we want this club to go.”\n\nTalks with the sporting director, Dougie Freedman, will resume this week to plan for next term, with only Damien Delaney of those players out of contract on 1 July having confirmed he will depart. There must be resolution on the futures of Yohan Cabaye, Joel Ward, Bakary Sako, Julián Speroni and Lee Chung-yong. Ruben Loftus-Cheek will return to Chelsea, leaving a void to be filled in midfield.\n\nSign up for The Fiver and get our daily football email.\n\nIt would take a mind-blowing offer for Wilfried Zaha for Palace to consider selling their talisman. There is no desire to sell a player who is contracted to 2022 and without whom this team did not muster a point in the 10 games he missed this season. “I understand people coveting Wilfried, but he loves playing for the club, he’s a Croydon boy and I don’t think he’s going to jump at the first opportunity,” said Hodgson. “He knows full well the last thing on anyone’s mind here is letting him go. We don’t need to sell him.”\n\nTrue to form, it was Zaha who eventually opened the scoring here, converting the excellent Patrick van Aanholt’s centre as West Brom struggled to reorganise after the introduction of Christian Benteke. Van Aanholt would add a second soon after, following some slick close passing in a cramped penalty area, rounding Ben Foster to score for the third game in succession.\n\nManuel Lanzini double gives West Ham victory over lacklustre Everton Read more\n\nThat confirmed the only defeat of Darren Moore’s caretaker stewardship of Albion, but should not detract from the impact he and his staff have made over the last six weeks. “We’ve restored pride in the football club,” said the interim manager. “We stopped the rot and offered hard work and endeavour, and even provided a bit of a feel-good factor. We’ve seen that over the final six weeks of a very difficult campaign.”\n\nMoore is a leading candidate to take up the position on a full-time basis, with West Brom hoping to confirm an appointment before the end of the week.

Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang, the Frenchman’s last major signing at the club, made sure of that detail by stabbing into the net in the 38th minute.\n\nThe result may have been incidental to both teams but this was no non-event. It was most definitely a happening, a festival within a football fixture.\n\nLife down an Arsène Wenger YouTube rabbit hole at three in the morning Read more\n\nNearly 22 years ago Wenger arrived at Arsenal as a French revolutionary and here he sent out his troops for the final time before his status at the club changed to head off an ancien régime. Given the dietary advances that Wenger introduced to English football, there was an amusing irony to the fact that Arsenal were being hosted by a team whose preparations had involved going on the lash in London.\n\nHuddersfield fought hard all season for their right to party after Wednesday’s draw at Chelsea, the result that confirmed they will be in the Premier League next season. That is a resounding success for the Yorkshire club in view of how far they have travelled in a short time. So everyone, home and away fans alike, was in the mood to celebrate here. And everyone, home and away fans alike, stood to cheer and applaud Wenger as he walked across the pitch before kick-off to salute the travelling fans one last time. The atmosphere was mainly joyful but there was a touch of poignancy at that moment and, with the sun glowing and the sky nearly cloudless, no one could claim water in their eyes was rain. It was not even crocodile tears, mostly.\n\n“It was spontaneous,” the manager said of his pre-match greeting. “They had disagreements with me that I can accept but we had one thing in common: we loved Arsenal football club and I just wanted to share that with them.”\n\nThe noise from the crowd never abated, the entire match subsequently played out to a soundtrack of singing and clapping. David Wagner, the 14th full-time manager Huddersfield have employed since the beginning of Wenger’s reign, has awoken hopes of a glorious new era at the Yorkshire club, who have thrice in their history been English champions. That is the same number of league titles Wenger delivered to Arsenal so, when Huddersfield players gave him a guard of honour before this match, they did so as representatives of a club who know the value of his achievements.\n\nThe reason Wenger has been ushered towards stepping down, of course, is that those feats started to seem almost as distant as Huddersfield’s titles. His team pitched up here on the back of a dismal sequence of away performances. Could they rouse themselves to give their departing manager his first away league point of 2018?\n\nIt seemed not at first. Huddersfield, liberated from the threat of relegation, played with adventure and forced Arsenal back early on. They almost scored in the second minute when Florent Hadergjonaj crossed from the right and Steve Mounié leapt high to send a downward header towards goal. David Ospina needed two tries to hold it.\n\nMounié was given a better chance in the 11th minute, this time Alex Pritchard supplying the pass, but the striker slashed over the bar from eight yards. It took Arsenal half an hour to come to grips with the pace Huddersfield had set. Once they did so, they began to take over.\n\nTheir goal unfolded like a tribute to Wenger, Aubameyang scoring after the sort of cutting one-touch move that the manager has always espoused. Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alexandre Lacazette combined slickly to feed Aaron Ramsey, who passed across the face of goal for Aubameyang to convert.\n\nThat was his 10th in 13 matches since joining halfway through a season of upheaval. Signed by a manager on the way out, the Gabonese striker is central to Arsenal’s future.\n\nArsenal, the Arsène Wenger years - in pictures Read more\n\nThe hosts scavenged for chances on the break. They nearly found what they sought on the hour but Ospina dived low to the left to tip away a fierce shot from the edge of the area by Tom Ince.\n\nAs the intensity drained from the game Lacazette was presented with an opportunity to make matters even more comfortable for his team in the 79th minute. But Jonas Lössl read his mind and blocked his attempted dink. Two minutes later Arsenal missed another one-on-one chance, Lössl thwarting Danny Welbeck.

Mohamed Salah began an emphatic defeat of Brighton with a record 32nd goal of the league campaign and another Kop favourite, Andy Robertson, closed it with his first for the club. Anfield absorbed the exhibition in between.\n\nArsène Wenger gets a winning farewell with 1-0 to the Arsenal at Huddersfield Read more\n\n“The perfect finale to a very exciting, intense season,” said Jürgen Klopp. “We showed again the kind of football that we couldn’t in the last few games because the boys are human, not machines.”\n\nSalah’s contribution this season suggests otherwise. The Egypt international ended the afternoon with the Golden Boot, presented by Kenny Dalglish while his young daughter, Makka, enjoyed a kick-about, and as the most prolific goalscorer in a 38-game Premier League season, eclipsing Luis Suárez, Cristiano Ronaldo and Alan Shearer in the process.\n\nSalah has not been the only Liverpool player to deliver consistently when it mattered. Klopp’s team qualified for the Champions League for a second season running with an unbeaten home record. This sunny Sunday-afternoon stroll against Chris Hughton’s side was also the 14th occasion that Liverpool scored four or more goals in a game. Only once, in 1895-96, has that record been bettered.\n\nKlopp said of his leading goalscorer: “It’s fantastic what he has done. The last few weeks especially were difficult with every single day someone saying how brilliant you are and giving you an Oscar for this, an award for that, even getting out of the car without having an accident. This gives us a big boost. Imagine if the only chance to get into the Champions League was to win the Champions League final. That’s maybe not the best option to choose, but it’s exciting now.”\n\nMohamed Salah (@MoSalah) Golden Boot? Come here to daddy 😂 pic.twitter.com/GasYbIerEm\n\nBrighton, survival ensured and their own season a success, tried to deliver a contest but were outclassed to such an extent that their neat passing game was confined to their own penalty area. They had nowhere else to go. Liverpool laid siege to Mathew Ryan’s goal from the start with Klopp picking Dominic Solanke on top of his imperious front three and seeing his team take complete control. Only poor finishing, overelaboration and Kevin Friend’s aversion to giving penalties delayed the inevitable.\n\nThe referee was well-placed when Shane Duffy handled a cross and felled Salah but waved away both appeals. When Sadio Mané then shot straight at Ryan having been played clean through by the impressive Solanke it could have been a cue for apprehension among the home fans. But they appear immune to that these days. There is a belief in their team’s potency that the unerring accuracy of Salah has helped cement and the first time he found space inside a crowded Brighton area another record fell at his feet.\n\nSalah broke the Premier League scoring record when Trent Alexander-Arnold drove through the Brighton midfield and found Solanke on the edge of the area. The striker turned the ball on to Salah, who needed one touch to create space for a low left-foot finish. It was his 44th goal in total this season. A hat-trick against Real Madrid on 26 May will be required to equal Ian Rush’s all-time Liverpool record.\n\nDejan Lovren delivered the comfort of a two-goal lead with a towering header from Robertson’s inviting cross after Brighton cleared a corner but left the centre-half unmarked for the return ball. The cushion should have arrived earlier but Mané, having found himself through on goal once more, attempted to gift-wrap a second for Salah and enabled Ryan to intercept before Duffy blocked his second attempt on the goalline. Klopp went apoplectic in his technical area at Liverpool’s indulgence. It never seemed likely to cost them.\n\nManchester City hit 100 points with late Gabriel Jesus winner at Southampton Read more\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino wasted excellent chances before the break – several in the Brazilian’s case – but the scoreline offered a more accurate reflection of Liverpool’s dominance when Solanke struck his first league goal for the club. It was an excellent finish too, created by Salah, who took Firmino’s pass and evaded two challenges before releasing Solanke inside the area. The Chelsea graduate gave Ryan no chance with a powerful drive that flew in via the underside of the bar.\n\nTo cap a perfect afternoon for Klopp’s team the final goal of the home season fell to the popular Robertson, perfectly placed to open his Liverpool account after Danny Ings’ cross deflected into his path. Adding to the manager’s satisfaction was the complete absence of fatigue in his players, something that had slowed their approach to the finishing line, having had a week to prepare for Brighton. A fortnight before Kiev looks ideal.\n\n“A few people have asked me whether it’s too long but no, it’s perfect,” said Klopp. “It’s like a little pre-season for us. The boys need a little bit of rest. We will give them two days now and then we will go to a camp. We will not train high intensity, we will do a little tactical stuff, a little fitness work, keep them in shape and then we have five days to prepare for the last game. We are all happy about that.”"}, {"date": "13/05/2018", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75049, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [],

and final Manchester United game – barring an unlikely appearance in the FA Cup final against Chelsea on Saturday – featured a vintage moment via a superb pass that created Marcus Rashford’s first-half winner.\n\nThe midfielder had walked out to a guard of honour and on 80 minutes strode off the turf for the last time to a standing ovation. Carrick will join José Mourinho’s coaching staff, the Portuguese indicating he will one day be his new No 2, following Rui Faria’s departure in the summer.\n\nCarrick said: “I have to thank the manager an awful lot. It is an unbelievable opportunity for me. I look forward to learning off him, he is one of the very best. I am sure he will teach me a few things and we will have some success in the near future, I am certain of that. We will give everything we can to bring the FA Cup back here next week.”\n\nMourinho said: “I will organise my coaching staff in a way where the assistant manager figure doesn’t exist. I am going to have assistant coaches, I am going to have fitness coaches and a structure where they are specialists in different areas connected to the performance, and I’m not going to have an assistant managing in the sense of the word.\n\n“The particular reason is I think it will be Michael Carrick in the future when he has his badges, pro licence, when he makes the bridge between being a player to [an] assistant. Because people think it is just like one day I’m a player and the next I’m a coach. It is not like that.\n\n“I have nobody in the world of football ready to be my assistant manager, so I prefer to educate people to structure my staff in a way where there is education and improvement. I am going to improve my staff in the performance level and in relation to the tactical work, I am going to bring some people that until this moment have not come with me yet.”\n\nThis first home game since Sir Alex Ferguson’s brain haemorrhage featured a note of best wishes in the programme, and the home crowd rising midway through the second half while chanting: “Stand up for Alex Ferguson”.\n\nManuel Lanzini double gives West Ham victory over lacklustre Everton Read more\n\nVictory for United was their 25th in the league and took them to 81 points and with second place already secured thoughts turn to the Cup final, for which Anthony Martial is a doubt, though Romelu Lukaku will return to training this week following an ankle problem.\n\nMourinho made nine changes from Thursday’s goalless draw at West Ham, Scott McTominay and Alexis Sánchez surviving.\n\nThe headline news here was Martial’s unavailability because of a knee problem, with some confusion regarding whether he was seen driving from the ground just before kick-off.\n\nMourinho said: “He was injured, he was injured Friday training session, yesterday [Saturday] couldn’t train. He had treatment in the morning at the training ground and he stayed away [today]. I don’t know [about the final]. I know Romelu will be back for Tuesday and we have to see.”\n\nJavi Gracia’s selection showed three changes to their previous game, as Heurelho Gomes, Gerard Deulofeu and Richarlison came in for Orestis Karnezis, Étienne Capoue and Troy Deeney. Despite the defeat his side finished 14th and the Spaniard indicated he will remain in place next season. “I think so,” Gracia said.\n\nSign up for The Fiver and get our daily football email.\n\nCarrick’s first intervention was to slide in on Roberto Pereyra but he was left flailing as the visiting midfielder evaded the challenge and Watford turned defence into attack.\n\nUnited needed 11 minutes to claim a first corner.

Yet though the ball fell sweetly on his right boot, the Chilean’s volley was wide.\n\nNext came a moment that summed up United’s season. Mata hit Rashford first time along the right and he did the same, firing the ball into the area. It had Watford scrambling and stood out as a rare move of slickness and pace: a scarcity of this has proved the unwanted trademark of Mourinho’s side this year.\n\nNow, though, came Carrick’s rewinding of the clock, as he slid a 40-yard ball on to Mata’s left boot. He passed right to Rashford and the 20-year-old collected a 13th goal of the campaign.\n\nCarrick featured in United’s opening foray in the second half though his shot was blocked. A Watford move came via Andre Gray when the centre-forward took possession outside the area, though he was soon stymied.\n\nLater, a Rashford pot-shot sailed over the bar and Watford had a mini-flurry in and around United’s area, before Carrick’s farewell.\n\nAlways a classy operator, he ended with a classy sign-off, patting the badge and offering a goodbye clap as a thank you to the crowd, closing a gilded 12 years at Old Trafford. Carrick said: “It’s the greatest club in the world and I thank you for your support.”"}, {"date": "13/05/2018", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52294, "home_team": {"name":

With suitors circling things are at a delicate stage.\n\n“We’ve finished 10th,” Benítez said. “But 10th is not high enough for this club. The potential to do much better is there. We have to be sure we share the same ambitions. We need a squad capable of going anywhere and winning.”\n\nAshley later said Benítez had his “full support” and added: “I will continue to ensure that every penny generated by the club is available to him. I hope very much that Rafa will remain at Newcastle United.”\n\nFor protracted periods Newcastle looked as if they were the side pursuing Champions League qualification, piling so much pressure on their visitors that Chelsea frequently struggled to escape their own half.\n\nWith the intensity of the home side ferocious and the decibel level ear-splitting, Conte’s team were in near total disarray with the lesser spotted Ross Barkley, making a rare start, struggling to get anywhere near the ball in midfield. Part of that was down to the fact that Shelvey, like Diamé, was irrepressible. Thibaut Courtois was swiftly required to repel Shelvey’s vicious long-range half-volley and Diamé’s angled shot.\n\nSign up for The Fiver and get our daily football email.\n\nAs Shelvey revelled in making N’Golo Kanté look thoroughly ordinary he appeared every inch an England international. The consensus is that Gareth Southgate has opted against including him in the World Cup squad he is due to name on Wednesday but Shelvey has not entirely abandoned hope of a summons. Maybe, just maybe, England’s manager still has a big decision to make.\n\nNewcastle’s playmaker helped create all three goals. The first originated with a pass that picked out the impressive Matt Ritchie, who confounded Conte’s defence with a left-foot cross from the right. When Jacob Murphy attempted somewhat audaciously to lob Courtois the goalkeeper palmed the ball clear – but only as far as Dwight Gayle, who headed into the unguarded net.\n\nAs Conte appeared in danger of physical implosion Benítez remained an oasis of serenity, celebrating the goal by giving his glasses a polish before summoning his captain, Jamaal Lascelles, for a detailed tactical discussion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Antonio Conte watched in fury as his players blew any chance of a top-four place with a humiliating defeat.

Despite a backpedalling Martin Dubravka performing acrobatic wonders to claw Olivier Giroud’s accomplished backheel to safety following Hazard’s cross, Newcastle responded by scoring a second.\n\nAgain it was created by Shelvey, whose volleyed connection with a half-cleared cross would probably have flown past Courtois had Pérez not flicked out a boot to apply the final touch.\n\nAfter Dubravka excelled in keeping a Barkley effort out with his legs, Pérez soon scored his second. This time Shelvey whipped a free-kick in and Florian Lejeune’s slide-rule pass prefaced the Spaniard dispatching a shot past Courtois from six yards.\n\nAs the manager who led Chelsea to Europa League glory Benítez never felt an iota of love at Stamford Bridge. He is smothered in the stuff on Tyneside but is determined not to let his head rule his heart. “We’ll see how the conversations [with the board] develop,” he said. “We’re still talking, maybe even tonight, so we’ll see what happens.”"}, {"date": "13/05/2018", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31882, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [],

Manchester City would finish an extraordinary season with a bang. After plucking Kevin De Bruyne’s exquisite flighted ball out of the summer air with his left foot, the substitute Gabriel Jesus hoisted a wonderful dinked effort into the net with his right, with only two seconds of three added minutes left on the clock, racking up the champions’ 32nd win of the campaign, attaining a landmark and record-breaking century in the process.\n\nMichael Carrick delivers vintage pass in Manchester United’s win over Watford Read more\n\nAs Jesus whipped off his shirt, wheeling away before being mobbed by his team-mates, Pep Guardiola, his manager, punched the air with both fists before half of his technical area emptied towards the delirious away support. It had looked as though the 100-point mark would evade them and that they would end the season on something of a bum note until Jesus’s timely reminder that this City side are no ordinary team. “A lot of goals, concede few, lots of points, wins at home, wins away, everything was perfect this season – and finished the way we deserved to finish,” Guardiola said. “Premier League, 100 points, I still cannot believe it, it is a massive achievement.”\n\n“One hundred points is a lot, [that is] 50 points at home, 50 points away, it means how stable, how good we were all the season. The numbers are always consequences of what we have done in terms of the way we play, our mentality. You cannot achieve what we achieve in terms of many, many records if you are not a humble team, professional, [that] has that desire to take the ball and win and win and win. It’s massive, it’s a lot of points, it’s now time to rest – except the guys who go to the World Cup – time to rest, enjoy the summer and prepare well for the next season.”\n\nSign up for The Fiver and get our daily football email.\n\nOne minor worry for Guardiola is that he may be about to lose one of his assistants, with Mikel Arteta of interest to Arsenal, as they search for Arsène Wenger’s successor. “What we have done this season, for all the staff, Mikel, his contribution, was outstanding, amazing. We were together so good, all the staff, Mikel. So if he stays, I will be happiest guy in the world. If he decides to move because he has this offer, this option, I will not say you don’t have to go. I want the best for my friends and he’s a friend of mine and I want the best. If he decides to go, I will be so sad but I will understand his decision, because it’s his career, his life, his family, and I am not right guy to say you don’t have to do that. But hopefully, hopefully he can stay and finish what we have started together in the coming years.”\n\nCity were made to work for their final win of a brilliant title-winning campaign, though. Southampton were at leisure for long periods, with the defender Wesley Hoedt rattling the crossbar in the first half. Guardiola’s side never really got a grip on the game until Jesus was introduced on the hour mark. Until then the returning Raheem Sterling, who himself struck the woodwork after dancing round the edge of the box, had led a City line that lacked killer instinct in the continued absence of Sergio Agüero. Leroy Sané slid a cross into an empty box before the ball ricocheted towards Fernandino, lurking near the penalty spot, only for the Brazilian to drive over.\n\nManuel Lanzini double gives West Ham victory over lacklustre Everton Read more\n\nGuardiola, sleeves rolled up, stalking his technical area, acknowledged something had to change and soon Jesus entered in place of Fabian Delph. It was Southampton who had the next glimpse of goal, though, with Fernandinho clearing off the line from Dusan Tadic, who had beaten the offside trap and twice skirted round Claudio Bravo, with the Manchester City goalkeeper frantically scampering round his box. Then came Brahim Díaz and 17-year-old Phil Foden, for their fifth league appearances of the season – ensuring each of them one of 40 Premier League medals in the process – before Jesus popped up to finish an unforgettable season in considerable style, lifting the ball over Alex McCarthy after latching on to De Bruyne’s brilliant ball.\n\nFor Southampton, their post-match lap of appreciation must have felt a little bittersweet at the end of an enormous week, in which they secured their league status after a crucial victory at now relegated Swansea City. “Tuesday night was the key one for us but I thought we put in a really professional performance, which I demanded,” Mark Hughes, the Southampton manager said, adding he expects the club’s hierarchy to make a swift decision over his future and whether he will lead Saints next season. “You expect the best team in England to always go to the end. They are an outstanding team.”\n\nCity, meanwhile, have tied down their goalkeeper Ederson to a new contract which will keep him at the club until 2025."}, {"date": "13/05/2018", "arena": "The Liberty

already relegated, condemned Swansea to spending next season in the Championship alongside them. Swansea, in truth, were resigned to their fate on Wednesday night, after Huddersfield grabbed an unlikely point at Chelsea, meaning that Carlos Carvalhal’s side needed a footballing miracle on the final day of the season to survive. That never looked like materialising as Swansea’s seven-year stay in the Premier League ended in defeat and amid no little anger in the stands.\n\nTottenham fight back to beat Leicester in thriller and seal third spot Read more\n\nHuw Jenkins was not at the game but his name was sung frequently and not in a complimentary way as the supporters directed their frustration at the chairman and the board. “You greedy bastards, get out of our club”, “We want our club back”, and “We want Jenkins out” all got an airing as the exasperation that has been simmering away for so long bubbled over.\n\nIn that respect the action on the pitch felt like a sideshow at times, especially given that it was never remotely likely that Swansea would win, Southampton would lose and there would be a 10-goal swing in the process – the set of circumstances that Carvalhal’s team needed to preserve their Premier League status.\n\nEven the first part of that equation – a home victory – proved beyond Swansea as they succumbed to their 21st league defeat of a miserable season, despite taking the lead through Andy King’s early goal and registering 26 shots on a day when Leon Britton and Ángel Rangel, two club stalwarts, made their final appearances before retiring. One of those efforts on goal was struck by André Ayew and it rather summed up Swansea’s season when Tammy Abraham, on as a second-half substitute, got in the way of the ball and prevented it from going into the net, with Jack Butland, Stoke’s goalkeeper, beaten.\n\nIt was a surreal afternoon in so many ways – at one point Stoke’s supporters were chanting for Swansea to score 10, such was their desire to see Mark Hughes, their former manager, relegated with Southampton – and topped off by the sight of Carvalhal reading statistics off a sheet of paper afterwards, saying nothing remotely critical about his own reign and even suggesting that he could still be Swansea’s manager next season. “They [the owners] ask me if I am available to talk about staying,” Carvalhal said.\n\nSign up for The Fiver and get our daily football email.\n\nIt felt like a strange comment for Carvalhal to make, not least because it flies in the face of what senior figures at the club think should happen as Swansea approach the huge task of trying to rebuild for the Championship, and it was hard to escape the feeling that the Portuguese was doing little more than saving face prior to his anticipated exit.\n\nEither way, Carvalhal had clearly done his homework before coming into the press conference room afterwards. “We had 18 games, we achieved 20 points since our arrival. We achieved more points in this period than Stoke City, Southampton, Huddersfield, West Brom, Watford and Brighton, and the same points as Leicester,” he said, looking down at his facts and figures. “I don’t want to criticise anybody but it’s a fact that the few points the team did in the first 20 games, with just 13 points, made things very difficult to recover.”\n\nCallum Wilson hits last-gasp winner for Bournemouth at Europe-bound Burnley Read more\n\nThat may well be so and it would be extremely unfair to pin relegation on Carvalhal given the wider problems at the club and the mess that he inherited when he was appointed in December, yet there is also no getting away from the fact that Swansea imploded at a time when they had Premier League survival in their hands. Swansea, 13th at the start of March, failed to win any of their last nine league games – something that Carvalhal attributed, rather dubiously, to the team’s element of “surprise disappearing”.\n\nStoke, who avoided the ignominy of finishing bottom with this victory, also have a busy summer ahead and it remains to be seen whether Lambert will stay in charge. Badou Ndiaye’s neat finish and Peter Crouch’s close-range header gave Paul Lambert only his second victory in 15 matches, with the Stoke manager claiming afterwards he had been working in difficult circumstances because of the behaviour of a small of group of senior players whom he felt that he had no choice but to alienate. “Anyone that knows me knows I’m fair but my standards are high, and I

rebuilt White Hart Lane next season. Yet what a send-off they gave to Wembley.\n\nMauricio Pochettino hints Spurs future hinges on commitment of transfer funds Read more\n\nThe merits of the club’s temporary accommodation at the national stadium have been a talking point throughout a season that has finished with them securing third place in the Premier League and a third consecutive Champions League qualification.\n\nSpurs started badly at Wembley but they grew into the old place and they can look back on a handful of outstanding wins against Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal in the league, plus Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid in the Champions League.\n\nOn the other hand the three defeats that Mauricio Pochettino feels have scarred the season were also here – against Juventus in the Champions League, Manchester City in the league and Manchester United in the FA Cup. This victory against a spirited Leicester City will stand the test of time mainly for its wackiness. The entertainment value, however, was rich.\n\nOn an afternoon when defending was clearly not a part of either team’s plans, Tottenham trailed 3-1 before storming back to lead 4-3 thanks to a pair of Erik Lamela goals and an unwitting assist from him for the other one. Jamie Vardy found the equaliser for Leicester with his second of the game before Harry Kane – who else? – sealed it for Spurs with a second of his own.\n\nTottenham had invited a host of their former players to the game and one of them, Paul Gascoigne, who was presented on the pitch at half-time, could be seen performing The Floss dance up in the stands when Kane’s winner went in. Around him Gary Mabbutt smiled, Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa applauded and Dimitar Berbatov just looked cool.\n\nKane finished with 30 league goals for the season but it was not enough to overhaul Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah in the race for the Golden Boot. Kane had won the award in the previous two seasons with 25 and 29 goals.\n\nSign up for The Fiver and get our daily football email.\n\nLeicester played a full part in a see‑saw spectacle and they will wonder how they went home with nothing other than a fifth defeat in seven league matches. The focus will now turn to the future of the manager, Claude Puel, but it is fair to say that his players performed for him here. “Speculation is not my area,” Puel said. “We need stability. I will try to make this work. This is just the second time in 18 years we have finished in the first half of the table.”\n\nThe game exploded into life at the outset, with Vardy in the mood. He put Leicester in front with a flicked header from Riyad Mahrez’s free-kick but Tottenham hit back when Danny Simpson’s loose pass hit Lucas Moura and Kane was away. He beat Eldin Jakupovic with a low shot inside the near post.\n\nArsène Wenger gets a winning farewell with 1-0 to the Arsenal at Huddersfield Read more\n\nTottenham had lost Jan Vertonghen to a calf problem in the warm-up and so Pochettino reshuffled, bringing Victor Wanyama into the line-up in midfield and dropping Eric Dier back to central defence, where he partnered Toby Alderweireld. Kyle Walker‑Peters enjoyed a rare opportunity at right‑back and he suffered, at times, defensively yet he looked good going forward. It was pretty much the story of every player’s day.\n\nLeicester were back in charge with 16 minutes on the clock and the goal owed much to an incision from Kelechi Iheanacho. Walker-Peters and Vardy challenged for a loose ball and, when it broke for Mahrez, he banged past Hugo Lloris. Leicester ought to have been further in front on 26 minutes but Demarai Gray could not beat Lloris when one-on-one, after Vardy’s lovely touch. Spurs were booed off by some of their supporters at the interval.\n\nIt was even crazier in the second half, with Iheanacho making it 3-1 with the goal of the game – a precision left-footed drive into the top corner, after holding off Wanyama, which is no mean feat. Game over? Not at all. Spurs were in front 13 minutes later.\n\nLamela scored his team’s second and fourth goals from low Walker‑Peters crosses while the equaliser for 3-3 came when Harry Maguire jumped into a challenge on him. The ball ricocheted off Lamela and went in off Christian Fuchs for an own goal.\n\nBack came Leicester and after Lloris had saved brilliantly to keep out Iheanacho, Mahrez ushered in Vardy, who finished explosively into the near top corner. Kane created the winner for himself with a move that sent the Leicester substitute, Hamza Choudhury off towards Brent Cross. He bent his shot expertly into the far corner. Though Vardy fired high when well placed in stoppage-time, there would be no further twists."}, {"date": "13/05/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56926, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham

sources rating the Scot’s chances of being given a new contract at no more than 25%.\n\nKarren Brady under pressure to drop Sun column after ‘malcontents’ claim Read more\n\nWest Ham expect to reach a final decision at a board meeting next week and although Moyes has kept them in the Premier League, the east London club will consider a host of candidates in the coming days. If they prove attractive enough to one of their favoured picks, then Moyes is likely to be looking for a new job.\n\nThe same could be true of Sam Allardyce, who did not sound optimistic about seeing out the final year of his contract with Everton. “I can’t quite say I’m confident after all the rumours I’m reading because there is no smoke without fire, is there?” Allardyce said. “But we will wait and see when we meet up this week.”\n\nMoyes was more positive. West Ham were in the bottom three when the 55-year-old replaced Slaven Bilic on a six-month deal in November and he is thought to be in line for a £1.65m bonus after leading them to 13th place. But while he has found a way to survive in awkward circumstances, he might not have impressed sufficiently to convince David Sullivan and David Gold, the owners, to reward him with a long-term deal.\n\nWest Ham are interested in Rafael Benítez, who might prove too expensive to prise away from Newcastle, and they have held informal talks with Manuel Pellegrini, although the former Manchester City manager has also been heavily linked with Sevilla. Other options include Burnley’s Sean Dyche, Huddersfield’s David Wagner and Marco Silva, the former Hull and Watford manager. Their preference is to hire a manager who has worked in the Premier League, although they have not denied making contact with Shakhtar Donetsk’s Paulo Fonseca last week.\n\nThey have also not completely ruled out appointing Moyes, who has misgivings of his own about taking the job. The former Everton manager hit out at the club’s culture of leaks after word of his row with Andy Carroll filtered through to the media earlier this month and he has challenged West Ham to show that they can match his ambition.\n\nSign up for The Fiver and get our daily football email.\n\n“We will meet next week,” Moyes said. “We’ve not arranged a date, not arranged a time. I don’t know if anybody can make that big of a difference in six months. Even Pep [Guardiola] took a bit of time to get this right. I don’t think anybody can really come and make a difference. You would need to give a bit longer. Everybody always thinks the grass is greener and there is something better out there. I would say, more often than not, it’s proved wrong.”\n\nMoyes believes that he will receive offers from elsewhere if his time is up. “I’ll have options,” he said. “Look, it’s not us challenging each other. I’ve had a really good relationship with the board, I speak regularly with them. I would like to change things and maybe everybody is not happy with change.”\n\nThere is a feeling within West Ham’s squad that Moyes’s methods are old-fashioned but he provided a strong audition here. The hosts swept forward and took the lead in the 38th minute. Cheikhou Kouyaté’s pass ran beyond Marko Arnautovic but Michael Keane had pushed up, leaving a huge gap in the middle of Everton’s defence. Manuel Lanzini scampered on to the ball and used his left foot to beat Jordan Pickford with a precise shot from 18 yards.\n\nLiverpool clinch fourth after Mohamed Salah kickstarts romp against Brighton Read more\n\nEverton were bland for long spells and finishing eighth is unlikely to convince them to keep Allardyce, who hit out at suggestions that he has a troubled relationship with Wayne Rooney. “We’ve been very professional and very adult with our conversations,” he said. “You’ve been misled by somebody, or you have just decided to make it up.”\n\nRooney, who has an offer to join DC United, was absent with a knee injury and Everton toiled without him. West Ham doubled their lead midway through the second half when Arnautovic rolled away from Keane and caught out Pickford with a thunderous shot from long range. The Austrian has scored 11 times in the league under Moyes.\n\nThe visitors pulled a goal back when Oumar Niasse bundled the ball home from a corner with 16 minutes left, but West Ham sealed their first home win over Everton since 2007 when Pickford failed to get a strong enough hand to Lanzini’s curling shot.\n\nMoyes ended with a light touch, joking that he can relax now that he is out of contract. “I’ll take my suit off at midnight, undo my tie a little bit, be back on the streets come midnight,” he said."}, {"date": "10/05/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56902,

The most famous club in England are 19 points behind Manchester City with one game remaining and while this forgettable draw secured second place for José Mourinho’s spluttering team, that will not be cause for celebration when they consider the ease with which Pep Guardiola’s record-breaking champions have cantered into the distance.\n\nThe gap is vast and United will struggle to cut it as long as they continue to toil against opponents as limited as West Ham. Mourinho argued that a point was a respectable reward but United’s fans, who spent much of the second half bellowing their support for the hospitalised Sir Alex Ferguson on a drab night, must be concerned at their team’s negative approach.\n\nManchester United consider gesture of support for Sir Alex Ferguson on Sunday Read more\n\nForget about the late sideshow flare-up between Paul Pogba and Mark Noble The real intrigue was that when Mourinho turned to his bench as this dire game neared its conclusion, he did not consider the merits of Anthony Martial. Instead he opted for caution, turning to Eric Bailly and Ashley Young to see United over the line, and Martial stayed in his seat, yawning along with the rest of us.\n\n“When the game goes to minute 70 or 75, you don’t win, you don’t lose,” Mourinho said. “We deserved the point and second position. When you are not ready to be champion, second position is the best available.”\n\nIt might seem harsh to be critical given that United got the job done, assuming their task was to participate in a grim slog. Yet it is hard to shake off the impression Mourinho is managing expectations in an effort to make it seem that he cannot be blamed for his team’s failure to compete with City.\n\nHe had glowered more than usual before this game and his observation that some of the players at his disposal are not good enough to challenge Guardiola’s side did not seem like a classic motivational ploy.\n\nUnited, who made eight changes after their defeat at Brighton, rarely suggested that they were going to respond to their manager’s curious form of tough love. They needed time to adjust to an unfamiliar 3-4-1-2 system and although they looked solid in the central areas, it must have alarmed Mourinho when Chris Smalling’s failure to deal with Aaron Cresswell’s cross almost allowed Marko Arnautovic to give West Ham an early lead.\n\nSign up for The Fiver and get our daily football email.\n\nArnautovic turned an awkward header over, however, and United started to threaten sporadically. Pogba had the freedom to roam behind Alexis Sánchez and Jesse Lingard, and Mourinho’s side could argue that they were unfortunate not to be in front at the interval. Scott McTominay sent a shot inches wide after an error from Manuel Lanzini, Lingard had two swerving shots pushed away by Adrián, and West Ham were indebted to a brilliant piece of athleticism from their goalkeeper in the 23rd minute.\n\nSánchez, who scored a hat-trick for Arsenal on this ground last season, must have been licking his lips when Antonio Valencia found him with a cut-back from the right. He had time to pick his spot and he tried to bend a shot high to Adrián’s right. The Spaniard responded with a sharp stop, however, and then he sprang back into position to turn Luke Shaw’s fizzing low drive against the woodwork.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester United’s Paul Pogba and West Ham United’s Cheikhou Kouyaté clash. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nIt is two years to the day since West Ham said farewell to Upton Park with an emotional victory over United and with his team’s Premier League status secured, there was an argument that this was an opportunity for David Moyes to let go of the handbrake.\n\nYet West Ham’s pragmatic display had a sapping effect on the atmosphere and did little to further the Scot’s case that he deserves a contract extension at the end of the season. “I thought the players showed a great attitude,” Moyes said. “Sometimes when you get safe you can slip away with it but they were at it the whole night. It was a thoroughly deserved point.”\n\nAt least Arnautovic gave it a go. The Austrian took on United’s back three on his own at times and he deserved better after a powerful surge down the right only for João Mário to jab the cross wide from close range.\n\nWith Romelu Lukaku unavailable and Mourinho waiting until the 74th minute to bring on Marcus Rashford, United’s attacks lacked a potent presence. Sánchez was persistent and he almost took advantage of indecision from Adrián early in the second half, however. Yet West Ham were relieved that Angelo Ogbonna raced back to head the Chilean’s chip off the line.

A point squeezed despite incessant Chelsea pressure will prolong their stay into a second year, effectively at Swansea’s expense. The joyous visiting players swiftly persuaded the management to cancel the team’s flight home in favour of a coach journey back to west Yorkshire. Beery celebrations were no doubt maintained up the M1 through the small hours.\n\nTheirs has been a staggering achievement, one perhaps lost amid the plaudits strewn over sides overseen by Pep Guardiola and Sean Dyche, or others steered to safety by Roy Hodgson, Chris Hughton or Rafael Benítez. Wagner deserves similar accolades. “People said we had no chance and they were right,” he offered, his trousers hoisted back to his waist after an unfortunate and inadvertent flash as he was subjected to the bumps in front of the away support.\n\n‘We did it on our own’: Wagner hails Huddersfield heroes after Chelsea draw Read more\n\n“We were anything but a Premier League club last summer, but we have given it a go. If you have the passion, desire and spirit you can compete with top, top quality.”\n\nThey have done just that, at Manchester City and Chelsea in successive games, to claim the unlikely draws to edge them to safety and effectively condemn Swansea – three points adrift of Southampton and 10 goals worse off – in the process. It was fitting Town should achieve a campaign’s objective with such a scrap of a performance, a frenzy of blocks and challenges to blunt Chelsea’s Champions League aspirations, with their resolve utterly unbreakable as the home side poured at them through the chaotic latter stages.\n\nOne madcap pinball in the visitors’ penalty area seven minutes from time summed up their refusal to wilt, players flinging themselves into a succession of blocks as the ball ricocheted off the mass of bodies. When it eventually broke free to loop up invitingly to Andreas Christensen, the Dane’s header back towards the far corner was tipped thrillingly on to a post and behind for a corner by the diving Jonas Lössl. They simply would not allow Chelsea in for the victory that would have thrust them level with Liverpool. Huddersfield were not to be denied.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Huddersfield players hold their breath as Jonas Lössl’s fingertip save comes back off the post to deny Chelsea a winner. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Reuters\n\nThey had briefly even enjoyed a lead here, plucked from one of their three shots. Willian lost out to Chris Lowe and with home players committed upfield, Aaron Mooy, a midfielder whose industry sets the tone, lofted a simple pass down the middle into space beyond Christensen.\n\nOn to the loose ball lumbered Laurent Depoitre, a striker previously without a goal this year and noted more for his brawn than any searing pace, to attempt to lift a shot over the onrushing Willy Caballero as the pair collided on the edge of the penalty area. As the Argentinian goalkeeper lay supine on the turf Depoitre retained his composure to lift a follow-up beyond a stumbling Antonio Rüdiger and into the gaping net.\n\nHarry Kane purges Spurs of Champions League nerves with win over Newcastle Read more\n\nThe majority inside this arena blanched at the concession. Antonio Conte had rested six players here with one eye on the FA Cup final and while his team’s endeavour could not be doubted, it took the introduction of the cavalry – Olivier Giroud and Eden Hazard – to force parity. César Azpilicueta’s low centre fizzed across the six-yard box and Mathias Jørgensen, in attempting to hack it clear, succeeded only in belting the ball on to Marcos Alonso’s forehead. In it flew beyond a startled Lössl, the Spaniard just as shocked to have been rewarded in such bizarre fashion.\n\nYet, for all that Rüdiger would miss two appealing opportunities from close range, that was the extent of the damage the home side would inflict. Christopher Schindler was vocal and inspirational organising his back-line, Lössl excellent in goal and the Mooy and Jonathan Hogg combination in midfield snapped into challenges to disrupt the home side’s rhythm. Chelsea could find no way through and, trailing Liverpool by two points on the final afternoon, have surely now given up any lingering hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.\n\nThe vast majority of the home support had ambled away as the players went through the motions of a post-match lap of appreciation, their body language almost apologetic. This may have been Conte’s last home game in charge. “It is for the club to judge the situation and then to take the best decision,” he offered through numbed disappointment. “We have another game to play, and the FA Cup final, and then the club – for sure – will do the best to improve the situation.”\n\nThe Italian is unlikely to be in the Premier League next season. Huddersfield most definitely will be.\n\n• This article was amended on 10 May 2018.

Arsenal and this was in keeping with that theme as Arsène Wenger suffered his first defeat against Leicester City in 23 games, leaving his team without a point away from home this year and enduring their worst run of form on the road since 1966.\n\nIn many ways the evening felt like a microcosm of Arsenal’s season as they pressed the self-destruct button not once but twice. Konstantinos Mavropanos was sent off after only 15 minutes for hauling down Kelechi Iheanacho, who had just punished some poor Arsenal defending to put Leicester ahead, and although Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang equalised early in the second half, Wenger’s side handed the initiative to the home team again when Henrikh Mkhitaryan brought down Demarai Gray.\n\nHuddersfield seal Premier League survival and dent Chelsea top-four hopes Read more\n\nJamie Vardy, who turned down the chance to sign for Wenger two years ago, dispatched the penalty kick for his 21st goal of the season and Riyad Mahrez applied the coup de grace for Leicester with a superb third in the 90th minute, leaving Wenger to reflect on another disappointing night that he blamed on the officials.\n\n“It’s a frustration because I believe we played a great game and with 10 against 11 we have shown quality in our game and spirit,” he said. “Overall it is very sad because the decision went against us and we are upset that we lost a game that we should not have lost. It does not have big consequences but it’s just a continuity of what we have faced all season.”\n\nWenger was talking initially about the straight red card that Mavropanos received for tugging at the shorts of Iheanacho, who had forced the young Greek defender into a mistake by closing him down as he tried to play the ball out from the back. Graham Scott, the referee, was well positioned to make the call. “I disagree with the red card because [Rob] Holding would have caught this ball, because he was not the last man,” Wenger said.\n\nThat was a dubious interpretation of the incident given that it was highly questionable whether Holding would have been able to get across and stop Iheanacho in his tracks. As for the penalty kick, Mkhitaryan appeared to be playing with fire when he challenged Gray from behind, after Shkodran Mustafi abjectly passed the ball straight to the Leicester winger, although Wenger was convinced that Scott got that badly wrong. “The penalty is a very creative, imaginative aspect from the referee,” Wenger said. “We’ve watched it again, it’s a nice dive and it’s not a penalty. Mkhitaryan plays the ball.”\n\nThe evening finished with Wenger acknowledging the Leicester supporters as they sang his name, yet it was tempting to wonder whether the home crowd would have been quite so generous if they were losing, rather than winning. It was an important victory for Claude Puel, who had registered only four wins from Leicester’s previous 19 league matches, and opens the door to the possibility of his side pipping Everton to eighth place on the final day.\n\nIheanacho’s goal set Leicester on their way, the Nigerian thumping a bouncing ball inside the near post, after Fousseni Diabaté nodded down Christian Fuch’s cross, and only a string of fine saves from Petr Cech prevented the home team from adding to their lead before the interval as Arsenal struggled to cope with their numerical disadvantage.\n\nThe visitors were brighter early in the second half, however when Aubameyang turned the ball in from six yards after Eldin Jakupovic had repelled his first attempt. Leicester, though, were back in front 14 minutes from time, when Vardy sent Cech the wrong way from the spot, and Mahrez then turned Holding inside out to score a lovely third and put a smile on Puel’s face. “It was a good feeling to win our last home game,” Leicester’s manager said."}, {"date": "09/05/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54013, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester

What he wanted was a quicker, slicker City. So when Aymeric Laporte swept a diagonal out to Bernardo Silva along the right and the ball went into the box instantly, the manager would have been pleased.\n\nThey went even closer when Fernandinho roved forward, moved in behind opposition and found Ilkay Gündoğan, with Shane Duffy required to make a sliding block.\n\nWith the crowd cheering Touré’s every touch he delighted with a quick shuffle that took the ball out of his feet and passed in an instant. Later, when he outmuscled Ulloa, there were groans as the referee adjudged an infringement and Guardiola looked equally unimpressed with the official.\n\nMoments later emotions reversed due to an opener straight from the manager’s playbook. Sané hit high gear, burned through the centre circle, and rolled a pass inside the defence to Danilo. The right-back took this on and finished impressively to Mathew Ryan’s right.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yaya Tour´e and the Manchester City players mob Danilo after he gave Manchester City an early lead.

When Davy Pröpper sprinted down the right the Chilean goalkeeper initially smothered the ball only to see it pop back to the Dutchman.

Moments later his cross found Silva and he smashed the ball in for the lead and for goal number 104, the record.\n\nCity’s second-half task was to take the contest away from the visitors.

fraught first half, when the Tottenham support could imagine the worst-case scenario that their team would contrive to lose their grip on Champions League qualification.\n\nBut the mood and the match turned on one swish of Harry Kane’s boot early in the second half and with Chelsea failing to beat Huddersfield Town at Stamford Bridge, it turned into a night of celebration.

Spurs will finish as the top team in London for the first time since 1994-95 and they will wrap up third place if they beat Leicester City at Wembley on Sunday.\n\nPochettino had declared this match to be about the mentality of his players and they found a way to chisel out the result. Newcastle were proactive and they created plenty of opportunities and Rafael Benítez complained about the non-award of two penalties for his team – the biggest shout coming when Hugo Lloris caught Matt Ritchie in the 58th minute.\n\nThe Newcastle manager was entitled to say that “100% we deserved something” but, in the end, it was another occasion to illustrate why he wants his board to break the bank for a dead-eyed striker. The chances came and the chances went, with the substitute Jacob Murphy blowing a gilt-edged opportunity on 72 minutes.\n\nKane has still to rediscover the red-hot form he showed before his ankle injury in March and his air-kick for an attempted volley when gloriously placed in the 40th minute summed up both his and the team’s travails before the interval. But he dug deep and found a way to make the difference.\n\nIt was an excellent finish, swept high inside Martin Dubravka’s near post after Son Heung-min had drawn three Newcastle defenders to him and popped the ball back to Kane. The England striker now has 28 Premier League goals – three short of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. The Golden Boot race could yet go to the wire.\n\nPochettino was elated and he made the point of thanking his backroom staff for their work. But he also highlighted how Tottenham had made light of their temporary move to Wembley. “People did not realise how tough it was for the players and for the fans too,” he said. “To achieve the top four under this condition – it is a massive achievement.”\n\nSpurs were loose, anxious and too lateral in the first half and there were groans of frustration from the home crowd at the end of it, which sounded a lot like boos. With so much at stake, it was also surprising to see so many empty seats. The attendance of 54,923 was the club’s third lowest of the league season.Newcastle called the tune before the interval and they ought to have led. Jonjo Shelvey banged a free-kick from the edge of the area against the outside of a post while Lloris sprang to his right to keep out Jamaal Lascelles’s header. It was a wonderful save. Dwight Gayle headed too high from close-range and the visitors had further flickers.\n\nPochettino’s team and the home fans refocused during the interval.

Manolo Gabbiadini was the player who set that chain of events in motion with a goal that was scrappy and untidy but worth its weight in gold to Mark Hughes and his players.\n\n“We are staying up,” chanted the Southampton fans as the players joined hands to celebrate in front of them at the final whistle. Hughes was as pumped up as anyone as he strode on to the pitch without shaking hands with Carlos Carvalhal, clenching his fist and embracing the players who have taken Saints to the verge of safety.\n\nSwansea were crestfallen. They are three points adrift with only one game left and will need to beat Stoke at home on Sunday and hope Huddersfield lose their final two fixtures, against Chelsea and Arsenal, to have any chance of staying up. On this evidence there is little chance of Swansea keeping their side of that bargain.\n\nSouthampton suspect ‘dark arts’ after hotel move and bus spat in Swansea Read more\n\nThe Carvalhal revival has crashed and burned. Swansea have failed to win in nine matches and this was the eighth home game of the season in which they have not scored. They are toothless in attack and Carvalhal’s negative approach over the last couple of months – he has become obsessed with playing five at the back – has done nothing to help their cause.\n\nHughes read the script in that respect. Southampton sat deep initially, defending in numbers, and effectively asked Swansea to break them down. As has been the case so often Swansea struggled to do so, and there was always a feeling Southampton had the wherewithal to punish them at the other end, especially when they started to attack with more conviction after the break.\n\nThe goal arrived in the 72nd minute and it was a desperately poor one to concede. Dusan Tadic’s corner was headed back across goal by the unmarked Shane Long, it was flicked on again by Oriol Romeu and although Lukasz Fabianski managed to keep out Charlie Austin’s shot, Gabbiadini was perfectly positioned to sweep home from inside the six-yard box four minutes after coming on.\n\nPlay Video 1:01 Mark Hughes delighted with Southampton response against Swansea – video\n\nHughes said he had always planned to introduce Gabbiadini at some stage, and the Southampton manager made it clear he had felt this was a must-win game because Saints face Manchester City on the final day.\n\nA heavy defeat against City and an emphatic Swansea win could still see Hughes’s team relegated in theory, yet nobody can realistically expect a nine-goal swing in the respective fixtures.\n\nFor Hughes, victory was particularly sweet because of some of the shenanigans that went on before the game. The Swansea hotel Southampton planned to stay in was cancelled at short notice on Sunday, forcing Hughes and his players to find alternative accommodation in Cardiff, and there was more frustration for the visitors when they arrived at the Liberty Stadium and were told they would have to wait on the bus.\n\nHughes had had enough at that point and instructed his players to leave the team coach and walk the 100 yards or so to the entrance.\n\nMark Hughes throws off shackles to leave Swansea paralysed by doom | Nick Miller Read more\n\nAlthough the atmosphere crackled inside the Liberty Stadium in the early stages the game was something of a slowburner. Swansea had plenty of possession and tried to dictate the tempo but they created little going forward.\n\nAndy King’s low drive was comfortably saved by Alex McCarthy and Sam Clucas’s glancing header fell the wrong side of the far upright; but that was the sum total of Swansea’s threat before the interval and it was difficult to know what opportunities Carvalhal was referring to afterwards when he talked about his team creating plenty of chances.\n\nSwansea’s best moment came at the start of the second half and that was down to a piece of individual inspiration from Jordan Ayew. Twisting and turning to wriggle clear of a couple of Southampton players, Ayew cut inside and unleashed a 25-yard dipping shot that looked to be arcing into the top corner until Alex McCarthy, stretching every sinew, got a hand to the ball to superbly flick it over the bar.\n\nSouthampton were starting to look more and more menacing. Austin had forced Fabianski to make two saves before half-time and another couple of attempts from the same player highlighted the visitors’ growing threat.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up for our daily football email.\n\nDesperate for a goal, Carvalhal introduced Tammy Abraham, but it was the change made by Hughes that did the trick as Gabbiadini, who has endured a difficult season, joined Long and

Sir Alex Ferguson on Saturday but the mood here was fittingly celebratory for the coronation of Pep Guardiola’s champions – though the pitch invasion at the close featured two City fans holding a large banner reading: “Football aside get well Fergie.” For Huddersfield Town this was an admirable result – a precious point in the fight to retain Premier League status and the first time City have been kept goalless here in the league all season.\n\nIt left David Wagner, the manager, content. “We don’t like to be too greedy but it was possible to win the game at the end,” he said of a late Scott Malone chance. “From my point of view, this was on the same level [as beating Manchester United]. A clean sheet and point against Manchester City away is the same as Man United because of the crucial time of the season.”\n\nManchester City given Premier League trophy after draw with Huddersfield – live! Read more\n\nAfter Guardiola’s men walked out to a guard of honour made up of survivors from the 1968 title-winning team in an Etihad Stadium turned blue and white by flags placed on seats, the visitors began as so many do here: watching a medley of passes from Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sané, Kyle Walker, Fernandinho and David Silva.\n\nThe latter had the first chance as he broke behind Huddersfield’s lines and aimed a low shot at Jonas Lössl, the goalkeeper making the save. Wagner’s side offered an near-instant response via Aaron Mooy, though his effort required Ederson only to watch it. Huddersfield’s tactic was to box City in when the ball was with their Brazilian goalkeeper. So it was that with players surrounding the area Ederson misplaced one clearance straight to Mooy, the No 1 perhaps feeling more pressurised than usual at this venue.\n\nThis caused a shake of the head from Guardiola’s, head and Mooy had more to come. The Australian found Steve Mounié with a clever inside-out ball that had City’s rearguard scrambling.\n\nBefore this Sané had rolled the ball in to De Bruyne but the Belgian’s measured left-foot shot went wide. Later Sané again broke through and failed to find Sterling. The pattern continued when Gabriel Jesus failed to finish a De Bruyne cross from near in.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester City fans held aloft a message for Sir Alex Ferguson. Photograph: Andy Hampson/PA\n\nGuardiola looked glum, but Mooy was having a fine half. His next touch found Chris Lowe with a no-look pass, the No 15 receiving the ball close to Lössl’s goal but he snatched at the opportunity from a narrow angle.\n\nAlex Pritchard had gone far closer when forcing Ederson into a flying save to his right, tipping the ball around the post to ensure the teams went in level at half-time. Guardiola had selected as close to his strongest XI as he could, bringing in John Stones and David Silva for Aymeric Laporte and İlkay Gündoğan from the side that won 4-1 at West Ham.\n\nWagner’s two changes were the standing down of Rajiv van La Parra and Collin Quaner for Mathias Jørgensen and Pritchard with his team still requiring a win from their last three games to ensure survival. If Guardiola put a flea in his charges’ ears at half-time a slipshod Walker pass to cede possession will have particularly annoyed. Still, the sight of Ederson confidently taking the resulting high ball will have cheered his manager.\n\nCity went close in a goal-line scramble that had the ball parried on to Mounié and scrambled away by Christopher Schindler. As the second half wore on Huddersfield’s first-half exertions began to tell. They were encamped in and around their area as City pressed for a win that would take them to a record 96 points.\n\nFor the closing period Guardiola took off Stones for Bernardo Silva and switched to a back three, but victory proved elusive. For Huddersfield it was a job well done and they remain firm favourites to spend a second successive season in the Premier League.\n\nAfter final whistle Vincent Kompany, who was not in the match-day squad, finally lifted the Premier League trophy – the third time he has done so for the club. Kompany said: “This feels different [to previous times]. We were really trying to score the extra goal. In the first year [2012, versus Queens Park Rangers], in the 90th minute, we needed two.\n\n“But this team deserves it. We can’t forget the impact of the gaffer. It was massive – the team so willing to learn and implement plans every week. I personally needed Pep’s drive, and the team needed it.”\n\nBefore Kompany raised the trophy did there was a comical moment when Yaya Touré took to the podium. The Ivorian was mobbed by his team-mates, and in the excitement the trophy fell to the ground. Touré will depart in the summer, but the Guardiola project is up and running in supremely successful fashion and looks to have bright future."}, {"date": "06/05/2018", "arena": "Emirates Stadium",

one in terms of Arsène Wenger’s farewell tour there could be a degree of relief at Arsenal. There is a pretty significant difference between finishing sixth and seventh in this season’s Premier League and, had Arsenal slumped here, it would have opened up the possibility that Burnley might pinch sixth spot from them.\n\nArsène Wenger says goodbye but ‘will cherish every moment I was here’ Read more\n\nIt would have meant Arsenal beginning next season under their new manager in the second qualifying round of the Europa League on 26 July while Burnley went straight into the group stage of Europe’s second-tier competition. Arsenal are scheduled to face Atlético Madrid on that date in a pre-season friendly in Singapore. They would have had to have cancelled their tour.\n\nArsenal’s final two matches of the season are at Leicester City and Huddersfield Town and, given their dismal away form in 2018 – they have yet to pick up a point – there could be no guarantee of any rewards. Yet they spared themselves the potentially awkward situation with a comprehensive dismantling of Burnley, who played nothing more than a ceremonial role here.\n\nIt says plenty about how far Arsenal have fallen under Wenger this season that the merits of coming in ahead of Burnley in sixth were even up for discussion. But this, at least, was a day in which everything went right, when the supporters could cheer Wenger to the rafters as he entered through a guard of honour and departed with a clutch of mementos, and the team clicked in fine style.\n\nPlay Video 0:43 Arsène Wenger looks to the future as he cherishes Arsenal memories – video\n\nThere was even a 13-minute substitute’s cameo for Per Mertesacker, who will retire at the end of the season to take over as the head of the club’s academy, and it threatened to bring the house down. Petr Cech ran from his goal to embrace Mertesacker and the big German’s every touch was cheered.\n\nStan Kroenke, the majority shareholder, was in attendance and he listened to songs in praise of Wenger throughout. For one sunny afternoon the angst of so much of the season could be forgotten. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice to take his tally for the club to eight in 12 appearances while Alexandre Lacazette, Sead Kolasinac and Alex Iwobi got the others.\n\nArsenal took charge early on and the breakthrough goal owed everything to Lacazette’s vision and incision. He played a give-and-go with Iwobi, which allowed him to slice into the area, and his driven cross was made to measure for Aubameyang who poked home. It is clear that Aubameyang’s relationship with Lacazette and Henrikh Mkhitaryan will be key to the club in the post-Wenger era.\n\nThe fourth member of the LMAO strike-force was absent and it had to be said that Mesut Özil’s back injury was the least surprising feature of the day. The World Cup is looming for the Germany maestro. It is unclear whether he will play against Leicester or Huddersfield.\n\nFrom Arsène knows to Arsène goes – curtain falls in classy send-off | Amy Lawrence Read more\n\nLacazette was lively from the first whistle and he got his reward in first-half stoppage time. Iwobi played the pass before the assist and Héctor Bellerín did well to cut back his cross. Lacazette steered a volley inside Nick Pope’s near post.\n\nArsenal had other flickers through the dangerous Mkhitaryan while they shouted loudly but in vain for a penalty when Kolasinac’s cross hit Matthew Lowton’s hand. Burnley lost Ashley Barnes to a shoulder injury on 20 minutes. The first half passed them by; the second period even more so.\n\nWenger omitted Shkodran Mustafi, Nacho Monreal and Aaron Ramsey from his starting line-up and there was another opportunity for the 20-year-old Greek centre-half, Konstantinos Mavropanos, who took no prisoners. Twice he cleaned out Barnes’s replacement, Sam Vokes, to the delight of the home crowd, who have missed a bit of Martin Keown-style violence in their team. After Mavropanos’s first challenge on Vokes the fans around the press box chanted Keown’s name. Keown, who was on punditry duty, smiled.\n\nBurnley are going on a European tour, as the travelling fans chanted, but they were AWOL here. Arsenal turned the screw after the interval. Jack Wilshere had lifted a good chance high when he rinsed Jack Cork to tee up Kolasinac while Iwobi smashed the fourth into the roof of the net after a one-two with Aubameyang and statuesque Burnley defending. Bellerín crossed for Aubameyang to score the fifth and Danny Welbeck almost added a sixth only to see a thunderous long-range shot rattle the crossbar."}, {"date": "06/05/2018", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41314, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tiemoué Bakayoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emerson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Woodburn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "There have been plenty of occasions this season when Chelsea have appeared broken beyond repair. Their title defence fizzled out early but points had been frittered away before the onset of spring as the campaign degenerated into an apparently hopeless pursuit of Champions League qualification. But in the final week they have given themselves a chance and are on the top four’s shoulder once again.\n\nBy defeating third-placed Liverpool here courtesy of Olivier Giroud’s first‑half goal, a header guided into the corner as the visitors switched off for Victor Moses’s cross, their chase is prolonged. All Antonio Conte and his players can do is ensure Huddersfield and Newcastle are beaten in the last five days and then pray , somehow, Tottenham Hotspur or the Champions League finalists slip up in their own appealing home fixtures.\n\nSuccess remains a long shot but, as Conte admitted, Chelsea would have considered such a target “impossible” only a month ago. Four wins on the trot have fired hope.\n\nThe late rally is tinged with regret. Those horribly damaging defeats to Bournemouth and Watford spring to mind when reflecting on a turbulent season, but so might the flurry of draws at the turn of the year or, even, the wasteful 1-1 draw with West Ham only a month ago. When they lost at home to Spurs at the beginning of April, the chasm to fourth had gaped at eight points. “Now we are getting three points in every game and our opponents are dropping points,” Conte said. “Our future is not in our hands but we have to try to put pressure on the teams ahead of us.”\n\nGiroud’s goal, cushioned into the corner as he leapt between Virgil van Dijk and Dejan Lovren, and some feverish defending, secured this latest win. Thibaut Courtois was authoritative and imposing. Gary Cahill, rejuvenated over recent weeks, relished the scrap of it all with César Azpilicueta and the excellent Antonio Rüdiger flinging themselves into blocks and challenges at his side.\n\nRüdiger had played with Mohamed Salah at Roma and was instrumental in blunting the footballer of the year. The Egyptian’s frustration saw him booked for a dive over Cahill’s first‑half tackle. For once, he actually seemed rattled.\n\nSadio Mané, in particular, and the substitute Dominic Solanke still threatened to restore parity, but Chelsea would not be breached. Their former academy player twice nodded over the bar near the end, straining but failing to keep his headers down. His time will come. “He’s a hard-working boy,” said Jürgen Klopp, who had clearly sensed the potential theatre of flinging the 20-year-old into the fray against his former club. “He will be fine in the future.”\n\nKlopp will be irritated his team’s final domestic game, against Brighton, may no longer be irrelevant given he would have preferred to rest personnel before the European Cup final in Kiev. Liverpool had required a result on the final day of last season, in a home game against relegated Middlesbrough, to qualify and may now have to repeat that trick.\n\n“That’s my life, always going to the last day,” Klopp said. “But I saw Brighton against Manchester United on Friday and they don’t look like an easy game. They were really good that day. But it’s football. If you want guarantees, do something different. The boys have shown me they will try and try and try.”\n\nHis players certainly did not seem spent after their exertions in Rome in midweek and monopolised the ball for long periods, though they ran aground too often on the clutter in Chelsea’s penalty area. It only took them being marginally off their effervescent best to offer the home side their chance.\n\nEven Tiémoué Bakayoko, much maligned over his first season in this country, seemed to revel in the rearguard action, with the hosts’ counterattacks always carrying a considerable threat of their own. Eden Hazard, his shirt ripped and replaced, led the charge and was irrepressible until replaced by Willian late on.\n\nGiroud, so impressive since arriving from Arsenal in January, offered a focal point to exploit.

Lambert spent most of his time doing shuttle runs along the edge of the technical area, jawing in the ear of the fourth official, his face turning a curious shade of puce – or, put another way, looking every inch the nervous manager.\n\nHe was briefly calmed just before half-time. Shaqiri was fouled about 25 yards out, hitched his shorts up his vast thighs and whipped the free-kick into the goalkeeper’s top-left corner.

That has been a theme of Stoke’s season. “It’s people being anxious, worried about what might happen when we’ve got the lead,” Lambert said.\n\nThat anxiety manifested itself in Stoke’s defensive line dropping virtually on to Jack Butland’s toes, inviting Palace on. Stoke looked like a team trying to hold on for 45 minutes and, while Lambert has tightened their defence since arriving in January, it seemed a risky approach.\n\nSo it turned out, although Palace’s equaliser came after one of Stoke’s few attacks. Wilfried Zaha led a counter and fed Loftus‑Cheek, who slipped in McArthur. Shoulders slumped around the stadium when he bobbled a shot home.\n\nStoke City v Crystal Palace: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThe decisive moment came with four minutes left. Zaha played what was actually a terrible pass looking for Van Aanholt, which Ryan Shawcross looked to intercept but poked straight into the Dutch full-back’s path, and he slotted the ball beneath Butland. It was cruel, perhaps, that the final error came from the man who has been with Stoke since they came up to the top flight.\n\nThe result also confirmed that Palace are safe. Roy Hodgson has done an extraordinary job since taking over a team that had not managed a goal or a point in their first four games, (and went three more in kind under him) but he tried to direct praise towards his backroom staff. “I suppose every orchestra has to have a band leader,” he eventually said, when pressed for a little less modesty. “I’m really proud of our team’s performance, not just today but over the whole season.”\n\nIn some ways it might be the kindest thing that it is over now for Stoke. Even with a victory they might still have gone down this weekend, so at least this curtailed their pain. “It’s a chance for Stoke to rebuild,” said Lambert."}, {"date": "05/05/2018", "arena":

it the hard way.\n\nRyan Fraser’s first-half strike was enough to inflict a third successive defeat on Carlos Carvalhal’s side, who have lost form just when it matters most. From a position of relative security a few weeks ago, they are now in serious danger of slipping through the trapdoor.\n\nAt least their manager could console himself with the fact that, with Tuesday’s crucial home fixture against Southampton and another against already-relegated Stoke City to come, Swansea’s fate remains in their own hands.\n\nYet on this evidence, after a seventh match in a row without a victory, they could be on borrowed time, even if Carvalhal appeared relaxed about the nerve-wracking week he has ahead.\n\n“I’m not worried because we depend on ourselves,” insisted the Portuguese.\n\n“When I arrived, if I had said at that moment that we would have two games at home left to stay in the Premier League, then nobody would have believed it. When you have something in your hands, let’s do it. At the Liberty we are strong and the fans can make a big impact. When we depend on ourselves we can do it all the time. We don’t need to hear about other teams on the radio or on television.”\n\nHe added: “Tuesday will be a game that will decide a lot of things – we’ve known about that since I arrived. I believe we will stay in the Premier League.”\n\nMark Noble fires West Ham to win at Leicester and step closer to safety Read more\n\nGiven that his side had failed to win on the road since the victory over Watford in his first match after replacing Paul Clement at the end of December, it was no surprise to see Carvalhal opt for a safety-first approach to his starting lineup against Bournemouth. Perhaps with the showdown with Southampton in mind, he opted to leave Sam Clucas and Kyle Naughton out to give them a chance to be ready for Tuesday.\n\nWith their own Premier League status for another season virtually confirmed even before kick-off despite Eddie Howe’s protestations to the contrary, there was a carnival atmosphere for Bournemouth’s last home game of the campaign, on a beautiful day on the south coast. The home side’s intent was clear from the start and they almost took the lead inside the first 90 seconds when Federico Fernández did well to deny Callum Wilson a clear-cut chance. Mike van der Hoorn then should have put Swansea ahead in the 12th minute, after an excellent free-kick routine, but Asmir Begovic was there to deny him.\n\nWilson was the next to waste an opportunity after a delightful ball across goal from Fraser, but, prompted by Lewis Cook’s industry in midfield, Bournemouth continued to dominate proceedings.\n\nYet Swansea, and Alfie Mawson in particular, were the architects of their own downfall when they fell behind eight minutes before half-time.\n\nA moment’s hesitation from the defender allowed Wilson to nip in front of him and Mawson was lucky referee Kevin Friend did not point to the spot after bringing down his opponent just inside the box. He was the first to react to Bournemouth’s quickly taken free-kick, but could only divert Fraser’s shot past a helpless Lukasz Fabianski with his head.\n\nJake Livermore’s late winner keeps alive West Brom hopes of staying up Read more\n\nJordan Ayew had the chance to equalise immediately, after excellent interplay with his older brother, but his shot went embarrassingly wide of the target.\n\nThe second half also began with Ayew going close, although, this time, he at least forced Begovic into another save after creating space for himself. An increasingly fretful Carvalhal paced the touchline like a man possessed whenever Bournemouth came close to threatening at the other end, with Steve Cook wasting a great chance from Joshua King’s cross.\n\nQuick guide Promotion and relegation: how they stand Show Hide Premier League Champions: Manchester City\n\n\n\nChampions League: Manchester United and Tottenham in the group stage, Liverpool will face a play-off unless they win this year's final.

They have endured a traumatic season but this was a rare moment of gaiety. David Moyes strode on to the pitch to embrace his players at the end and even Andy Carroll, banished from training earlier in the week, could be seen lapping up the acclaim from the jubilant away fans.\n\nWest Ham had delivered a passable impression of unity just when a collapse looked possible with Mark Noble’s spectacular effort in the second half securing the win that ensures their survival and all the discontent belonged to Leicester instead. The King Power Stadium was empty for the home team’s lap of appreciation, almost two years to the day since Leicester lifted the Premier League trophy, and it is impossible not to fear for Claude Puel’s job prospects.\n\nLeicester’s apathy strengthened the theory that they have stopped playing for Claude Puel. The Frenchman has overseen a run of four wins in 19 games and was subjected to mutinous chants from the home fans, who amused themselves with ironic cheers when Christian Fuchs roused Adrián, the visiting goalkeeper, with a shot from long range in the 86th minute. The harsh truth is that West Ham did not have to be spectacular to dominate, even if Moyes was delighted with his side’s response to last Sunday’s chastening defeat to Manchester City.\n\n“I’m really pleased with the performance,” West Ham’s manager said. “It was really good, especially in the first half. More importantly the result was what mattered. The sooner we got a win, the better. We are capable of that. What I’m trying to get is for us to be capable every week.”\n\nWith Puel teetering on the brink, West Ham did not dare pass up the opportunity to move five points clear of the bottom three and, when Southampton conceded a late equaliser at Everton, the Hammers’ survival was confirmed. Moyes had complained before the game that a culture of leaks was making his job harder, but this was a time for togetherness and it soon became apparent that the visitors had nothing to fear from their unhappy opponents.\n\nJake Livermore’s late winner keeps alive West Brom hopes of staying up Read more\n\nLeicester, missing nine players, struggled to build any positive intent. They relinquished possession with alarming frequency, leaving Jamie Vardy isolated in attack, and they were fortunate when Manuel Lanzini failed to punish a poor clearance from Ben Hamer in the fifth minute.\n\nHamer would soon be forced to race from his line to deny Marko Arnautovic, whose next contribution was to get in the way of Lanzini’s shot, and Leicester’s lethargy would have shamed a hungover teenager. Puel insisted that he is looking forward to next season but his bosses might have other ideas.\n\nWest Ham had control in midfield and, despite starting without an orthodox striker again, the measure of Leicester’s defence. Lanzini and João Mário were full of mischief in their floating roles behind Arnautovic, who settled for creating the opening goal a minute after rattling the bar with a fierce effort.\n\nArthur Masuaku, an effervescent presence on the left after returning to the starting lineup, swung a deep cross to the far post in the 34th minute and Arnautovic levered himself into position, making space with the slightest of pushes on Fuchs, and pulled the ball back for Mário to finish from close range.\n\nWatford end winless run as Andre Gray secures victory over Newcastle Read more\n\nLeicester played with greater intensity at the start of the second half and were enraged when Aaron Cresswell escaped with a booking after stopping Vardy with an intentional handball. Yet they failed to stretch one of the league’s leakiest defences and West Ham should have profited on the break, only for Arnautovic to dither with Lanzini screaming for a pass.\n\nSensing edginess, Puel replaced Hamza Choudhury and Fousseni Diabaté with Demarai Gray and Kelechi Iheanacho in the 61st minute and Leicester almost equalised when Harry Maguire whistled a shot over from 18 yards.\n\nYet Arnautovic would soon be placing his hands on his head in disbelief as he watched Noble’s vicious volley from 25 yards swerve to Hamer’s right and nestle in the bottom corner. It was a stunning goal from the midfielder, who showed perfect technique when he met a loose clearance with his right foot, and an audacious way for West Ham to seal a precious victory."}, {"date":

eased pressure on manager Javi Gracia as Watford ended a seven-match winless run by dispatching Newcastle 2-1.\n\nFit-again captain Troy Deeney missed a penalty, with Magpies keeper Martin Dubravka making a fine double save, while Ayoze Pérez’s impressive finish came to nought for the visitors.\n\nStoke relegated from Premier League after Van Aanholt strikes for Crystal Palace Read more\n\nThe battling hosts threw their support behind boss Gracia’s candidature to remain as manager next term, while Newcastle’s season-ending malaise continued.\n\nFormer Malaga boss Gracia has already admitted he does not know whether he will still be Watford coach next seasonHe only arrived in January, to become Watford’s eighth manager in five years - but an 18-month contract carries precious little security.\n\nThe 48-year-old received a stirring show of support from his squad on Saturday however, as the Hornets held on for victory in their final Premier League home game of the season.\n\nPereyra’s fifth goal of the season rubber-stamped Watford’s high-octane opening, the Argentina midfielder blasting home to cap a neat build-up.\n\nThe lively Will Hughes’ astute angled ball bisected the Newcastle defence, before Pereyra blasted home in style. The 27-year-old should have doubled his and his team’s tally mere moments later, only for Dubravka to rescue the visitors.\n\nNewcastle’s Slovakia goalkeeper spared Rafael Benítez’s blushes again when denying Gray who had raced clean through. The former Burnley striker quickly atoned for that failed effort however, when Pereyra’s fine hanging cross left him no option but to nod into the empty net.\n\nWatford should have turned around three goals to the good, only for the inspired Dubravka to deny Deeney both from the penalty spot and the rebound. Paul Dummett upended Gray in the box after an even foot race, only for Deeney to let the north east side off the hook.\n\nWhen Newcastle finally produced a move of substance, after the break, they found the net. The outstretched Pérez expertly redirected Javier Manquillo’s whipped cross for his sixth league goal of the campaign, immediately altering the game’s complexion.\n\nFrom armchair comfort to nail-gnawing nerves, suddenly Watford were back in a scrap. Anonymous until the hour, Dwight Gayle then spurned two fine Newcastle chances, first unable to turn in the box, then failing to glance a header on target. Pérez flicked a corner the wrong side of the post as Newcastle continued to press, before Mikel Merino failed to convert a fine late chance.\n\nWatford might have wilted in the bank holiday weekend heat, but still merited victory on a day when Newcastle paid dearly for being caught cold."}, {"date": "05/05/2018", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 23685, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich

If other results go in their favour – they need Swansea and Southampton to draw on Tuesday for a start – then victory at Crystal Palace next Sunday could secure their survival.\n\nThat outcome seemed utterly implausible when Darren Moore stepped into the vacancy left by the dismissal of Alan Pardew last month but Moore has transformed the team’s fortunes, inspiring a run of three wins and two draws from his five matches at the helm. No wonder the crowd clamoured here for him to be appointed on a permanent basis.\n\nWatford end winless run as Andre Gray secures victory over Newcastle Read more\n\nAs the clock ticked past 90 minutes West Brom were on course to prolong Moore’s unbeaten record but his team knew anything less than a win would lead to demotion on the spot. So there was an explosion of joy all around the Hawthorns when Livermore forced the ball over Spurs’ line from close range following an almighty scramble after a corner by Matt Phillips.\n\nAll around the ground except in the visiting dugout, that is, as Mauricio Pochettino was left to lament the “lack of ambition” shown by his team throughout a match from which they seemed to expect a comfortable win. No such criticism could be directed at Moore’s side.\n\nSpurs, aiming to consolidate their place in the top four and maintain their notional chance of leapfrogging Manchester United into second place, began as if their victory was as inevitable as the hosts’ relegation was supposed to be. They set up camp in West Brom’s half and waited for an opening to present itself, hogged possession but were ponderous. Unable to create early on, Tottenham seemed in need of unwitting assistance from their opponents. But, unlike during most of the campaign, West Brom did not oblige. They defended steadfastly.\n\nSign up for the Fiver, our daily football email.\n\nNot until the 24th minute did Spurs even attempt a shot. It was a good one, Victor Wanyama’s curling effort from 20 yards forcing Ben Foster to tip over the bar. Danny Rose tried something similar one minute later but sent the ball into the stands.\n\nKieran Trippier produced the first really incisive pass of the game, sliding in Harry Kane on the half-hour. Foster rushed off his line and diverted the striker’s shot from eight yards behind for a corner. From the set piece Spurs worked the ball to Christian Eriksen, whose cross from the left found Kane. But the striker could not steer a header on target.\n\nWest Brom’s rope-a-dope strategy nearly paid off before the break. Chris Brunt’s long free-kick into the box in the 41st minute ran all the way to Jay Rodriguez, who dabbed the ball across the face of goal. Toby Alderweireld headed it out for a corner before any home player could pounce. But three minutes later West Brom almost took the lead from another corner, only for Ahmed Hegazi to nod wide from six yards.\n\nSpurs were nearly caught out within moments of the resumption after half-time, as Phillips glided down the right and crossed for Salomón Rondón but the striker missed his kick from close range.\n\nBournemouth leave Swansea teetering after Ryan Fraser seals victory Read more\n\nWest Brom grew bolder as the finale drew closer. “We knew we had to contain them early on and the pendulum started to swing around the 60th minute,” said Moore. “We just had the trust and belief that we would get a goal.”\n\nAs West Brom applied more pressure Kane became so spooked that he almost slicked a cross into his own net. Hugo Lloris had to make a brilliant save to prevent the England striker from being credited with a goal that he would not have wanted to claim.\n\nThe one West Brom craved came in stoppage time, Livermore stabbing the ball into the net from inches out after Lloris parried a close-range header by Craig Dawson. When the final whistle went, players who have been booed off many times this season were acclaimed by the Hawthorns crowd. Fans made it clear they want Moore to remain at the helm for next season no matter the league they play in.\n\n“There’s been some pride restored,” said Moore. “The feelgood factor is back around the community and club. I feel from the support that there is a real good energy in the club again and that’s all anybody would really want.”"}, {"date": "05/05/2018", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38225,

second successive league victory under Mark Hughes through a last-gasp equaliser from Tom Davies. The visitors must have thought they had done enough to win, with Nathan Redmond even bringing a late save from Jordan Pickford when Southampton had been reduced to 10 men, but when Ryan Bertrand gave the ball away with just seconds remaining Davies crashed in a shot from Idrissa Gueye’s square ball via a deflection off Wesley Hoedt.\n\nThe only consolation for Southampton is that they still managed to move out of the bottom three and above Swansea, going into the all-important meeting in South Wales on Tuesday. There was also another reprieve for West Brom, who would have been relegated by a Southampton victory, but little respite for Sam Allardyce. Though Everton have been safe for some time their manager’s position is looking increasingly precarious. Allardyce was hoping to use this game to leave Everton fans feeling positive over the summer, and it is doubtful whether Davies’s late rescue act will have quite that effect.\n\nEverton v Southampton: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nHughes was furious at the end because Jon Moss awarded a free-kick against Redmond for an offence no one else had seen, then allowed Everton to take it from the wrong place. Not what you need when you are shorthanded and trying to cling on for dear life. “Jon Moss was 30 yards behind the play, as he usually is,” the Southampton manager said. “He gave a free-kick that shouldn’t have been. At least we took something from the game. Everton had to change their shape to match us and we were still better at it than they were. We got everything right in the game until the final few moments, and we didn’t get any help from the officials.”\n\nDavies showed willing in the opening minutes with a shot from the edge of the area that was not too far off the target, though Everton failed to keep up anything like the same urgency. Cenk Tosun headed over the bar with a difficult chance from a Séamus Coleman cross but that was about it for home attempts on goal in the first half and Allardyce was soon in his technical area gesturing furiously for his side to get men further forward.\n\nSouthampton were the first side to bring a save from a goalkeeper, and a very good one it was too from Pickford, whose reactions did not let him down when Charlie Austin sent in a volley on target with little warning after the ball came his way off Michael Keane. By the half-hour mark Southampton were looking the more likely to make a breakthrough and Everton were glad Phil Jagielka was in the right position to make a timely interception when the ball came through to Oriol Romeu in front of goal.\n\nTo say the game was low on incident and excitement would be a considerable understatement. The home side departed to boos at half-time, though that has become par for the course in recent weeks. Even when Everton won at Huddersfield last week there was still dissatisfaction expressed at the style of football being played under Allardyce. Or perhaps just the continued presence of Allardyce. The school of science, it is being said by some unhappy supporters, is presently in special measures.\n\nAllardyce is impervious to that sort of background noise, of course, and as a half-time flourish to mark the end of his first season at Goodison he brought on Ramiro Funes Mori for Yannick Bolasie and switched to a back three. He does not exactly court popularity, though something needed to change and after an anonymous first half the winger could hardly complain.\n\nJake Livermore’s late winner keeps alive West Brom hopes of staying up Read more\n\nSouthampton also made a change, Redmond replacing the ineffective Mario Lemina, and 10 minutes after the restart it was Hughes looking smug on the sideline. Dusan Tadic and Cédric Soares found space on the Everton left behind the now advanced Leighton Baines – always the drawback with wing-backs – and from the latter’s precise cross Redmond arrived in the area to beat Pickford with a firm downward header. Cue joy in the small corner of the Bullens Road stand that was red and white and more boos from the blue majority.\n\nThe visitors were forced to see out the last five minutes with 10 men after Maya Yoshida picked up a second yellow for a foul on Oumar Niasse. Baines brought a brilliant fingertip save from Alex McCarthy with a stoppage-time free-kick but time was running out when Bertrand made his mistake and invited Everton to claim a point they barely merited. That may sound harsh but Allardyce himself admitted it. “We nicked a point we didn’t deserve,” the Everton manager said. “It’s disappointing but we have made overall progress.”"}, {"date": "04/05/2018", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30611, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [57], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Goldson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ezequiel Schelotto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jürgen Locadia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Brighton have enjoyed plenty of giddy highs since their restoration to the top division last summer but this was a victory to cap them all.

Read more\n\nAlbion’s run-in had always looked daunting, with trips to the Premier League champions and Champions League finalists to come in the final week. Yet by winning for the first time since early March and discomforting United all night, they have quelled fears of a late sting in the season’s tail.\n\n“It’s a relief because I felt we’ve deserved to stay in this league for our season’s work,” said Hughton. “If we’d lost today and the next two and somehow gone down, it would have been a real feeling of injustice. Normally when you win this type of game it’s because you’ve played at a good level and maybe your keeper has had to make some good saves or they’ve missed some chances. But United didn’t have a clear-cut chance in the 90 minutes. We were good value for the win.”\n\nThat was an understatement. Brighton’s attacking approach play had been more assured and incisive all night, led by Izquierdo and Anthony Knockaert, who tends to rouse himself for occasions such as these. The hosts’ back-line was obdurate and organised, their midfield industrious and energetic and neither of United’s centre-halves ever appeared at ease in trying to combat the splendidly awkward Glenn Murray. De Gea’s stunning first-half save denied the striker from distance. Izquierdo would be thwarted in similar fashion before José Mourinho could haul his players back into the dressing-room for a dressing-down.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brighton players celebrate Gross’s goal, with goalkeeper Mat Ryan running the length of the pitch to join in.

The Portuguese was a picture of disgust through most of the first half, eventually retreating from his technical area as if to distance himself from such a mess of a performance. Where Albion were urgent and energetic, the visitors were horribly slack.\n\nSimple passes were repeatedly guided out of play, team-mates delivering blindly and misreading colleagues’ runs, their wavelengths forever scrambled. Sloppiness infected the visitors’ approach, with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, players for whom there has been a clamour for greater involvement, either too anxious to impress or too rusty to do themselves justice. In the end the injured Alexis Sánchez and Romelu Lukaku actually emerged with their own reputations enhanced in absentia. Both will hope to be fit for the game at Wembley against Chelsea.\n\nJosé Mourinho blames loss at Brighton on Manchester United bit-part players Read more\n\nUnited’s best opportunity was spurned as the final whistle approached, Rashford flicking a return pass inside for the substitute Jesse Lingard just inside the penalty area, only for the former Brighton loanee to skew his shot wide as Shane Duffy dived in to challenge.\n\nMourinho had made a beeline for Hughton on the touchline as soon as the chance was missed, offering him a hug of congratulations.

It did not bother Mauricio Pochettino that there were times when his bruised players tried too hard to extinguish their disappointment at failing to reach the FA Cup final. They still won with plenty left in the tank and, in the end, this was a timely reminder that the modern Tottenham possess more resolve than many of their predecessors.\n\nThat is why Pochettino likes to speak about this young team’s development. The Argentinian has hardened their mentality and, while Tottenham’s wait for their first trophy since 2008 will not end this season, the bottom line is that they can guarantee a top-four finish by beating West Brom on Saturday and Newcastle next Wednesday.\n\nDele Alli’s opener provided them with a springboard to move five points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea and Tottenham will pip Liverpool to third place if they win their final three matches. They endured some awkward moments here and Watford, who are still not arithmetically safe from relegation, felt aggrieved not to have won for the first time since 3 March. Harry Kane’s 38th goal of the season killed off Javi Gracia’s side, though, and left Pochettino praising his team’s response to losing their FA Cup semi-final to Manchester United last weekend.\n\nTottenham facing up to reality check as stadium costs escalate Read more\n\n“It is important in the last few games that we win,” Pochettino said. “We were all disappointed. Our fans the same. You felt it. I am so proud of the mentality and commitment they showed.”\n\nThe game was played in a subdued atmosphere, with plenty of empty seats dotted around the ground, and Spurs were often there for the taking. There was a slight air of edginess about their play and Pochettino frowned at his team’s tentativeness in the final third, especially when Kane spurned a decent shooting opportunity with an awkward piece of control in the 12th minute. Watford sensed an opportunity to exploit that unease, showing inventiveness on the break, and Spurs’ defenders were relieved to see Hugo Lloris deny Andre Gray in the 25th minute.\n\nThe frustration for Watford, however, was that one defensive aberration had already undermined their enterprising approach by the time Gray saw his snapshot pushed away.\n\nA team with Tottenham’s attacking options rarely require a helping hand from their opponents and Orestis Karnezis will wince when he watches a replay of the mistake that handed the home team an undeserved lead.\n\nThe threat looked minimal when Kieran Trippier whipped a cross towards the near post from the right flank. It should have been a routine catch for Karnezis. Instead, the Watford goalkeeper was distracted by Christian Kabasele ducking underneath the ball and his fumble presented Christian Eriksen with the chance to tee up Alli, who drove a low shot into the unguarded net.\n\nSign up for The Fiver and get our daily football email.\n\nHowever, Pochettino was mistaken if he thought that isolated show of composure from Alli would settle his players. Watford targeted Tottenham’s unconvincing high line, forcing Lloris to race out of his area to beat Abdoulaye Doucouré to a through-ball, and all that was missing was a touch of ruthlessness.\n\nA lovely backheel from Will Hughes released Doucouré, who shot straight at Lloris, and Richarlison also had an effort pushed away after combining with Gray. “We conceded a few chances but Lloris showed fantastic skills in goal,” Pochettino said. His side would make Watford regret their generosity. “We conceded cheap goals,” Gracia said. “When we created chances we didn’t score.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Kane scores Tottenham’s second goal. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTottenham emerged with renewed focus at the start of the second half and normal service was resumed when Kane made it 2-0. The goal stemmed from one of those flowing moves that have made Spurs so enjoyable to watch under Pochettino, Eriksen shuffling a pass to Alli, who poked the ball through to Son Heung-min on the left. Son wasted no time turning the ball across goal and, although Kane slipped in the middle, the striker sprung back to his feet to meet Trippier’s centre with a crisp shot.\n\nWatford, winless on their travels since 25 November, had been put in their place. Richarlison contrived to fire over from close range and Gerard Deulofeu had a goal correctly ruled out for offside. But despite losing Mousa Dembélé to an ankle injury, Tottenham closed out the game after Kane’s goal.\n\nQuick guide Promotion and relegation: how they stand Show Hide Premier League Champions: Manchester City\n\n\n\nChampions League: Manchester United and Tottenham in the group stage, Liverpool will face a play-off unless they win this year's final.

before the final whistle, their mood more one of resignation than disgust, with West Ham’s Premier League status feeling ever more precarious.\n\nBreathing space from the bottom three has been squeezed to an unnerving three points and, while there is no disgrace in losing to the champions, the manner in which they surrendered was disturbing. Manchester City sauntered to a thrashing and the near silence in the stands was significant.\n\nConsidering how many opportunities were created but passed up by Pep Guardiola’s side against the division’s most porous defence, this felt like an escape. City as good as declared in the latter stages, by which time their season’s goal tally was marginally short of a Premier League record having been swollen to 102. Yaya Touré strolled around central midfield for the last 20 minutes while the teenage England youth international Lukas Nmecha led the line on his league debut, and even then the ball rarely left the home side’s half. West Ham, chasing shadows for all but a brief period before the interval, were pummelled into submission.\n\nManchester City out of Women’s Champions League after Bronze’s strike Read more\n\nDavid Moyes must somehow raise spirits for Saturday’s trip to Leicester, otherwise this season could have a sting in its tail, not least because Manchester United and the stewardship of Sam Allardyce’s Everton are still to visit. The prospect of their former manager condemning them to the Championship is unthinkable. “I’m not as anxious as when I first came in, because we were in the bottom three then,” said Moyes. “In the main our form here has been pretty good. I’m hoping one of those last two games will turn into points and we also go to Leicester. If we turn one of those into a win, I think we’ll be OK.”\n\nThe worries will persist, though, while his team labour like this. It was the kind of masterclass City tend to impose in these parts. Last season they had prospered 4-0 and 5-0 here, playing on West Ham’s insecurities and relishing the wide open spaces on offer. This was merely more of the same, with Raheem Sterling granted the freedom of the right flank by Patrice Evra and Aaron Cresswell while Leroy Sané revelled on the opposite wing. City did not need to innovate or adjust. Other teams may have profited of late from a more aggressive, smothering approach but Moyes had clearly determined his own side lack the dynamism to swarm into such a press and simply sat deeper hoping to survive.\n\nIt was never likely to be enough. Only briefly did they flicker into life, Cresswell slamming a free-kick beyond Ederson just before the interval when, in truth, West Ham should have been awarded a penalty after Ilkay Gündoğan’s trip on Edimilson Fernandes. Perhaps if Nicolás Otamendi had been dismissed for a pair of first-half fouls, West Ham might have gained a foothold. Instead they were swept aside, the latest victims of City’s swashbuckling approach.\n\nThe most majestic of the visitors’ rewards was their third, scored by Gabriel Jesus early in the second half, the striker initially supplying a wonderfully weighted and incisive pass that sent Sterling scurrying beyond Cresswell and into the penalty area. Just as impressive was the winger’s clarity of thought as he contemplated his centre while West Ham flooded their penalty area. In darted Jesus, unnoticed, to collect with a glorious first touch, disorienting Pablo Zabaleta in the process, and then beat Adrián from close range.\n\nSterling, whose display warranted a goal, should have earned his side a penalty after Cresswell’s trip but it was his scurry on to Fernandinho’s pass and accurate return for the Brazilian to score that secured the team’s fourth of West Ham’s long afternoon. “Sometimes we judge him on the times he misses but the amount of actions he creates … the assists today, the penalties he wins because he’s so fast and quick,” said Guardiola. “He’s a guy who can go inside, outside, make dribbles. He misses simple balls still and he has to be more aggressive. But he has improved so much.”\n\nWest Ham never came close to containing him, for all that there was a sloppiness to City’s first two goals which betrayed the fragility of local confidence. Sané had benefited from Cresswell’s reluctance to engage early on, though the German’s shot required a heavy deflection off Evra to bypass the wrong-footed Adrián. The goalkeeper did better to thwart Sterling before the half-hour, only for City to retrieve the loose ball with Gündoğan supplying Kevin De Bruyne on the overlap. His centre flicked off Adrián’s fingertips and bounced in off Declan Rice and Zabaleta.

Wenger had been clapped to his seat but the hospitality did not extend to the pitch. His team had conceded a 91st-minute winner and, however rich the tributes might be for the departing manager, Arsenal have now lost six successive away fixtures in the league for the first time since Billy Wright was their manager in 1966.\n\nWenger left Old Trafford with a silver vase, presented by Sir Alex Ferguson, and the lingering memory of this game will be the applause that followed the Frenchman along the touchline before the start. By the end, however, Old Trafford had reverted to type. “We want you to stay” was the cry, directed towards Wenger, after the stoppage-time header from Marouane Fellaini that meant Arsenal’s manager will remember his final visit to this stadium with little affection.\n\nArséne Wenger praises ‘classy’ gesture from Manchester United Read more\n\nThat goal means Arsenal are still the only team in England’s top four divisions to have lost every league game on the road since the turn of the year. It is an ignominious record and typical, perhaps, of the club’s decline if it is generally accepted that the teams with the better away results are usually the ones with the stronger personality. Arsenal, for example, rarely lost on the road in Wenger’s peak years.\n\nThose days can feel a long time ago when it is Alex Iwobi in central midfield, rather than Patrick Vieira, and Calum Chambers operating in the space Tony Adams used to occupy. Yet it would be difficult to be too harsh when Wenger’s team selection was guided by the fact that the team have the second leg of their Europa League semi-final coming up against Atlético Madrid on Thursday.\n\nMesut Özil, Aaron Ramsey, Alexandre Lacazette and Jack Wilshere were among the players given a day off. All the same, Arsenal held their own for long spells and, at times, threatened a winner of their own following Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s equalising goal against his former club.\n\nIn total, Wenger made eight changes from the team that drew against Atlético last Thursday. This was the youngest Arsenal team, with an average age of 24 years and 67 days, since the infamous 8-2 defeat here in August 2011 and to put it into perspective, there were three teenagers on the bench – Eddie Nketiah, Jordi Osei-Tutu and Joe Willock – whose shirt numbers were in the 60s. Of Arsenal’s entire match-day squad, Mkhitaryan was only player with a number between one and 11.\n\nWenger’s record against Mourinho – now two victories from 19 attempts – is fairly lamentable even with his strongest group of players. Here, though, he was trying to beat his old rival with the kind of inexperienced team he would usually put out in the Carabao Cup. Konstantinos Mavropanos, a 21-year-old Greek defender, became the 200th player of the Wenger era to be given a debut. Arsenal’s midfield included Reiss Nelson and Ainsley Maitland-Niles and, with so many changes for the visitors, it must have been troubling for Mourinho that his team could not exert more control. Wenger summed it up accurately as “a positive performance but negative result”.\n\nAlexis Sánchez certainly found it heavy going at times against his former club, whereas Maitland-Niles, in particular, seemed determined to show that Arsenal have more strength in depth than many people might realise. Sánchez was, however, prominently involved in the opening goal for United, in the 16th minute, when Romelu Lukaku’s cross picked him out at the far post. Sánchez’s header was going in until Héctor Bellerín thrust out a leg to divert the ball against a post. The rebound fell kindly for Paul Pogba and he hooked the ball into an exposed net.\n\nAll that had originated from Nelson, Arsenal’s youngest player losing the ball to Jesse Lingard close to the halfway line. It was a lesson for the 18-year-old that, at this level, those kind of mistakes tend to be punished. Yet the teenager did well overall and the build-up to Arsenal’s equaliser was a reminder that even players of considerable experience can be guilty of costly lapses.\n\nOld foe’s presence a reminder that Arsène Wenger’s glory days are past | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nFor this one it was a combination of errors, with Nemanja Matic and Ander Herrera leaving a pass from Antonio Valencia to one another and as soon as Granit Xhaka sprung the counter-attack, United were vulnerable. Mkhitaryan had sprinted upfield in support and his low shot from just outside the penalty area picked out a gap between Victor Lindelof’s legs to find its way into David de Gea’s net.\n\nBy that stage, United had lost Lukaku to a foot injury and it was not until the final exchanges that the home side started to pin back their opponents. Fellaini hit a post with one header and when the substitute Marcus Rashford bundled in the rebound the goal was ruled out by a late offside flag. Unfortunately for Wenger, the next time Fellaini won a header in the penalty area there was no intervention.\n\nThat goal should confirm United’s second-placed finish, five points clear of Liverpool in third with a game in hand. Arsenal, on the other hand, have lost 10 away fixtures for the first time since the 1989-90 season and, with 57 points from 35 games, are guaranteed to finish with the worst total of Wenger’s 22-year reign, the previous low being 67 in 2005-06. He talked afterwards of his gratitude for the “classy” gift from United and the crowd’s applause. But he must have preferred the days when the crowd in Manchester had cause to fear his teams. “It shows that once you’re not a danger any more, people love you.”"}, {"date": "28/04/2018", "arena":

on the matter in hand, describing this game as the most important one of the season and appealing to the crowd for fervent support, though a rugged and resolute Stoke were the last opponents Liverpool needed to meet between the two legs of their Champions League semi-final.\n\nLiverpool v Stoke City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThere was no goal for Mohamed Salah, who will now have only two more chances to set a Premier League scoring record, and no confidence boost from temporarily climbing above Manchester United to second in the table. Defeat at Chelsea next Sunday could likely leave a top-four finish hanging on the final day’s home game with Brighton.\n\nLiverpool wanted more than a point from this fixture but so too did Stoke, who need wins to get out of trouble. Paul Lambert’s side put in a solid performance to frustrate Liverpool but it is possibly too little and too late. Stoke have not won a league match at Anfield since 1959 and, though this draw preserves Lambert’s record of never losing here in six visits as a manager, he may have to wait a while for his next opportunity unless other results go his way.\n\n“We were outstanding. I couldn’t ask the players for anything more,” the Stoke manager said. “Liverpool have been scoring for fun and we stopped them. They didn’t create that many chances.”\n\nKlopp did not make a huge fuss about the Erik Pieters handball that could have earned Liverpool a late penalty or about the occasionally over-physical way in which the full-back stuck close to Salah.\n\n“Football is a physical game and Mo is probably the most attacked player in the Premier League but all the lads are used to that,” the Liverpool manager said, before confirming Sadio Mané would be back for Roma on Wednesday and that Salah and Jordan Henderson should overcome minor knocks. “We didn’t score, so it’s not the best day of my life but for sure I’ve had worse days.”\n\nThe visitors must have had an inkling their luck was in when Salah passed up a glorious chance after five minutes and with it the possibility of settling home nerves and forcing the opposition to chase the game. Early plans to limit the space available for the Egyptian to run into evaporated as Salah broke from halfway into an empty half but, having carried the ball into the area and put himself in a one-on-one situation with Jack Butland, he chipped the goalkeeper and uncharacteristically missed the target.\n\nThus reprieved, Stoke went on to create a few chances of their own in a first half which saw Liverpool do most of the attacking without quite making the final pass count. Mame Biram Diouf headed into the side-netting after a Joe Gomez slip gave Moritz Bauer the opportunity to cross and, when Xherdan Shaqiri rolled the ball across an unguarded Liverpool goalline a few minutes later, neither Peter Crouch nor Badou Ndiaye could stretch far enough to gain the necessary touch.\n\nSign up for the Recap, our weekly pick of the best content on Guardian.com/sport.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum came closest to breaking the first-half deadlock when shooting narrowly wide from a Roberto Firmino lay-off, though Salah might have made something from an unforced Butland error had he not been unceremoniously barged over on the edge of the area by Pieters. He took the free-kick himself but was unable to trouble Butland again and, when Danny Ings put the ball in the net from a narrow angle on the stroke of half-time, he was correctly flagged offside.\n\nAfter watching 20 stodgy second-half minutes of Liverpool struggling to break down Stoke, Klopp sent on James Milner and Nathaniel Clyne to try to inject a little more urgency.\n\nClyne was presented with a decent opening almost immediately, only to head tamely into Butland’s arms, before Milner set up Alberto Moreno for a shot that flew wide but still amounted to Liverpool’s best attempt since turning round. The afternoon did not get any better for those in red, though at least they were spared the ignominy of following the midweek Roma 5-2 spectacular with a home defeat when Ryan Shawcross was unable to turn the ball in at the far post after excellent work from Diouf.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Erik Pieters pulls his arm away after being struck by Georginio Wijnaldum’s cross.

The rebound off the woodwork and appeared to strike Lewis Dunk on the arm but Roger East refrained from awarding the home side their first Premier League penalty in more than a year.\n\n“There is no point in me talking about penalties,” Dyche said, jokingly. “Cartoon capers, someone just sneaks a club out on someone’s head, we might get one then, but they might not see it. Eventually we’ll get a penalty, you imagine.”\n\nSign up for The Fiver, our tea-timely football email.\n\nIt was also a point towards Brighton’s objective of survival, although Southampton’s victory over Bournemouth cut the gap between Hughton’s side and the bottom three to five points.

For the large majority of the game I thought we dealt with that threat.\n\n“There is probably a tinge of disappointment that we didn’t get the win.

Roy Hodgson as full-time approached, the Crystal Palace manager responding with a wave from his dugout. The south London club may not be arithmetically assured of survival but this was surely the riotous victory which extended their stay in the Premier League into a sixth campaign. He deserved his moment.\n\nTo have in effect guaranteed their status before the end of April is remarkable. Rewind to September and the side had languished pointless and goalless at the foot of the table after seven games, Frank de Boer’s tenure having already been curtailed with the dust still to settle on the summer transfer window. Hodgson had come in as a firefighter. He has since steered the side to 38 points with two games to go without a goalscoring centre-forward, a crippling injury list and with no significant additions in January.\n\nBurnley set to end 50-year wait for European football after Brighton draw Read more\n\nThe smile of satisfaction which creased across the manager’s face on the final whistle said it all, relief giving way to unbridled delight as he clapped hands with his assistant, Ray Lewington, and the locals celebrated their most emphatic win in Premier League history. Hodgson has done what he does best: diligent coaching allied with logical team selection, with players revelling in the positions they know best. Common sense and industry have led the way, with Wilfried Zaha the free spirit in amid the industry.\n\nHe is the player who can set this collective apart. Leicester were unable to deal with the Ivorian’s trickery and slippery running, particularly once they had been reduced to 10 men after Marc Albrighton had brought down the forward. It had been his first-time finish beyond Ben Hamer which set the tone, Palace having shifted the ball wonderfully in-field, from Ruben Loftus-Cheek to Yohan Cabaye to James McArthur’s back-heel, while City dithered.\n\nZaha set up McArthur for a second, crisply dispatched into the far corner, before the interval. For all the mind-boggling exploits of Mohamed Salah or Kevin De Bruyne, surely no single player exerts as much positive influence on a team as Zaha does for Palace. “That was maybe one of his very best [performances] during my time at the club,” said Hodgson. “He balanced running with the ball, creating chances and tracking back. His all-round game was great. If he can continue like that there is no barrier for how high he can reach.”\n\nThe Fiver: sign up for our free football email\n\nThis was actually a triumph for the collective. Loftus-Cheek was excellent in front of the watching Gareth Southgate, capping his own display by collecting Mamadou Sakho’s pass to round Hamer and tap into a gaping net. Cabaye and McArthur were excellent, while Andros Townsend was irrepressible. James Tomkins saw a header scrambled from the goalline by Kelechi Iheanacho.\n\nLeicester were slack in midfield throughout, blunted further by a hamstring injury to Wilfred Ndidi and Albrighton’s dismissal. They have won only twice in 11 league games and Claude Puel is under pressure. “It’s not my concern at this moment,” said the Frenchman. “My first feeling is to stay near my players and get a good response in the next game.” He had mumbled his assessment of the game with three mentions of “catastrophe”, which neatly summed it up.\n\nDusan Tadic double earns vital win for Southampton and lifts survival hopes Read more\n\nPatrick van Aanholt belted in a fourth after Hamer had blocked from Jeffrey Schlupp, though Palace saved their most celebratory goal until last. Christian Benteke had not scored in this arena since last May. Yet Harry Maguire tripped the Belgian in stoppage time and Luka Milivojevic, having taken counsel from the bench, insisted the striker took the spot-kick.\n\nIt was a role reversal from the late farce against Bournemouth in December, when Benteke had ripped the ball from the regular penalty taker but failed to convert. Here he slipped as he connected but the ball was struck truly enough. Once he had emerged from the joyous clutter of team-mates, Palace had risen to 11th. “Miracles do happen but basically we are safe,” added Hodgson.

But the risk of them sinking has always been present and it increased with this result.\n\nDavid Wagner’s team are still clear of the bottom three but goals by Cenk Tosun and Idrissa Gueye, combined with results elsewhere, mean that Wagner believes his team will reach safety only if they scrounge points from a daunting final week of the season in which Huddersfield take on a trio of giants.\n\n“I think 35 points will not be enough to stay up,” said Wagner, whose side face trips to Manchester City and Chelsea before hosting Arsenal in a match that Huddersfield hope will not be their last in the Premier League, even if it will be Arsène Wenger’s. “Last year we worked our socks off to play these opponents and now we play them in the last week of the season and have to get points. For two and a half years we have worked on the impossible and now we face a week that is very difficult but success is possible. Other teams have shown it is possible to steal points off the top six and this is our task now.”\n\nWagner had hoped to make that task unnecessary by beating Everton. “It absolutely feels like a missed opportunity,” he admitted. “I said to the players before: ‘Is it a final?’ Yes, because we are able to get over the line [by winning] but on the other hand, maybe it isn’t, because we will have three more opportunities afterwards, admittedly against top teams.”\n\nThey began their maybe-a-final warily and never looked like producing enough sharpness to beat Everton. That has been a recurring problem during a league campaign in which they have failed to score in 19 of 35 matches.\n\nAs for the visitors, many of their supporters still want to see the back of Sam Allardyce – sporadic chants from the 2,300 travelling fans made that much clear – but the manager maintains he is not going anywhere and hopes this victory, on top of positive recent results, will help fans warm to him.\n\n“I can’t produce more than I’m doing,” he said. “What can I say when we’ve got 14 points from the last seven games when the club was in a very difficult position when I arrived? I can only say it’s one of those things. If we keep winning, we might change it to love.”\n\nThere was not much to love or fear about the visitors early on. Everton had a lot of the ball but advanced with the joy and pizzazz of a chain gang. One could understand why Evertonians complain that watching their team can feel like serving a sentence.\n\nHuddersfield were emboldened by Everton’s impotence. Steve Mounié landed the game’s first shot on target in the 17th minute but Jordan Pickford saved easily.\n\nThree minutes later Terence Kongolo tried his luck from 20 yards but his shot looked like affecting the scoreline only in that it nearly struck the giant scoreboard at the top of the stand. Rajiv van La Parra got a little closer on the half-hour when he drove the ball a couple of yards over the bar after a pull-back by Alex Pritchard.\n\nEverton were shrinking all over the pitch and perhaps their dwindling was what lulled Van La Parra into a costly lapse in the 39th minute. The winger sent an attempted crossfield pass straight to Theo Walcott, who released Tosun. Play seemed to unfold in slow motion as the Turk lumbered forward and directed a low cross-shot from the right-hand corner of the box into the bottom corner of the net. It was Tosun’s fifth goal since joining Everton in January and, for Huddersfield, a sickening strike against the run of play.\n\nWilfried Zaha stars in Crystal Palace’s five-goal thrashing of Leicester Read more\n\nEverton improved in the second half, pre-empting any Huddersfield fightback, and Jonas Lossl was forced to make good saves from Morgan Schneiderlin and Séamus Coleman.

There’s nothing we can do about the future, we can’t stop what happens but we’ve come together as a football club. There’s a wonderful trust and belief throughout the club.”\n\nThere is a clear sense that he will not be invited to remain in charge next season and Moore became uncomfortable when questioned about his future. “I’m not looking beyond the next game,” he said before, later, blowing his cheeks out in irritation when pressed further on the issue.\n\nA bleak afternoon for Benítez was further blemished by the petulant late off-the-ball kick with which substitute Islam Slimani sent Craig Dawson crashing to the turf at a dead ball.

We made too many mistakes. We weren’t playing well and West Brom were working hard. We did a fantastic, amazing job to stay up but we need the same determination we had before.”\n\nJames McClean had limbered up for kick-off with a not so subtle dig at Pardew. “No disrespect to Alan but, when we go out on the pitch now, we know what we’re doing,” said the Ireland winger.\n\nDusan Tadic double earns vital win for Southampton and lifts survival hopes Read more\n\nSharpness behind a microphone is one thing but could McClean offer a similar cutting edge with the ball at his feet? It certainly appeared so as he concluded a rapid early counterattack by veering in from the left and, capitalising on poor defending, directing an angled shot wide.\n\nThe impression that West Brom looked anything but a side all but condemned to the Championship was emphasised when Jake Livermore’s fine through pass and Matt Phillip’s well timed run combined to spring Newcastle’s offside trap before Phillips – proving a frequent menace on the right wing – cut inside and, having taken an assured first touch to steady himself, thumped a powerful right-foot shot beyond Martin Dubravka.\n\nKenedy might swiftly have equalised after a slick one-two with Ayoze Pérez but, instead, the Chelsea loanee winger’s left-foot shot hit the base of a post with Ben Foster beaten.\n\nOverall, though, Benítez’s players struggled to raise their collective game on an unseasonably chilly afternoon punctuated by frequent rain showers. Freed of the pressures involved in fighting for survival, they seemed enervated rather than liberated.\n\nIt did not help that Jonjo Shelvey was struggling to settle into his customary playmaking groove. A few of his hallmark long passes did come off but generally Shelvey looked like a man trying much too hard. Maybe the news that Gareth Southgate was considering offering him a late World Cup call-up has inhibited rather than inspired a midfielder last capped by England three years ago. Arguably the biggest beneficiary could be Livermore, who had a good game in central midfield for West Brom.\n\nIn mitigation Shelvey did create the opening from which Mo Diamé’s goalbound left-foot volley was deflected fractionally over the bar as Newcastle rallied. Indeed, they would have equalised had Foster, excellent throughout, not produced a fabulous save to divert Dwight Gayle’s close-range header to safety.\n\nSign up for the Fiver, our free football

Mark Hughes earned his first victory as their manager as his team picked up their sixth league win of the season – and their first since February – to hoist themselves closer to safety. Two goals from Dusan Tadic against neighbours Bournemouth was enough to keep what was a sinking ship in with a chance of staying afloat. Their fate may be in their own hands by the time they travel to fellow strugglers Swansea in their penultimate match in the final week of the season.\n\nWhether this result provides sufficient impetus to ensure Saints’ top-flight survival, with three games to play, remains to be seen, but a rousing standing ovation at the final whistle from almost all quarters of St Mary’s spoke volumes. Tadic labelled it as one of Southampton’s most important wins in their history.\n\n“I think everybody understood the significance of the result for us,” said Hughes, who was appointed in March. “The order of the day was to get those maximum three points and it was a rollercoaster but everybody stuck at it.\n\n“Clearly, at times there is a little bit of apprehension and anxiety in our play. Hopefully, now we’ve got those points on the board the shackles will loosen.”\n\nWest Brom give themselves hope with Matt Phillips winner against Newcastle Read more\n\nThe magnitude of this game meant Southampton and Bournemouth have never met with more at stake. Hughes described it as a “black and white” matter given that victory here was a necessity for his side, who travel to Everton on Saturday.\n\nTadic’s goals, either side of a Joshua King strike, have finally injected life into Southampton’s faltering season and could yet define a late escape.\n\n“You saw the reaction at the end of the game – it was huge for everybody,” Hughes said. “It’s not an easy situation and we are all conscious of the responsibilities we have. Maybe in the past the players have been questioned in terms of recognising what this situation is but I thought they were first-class. We will see if we can get over the line and we still have a lot to do in fairness.”\n\nIt was never going to be a nerveless occasion and Eddie Howe’s attacking side seized the initiative, with Lys Mousset’s low cross flummoxing Jan Bednarek, the Southampton defender freezing in the penalty area before conceding a corner.\n\nBournemouth were at ease, typified by Mousset’s nutmeg on Oriol Romeu and Nathan Aké’s show of strength when faced with Tadic on the touchline. But their comfort also allowed Saints in to prosper twice, much to Howe’s frustration.\n\n“We made too many bad decisions and that was probably epitomised by the two goals,” the Bournemouth manager said. “The game was there for us to exert our influence but we were too wasteful.”\n\nThe visitors were on the front foot when Southampton swarmed upfield in the 25th minute, Charlie Daniels, the last defender, isolated against Mario Lemina. The Saints midfielder galloped forward before teeing up Tadic to slot home into the corner beyond Asmir Begovic in the Bournemouth goal.\n\nThe home joy did not last to half-time, however. First, Aké, after swivelling away from Maya Yoshida and Wesley Hoedt, was superbly denied by the outstretched left leg of the Southampton goalkeeper, Alex McCarthy, before King, lurking unmarked, stabbed home from the resulting corner.\n\nLiverpool suffer European hangover as resilient Stoke cling on for a point Read more\n\nSouthampton had been thrust back to square one. It could have been worse after the interval but McCarthy pulled off another fine save, this time from Lewis Cook’s swerving effort from distance.\n\nHowever, in the 54th minute, when Steve Cook, the Bournemouth defender, went to chest down a routine ball in the centre circle, Tadic nipped in to pick up the pieces. He edged closer and closer to goal as Bournemouth backed off before the invitation was too good to pass up, and he stepped inside to fire beyond Begovic.\n\nAustin’s cross-cum-shot was almost diverted home by substitute Shane Long only for Begovic’s towering frame to intervene.\n\nBournemouth and Howe responded. Jermain Defoe and Jordon Ibe were thrown on and the former was superbly thwarted by Hoedt’s sliding challenge late on with only McCarthy to beat. Austin then slammed an effort into the side-netting as the Saints toyed with their supporters’ nerves.\n\nSouthampton looked set to seal the win, only for Simon Francis to nick the ball away from Lemina just as he readied himself to score into an empty net.\n\nStuart Attwell, the fourth official, indicated five added minutes and only at full time could Southampton finally toast the most priceless of results.\n\nQuick guide Promotion and relegation: how they stand Show Hide Premier League Champions: Manchester City\n\n\n\nChampions League: Manchester United and Tottenham in the group stage, Liverpool will face a play-off unless they win this year's final.

Cesc Fàbregas was the scorer, racking up 50 Premier League goals in style, yet it was the artistry from Eden Hazard that went before which caught the eye just as much as the midfielder’s splendid finish.\n\nSwansea contributed to their own downfall in the build-up to that early goal by carelessly giving away possession inside their own half and, although Carlos Carvalhal’s side finished the match strongly, they were unable to repair the damage as Chelsea collected a third successive away victory in the league to move two points behind Tottenham, who have a game in hand.\n\nDusan Tadic double earns vital win for Southampton and lifts survival hopes Read more\n\nFor Swansea the league table now makes for uncomfortable viewing. The four-point advantage they enjoyed over Southampton at the start of the day has been trimmed to a point and momentum seems to have deserted them at a critical stage of the season. Although Carvalhal made the point afterwards that Swansea are in a far better position than when he was appointed in December, they have failed to win in six league matches and for long periods against Chelsea it was hard to see where a goal would come from.\n\nWith three fixtures remaining their fate is still in their own hands and it promises to be quite an occasion on Tuesday week, when Southampton come to the Liberty Stadium. Stoke are then the visitors on the final day of the season and it now looks as if this relegation battle will go right to the wire. “If we play like that today, I’m sure we’ll get the necessary points,” said Carvalhal, a little optimistically.\n\nAs for Chelsea, this was not a vintage performance from them by any stretch but Antonio Conte’s side did just enough to get over the line. It was not until the final 20 minutes that the champions started to come under any real pressure, after Carvalhal scrapped the three-man central defence that has become more of a hindrance than a help to a team that struggles to create chances, and even then Chelsea looked reasonably comfortable.\n\nThe only real moment of concern for Chelsea was when Nathan Dyer tumbled to the ground in the Chelsea area following a robust challenge from Gary Cahill, who squared up to Jordan Ayew in the final seconds of the game after being unhappy with the Swansea forward’s shove on him from behind. Jon Moss, the referee, felt that Cahill got the ball cleanly when he tackled Dyer, although Carvalhal saw things differently. “He took the ball and Dyer together,” the Swansea manager said. “Outside the area it must be a foul; inside the area it must be a penalty.”\n\nWilfried Zaha stars in Crystal Palace’s five-goal thrashing of Leicester Read more\n\nConte claimed not to have seen the penalty incident and was more interested in discussing Chelsea’s lack of conviction in front of goal. “I think this season we are not clinical,” he said. “In the last period we are winning but also playing a little bit where we could kill the game but instead the game was in the balance until the end.”\n\nAsked why that has been the case with Chelsea this season, Conte replied: “Our top scorer has scored only 12 goals and, if your best scorer has scored only 12 goals, it means it is very difficult to fight for something this season. This is the reality – the stats speak very well.”\n\nHazard is the man leading the way in the goalscoring charts for Chelsea and it was a wonderful bit of play from the Belgian that created the breakthrough here. Andy King, however, will rue the moment when he allowed a routine pass to slip under his foot deep inside the Swansea half, handing Chelsea and N’Golo Kanté possession.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up for our free football email.\n\nHazard, the best player on the pitch, then picked up the ball and pirouetted away from Ki Sung-yueng with a lovely turn, before driving forward to the edge of the area. All eyes were looking to Hazard’s left but instead he played an exquisite reverse pass that bamboozled the Swansea defence and picked out Fàbregas.\n\nWhat followed was just as impressive, as the Spaniard, without breaking his stride, swept a glorious first-time left-footed shot that nestled in the top corner.\n\nPedestrian in possession and hamstrung by a lack of width further forward, Swansea never really troubled Chelsea until that tactical shift and a couple of substitutions led to them attacking with more urgency and conviction. André Ayew and Tom Carroll both shot narrowly wide during that period, but it still seemed a case of too little too late for a team that has a tense couple of weeks ahead."}, {"date": "23/04/2018",

Walcott’s sharp finish shielded the Everton manager from further hostility. Those wishing to register distrust in the former England manager’s style must make do with a club survey for now.\n\nWalcott’s third Everton goal since arriving from Arsenal in January lifted an otherwise grim affair and Everton to eighth in the Premier League as Newcastle’s winning streak came to a subdued end. Rafael Benítez and his players have defied expectations to haul themselves clear of relegation danger but a lack of quality in attack was glaring.\n\nNewcastle finished on top, preying on Everton’s anxieties, having a handball claim against Phil Jagielka dismissed and almost equalising in the final seconds only for Seamus Coleman to intercept Jacob Murphy’s cross towards Dwight Gayle with a superb header.\n\nRobot helps disabled young fan enjoy Everton mascot experience from home Read more\n\nBenítez claimed Bobby Madley was too lenient with Everton’s physical approach but accepted that, in Walcott and Wayne Rooney, lavish spending at Goodison has at least bought the experience to make a difference in matches as mundane as this. “It might have been different if we had done better with the final pass in the final third,” the Newcastle manager said. “In this kind of game when they are very physical and the referee allows them to do these things, and they are at home and have quality, that is an advantage.”\n\nUnsurprisingly, Allardyce took an opposing view, suggesting Everton had been “excellent” for 75 minutes and lost their way only when Morgan Schneiderlin departed injured. Schneiderlin did impress, earning a rousing ovation from fans who had booed him on to the pitch a few months ago, but there was nothing excellent about this display beyond Walcott’s winner.\n\nAllardyce had called for clarity over his long-term position before a game attended by Everton’s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri. A glance to his left before the kick-off will have given the Everton manager a reminder of the clarification many supporters are hoping for. “Our survey says … Get out of our club” read a banner draped over the upper Gwladys Street stand. Anti-Allardyce sentiment had been reserved for Everton’s away matches, unsurprisingly given the contrast in results on the road and at Goodison, but the recent PR fiasco of asking fans to rate an unpopular manager on a scale of zero to 10 presented an opportunity that was not missed at home. A solid but unspectacular performance did little to appease the restless natives.\n\n“The controversy was caused by an error from one of our employees who recognises it wasn’t the right thing to do,” said Allardyce on what was a wide-ranging survey. “As a manager you have to deal with it and move on. The players did the talking tonight by winning and moving us up to eighth. Let’s hope we finish the season as strong as we can.”\n\nNewcastle arrived free of relegation concern after four successive wins and with Jonjo Shelvey seeking to press his claims for a World Cup call from the England manager Gareth Southgate. He was unable to do so as Schneiderlin and Idrissa Gueye controlled the midfield contest while a lack of composure with the final ball cost Newcastle several promising openings.\n\nThe visitors should have punished a miscued clearance from Jordan Pickford that invited Ayoze Pérez the freedom to play the fit-again Islam Slimani through on goal. Pérez badly overhit his pass, however, and the Everton goalkeeper was spared. Pickford was jeered throughout by the Newcastle support who have not forgotten nor forgiven the former Sunderland keeper for tweeting “Get the rave on” when his rivals were relegated in 2016. He responded with a “shush” gesture in the final seconds.\n\nWalcott made an encouraging start to his Everton career but had gone nine games without a goal, and several anonymous performances, when he enlivened the match with a smartly taken breakthrough. Yannick Bolasie was the provider, driving down the right and using Coleman’s overlapping run to create space for a dangerous cross to the back post. The ball rebounded into Walcott’s path via the unwitting DeAndre Yedlin and the winger took an assured touch before driving high into Martin Dubravka’s goal.\n\nBenítez, in his 100th game in charge of Newcastle, reacted by replacing Slimani with Gayle and the substitute should have equalised with his first touch. Shelvey’s corner was flicked on by Jamaal Lascelles to the striker, who had space inside the six-yard area, but his first-time shot sailed over Pickford’s crossbar.\n\nPérez and Matt Ritchie also had opportunities before the crucial diving header from Coleman in stoppage time, with Gayle poised to convert, secured an important win for Allardyce."}, {"date": "22/04/2018", "arena": "Emirates

Arsenal supporters might even be impertinent enough to subject the tall, grey-haired man on the touchline – hands on hips, elbows out, wearing a worried look that has been seen here too often in recent years – to a smattering of boos at the final whistle. The score was 1-1, West Ham looked relatively comfortable and Arsenal were heading towards a result that would have confirmed another finish outside the Premier League’s top four and meant a second successive season behind Tottenham Hotspur for the first time since 1983.\n\nUnfortunately for Arsène Wenger, the late flurry of goals only delays the inevitable bearing in mind his team are still 11 points adrift from the leading pack and, staggeringly, 33 behind Manchester City. Yet the three-goal blitz did at least ensure a happy ending in the first game since Wenger announced he would be cutting his ties with Arsenal at the end of the season. The sun was shining and the Emirates, once again, felt like a happy place. He will miss these moments.\n\nIn the process, Arsenal warmed up nicely for the first leg of their Europa League semi-final against Atlético Madrid on Thursday, the only downside being the injury to Mohamed Elneny that led to the Egyptian being taken off on a stretcher and could threaten his World Cup participation.\n\nAdieu, Arsène Wenger – artistry in hobnail boots | Alex Clark Read more\n\nAlexandre Lacazette scored twice in the late drama but the key moment came in the 82nd minute when Aaron Ramsey crossed from the left and Declan Rice and Joe Hart left it to one another. The ball went between them both and bounced into Hart’s net for Arsenal’s second goal before Lacazette’s quick double, in the 85th and 89th minutes, lifted the volume by a few more notches.\n\nIt was the 1,000th top-flight defeat in West Ham’s history and Arsenal’s supporters willingly designated Hart as the scapegoat, reserving ironic cheers for the moments when he touched the ball without making a mistake. That, however, was not exactly fair and the blame should be apportioned Rice’s way for committing the centre-half’s sin of ducking when Ramsey’s cross came his way.\n\nHart had expected him to clear it. The communication was poor, to say the least, and it was noticeable that Moyes criticised the 19-year-old Rice more vehemently than he had done Hart after the goalkeeper’s mistake against Stoke City last Monday. Hart, to give him his due, had made a couple of outstanding saves, particularly at 1-1 when Danny Welbeck’s curling shot was heading into the far corner.\n\nWest Ham were obliging opponents in the final exchanges and Lacazette duly took advantage with two penalty-box finishes. Yet it was a strange afternoon overall and, despite everything, not the Wenger love-in that might have been anticipated. Wenger took his seat to mild applause and, briefly, some of the fans behind the dugout serenaded him. Then the game kicked off and it was not until just before the hour mark, once Nacho Monreal had given Arsenal the lead, that we heard the manager’s name being sung with any volume. The atmosphere at other times, just like the man’s cardigan, was grey and low-key. The television cameras found one child with a homemade banner to thank Wenger for the last 22 years. But only one.\n\nThis is the one decision nobody is saying Arsène Wenger has got wrong | Daniel Taylor Read more\n\nPerhaps those of us who expected it to be different – emotional, even – had underestimated the apathy that has engulfed the Emirates this season. The banners that are permanently in place here pay tribute to “Old Trafford 02”, the Invincibles season – “P38 W26 D12 L0” – and many of the other highlights from the Wenger years. Yet it was a mistake, plainly, to think the news of his abdication might tempt back some of the thousands who have stayed away. Again, there were large expanses of empty seats. “Merci Arsène” read the front cover of the programme. That apart, however, there was nothing to distinguish this from any other Arsenal match bar the extra numbers in the press seats. It was standing room only while outside a swarm of television crews were conducting vox pops on the roundabout between the stadium and the Little Wonder Cafe.\n\nWest Ham began encouragingly and could reflect on reasonable first-half chances for Marko Arnautovic and João Mário as well as a corner when Cheikhou Kouyaté’s looping header landed on the top of the crossbar. After that, however, David Moyes’s team lost their early momentum. Arsenal finished the first half strongly and when Monreal volleyed in Granit Xhaka’s corner six minutes after the interval there was a 10-minute spell when the home side were so much in command it came as a jolt when West Ham, on the counterattack, levelled through Arnautovic’s splendidly taken left-foot shot.\n\nAfterwards, it was quite something when Wenger removed some of the barriers that might normally have existed and questioned whether Arsenal’s supporters had gone against the club’s values – in his view, potentially damaging the club’s reputation worldwide – because of all the rancour and divisions that have existed in recent years.\n\nHere, though, the mood was light and Lacazette’s double added some extra sheen under the blue skies. Wenger’s gamble not to include Mesut Özil and Petr Cech, with Thursday’s assignment uppermost in the manager’s thoughts, had worked out and, strange as it still feels, his next Premier League game at this stadium will also be the last."}, {"date": "22/04/2018", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 29532, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [],

Lambert had made no bones about it: Stoke needed to take three points from this match to retain hope of paying their arrears before the arrival of the relegation bailiff. They failed, so Lambert revised his view: his team can still avoid eviction from the Premier League provided they win all three of their remaining matches. He knows how unlikely that it is given that Stoke have won only one in 12 since his appointment in January.\n\n“We have to go to Anfield [on Saturday] and get a result, then we have to get results against Crystal Palace and Swansea,” he said. “We need wins.”\n\nThey seemed on course to get one here thanks to Badou Ndiaye’s fine goal in the 11th minute. But Mame Birame Diouf fluffed a wonderful chance to add to that before Ashley Barnes cancelled it out. It was Barnes’s ninth league goal of the season, three more than any of Stoke’s strikers. The lack of a reliable goalscorer is one of the reasons why Stoke are heading for the Championship while Burnley look to be on their way to Europe.\n\nLambert may not have overseen a victory since the win over Huddersfield on his first day in the job but he has at least inspired a fighting spirit. Here the Potters went straight for the Clarets’ jugular. The Scot deployed two strikers, giving Peter Crouch a rare start alongside Diouf. With Sean Dyche’s men aligned in their usual formation, the clash had an old school character, both sides set up in 4-4-2s and unashamed to play a direct style. With each set of supporters singing “England’s No 1” in tribute to their respective goalkeepers, there were plenty of similarities between the sides and it is a tribute to Dyche, and damning on Stoke, that the sides are separated by 12 places and 24 points.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette’s late double seals Arsenal rout against West Ham Read more\n\nThe early skirmishing was scrappy but Ndiaye’s goal came at the end of a nice move. Joe Allen released Xherdan Shaqiri down the left and the Swiss crossed for Ndiaye, who headed to Diouf, who laid the ball back to his compatriot. In one movement Ndiaye switched the ball from his left foot to his right, sidestepping Jack Cork, and then swept a shot into the bottom corner from 20 yards. It was the Senegalese midfielder’s first goal since joining for £14m from Galatasary in January and the roar it inspired around the ground attested to the hope it spawned.\n\nMoments before half-time the crowd leapt to their feet in anticipation of a goal that would have made Stoke’s lead more comfortable. Moritz Bauer produced a perfect cross for Diouf, who was free seven yards out. But the striker stalled in two minds – to shoot first time or take a touch? – and let the ball squirt under his foot. Diouf howled at the sky while home fans turned the air blue. The miss proved to be as costly as they feared. “It was huge,” Lambert said later. “But I’ll never criticise a player who gives me everything and Mame does that.”\n\nJack Butland prevented Burnley from inflicting more torment early in the second half, batting away a header from James Tarkowski after a corner. That was just agony postponed. In the 62nd minute Tarkowski, unmarked at the back post, got his head to a cross by Ashley Westwood and although the goalkeeper made an even better save than the previous one, Barnes nudged the rebound into the net from close range.\n\nStoke blustered forward in search of the win. Lambert introduced Tyrese Campbell, an 18-year-old who has been scoring prolifically for Stoke’s under-23 team. Perhaps the teenager could show the predatory skills that none of his senior colleagues have been able to muster regularly this season? He had one shot and got it on target.

They witnessed a masterclass from their freshly crowned champions on a jubilant afternoon.\n\nIt was decorated by a 20-yard peach from Kevin De Bruyne that rocketed past Lukasz Fabianski after 54 minutes on a right-left diagonal that was as pure a connection as possible. This had Pep Guardiola blowing his cheeks in admiration and the Etihad Stadium offering a collective “ooh”.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette’s late double seals Arsenal rout against West Ham Read more\n\nThis 29th victory takes Guardiola’s team to 90 points, six from breaking Chelsea’s record Premier League total of 95. If the maximum remaining are taken, City will finish on 102. They also have 98 goals, six short of breaking the highest tally of 103, again by Chelsea.\n\nAt the close City supporters invaded the pitch and at least one flare was fired. Each of these could draw a Football Association charge but Guardiola, understandably, was not concerned.\n\n“No problem,” he said. “Football is an emotional game. I understand you have to be careful – but when they feel they want to share that they are happy – it is better they stay where they should stay – I’m not going to tell them don’t do that.”\n\nOf his team, whose 1,015 attempted passes was the most since 2003-04, breaking records, Guardiola said: “Looking for them helps to keep the players focused.”\n\nFor his stated mission of ending the season with five victories Guardiola made two changes. Kyle Walker and Leroy Sané became substitutes – alongside Benjamin Mendy after seven months out with a knee injury – as Danilo and Bernardo Silva took their places in a still formidable XI.\n\nCarlos Carvalhal made one alteration – Luciano Narsingh being replaced by Mike van der Hoorn, as the manager continued Swansea City’s survival bid. His team formed a pre-game guard of honour before a newly unveiled banner that read: “Welcome to the home of the Premier League champions”.\n\nGuardiola’s men began and ended as they nearly always do at home: in control. Fabianski’s first action was to catch a long De Bruyne cross-shot from the right that was heading in.\n\nNext Ilkay Gündogan played an inadvertent one-two with the referee, Craig Pawson, that allowed the German to find David Silva. He relayed the ball to his namesake Bernardo and a devilish delivery was scrambled out for a corner by Martin Olsson.\n\nDe Bruyne took this but it was unproductive. The Belgian’s next contribution was the opposite. This time, from along the left, he found Raheem Sterling who turned the ball off his left foot inside to David Silva. It ricocheted off Van der Hoorn and the Spaniard collected a 10th of the campaign.\n\nAfter the quarter-hour the lead was doubled. Once more David Silva was involved. He returned a pass to Fabian Delph and, when the ball was swept in, Raheem Sterling had a tap-in for his 23rd goal of the season.\n\nThis signalled contest over with more than three-quarters still to play. Already the game was akin to a training ground affair with the home side yo-yoing the ball around. De Bruyne – City’s player of the season – warmed Fabianski’s fingers with a left-foot zinger. Gabriel Jesus hit a low shot that again kept the goalkeeper honest. At the close of the half Alfie Mawson wandered forward and took aim at Ederson. The Brazilian collected but this was as good as the visitors were before the break.\n\nThe second half began with a lightning foray that included a David Silva step-over and ended with Danilo’s cross flashing before Fabianksi.\n\nAfter De Bruyne’s glorious finish City continued to dominate. Sterling won a penalty, Jesus’s effort from the spot was steered on to the post via a Fabianski palm, and Bernardo Silva slotted in the rebound.\n\nIt might have been more but Alfie Mawson’s back-header rebounded to safety off the left post. There was even time for a 15-minute cameo from Mendy and for City to secure a fifth as Yaya Touré’s lob was headed home by Jesus: it was that kind of day for City.\n\nCarvalhal’s side are four points above the drop zone with four matches left. Asked how the defeat would affect confidence, the manager said: “Zero, absolutely. They are a team from another planet.”"}, {"date": "21/04/2018", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24520, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster",

as he described West Bromwich Albion’s comeback as useless in the context of their survival hopes and railed against the dry state of the pitch.\n\nKlopp’s complaints about Stuart Attwell’s poor refereeing were far more legitimate given that Liverpool were denied a clear penalty at the start of the second half and should have been playing against 10 men after Ahmed Hegazi punched Danny Ings in the stomach, yet it was his remarks about Albion’s predicament and the playing surface that caused a stir.\n\nIn fairness to Klopp, he was honest enough to admit he would have said nothing about the pitch if Liverpool had won a game that was firmly within their grasp when Mohamed Salah registered his 31st league goal of the season – equalling the record for a 38-game season held by Alan Shearer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suárez – to double their lead 18 minutes from time.\n\nSign up for The Fiver, our daily football email.\n\nAlbion, however, have been a totally different proposition since Darren Moore took over from Alan Pardew and they showed tremendous spirit to score from two set pieces in the last 12 minutes, through Jake Livermore and Salomón Rondón, to salvage a point and leave Klopp, whose team face Roma in the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday, bitterly upset.\n\nAfter claiming the pitch became “drier and drier, and it is not in favour or an advantage for the football-playing side”, Klopp lamented Attwell’s failure to point to the penalty spot after Ings was barged over by Craig Dawson and the way that Hegazi escaped punishment for his punch on the striker.\n\n“You see it, I see it, but that’s not important,” Klopp said. “It is only important what three or four gentleman with a whistle say. So we cannot change it. I think if you are the better team, you should win. We are the better team, we didn’t win.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jürgen Klopp shows his displeasure at some of the decisions at the final whistle, and his anger continued in the post-match interviews. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\n“I don’t feel that point will help West Brom massively. It feels like a complete waste of points; they don’t need it. We would have needed it. They are all happy now, we are not happy. We stay in the league, they don’t stay in the league. It’s kind of a strange situation.\n\n“I am a big football fan. You have to do everything to create the best circumstances for all the boys to deliver. You let the home team decide if they water the pitch or not. It’s not only football, it’s also dangerous for injuries if the pitch is really dry. To be 100%, I would have said nothing about that probably if we had won. But it’s all what you see during the game.”\n\nAlbion may well be heading for the Championship – they are eight points adrift of safety with three matches remaining – yet their supporters’ reaction at the final whistle suggested that they viewed the fifth point gained from three games under Moore as anything but futile.\n\nWest Brom 2-2 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe home team were behind as early as the fourth minute, when Ings, whose introduction was one of five changes that Klopp made to his team, swept home from close range after Georginio Wijnaldum teed him up from Sadio Mané’s cross. It was Ings’s first goal since October 2015.\n\nLiverpool’s second was another of those trademark finishes from Salah, who coolly lifted the ball over Ben Foster after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had set him free.\n\nAlbion, though, were far from finished. Livermore hooked home from six yards and then Liverpool pressed the self-destruct button. Joe Gomez carelessly gave away possession in the lead-up to the free-kick that Chris Brunt expertly delivered for Rondón to head in at the near post.\n\nAsked about the condition of the pitch, Moore said: “It wasn’t a ploy.

The last time he was here, in December 2016, the Crystal Palace forward reacted angrily when he was accused of diving by the Watford mascot, Harry the Hornet, after winning a penalty for his side.\n\nNearly 18 months on, Zaha once more found himself embroiled in controversy after three incidents that – depending on your opinion – could have ended with him being shown a red card or awarded two penalties.\n\nIn the end, the hard-earned point that pushes his side a step closer to safety will provide some solace for the Ivory Coast international on a day when he ran the opposition defence ragged at times.\n\nWatford’s traditional poor springtime form meant they had gone five matches without a victory, conceding 15 goals in the process, so the decision to pair the Italy international Stefano Okaka in attack with Troy Deeney was a brave one with the former chairman Elton John, watching on from the stands. Yet it almost paid off as early as the fourth minute when Deeney found space on the right and his cross was headed against the crossbar by Okaka.\n\nJürgen Klopp bemoans ‘dangerous’ pitch after West Brom stun Liverpool Read more\n\nPrompted by the dominance of the excellent Abdoulaye Doucouré in midfield, the strike duo continued to cause Palace’s defence problems throughout the first half, with Joel Ward lucky to escape as Deeney’s cross-shot cannoned off him and into the arms of Wayne Hennessey.\n\nIn contrast, Palace struggled to create any forward momentum as the makeshift strikers, Zaha and Andros Townsend, found space limited with their backs to goal. A header by James Tomkins from Townsend’s free-kick that was easy saved by Orestis Karnezis was the best they could muster.\n\nThe half’s moment of controversy was saved for just before the break when Zaha went down in the box under a clumsy challenge from Christian Kabasele.\n\nDoucouré immediately rushed over to confront him and was lucky to escape a second booking for pushing the Palace forward in the chest having only just been cautioned for a tackle on Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Chris Kavanagh waved away Zaha’s appeals for a penalty but, significantly as it turned out, did not produce a card.\n\nWatford’s supporters were incensed and their mood did not improve after the break when Zaha escaped a caution for his late challenge on Karnezis.\n\nPalace’s talisman was back in the thick of the action when he was felled by Adrian Mariappa on the edge of the box and Luka Milivojevic’s free-kick struck the bar.\n\nMoments later the referee showed Zaha the yellow card after ruling he had dived under pressure from Mariappa and Will Hughes during a goalmouth scramble, delighting the home fans if not Roy Hodgson.\n\n“I try hard not to be the person who bellyaches but having seen it again, it was a pretty clear penalty decision,” he said. “Reputation is a dangerous thing. Who gives them the reputation? Where he has suffered is that other managers have given you their version of the story and branded him someone who dives for penalties.

It will console Álvaro Morata to know the Chelsea manager thought he embodied them all. Morata misses were the only blot on an otherwise encouraging night for Conte’s team at Burnley as they preserved faint hopes of Champions League qualification.\n\nChelsea’s £58m record signing cut a furious figure when substituted shortly after squandering a glorious opportunity to seal the 65th win of Conte’s 100-game reign. The Spain international exchanged words with a mocking Burnley crowd behind the dug-out and threw away his boots in disgust before receiving a consoling pat from Cesc Fàbregas. Victor Moses’ 70th minute winner ensured Morata’s miss did not matter and, while it may hinder his chances of starting Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Southampton, the striker’s overall contribution alongside Olivier Giroud was ample consolation to Conte.\n\n“I think Álvaro must be angry because when you have a chance to score, especially for a striker, it can change your confidence,” the Chelsea manager said. “I think he was angry with himself for the chance he missed but I saw a very good performance. I am happy I tried two strikers. They played very well. To see Giroud and Morata play this way “there was a good combination and a desire to press. This could be an option for Sunday and maybe the future. It can be a good option when players show you this desire and sacrifice themselves without the ball for the team.”\n\nThe FA Cup may have assumed greater importance than Conte dared imagine back in August but he and his players are not giving up on a top-four finish lightly. They are five points adrift of fourth-placed Tottenham with four matches to play but their superiority over a Burnley side that had not lost at Turf Moor since 20 January, and had the opportunity to leapfrog Arsenal in sixth following five consecutive league wins, should restore belief beyond Wembley. Conte made six changes to the side that defeated Southampton in the league last weekend. He changed Chelsea’s formation too, opting for Giroud and Morata at the head of a 3-5-2 with Pedro in central midfield, but there was no evidence of disruption as the visitors gave a commanding display.\n\nConte said: “It won’t be easy because it is five points to Tottenham but the only thing we can do is try to get three points in every game from now until the end.”\n\nGiroud and Morata established an immediate rapport, combining instinctively and giving the Burnley defence no respite in possession all night. The former Arsenal striker released his partner with a neat flick over James Tarkowski. Morata’s run took him wide but his low shot was goal-bound only to strike goalkeeper Nick Pope’s legs and deflect wide.\n\nThe England World Cup hopeful was not so fortunate from Chelsea’s next attack. Moses was the instigator with a driving run that caught Stephen Ward unawares, although credit is due to Gary Cahill for the perfectly-timed delivery that dropped at the feet of the right wing-back. Moses pulled his cross back from the byline towards Giroud. Pope’s fingertips got there first, but only succeeded in steering the ball against the arm and thigh of Long before it dropped slowly, agonisingly, over the line.\n\nOlivier Giroud seals Chelsea’s comeback win to stun struggling Southampton Read more\n\nBurnley responded strongly with Ashley Barnes a constant menace but it was Chelsea who came closest to extending their lead before the interval. Giroud sent Morata through on goal for a second time only for Pope to deny the former Real Madrid and Juventus striker his 15th goal of the season.\n\nConte had no complaints with Morata’s work rate or the pace that frequently stretched Burnley. His finishing was a different matter, however, and there was no clearer illustration of his lack of composure when sent clear for a third time. Kanté was the provider, intercepting Matthew Lowton’s attempted pass and releasing Morata from inside the Chelsea half. The striker galloped through and his options appeared to improve when Pope stayed on his six-yard line. Morata lined up his shot but, to widespread disbelief among the away fans, failed to hit the target. It would be his last contribution before being replaced by Eden Hazard, who brought a calm assurance to the closing stages.\n\nMorata’s miss assumed greater significance when Burnley levelled courtesy of a wild deflection off Barnes’ heel. Johann Berg Gudmundsson tried his luck from distance and it paid dividends when his shot struck his team-mate and sailed into the far corner with Courtois stranded. Chelsea players converged on the referee to protest that Barnes was offside. He was level with Cahill when the ball was struck and Burnley were back in the game. But not for long.\n\nEmerson produced an impressive display on the left for Chelsea and it was his searching cross that produced the winner for Moses. Giroud was unable to connect with another of his scorpion kicks and the delivery dropped invitingly for the unmarked wing-back at the back post.

Mark Hughes took some encouragement from the fact he has collected his first point as Southampton manager and ended the club’s run of four successive league defeats, yet this is a time of the season when he needs victories rather than draws to improve Saints’ survival prospects.\n\nAgainst a Leicester side who have badly lost their way, Southampton played with a curious lack of ambition and urgency, summed up by Hughes’s decision to replace one striker with another at a point in the game when the travelling supporters were entitled to think he would throw caution to the wind and chase the win that would have cranked up the pressure on Swansea, in 17th place. Strangely, however, Southampton looked like they were content to settle for the draw that leaves them four points adrift of safety with four matches remaining.\n\nLeicester, with nothing to play for, were obliging opponents and the chorus of boos at the final whistle said everything about how this listless performance was viewed by their increasingly disillusioned supporters. Claude Puel, who was sacked as the Southampton manager at the end of last season, has now won only four of his last 17 league matches and there were times here when it was hard to work out what his players were trying to do.\n\nAndy Carroll surrounded by toddlers – Football Weekly Extra Read more\n\nAll of which added to the feeling Southampton, who play Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday, missed a chance. Asked whether it was a point gained or two dropped, Hughes replied: “We don’t know yet. We’ll have to wait until the end of the season to see if that’s a significant point one way or the other. I think given the fact we haven’t been able to pick up points of any note in recent weeks, it’s a positive. Performance-wise, I don’t think we got anywhere near the level that we showed against Arsenal and Chelsea, but we didn’t get any points out of those games.”\n\nHughes admitted there was “a little bit of apprehension” in Southampton’s play, yet his tactics and substitutions arguably contributed to that situation. There seemed to be no real desire for Southampton to attack with more intent, even in the closing stages, with the decision to replace Shane Long with Charlie Austin a case in point.\n\n‚ÄúIt’s like for like because Shane Long had a huge effort against Chelsea, he was clearly flagging when we took him off,” Hughes said. “It was a little bit of a stick or twist situation, to be perfectly honest. The importance of taking something out of the game shouldn’t be underestimated. But clearly we’re going to get to a point with the games that we havewhere we’re just going to have to throw everything at it. Maybe tonight wasn’t the case for that.”\n\nSouthampton did have a couple of good chances either side of the interval and both fell to Long. The Republic of Ireland international squandered the first after he was caught in two minds as to whether to shoot or pass and ended up doing neither. His next opportunity ended with Ben Hamer, the Leicester goalkeeper, dashing from his line to make an instinctive save as Long turned sharply to spear a close-range attempt at goal.\n\nPedestrian in possession and devoid of ideas going forward, Leicester were plodding their way through the match. Kelechi Iheanacho placed an early chance wide but Leicester had to wait until the 69th minute, when Jamie Vardy’s first-time volley from Marc Albrighton’s pass was tipped over the bar by Alex McCarthy, for their next decent attempt.

That is what they achieved thanks to goals by Chris Smalling and Romelu Lukaku. The result tightens their hold on second place in the Premier League and raises spirits, at least a little, before they resume their pursuit of the only trophy they can win this season.\n\nJosé Mourinho, for one, was encouraged by the improvement he saw from his side, hailing a “good collective performance, with good responsibility and a great attitude”. But he regretted that his players have not always shown those qualities this season. “I spoke with them about that [after the defeat by West Brom],” Mourinho said. “We are inconsistent many times in our attitude. With our top five opponents, we didn’t lose any points. We lost and won against City, Spurs and Chelsea and won and drew against Liverpool. But we lost against Huddersfield and Newcastle. And we lost points against teams that are probably going to get relegated. So I think we were not consistent. And you pay the price.”\n\nIt is harder to manage Chelsea than Burnley, claims Antonio Conte Read more\n\nAfter offering another reminder of his personal roll of honour – “eight titles in four different countries, including three in this country” – he said: “I know why you win and why you don’t win. No doubt about City’s quality and that in any circumstances they would win this title this season but we could have perfectly, I would say, 10 more points this season.”\n\nMourinho made seven changes to the lineup who were embarrassed by West Brom but perhaps the most intrigue concerned a change the manager did not make: did the inclusion of Paul Pogba, who had been withdrawn before the hour on Sunday, indicate Mourinho wanted to see a performance that would convince him the club’s record signing deserves to start against Spurs?\n\nIf so, Mourinho got the display he wanted. Pogba did not cast spells but did play very well. He affected the game positively almost every time he got the ball, which was not often enough for him to be described as having dictated play. Mourinho acclaimed a “top performance” from the Frenchman, who crowned his display by teeing up Lukaku for the goal in the 70th minute that made sure of United’s victory.\n\nSmalling had given United the lead in a low-key first half by converting from close-range after a sharp move. Ander Herrera, the most influential of United’s trio in midfield, was instrumental, playing a neat pass to Jesse Lingard, whose crisp low cross left Smalling with a straightforward finish.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chris Smalling converts Jesse Lingard’s low cross to put Manchester United ahead at Bournemouth. Photograph: Mark Enfield/Mercury Press/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe goal came one minute after Marcus Rashford injected spark into a humdrum game by winning possession off Nathan Aké before firing off a shot that forced a diving save from Asmir Begovic.\n\nRashford was deployed centrally because Lukaku was on the bench. The 20-year-old looked dangerous, combining well with Lingard and Anthony Martial. All three, without quite catching fire, made reasonable claims for starting at Wembley ahead of Alexis Sánchez.\n\nOther players were given opportunities to stake claims, too – or perhaps just to add another word to their long goodbyes from United. Luke Shaw did fine at left-back on his first appearance since being hauled off at half-time against Brighton last month. The right-back Matteo Darmian did not disappoint on his first league start since October. Marouane Fellaini, who is expected to leave Old Trafford on the expiry of his contract in the summer, completed the midfield trio adequately on his sixth start of the campaign.\n\nUnited bossed most of the match against hosts minded to make their visit uncomfortable. Josh King did ruffle United just before the break, however, drawing a save from David de Gea with a shot from 20 yards.\n\nEuropean roundup: Napoli win cuts Juve’s Serie A lead to four points Read more\n\nThe visitors started the second period as if ordered to wrap up the win as quickly as possible. Bournemouth resolved to try to fend them off and hope to equalise on the break. They came close to doing so in the 56th minute but Callum Wilson was unable to connect with King’s ball across the six-yard box – the striker claimed that was because Shaw had pulled him back but the referee disagreed. Soon afterwards Smalling was booked for dragging down Wilson near halfway. One minute later Steve Cook received a similar punishment for a far more brutal tackle on Pogba. As tempers and the tempo rose a touch, the game became more open.

On Tuesday night at the Amex Stadium they took a small step towards retaining their Premier League status for another season.\n\nThe fiendish nature of their run-in has been well-documented and Chris Hughton’s team must still face the Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Burnley in their final matches. They needed something, anything, to allow them to breathe a little easily after a worrying run of one point from an available 15. This was it.\n\nBrighton 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe horror of Saturday’s 3-2 defeat at Crystal Palace was forgotten as Brighton put their bodies on the line to earn precious reward. The roar from the home crowd at the full-time whistle told its own story. Brighton are eight points clear of third-from-bottom Southampton, although they have played a game more.\n\nTottenham have a bigger match round the corner in the shape of Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United and Mauricio Pochettino appeared to have one eye on it with his team selection. He made six changes from Saturday’s home defeat by Manchester City and omitted Davinson Sánchez and Dele Alli from the squad entirely. He gave Toby Alderweireld his first Premier League action since 28 October and the centre-half was not overly extended.\n\nHowever, Pochettino made the point yet again that the league was the priority. The personnel changes, he said, were purely down to fatigue from the City game. “If we win the FA Cup, we are not going to play Champions League,” Pochettino said. “You only do that if you finish in the top four. Today was the most important game.”\n\nFor Tottenham it felt like points dropped. Pochettino was entitled to say that his team had “dominated” the game in terms of possession and territory but he was also on the money when he lamented a “lack of aggression” in the final third. They were unable to create sufficient clear-cut chances.\n\nHarry Kane put Spurs in front with his 26th goal of the Premier League season – his Golden Boot rival, Mohamed Salah of Liverpool, has 30 – but Brighton showed their strength of character with an instant riposte through Pascal Gross’s penalty. Hughton had given him the responsibility after a couple of penalty misses this season by Glenn Murray.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pascal Gross beats Hugo Lloris from the spot after replacing Glenn Murray as Brighton’s penalty taker. Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur FC/(Credit too long, see caption)\n\nTottenham’s lead over fifth-placed Chelsea could be cut to five points with four matches to play when their London rivals go to Burnley on Thursday. But theirs remains a position of strength. Three of their final four matches are at Wembley – against Watford, Newcastle and Leicester – and the other one is a trip to West Brom.\n\nPochettino’s team sought to impose their pressing game and they sparked danger on a number of occasions when they forced errors from Brighton high up the pitch. Gross was guilty of the stray pass that set in motion the move for Kane’s goal at the beginning of the second half.\n\nHe put Gaëtan Bong in trouble, the left-back was tackled by Victor Wanyama and, when the ball broke, Son Heung-min tried to run round Lewis Dunk on the byline. Son did not look to have the room but he benefited from the spin of the ball, which remained on the right side of the line, and the alarm bells sounded when Kane swooped. He crashed home from close range.\n\nBrighton’s response was impressive. José Izquierdo got away from Serge Aurier inside the box following Murray’s touch and the Tottenham right-back’s attempt to rectify the situation was clumsy. Izquierdo felt the contact and went down. Gross’s penalty was too powerful for Hugo Lloris.\n\nThe first half had been end-to-end without too many thrills in front of goal. Son, who menaced Bruno, the Brighton right-back and captain, had the clearest chance in the third minute of stoppage-time. Taking a flick from Kane, he eked out a yard of space before shooting for the bottom corner. Mathew Ryan thrust out a hand to save smartly.\n\nWolves’ link with agent Jorge Mendes to face Premier League scrutiny Read more\n\nSet pieces had seemed the likeliest route to the breakthrough. The tension inside the ground was palpable when Christian Eriksen and Kane stood over free-kicks on the edge of the Brighton area on 11 and 44 minutes respectively, but neither could convert. The awards had followed loose passes from Beram Kayal and Anthony Knockaert.\n\nAt the other end Dunk rose to direct a towering header at goal from Gross’s 19th minute corner and Anthony Knockaert almost applied the decisive touch in front of Lloris. Knockaert was a willing and pacy outlet and he worked Lloris with a deflected shot while Murray could not muster sufficient power in his flick after slick work from Gross. Ryan also had to be alert to tip over a long ranger from Lucas Moura.\n\nTottenham pushed for the winner in the second half, with Pochettino introducing Mousa Dembélé and Erik Lamela, but Brighton’s resolve was fierce. Their support endured a few flutters, not least when Eriksen fizzed in a cross-cum-shot and Shane Duffy diverted the ball inches past the far post, while Lamela was denied by Ryan.

This was another personal ordeal for the man who has just lost his place as England’s first-choice goalkeeper. Southgate was here to witness it and, at this rate, there has to be a serious possibility that Hart will be cut adrift from the England squad that goes to Russia for this summer’s World Cup.\n\nWhat other conclusion can be drawn when the goalkeeping error that led to Peter Crouch, one of Stoke’s substitutes, opening the scoring can hardly be described as a one-off? Indeed, Hart did something very similar in the 3-0 defeat at home to Burnley last month, on the day he was recalled to the side after a long spell in the wilderness. It is becoming a recurring theme and West Ham’s fans were not in the mood to be sympathetic after his latest lapse. There were ironic, unforgiving cheers towards the end whenever Hart gathered the ball without making a mistake.\n\nWest Ham United v Stoke City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nAt least Hart was spared the ignominy of his mistake being the game’s decisive moment and West Ham’s equaliser, courtesy of the fit-again Andy Carroll, helped David Moyes’s team edge another point further away from the relegation places. Stoke, on the other hand, remain in 19th position, having passed up a glorious opportunity to register their first away win since October. Paul Lambert’s side now have only four games to save themselves and still have to play Liverpool after they have hosted Europa League-chasing Burnley on Sunday.\n\nLambert looked crestfallen afterwards but Stoke’s manager was stretching the truth when he said all the luck had gone against his team. On the contrary, there were three disallowed goals for West Ham in a chaotic second half for the referee, Michael Oliver, in his first game back since the now-infamous Champions League tie between Juventus and Real Madrid, Gianluigi Buffon’s red card and all the unpleasantness that has followed.\n\nMarko Arnautovic had strayed offside before directing in his 55th-minute header and the same player was flagged again when Edimilson Fernandes fired in a shot from 20 yards. This time, Arnautovic was standing directly in Jack Butland’s line of vision and, though Moyes seemed aggrieved at the time, he accepted afterwards it was a fine piece of officiating. West Ham’s manager was less impressed with the decision, in stoppage-time, to penalise Carroll for his challenge on Ryan Shawcross just before another substitute, Javier Hernández, fired in what would almost certainly have been a winner.\n\nIt was a dramatic finale to a game that had taken a long time to ignite and, for Carroll, a personal triumph given that he had not played since 4 January and, at one point, was not expected to feature again this season. His goal was expertly taken: he guided in a controlled left-foot volley from Aaron Cresswell’s cross and shifted the mood just as the West Ham fans were preparing, undoubtedly, for another show of loud dissent at the final whistle. Carroll returned to full training only five days before this match and there was an irony that it was two of England’s forgotten men who came up with the goals on the night Southgate was in the crowd to keep tabs on the two goalkeepers.\n\nSign up for The Fiver, our daily football email.\n\nMoyes made a point afterwards of not being too hard on Hart, restricting himself to saying it was a “surprise” to see the former England No 1 fumbling Xherdan Shaqiri’s shot into Crouch’s path. Moyes also made the point, legitimately, that Hart had made some fine saves in their previous game at Chelsea. Yet this felt like a manager trying not to damage Hart’s confidence any further. The truth, however it is dressed up, was that it was a wretched error from an increasingly accident-prone goalkeeper.\n\nFor Stoke, the disappointment was their inability to hold on once they had put themselves in a winning position. The game lived down to expectations during the opening 45 minutes – two ordinary sides huffing and puffing without any real wit or creativity – and it was easy to see why Stoke were averaging under a goal per game this season. Stoke have not managed two goals in a league fixture since January. They have the worst goal difference in the league and it is a problem that needs to be fixed if there is to be a dramatic feat of escapology in the next few weeks.\n\nLambert argued afterwards that if Stoke had played this well throughout the season Mark Hughes would still be their manager and the team would not be in the bottom three. There was a fair amount of top-spin on that assessment but in one respect it was an improvement – Stoke had lost their previous seven fixtures in London, conceding 26 goals in the process. Ultimately, though, it needed a goalkeeping mistake for them to take the lead and that, for Hart, made this a night that could have serious ramifications for his hopes of going to the World Cup."},

Then Aubameyang and friends limbered up with a friendly at nearby Northern League club Heaton Stannington, where he caused quite a stir by arriving in a pair of £2,500 Swarovski crystal-encrusted trainers.\n\nAyoze Pérez – who cost Newcastle a relatively modest £1.5m – is unlikely to ever command the £56m that Arsenal paid for Aubameyang but, almost imperceptibly, the young Spaniard has grown into what initially seemed an unnatural No 10 role in Benítez’s hallmark formation.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ayoze Pérez scores Newcastle’s equaliser, his third goal in three matches. Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters\n\nSo much so that Pérez has now scored three times in the last three games, with the latest pulling Newcastle right back into things on Sunday.\n\nIn some ways almost a carbon copy of Arsenal’s opener, the equaliser began with a fine 50-yard delivery from Shelvey. Once Dwight Gayle had brought the playmaker’s pass under seamless control and Mustafi – defensively disappointing throughout – negligently stood off, the striker fed DeAndre Yedlin. The right-back’s superb low cross was met by Pérez’s right foot and the ball arrowed beyond Petr Cech.\n\nMartin Dubravka’s arrival on loan from Sparta Prague in January has been a key factor behind Newcastle’s renaissance – significantly Lacazette’s goal was the first the Slovakia goalkeeper had conceded at St James’ Park – but bar a momentary brain freeze on Willock’s part he would surely have been beaten again just before half-time.\n\nWhen Mo Diamé slipped, Lacazette was gifted possession and the striker’s pass seemed to have cued the teenager up for a memorable goal but Willock got his feet in an awful tangle and a glorious chance evaporated.\n\nArsène Wenger says Arsenal defeat at Newcastle ‘a worry character wise’ Read more\n\nThe afternoon had turned into an intriguing tactical duel between Arsenal’s slick possession game (featuring the odd encouragingly mature cameo from Willock before his replacement by Danny Welbeck) and the counterattacking strategy that has enabled Benítez to overachieve greatly this season.\n\nIf the containment capabilities of the vastly improved Jamaal Lascelles and Paul Dummett should not be underestimated, Shelvey’s defence-splitting contributions alongside the quietly influential Diamé have frequently changed games. Against Arsenal Shelvey did much to suggest that Southgate is wrong to continue turning a blind eye to his England candidacy. After all, an unusually subdued Mohamed Elneny would surely not relish facing Shelvey and Diamé every week.\n\nAs Elneny and company’s legs grew heavier, Islam Slimani, on for Gayle, created Newcastle’s second goal with a header across the area. That delivery allowed Pérez to contribute a clever dummy and neat flick, leaving Matt Ritchie to lift an accomplished chip over Cech, with Nacho Monreal culpable.\n\nWith Slimani creating havoc, Kenedy subsequently hit the bar and the Blaydon Races was sung ever louder. Beneath a tepid April sun, one team was crumbling.

They find themselves 16 points behind Manchester City, the newly crowned Premier League champions. Their goal difference is 31 inferior to Pep Guardiola’s team and the final twist in the story of a one-sided title race counts as a humiliation for a club with their haughty ambitions.\n\nIt was a defeat at home by the Premier League’s wooden-spoon team, with the Old Trafford stands barely half-full and the players booed off by many of the people who had chosen not to leave early. Was this really the team who won 3-2 at City in one of the season’s great comebacks? It was only eight days earlier that Mourinho’s players could be seen throwing their shirts into a euphoric away end at the Etihad Stadium. Now they were wandering around like zombies, drenched in a Mancunian downpour, losing against the worst team in the league.\n\nMourinho called his players the “masters of complicated football” but that was being generous after one of the more startling displays of his two years in charge. West Brom have been submerged in the relegation quicksands since December. Their previous away win in the league came in August and there has been only one other occasion in the Premier League years, against Blackburn Rovers in 2011, when United have lost at home against the league’s bottom club.\n\nManchester City crowned Premier League champions after shock United defeat Read more\n\nEven when Jay Rodriguez headed in the decisive goal, in the 73rd minute, it was alarming to see the lack of fight from a team, lest it be forgotten, that have won this league 20 times. Sir Alex Ferguson used to boast there was no other side in the world who scored as many late goals as his – but not the current version. United drifted aimlessly towards the final whistle without ever looking as if they had the wit or gumption to save themselves. Thousands of people had gone before the end. “Manchester City, we’ve won you the league,” was the cry from the West Brom fans.\n\nOn this evidence perhaps West Brom ought to have put Darren Moore in charge earlier in the season. As it is, they can still be relegated next weekend and their victory will be remembered as an almost freakish result from an otherwise wretched season. Yet a result of this nature must enhance Moore’s chances of being given the job full-time and the only possible mitigation for United was that their opponents appeared to have dramatically improved since Alan Pardew’s departure.\n\nAll the same it was difficult to find any plausible excuse for a team that finished with Alexis Sánchez, Romelu Lukaku, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Juan Mata on the pitch but barely landed a glove on willing but limited opponents. Mourinho said he could “smell” a performance of this nature coming, complaining there had been a noticeable deterioration on the training ground since beating City. His players, in other words, have started choosing their games and, in the case of Paul Pogba in particular, it would have been no surprise if Mourinho picked up the stench of complacency.\n\nPlay Video 4:04 How Pep Guardiola's tactics made Manchester City Premier League champions – video\n\nPogba might have risen to the challenge against City, with two of the goals in United’s second-half comeback, but when he can play with that kind of authority it makes it even more perplexing that he can follow it up by having this kind of stinker. He dawdled his way through 57 minutes and there was no dissent from the crowd when Mourinho decided the team’s record signing should be removed so early. Mourinho was in such a dark mood afterwards it would be no surprise if Pogba loses his place against Bournemouth on Wednesday, or even in the FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham on Saturday.\n\nNot that it was all the fault of one player. At one point Pogba had the ball 20 yards inside the opposition half and was so irritated by the lack of movement from his team-mates he put his studs on top of the ball and held out his arms to protest. Unfortunately, when a player with his uncommon ability can play so listlessly he is not in any position to preach.\n\nWest Brom had a let-off in the first half when the referee, Paul Tierney, gave Craig Dawson the benefit of the doubt for a penalty-box challenge that put Ander Herrera on the floor. Ben Foster denied Lukaku with two fine saves and there was another occasion when the United striker had the chance to go through the middle only to be let down by his control. Yet the reality for United is that there was never a part of the match when it became a backs-to-the-wall operation for a team that is bound for the Championship.\n\nThe most inviting chance of the first half was the one for Jake Livermore, after 11 minutes, when David de Gea’s one-handed save denied him beneath the Stretford End. West Brom played with a sense of adventure that seemed to surprise their hosts. Rodriguez scored the game’s decisive goal from a badly defended corner and, as the United fans headed away, a party was starting a few miles across this divided city."}, {"date": "14/04/2018",

Championship and they did themselves few favours here, throwing away a two-goal lead in eight second-half minutes to hand victory to Chelsea.\n\nThat was not the whole story. Southampton deserved their lead after a brave first-half performance. Chelsea, meanwhile, had reeked of the malaise that has afflicted them ever since it became apparent Antonio Conte is unlikely be their manager after the end of this season. A classic tactical switch by the Italian, however, turned the game on its head. Saints are now five points from safety with only five games left to play.\n\nChelsea’s Marcos Alonso should have been sent off, claims Mark Hughes Read more\n\nDusan Tadic opened the scoring, turning home from 10 yards after a determined run from Ryan Bertrand. The centre-half Jan Bednarek, making his first start for Southampton, doubled the advantage when he volleyed home a free kick on the hour. Conte reacted immediately to the setback, however, and a double substitution, alongside a switch to a less-favoured back four, led to Chelsea swamping their opponents. Olivier Giroud sprang from the bench to score a double, with Eden Hazard thumping home the other. St Mary’s was left stunned, bar the section of Chelsea fans delighting in the proceedings.\n\nConte actively took responsibility for the failings of his side. “I must be honest, I was very angry for our first half because we didn’t show the will to play in the right way,” he said. “I am coach of this team and if we are not in the right way I’m the first person to take responsibility. For sure, to go 2-0 down was horrific for us.\n\n“But I think you must understand that in that moment you have to show great heart and great desire to come back. For me it is not important to win, lose or draw, the most important thing is to always play with great intensity, to fight from the start to the end. We are having a difficult season, we know this, and in this situation you see the man more than the player.”\n\nPlay Video 1:29 Mark Hughes praises Southampton display despite defeat by Chelsea – video\n\nChelsea were indeed their own worst enemy in the opening 45 minutes, the conversion rate for their many attempted feints and flicks standing at roughly 0%. Southampton, meanwhile, lacked technical polish and struggled to keep possession, but they were not lacking in heart.\n\nThe captain, Bertrand, led by example, putting in a shift up and down the left, and he sprinted half the length of the pitch to set up the opener. Shane Long, meanwhile, harassed Gary Cahill throughout and had Marcos Alonso’s studs raked down a calf for his troubles. Alonso may yet be the subject of retrospective punishment for a challenge that was not spotted at the time by the referee Mike Dean.\n\nMohamed Salah takes his tally to 30 in Liverpool win over Bournemouth Read more\n\nMark Hughes believes that those who are willing to fight it out provide his best hopes of an unlikely late turnaround in form. The question remains as to how many such characters the Welshman has at his disposal, however.\n\nHughes acknowledged his team “went under” after conceding the first goal, a brutal thumping header from Giroud that left his marker, Wesley Hoedt, crumpled on the floor. The marking on Hazard for the second suggested Hughes’s interpretation was correct. Giroud completed the comeback with a first-time, left-foot shot after Saints had failed to clear their lines.\n\n“We played really well, I thought, but during that eight-to-10-minute period in the second half we just went under,” Hughes said. “We were unable to clear our heads after the first goal. You know when a quality team like Chelsea are stung more often than not they have a reaction and that’s what Antonio Conte got.”\n\nLast Sunday his team lost 3-2 at Arsenal and Hughes added: “Everyone who’s seen our last two performances would say we deserved something. They were clapped off for the effort at the end today and that’s not happened on too many occasions recently. So there’s recognition of effort but we’ve got to have more than effort.

But he said: “How can there be a negative? Five and a half years ago we were 16th in the Championship. It’s impossible for there to be a negative.

Not at a timely derby success that has propelled Crystal Palace six points clear of the relegation zone, or even at the anxiety of the latter stages which, he said, had him “dying a few deaths” on the sidelines. Rather, the nagging sense of remorse was a legacy of his time in charge of England, and the player he partly allowed to slip through the net.\n\nThis was Wilfried Zaha’s moment. A winger whom Hodgson had twice capped in friendly fixtures only for four years on the outside looking in to prompt a switch in allegiance to Ivory Coast – the country of Zaha’s birth – illuminated this derby at Brighton & Hove Albion’s expense. It was his first-half effervescence which fed the home side’s momentum, his two goals which established a lead, and his ability to scuttle upfield in possession which relieved pressure as the visitors, mightily improved in the latter stages, threatened to force parity at the death.\n\nTom Ince’s last-gasp tap-in gives Huddersfield crucial win over Watford Read more\n\nOn this evidence, the 25-year-old Zaha would grace the summer’s World Cup finals but will, instead, be watching on from afar. “I’m partly responsible because I gave him his debut while he was at Crystal Palace in the Championship, and then he was at Manchester United not playing and we didn’t follow up on it,” said Hodgson. “I have to bear some responsibility there, but I’m pretty certain many England managers who will follow me will be saying it’s a pity he did choose the Ivory Coast. It was the prospect of greater involvement which seduced him.\n\n“He’s stepped up in a bid to help the team survive, as he did last season. Now he has to consider, with his best football years ahead of him, what he can do to get even better. His dribbling ability, and ability on the ball, has been good for a long time, so what step can he take to get himself up there recognised in the way Alexis Sánchez was at the Arsenal, or Eden Hazard is recognised at Chelsea? This season has been a dogfight, with us playing for our lives every week. But, with his qualities, he can step up and become even better.”\n\nPalace are grateful to count him among their ranks. This was a frenzy of a derby, gloriously chaotic from the outset, but it was Zaha’s class which ultimately held sway. The home side were at their most impressive when the winger was tearing at befuddled full-backs, or as Ruben Loftus-Cheek – a Chelsea loanee who may yet feature in Russia – drove forwards powerfully through the centre.\n\nThere were times in the opening quarter when Brighton, so shellshocked, threatened to wilt totally. It says much about the spirit and resilience of Chris Hughton’s team that somehow they summoned a performance from that initial disarray and came close to plucking a point.\n\nJordan Ayew’s equaliser earns Swansea strugglers a draw with Everton Read more\n\nSuch ambition would have seemed ridiculous in those early exchanges. Zaha had poked in from close range five minutes in, Albion having dawdled at Luka Milivojevic’s short-corner routine with the goalkeeper Mathew Ryan unable to keep out the Serb’s cross-shot. When James Tomkins rammed in a second after Yohan Cabaye’s set-piece had prompted panic, the first goals Brighton have conceded from corners since rejigging their approach in mid-January, this appeared to be a pummelling in the making. Glenn Murray, once of these parts, quickly replied after Palace froze at the other end, but Milivojevic was soon arcing over a centre for Zaha to nod in a first headed goal since the play-off semi-final between these teams back in 2013.\n\nAt 3-1 up, Palace seemed utterly dominant. As it transpired, they would end up grateful for Murray’s uncharacteristic profligacy. José Izquierdo, tormenting Joel Ward to wriggle on to Jürgen Locadia’s pass, had reduced the deficit impressively before the break, but the visitors were at their most oppressive in the final quarter. Murray had already steered one volley wide from Beram Kayal’s clever cross, Wayne Hennessey also denying Dale Stephens from distance, when Kayal centred again in stoppage time. Leonardo Ulloa flicked on and Murray, from point-blank range, could only poke an awkward volley backwards rather than into the net. “Did I expect him to score? Yes” offered Hughton. “But what Glenn does is he always gets there.”\n\nThere is more than enough quality in Brighton’s ranks, summed up by Murray’s persistence, to haul themselves clear of trouble, even with an horrendous run-in ahead, for all that derby defeat may have deflated an impressive campaign. The din at the final whistle reflected Palace’s relief, with Zaha leading the celebrations in front of the Holmesdale stand.

The question was whether Huddersfield could find precision to complement their tenacity. The answer for most of the match was negative, as it has often been this season for a side who had scored 26 goals in their 33 matches before this one. They worked themselves into positions to penetrate but failed to produce a cutting final ball. When they needed a scalpel they had only a plastic spoon. Their lone striker, Steve Mounié, looked hungry but was given little to feed off before being replaced in the 70th minute.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tom Ince scores Huddersfield’s late winner. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nWatford were worse. Theoretically Javi Gracia’s men are not out of the relegation woods themselves but they started here as if convinced they were already safe in practical terms. A ridiculous five-minute spell from Roberto Pereyra summed up most of the first half. In the 27th minute he took their first corner and hit it straight out of play. Ninety seconds later he did exactly the same thing. And soon after that he was booked for diving.\n\nIt was easy to see why Watford have not won away since November, nor scored in their last seven matches on the road. But amid the absurd sequence involving Pereyra, Watford started hinting at a threat, as Abdoulaye Doucouré burst from midfield and supplied Troy Deeney, whose shot from 16 yards was deflected wide. Doucouré sensed blood and began to break forward more regularly, one fierce low drive from the Frenchman forcing a save from Jonas Lössl. The interval came at a good time for Huddersfield.\n\nJordan Ayew’s equaliser earns Swansea strugglers a draw with Everton Read more\n\nHuddersfield curbed the visitors’ enthusiasm early in the second half but were unable to worry them. Gracia sought to give his team new impetus by introducing Richarlison for Femenía just before the hour.

A superbly-taken goal from Jordan Ayew at least enabled Swansea to salvage something after Kyle Naughton had put through his own net just before-half time, but this felt like a missed opportunity for Carlos Carvalhal and his players.\n\nThe Welsh club edged another point clear of the drop zone but slipped two places in the table on an afternoon when they paid a high price for their profligacy in front of goal. Everton, in contrast, remained ninth and it was another of those days when their supporters made it clear that they are far from enamoured with Sam Allardyce and his tactics. The Everton manager’s decision to bring on Ramiro Funes Mori for Yannick Bolasie went down particularly badly with the travelling fans, especially after they had just hit the woodwork and the game was there to be won.\n\nWilfried Zaha’s double clinches huge derby triumph for Crystal Palace Read more\n\nSwansea had started extremely brightly, opening Everton up with their slick passing and creating several excellent chances inside the first 30 minutes, yet their failure to take any of those opportunities proved costly as the visitors pilfered the lead shortly before the interval and totally against the run of play.\n\nLukasz Fabianski produced two fine saves to deny Bolasie and then Idrissa Gueye from close-range, but the ball rebounded off Naughton and over the line. Swansea thought they had got away with it but Lee Mason, the referee, received a notification on his wrist via the goal-line technology system and Carvalhal’s team found themselves behind in a game where they should have led.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Seamus Coleman hits the crossbar in the closing stages.

From the corner that followed Cenk Tosun nodded Federico Fernández’s header off the line.\n\nEverton seemed unable to stem the flow of white shirts and there was another reprieve for Allardyce’s team in the 26th minute. Jordan Ayew’s lovely first-time pass released Andre Ayew, his brother, through on goal but the forward’s shot was tame and straight at Jordan Pickford, who was able to easily save.\n\nTom Ince’s last-gasp tap-in gives Huddersfield crucial win over Watford Read more\n\nSwansea had another couple of openings early in the second half. Carroll’s diving header was saved by Pickford and five minutes later the Everton goalkeeper clawed Andre Ayew’s attempt over the bar. Everton, however, were starting to see a bit more of the ball and Gueye, totally unmarked, wastefully headed a cross from Theo Walcott wide of the far post.\n\nWith the clock ticking away, Carvalhal knew that he had to roll the dice. Tammy Abraham replaced Ki sung-Yueng as Swansea desperately pressed for an equaliser. Tosun, remarkably, cleared another header off the line, this time from Alfie Mawson, and Swansea must have wondered what they needed to do to score. The answer came via a slice of good fortune. Carroll’s mis-hit volley landed at the feet of Jordan Ayew, who took a touch before drilling an unerring shot across Pickford and into the far corner.\n\nQuick guide Promotion and relegation: how they stand Show Hide Premier League Champions: Manchester City\n\n\n\nChampions League: Manchester United and Tottenham in the group stage, Liverpool will face a play-off unless they win this year's final.

The Liverpool forward became the first player to reach 30 league goals with a delightful second-half header, leaving him one goal short of the record for a 38-match season, with four games to play.\n\nIn all competitions Salah has 40 for the season, enough to join the ranks of Liverpool royalty. Only Roger Hunt and Ian Rush have managed that feat before. One more league goal and Salah joins Alan Shearer, Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Suárez as joint top scorers for a 38-game Premier League season, although the chances are he will go out in front. He may even reach or pass the 34 goals Shearer scored in the original 42-fixture Premier League, though for the moment Liverpool are sufficiently impressed with the Rush connection.\n\n“Thirty-one years since Ian Rush scored 40?” Jürgen Klopp asked in mock disbelief. “He doesn’t look that old. Was he 14 years old at the time? Mo knows the way we play suits him. Perhaps the boys were searching for him a bit too much, but it is a win-win situation. He wants us to be successful and we would love him to get the Golden Boot.”\n\nGabriel Jesus sets Manchester City on their way to victory over Tottenham Read more\n\nSalah had already had a couple of chances by the time Liverpool took the lead on seven minutes. Jordan Henderson sent a diagonal cross into the box and though Asmir Begovic kept out Sadio Mané’s initial header from close to the penalty spot he could not keep hold of the ball, and the Senegal forward lost no time in tucking away the rebound.\n\nThough Jordon Ibe did try to hit back against his former club with a speculative drive that flew a couple of feet over Loris Karius’s crossbar, once Liverpool had taken such an early lead there was more interest in whether or not Salah would get on to the scoresheet than the outcome of the game.\n\nApparently piqued by Kane’s nerve in bulking up his total with a disputed goal, Salah made it clear from the outset he was keen to find the target. He brought a save from Begovic midway through the first half when it might have been more rewarding to pass to a colleague than shoot, and when a stray Simon Francis pass gave him a chance to run at the Bournemouth defence a few moments later he again showed little inclination to part with the ball, even though he must have known he had a slim chance of scoring with a rising shot from the edge of the area.\n\nThe second half began in a fashion that was actually quite tedious. The fact that Liverpool only had one attacking effort of note for a quarter of an hour might give some indication of how tedious. Roberto Firmino ran offside on a couple of occasions but that was about it for excitement. A 50-yard break by Trent Alexander-Arnold did bring Salah back into the game just after the hour mark, though by his standards the eventual shot was tame and straight at the goalkeeper.\n\nThe danger with just one goal separating the teams was that Bournemouth might sneak back into the game and share the points with a single effective attack, yet at the mid-point of the second half a couple of Salah-related incidents brought the stadium to life.\n\nFirst he went flying in the penalty area claiming a push in the back from Nathan Aké. It was in some ways similar to the Juventus foul Michael Oliver did so well to spot in midweek, though Chris Kavanagh was having none of it and replays proved him right. Aké did raise his hands, unwisely, and Salah may have felt the contact, though there was not even a hint of a shove.\n\nOlivier Giroud seals Chelsea’s comeback win to stun struggling Southampton Read more\n\nLess than a minute later Salah had his revenge, drifting in behind Aké to get his head to Alexander-Anold’s cross and put Liverpool two in front. That barely does his 30th league goal of the season justice, for Salah still had to apply the right amount of power and precision to get the ball above and beyond a 6ft 5in goalkeeper. In effect he lobbed Begovic while facing away from goal, showing the sort of instinctive finishing that has become his trademark. He made a difficult chance look easy. No wonder Kane is worried.\n\nKarius had to make a stop from Dan Gosling after that but Liverpool were never seriously threatened. Firmino could have made it 3-0 a few minutes before he scored, though after missing one good chance through over-elaborating in front of the Kop he made sure he buried his next one.\n\n“Liverpool have really improved in the last year,” Eddie Howe said, when reminded his team took a point from Anfield last season. “They are tough to play against at the moment.”"}, {"date": "14/04/2018", "arena":

cope in times of adversity, then Manchester City could hardly have chosen a more emphatic way to silence the people who seem to like nothing more than picking holes in Pep Guardiola’s methods. City had been forced to suck it up after a traumatic fortnight and it will be a long time before their fans get over missing out on the chance to start the title party in front of Manchester United last weekend. Yet if anyone wanted to know why Guardiola is on the verge of winning the Premier League for the first time, Wembley was the place to be on Saturday night.\n\nForget about the envy City will feel when Liverpool take on Roma in the Champions League semi-finals. This is no time to focus on their flaws. Not after they answered all the criticism by ending Tottenham’s 14-game unbeaten run with a blend of class and defiance, proving beyond doubt that little is as intoxicating as witnessing a Guardiola team allowing the creative juices to flow.\n\nDavid Silva still the conductor even if his tempo may be on the wane | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nGuardiola could barely keep the smile off his face as he paid tribute to his players afterwards. City require only three points from their final five games, with Swansea the visitors at the Etihad Stadium next Sunday, and the race will be over if United lose at home to West Brom on Sunday or at Bournemouth on Wednesday. How does Guardiola plan to spend his Sunday? “I’m playing golf with my son,” he said.\n\nHe will probably find a way to keep an eye on the United score, yet if City were carrying any psychological scars from their recent setbacks, they covered them up well. They relished Wembley’s wide open spaces, just as they had when collecting the first trophy of the Guardiola era with that impeccable victory over Arsenal in the League Cup final two months ago, and Tottenham must have feared they would be on the receiving end of a fearsome backlash as they tried to combat City’s high press and mastery of the ball.\n\nThe willingness to take risks sets City apart and no player encapsulates that more than David Silva, who was everywhere in those early stages, demanding the ball and unnerving Tottenham with how easily he crept away from his markers. City’s forwards knew that they just had to make the right runs and they almost took the lead in the fourth minute, Silva releasing Raheem Sterling behind Ben Davies, Leroy Sané volleying the winger’s cross against the woodwork.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gabriel Jesus scores City’s opening goal.

They had taken note of Tottenham’s high line and pierced it with one long ball, Vincent Kompany lifting the ball through for Gabriel Jesus to tear away from Davinson Sánchez and fire a resounding finish underneath Hugo Lloris.\n\nPochettino’s men were struggling to keep track of their runners and they found themselves in a deeper hole when Sterling skipped away from Sánchez and lured Lloris into tripping him. Replays suggested that the foul took place outside the area but Jon Moss pointed to the spot and Ilkay Gündogan made it 2-0. “The most important is to accept that sometimes it is for you and sometimes it is against you,” Pochettino said. “I am not going to complain. We lost because they were better.”\n\nPep Guardiola: ‘Premier League is harder to win than the Champions League’ Read more\n\nCity were in a similar position of strength against United last Saturday, though, and Tottenham struck back three minutes before the interval. Harry Kane released Christian Eriksen and the Dane enjoyed a moment of fortune when Aymeric Laporte’s desperate tackle rebounded off him and past Ederson.\n\nTottenham were determined to find out if City would crumble at the start of the second half, swarming around David Silva and asserting themselves in midfield, where Mousa Dembélé was dictating the flow at last. It had become a frenetic contest, played in a terrific atmosphere, and Jesus spurned a glorious chance to settle City’s nerves, scuffing woefully wide after escaping Sánchez again.\n\nHowever, City began to weather the storm after Guardiola switched to a back five in the 64th minute, Nicolás Otamendi replacing Sané, and they grabbed the clincher eight minutes after that tactical shift.\n\nSterling had added another baffling miss to his growing portfolio when he failed to punish an error from Lloris, infuriating Guardiola by firing against the prone Davies when it looked easier to score.\n\nYet there was no chance of Sterling turning down the chance to score his 22nd goal of the season when a rebound fell to him moments later.

The drama was relentless and for neutrals there was the bonus of seeing the contest descend into chaos after Jack Wilshere’s clash with Jack Stephens in added time.\n\nYet Southampton departed with an empty feeling. They had teased their supporters with the rarity of a Shane Long goal and their pursuit of an equaliser during the second half had yielded a reward when Charlie Austin, who had entered the fray moments earlier, cancelled out Arsenal’s lead with his first touch in the 73rd minute.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos Read more\n\nA precious point was there to be snaffled and, having ruined their first league game under Mark Hughes with a wretched collapse against West Ham last Saturday, that unfamiliar sensation Southampton were experiencing was a surge of optimism.\n\nYet the speed with which it was replaced by despair encapsulates why their hold on their Premier League status remains so uncertain. They had been level for eight minutes when Dusan Tadic allowed Alex Iwobi to cross for Welbeck, who had just produced a contender for miss of the season, to rise above Cédric Soares and head home Arsenal’s winner. “At that point you need to have clarity of thought to make sure you take something out of the game,” Hughes said.\n\nThere are six games left for Southampton, who are three points below 17th-placed Crystal Palace, and Welbeck’s second goal was the cue for a loss of composure from Stephens, who accepted the bait when he felt Wilshere nibbling at him. Wilshere was in full wind-up-merchant mode as Southampton attacked and the frustration was too much for Stephens to bear.\n\nIt was a naive reaction and the way the centre-back lashed out left Andre Marriner with no option but to send him off. Mohamed Elneny would follow him down the tunnel – Arsène Wenger suggested Arsenal could appeal against the Egyptian midfielder’s dismissal for pushing Soares – but the damage was already done.\n\n“Wilshere should have been sent off,” Hughes said. “Jack Stephens has reacted to being pulled back for about 20 yards. It’s not correct but it’s understandable. But if you’re going to send Jack off, you have to send Wilshere off for bouncing up. I thought I saw a definite movement with his knee towards Jack.”\n\nWilshere escaped with a booking and Hughes was left to reflect on Southampton’s failure to take advantage of opponents whose minds were elsewhere for long spells. The visitors began with a cautious 5-4-1 system, with the return of Oriol Romeu giving the midfield a steelier look and Long foraging on his own up front. Yet they had players who could trouble for Arsenal on the break and James Ward-Prowse had an early effort hacked off the line by Héctor Bellerín.\n\nThe opening stemmed from an error from Shkodran Mustafi, who was an accident waiting to happen in the heart of Arsenal’s defence, and Southampton’s reward arrived in the 17th minute. Sead Kolasinac allowed Soares to squeeze in a cross from the byline and Long nipped in front of the motionless Mustafi to prod his second goal in 46 appearances beyond the exasperated Petr Cech.\n\nArsenal 3-2 Southampton: Premier League –as it happened Read more\n\nWenger’s decision to rest seven players before his side’s trip to CSKA Moscow for the second leg of their Europa League quarter-final on Thursday demonstrated where Arsenal’s priorities lie. Their challenge for a place in the top four is all but over.\n\nHowever, they equalised with their first coherent attack, Welbeck conjuring a beautiful flick from Iwobi’s pass, the ball running into the area for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to elude Stephens and beat Alex McCarthy. Aubameyang’s sixth goal since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund settled the mood and Southampton’s porous defence was again exposed when Welbeck scored in the 38th minute. Iwobi found him and the striker sped past Stephens before seeing his powerful shot hit Maya Yoshida, whose punishment for turning his back on the ball was to watch it fly into the right corner.\n\nSouthampton chased an equaliser, Long and Pierre-Emile Højbjerg testing Cech, Wesley Hoedt forcing Elneny to clear his header off the line. Long turned in Højbjerg’s wayward shot, only for the flag to go up for offside.\n\nWenger introduced Wilshere in place of Reiss Nelson, who faded on his first Premier League start but a goal from the visitors felt inevitable. Soares drove inside from the right and Austin, who had just replaced Yoshida, converted his cross.\n\nCech denied Austin a second a few minutes later and Southampton must have thought their luck was in when Welbeck turned Wilshere’s cushioned ball over an unguarded net.

Both sets of fans had warmed to glimpses of the former Chelsea midfielder turned coach in action, clips that spanned eras beamed out over the big screens at either end of the ground, with West Ham’s support bellowing out their own admiration in unison.\n\nThe tributes were heartfelt and fitting. So it was to the 2016-17 champions’ exasperation that their side could not then produce the victory that would have so thrilled Wilkins from his seat just in front of the pressbox. The season-ticket holder would have rejoiced in some of his favourites’ attacking play, particularly when they were dominant through a one-sided opening period, and might have enjoyed the frantic intensity of the last quarter-hour once the visitors had plucked parity from nowhere. But, in reality, he would have cursed the fact Chelsea’s campaign is petering out in frustration.\n\nRay Wilkins given a fond farewell on a day for goodbyes at the Bridge | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThis draw left Antonio Conte’s side 10 points off Tottenham with only six games still to play and there was a smattering of boos at the final whistle. Chelsea have won only three league games this calendar year, their prospects of qualifying for the Champions League fading with each hiccup, and the head coach bemoaning the same inadequacies. Profligacy means the gap to fourth widened.\n\n“We must be realistic: if we are not able to win this type of game, we are talking about what?” the Italian grumbled. “You must win this game if you want to reach a target, the Champions League. Because the other teams are clinical, they are ready to suffer and win the game. At the end of the season, we’ll have struggled a lot. This game describes our whole season.”\n\nThat summed it up. There were hints of brilliance, not least in the zest of Chelsea’s early approach play, which had threatened to sweep aside West Ham, but it was not only Joe Hart’s brilliance that kept the scoreline decent. The home side’s front three seemed to feed off N’Golo Kanté’s energy through the centre, the Frenchman a frenzy of interceptions and short passes, cajoling Cesc Fàbregas into action at his side.\n\nWillian and Eden Hazard were a blur of movement ahead of them and, when they clicked, that combination sliced through their opponents almost at will. Some of their more intricate play took the breath away, summed up when Fàbregas slid a pass from deep to prompt a rat-a-tat exchange at pace between Hazard and Álvaro Morata, with the Belgian smartly liberating Willian.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Flowers and a vintage No 8 shirt were placed on the assistant manager’s seat in the home dugout at Stamford Bridge in tribute to the late Ray Wilkins. Photograph: Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC via Getty Images\n\nOnly Hart’s sharp save with his outstretched left leg denied the Brazilian as he bore down on goal. It was a fine intervention – the first of many from England’s current third choice – so to ship a goal from Hazard’s resultant corner, played short, seemed horribly careless on the visitors’ part. Victor Moses’ centre was looped towards the far post and nodded down far too easily by Morata, in amid grounded opponents. César Azpilicueta duly flicked up and away from a dozy Marko Arnautovic, dangling a leg weakly, with the Spaniard able to poke the loose ball into the far corner from five yards out. West Ham’s defenders had rather stumbled into the concession, concentration lapsing while they marvelled at Hart’s original save. “It was a really poxy goal to concede,” David Moyes offered.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos Read more\n\nYet, crucially, the visitors survived everything flung at them thereafter. Willian and Moses fired wide. Morata, with goals in his previous two games, was twice rightly flagged offside as he poked home – a reflection perhaps of anxiety as much as eagerness – with the script increasingly predictable. Arnautovic had fluffed the visitors’ best first-half opportunity, from Arthur Masuaku’s delicious diagonal, but the Austrian would make his presence felt before the end. Mark Noble launched an optimistic pass into the penalty area 17 minutes from time, with Gary Cahill’s header indecisive, neither a pass to a team-mate nor a clearance, with Arnautovic quick to the loose ball to pull back a centre. There loitered Javier Hernández, a regular scorer as a substitute against these opponents, to fizz a shot inside Thibaut Courtois’s post with his first touch of the contest.\n\nEverything in what time remained was frenetic, from Hart’s fine stops to deny Marcos Alonso and Olivier Giroud, to Kanté’s timely challenge on Arnautovic, bustling free of the home side’s backline. “Any player other than Kanté wouldn’t have caught up with Marko but I’d rather talk about how well the team kept at it,” Moyes said. “That level of form will be good for Joe, too. We played against a really slick Chelsea team, particularly in the first half, so I’m not disappointed with a draw.” His team are now six points clear of the bottom three and can sense safety.

Everton missed a golden opportunity not only via the right foot of Calvert-Lewin. “A bit woeful,” Allardyce said of his team’s passing, and they needed almost 80 minutes to exert the pressure that should have yielded a flattering three points.\n\n“We were not here to play a wild derby,” said Klopp, whose team have kept eight clean sheets in their last 12 outings. In that sense both teams delivered. This was the first Merseyside derby since 1992 to end without a card of any description. “We made it difficult for Everton to get the game they wanted,” the Liverpool manager added. “It was a good performance, not brilliant but probably the most mature since I came here. We played football, didn’t get involved in any fights and to deliver a game like this is a big compliment for my team.” No added injury worries before Tuesday’s trip to the Etihad Stadium were arguably more important to Klopp than the point.\n\nHe made five changes to the team that blitzed Manchester City in the Champions League on Wednesday with his squad impacted by injury and the second leg understandably in mind. Mohamed Salah was rested completely as he receives treatment on a groin injury that is not expected to rule him out against City. Liverpool’s injury problems continued in the warm-up when Alberto Moreno pulled out with a thigh problem. The Spanish left-back had only made the substitutes’ bench having taken a knock during his brief cameo against City. He was replaced by Rafael Camacho, who joined Curtis Jones among the 17-year-old back-up options available to Klopp.\n\nEverton opened with the high-tempo craved by the crowd and Ragnar Klavan was almost dispossessed by Theo Walcott on the edge of Liverpool’s penalty area. It was a deceptive opening. In Walcott and Yannick Bolasie the hosts had two fit, fast and experienced wingers up against a right-back making his first appearance of the season – Nathaniel Clyne – and a half-fit 32-year-old central defender making his first start since 1 January at left-back – Klavan. Yet Liverpool’s full-backs were only seriously tested in the final stages while Séamus Coleman and Leighton Baines were exposed time and again during the first half.\n\nKlopp’s options were stretched but he was able to do the same to Allardyce’s team by stationing James Milner on the extreme left of Liverpool’s midfield and Clyne in an advanced position. The pair revelled in the space between Everton’s wingers and full-backs and gradually, to Goodison’s audible dismay, forced the hosts into a collective retreat.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson met minimal resistance as they controlled midfield, although Danny Ings and Dominic Solanke unsurprisingly lacked the menace of Salah and Roberto Firmino. Solanke should have opened the scoring when Clyne’s cross rebounded into his path off Coleman’s chest but his snap-shot was straight at Jordan Pickford. The Everton goalkeeper, watched by England manager, Gareth Southgate, produced a fine save to tip away a Milner effort that was curling inside his left-hand post. The stop of the game, however, came from Loris Karius.\n\nLiverpool’s keeper had been a bystander but underlined his growing influence in the first moment he was required. The threat arrived from the first time Everton broke behind Klavan down the right. Walcott released Coleman and his deep cross fell to Bolasie, who cut inside and curled a shot that was destined for the top corner until Karius made a superb finger-tip save. That was a rare show of quality from Bolasie, with the Congo international encapsulating his side’s error-strewn performance. Wayne Rooney was similarly wasteful and could have no complaints about being withdrawn in the 57th minute for a second home game in succession.\n\nKlopp’s second-half substitutions reflected not only Liverpool’s current workload but how lightly he regarded the threat from Everton. Both his best player, Milner, and most dangerous player, Sadio Mané, were withdrawn and Liverpool’s control over the derby disappeared with them. An invitation was extended to Everton and they so nearly took it.\n\nEventually, belatedly, the hosts began to target Liverpool down the flanks and created several openings that should have yielded victory. Tosun was inches away from connecting with a Baines’ cross that flashed across the face of Karius’s goal. When Walcott stood up an inviting cross from the right, the Turkey international out-muscled Clyne at the back post but steered his close-range header inches wide of the far post with Coleman just failing to connect.\n\nThe chance of the game, one that Calvert-Lewin can only have dreamed about beforehand, fell to the 21-year-old in the 88th minute. Coleman galloped down the right and his cross broke to the Everton substitute lurking unmarked at the back post. He had time and only Karius to beat but sliced horribly wide as Everton’s players‚ to a man, lifted their hands to their heads. Their frustration continues.

With 60 seconds of normal time remaining, Palace thought they had earned the most priceless of victories, thanks to two stunning goals – by Luka Milivojevic and Wilfried Zaha – but they twice crumbled, with Joshua King striking the decisive blow when he stabbed home at the back post.\n\nBournemouth simply do not know when they are beaten, having now won 18 points from losing positions this season, the most of any Premier League team. With five games to play, this was a damning blow to Palace’s hopes of survival but this late drama showed why Eddie Howe’s side are surely set for a fourth successive season in the top tier.\n\nFor Palace, who continue to teeter immediately above the drop zone, one win in 10 matches reads as relegation form. Before King’s late goal here they had made huge strides, seemingly heading five points clear of the bottom three when Zaha fired home 15 minutes from time after dancing around on the edge of the box, twirling away from Ryan Fraser before sending Asmir Begovic’s net rippling.\n\nBut Fraser, who had gone to ground trying to challenge Zaha, had a hand in Bournemouth’s 89th-minute equaliser. It was his inviting corner that was flicked on by Steve Cook into the path of King, the second-half substitute, who turned home unmarked. It was Bournemouth’s second leveller of the afternoon, with Lys Mousset, another player to excel off the bench, having scored within three minutes of coming on. His goal cancelled out Milivojevic’s glorious free-kick, scored by the Palace captain on his 27th birthday.\n\nHodgson was left deflated having witnessed his side squander victory in the cruellest manner possible. Before Zaha’s wondrous strike, Patrick van Aanholt had shot straight at Begovic when clean through.\n\n“We couldn’t hold on to the lead on two occasions and we certainly created enough chances to put the game to bed,” Hodgson said. “If we continue to play like that over the next five games, we have to believe we can take enough points. I have confidence in the team and I think the team has shown confidence but it’s going to be a dogfight.”\n\nHodgson was forced into a rethink up front with Christian Benteke absent because of a groin injury, and Alexander Sorloth and Connor Wickham also missing. Zaha spearheaded the Palace attack, supported by Andros Townsend who was always in close proximity, but for much of this match he was frustrated and flummoxed, typified by a first-half contretemps with Lewis Cook. Jonathan Moss kept his cards in his pocket but moments later Hodgson pulled the forward aside, urging calm. Bournemouth had every right to be agitated themselves, with Callum Wilson guilty of spurning two golden chances.\n\nBournemouth had failed to seize the initiative and Palace did exactly that after the interval. Presented with a free-kick 25 yards from goal after Yohan Cabaye was fouled, Milivojevic arrowed a right-foot effort beyond Begovic and into the top corner. Palace were buoyed, Van Aanholt denied by Begovic before an advancing Zaha took centre-stage, wringing Charlie Daniels inside out only for his effort to be palmed away by Begovic. Howe responded by throwing on two strikers – King and Mousset – and both made ample impact.\n\nThe latter rifled home with his first touch, a first-time effort from distance, three minutes after coming on. Enter Zaha. After twisting and turning away from three Bournemouth shirts, the Palace forward piled all of his pent-up frustration into a bullet-like effort from the edge of the box. The pocket of Palace supporters celebrated deliriously – they thought Zaha had snatched victory – but it was King who stepped off the bench to have the final say.\n\n“There’s never a dull moment with us,” Howe said. “It’s not good for my health and was really edge-of-your-seat stuff. The comeback says lots about the attitude of our players and team. The players want to go the extra mile, I don’t think we’ve ever lost that, and I think it’s shone again today.”"}, {"date": "07/04/2018", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30501, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ezequiel Schelotto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [74], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Baldock", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Goldson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jürgen Locadia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [29], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Terence Kongolo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rajiv van La Parra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Malone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philip Billing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Collin Quaner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Crackling with nervous energy throughout, Brighton and Huddersfield fought each other to a standstill here in their attempts to avoid relegation. Two goals, both in part the result of an individual error, were characteristic of a match riddled with tension. First Huddersfield’s Jonas Lössl’s soft save rebounded into the net off the goalkeeper himself, then Shane Duffy handed Steve Mounié an equaliser on a platter. Both sides gave their all but neither can relax as the Premier League enters its final straight.\n\n“I’m disappointed and frustrated,” said the Brighton manager, Chris Hughton. His team stand on 35 points but now face Crystal Palace in another six-pointer before taking on the current top four in their final five matches. “We had a really good opportunity. Particularly with the start we had. We were up against a team that struggles to score and the goal gave them the lift they needed.”\n\nBournemouth’s Joshua King pounces at the last to deny Crystal Palace vital win Read more\n\nHughton was right about the start. Davy Pröpper should have scored his first goal for the club within the first 30 seconds. Chasing a looped pass from Ezequiel Schelotto, he controlled the ball, advanced on goal and missed the target. The Dutch international was under pressure from Jonathan Hogg but had a clear sight of goal. It was the first example of the nerves that would define Brighton’s performance.\n\nThe home side’s first properly fluent move resulted in a goal, however. Pröpper started it, releasing José Izquierdo on the counter with the outside of his boot. The Colombian smuggled the ball to Solly March, who hit a low shot that was precise but lacking real power. Lössl got down to it but his connection was weak, pushing the ball on to the post, then back on to himself and into the net.\n\nIf that was a warning that calamity can be round the corner at any moment, Brighton did not heed it. Within three minutes the visitors were level and it was all Shane Duffy’s work, the centre-half playing a blind pass across his box while under pressure from Alex Pritchard. Mounié intercepted, rounded Mat Ryan and tucked home.\n\nEverton rue late misses as winless derby run against Liverpool goes on Read more\n\n“In general I am happy,” said the Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, afterwards. His Terriers are four points clear of Southampton in 18th, having played two games more. “I’m pleased with the performance and very pleased with the players’ response after the start Brighton made and having conceded a lucky goal. If this means you get a point at the end we have to accept it.”\n\nPröpper put the cap on a highly strung performance when he was sent off with 15 minutes remaining for a sliding challenge on Hogg. Brighton might still have won the game with 10 men but Izquierdo failed to round Lössl when sent through by Leonardo Ulloa and Duffy had two headed chances to make amends only to see one cleared and the other go over.\n\n“There’s still six games to go, that means so many points still to play for,” Hughton said. “Somebody’s going to pull out a surprise; they always do. Which team that will be I do not know.

Here, and to Benítez’s immense credit, Newcastle’s players looked fully aware of their roles and convinced of their ability to fulfil them. Coming into the game on the back of two home wins, Benítez’s side showed confidence and smoothness. They were helped by another sluggish start by Leicester, a bad habit that Claude Puel’s team have fallen into in recent weeks.\n\nJack Cork keeps Burnley on track for Europe by sinking Watford Read more\n\nThe King Power crowd were treated to free beer and fireworks before kick-off to celebrate the 60th birthday of Leicester’s chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, but the home team were not supposed to be generous to the opposition. Leicester’s early diffidence seemed like an invitation to Newcastle and Benítez’s men did not need to be asked twice. They came close to scoring in the second minute when Kasper Schmeichel had to bat away a glancing header by Pérez following a corner by Kenedy.\n\nLeicester’s play for most of the first period was slow and bitty, the opposite of Newcastle’s. Shelvey intelligently ran midfield, where Leicester missed the dynamism of the suspended Wilfried Ndidi.\n\nShelvey was instrumental when Newcastle opened the scoring in the 18th minute. After Pérez picked him out on the edge of the area, Shelvey used a foxy dummy to send Wes Morgan and Harry Maguire on a wild goose chase. Then he guided a shot from 18 yards past Schmeichel, helped by a deflection off Ben Chilwell.\n\nIt was Shelvey’s first goal in the Premier League for Newcastle and, allied to how he orchestrated play for much of the first half, the ideal way to strengthen his chances of persuading Gareth Southgate to draft him into England’s World Cup squad.\n\nMaguire seems certain to go to Russia but could have been given his marching orders here. In the 20th minute he reacted to Dwight Gayle’s pesky jostling by turning and giving the striker an open-handed shove in the mouth. The referee, Stuart Attwell, showed only a yellow card.\n\nIf Leicester fans hoped that incident would serve as a metaphorical slap in the face to wake up their team, their wish was not immediately granted. Not until the 37th minute did Leicester show the class they undoubtedly possess. Adrien Silva was to thank for that, as he opened up Newcastle with a wonderful pass from the centre circle to Riyad Mahrez. As the winger wound up a shot from 15 yards, Paul Dummett slid in and took him down – but Attwell again took a lenient view, apparently believing the defender connected with the ball.\n\nSteve Mounié capitalises on Brighton howler to rescue point for Huddersfield Read more\n\nAt last Leicester perked up. Now Newcastle had to fight. As the second half progressed and Puel made a series of attacking changes, Leicester worked up a head of steam. But Newcastle stayed cool enough to stop them creating clear chances. And then, in the 75th minute, Leicester’s defence imploded. There seemed no trouble when Florian Lejeune punted the ball forward but Morgan and Maguire looked slack-jawed at it as if it were an unidentified flying object. Their bewilderment allowed Pérez to dart in and send a 25-yard lob over the stranded Schmeichel.\n\nVardy stabbed the ball in after 83 minutes after a knock-down by Shinji Okazaki. But Newcastle would not be denied a precious and richly merited win. “I have to say congratulations to the players.” said Benítez, who deserves a pat on the back himself."}, {"date": "07/04/2018", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 29515, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Martins Indi", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [32], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moritz Bauer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papa Alioune Ndiaye", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramadan Sobhi Ahmed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [57], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jakob Haugaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrese Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [52], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Moura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Every relegated side can tell a story like this. Stoke City left the pitch with applause ringing in their ears, their supporters summoning a mixture of defiance and appreciation after a performance that deserved more. Paul Lambert had cajoled a full-blooded display that mixed an awareness of their own limitations with moments of genuine threat but it was not enough here and may not be at the end of the season, either.\n\nThey lost to a fortunate goal from Christian Eriksen, whose second of the game arrived six minutes after Mame Biram Diouf had equalised via his own piece of luck, and the suspicion is that a lack of quality at either end of the pitch will prove their undoing.\n\nTammy Abraham equaliser denies West Brom vital win over Swansea Read more\n\n“I’ve not seen that too many times, you’d have thought we had won the game,” Lambert said of the roars to which his players, some of whom were on their haunches upon Graham Scott’s full-time whistle, departed. It was one of those occasions this stadium creates better than most: raucous, antagonistic and affronted throughout, baying for the most marginal decisions and thundering with noise given the slightest encouragement.\n\nThat their efforts were insufficient owed mainly to a free-kick from Eriksen, whipped over from the left flank, that Harry Kane rose to meet but appeared to miss. The ball continued its flight past Jack Butland, who was almost certainly distracted, and as Tottenham’s celebrations unfolded Kane was eager to inform Eriksen that the final touch was his. The Premier League did not agree and Kane, on his return to the starting lineup, will have to live without history recognising any glance off his sleeve.\n\nThe goalscorer’s identity dominated the post-match narrative but it is really just a detail. The softness of the concession was of far more concern to Stoke while, for Mauricio Pochettino, the satisfaction arose from a win that makes Champions League qualification look increasingly likely and came without Tottenham looking particularly comfortable. “It puts us in a really good position to achieve what we want,” Pochettino said. “I think it was a massive, massive three points. In football you need some luck but overall we deserved the victory.”\n\nThere was certainly cause for satisfaction that, while far from their best, Tottenham’s heads stayed cool. Stoke had lost the sides’ previous four meetings with an aggregate of 17-1 and emerged as if hellbent on turning the tide. They were denied possession for most of the first half but worked feverishly off the ball, the tone set by January signing Badou Ndiaye. The Senegal international looks a bargain at £14m from Galatasaray and his top-flight career should survive any relegation; here he dispossessed Mousa Dembélé twice in the opening quarter with crunching, impeccably timed challenges and denied Son Heung-min an opportunity with a third. Fans and team-mates responded alike: it was not long before Xherdan Shaqiri, tracking back 30 yards to harry Victor Wanyama, brought sections of the crowd to their feet.\n\nBournemouth’s Joshua King pounces at the last to deny Crystal Palace vital win Read more\n\nThey would have risen in unison had Diouf not jabbed a fine chance over the bar in the 12th minute. That was one of only two first-half openings, the other falling to Son after a lofted pass from Dele Alli. On that occasion Jack Butland saved Stoke but Tottenham’s radar had largely been off.\n\nButland had no chance when Eriksen, who had been awry before the break, found his bearings. The move started when Bruno Martins Indi, attempting to pass forwards, presented the ball straight to Dembélé and was instantly left floundering when it was slid through to Alli, roaming into the space behind him. Alli had the presence of mind to wait for Eriksen to catch up and his pass was dispatched unerringly.\n\nStoke refused to fold and equalised when Diouf, racing Hugo Lloris to a delicious Shaqiri pass, scuffed into the vacant net after the Tottenham keeper had belted his clearance against him from point-blank range. This looked like the kind of luck Lambert believes has eluded his team but Eriksen soon provided further cause for regret.\n\nSo, too, did the Tottenham crossbar during a rousing finale in which Pochettino admitted Spurs had to “suffer”. It was Shaqiri whose free-kick rebounded from the frame; substitute Tyrese Campbell also headed agonisingly wide 15 seconds after coming on and Diouf, full of running but never wholly reliable, somehow wasted a four-on-one counter five minutes from time.\n\n“I couldn’t ask any more than the way we played,” Lambert says. “Performance-wise, we didn’t look like a team at the bottom.” He believes three victories will secure safety; this was a stirring day’s work but for Stoke, winless in nine, that looks an increasingly long shot."}, {"date": "07/04/2018", "arena": "Vicarage Road",

to remember what it feels like to score a Premier League goal as Swansea came from behind against the league’s bottom club to salvage a precious point that they scarcely deserved.\n\nThe last time that Abraham registered in the top flight was back in the middle of October, before he made his England debut, and it has turned into a slog of a season for the on-loan Chelsea striker since. Yet this was a goal to cherish for player and club as the 20-year-old ended his drought and edged Swansea four points clear of the drop zone.\n\nThe fact that Abraham’s header was Swansea’s only effort on target all afternoon says everything about their performance, which was reminiscent of their toils in the first half of the season. West Brom could and probably should have punished them by picking up only their second league victory since August, yet Jay Rodriguez’s opportunist goal early in the second half was cancelled out after Swansea beat Albion at their own game by scoring from a set piece.\n\nJack Cork keeps Burnley on track for Europe by sinking Watford Read more\n\nThe good news for Albion is that this point ended that dismal run of eight successive league defeats, with the departure of Alan Pardew on Monday and the presence of Darren Moore on the touchline lifting the mood inside a stadium that has witnessed more than its share of misery this season. The bad news is that a point is not nearly enough at this stage of the season, with Albion still marooned at the foot of the table.\n\nMoore, who has been placed in charge in a caretaker capacity, saw the positives and said that he was “delighted to stop the rot”, and also pleased with the way that his players responded to Abraham’s goal 15 minutes from time. “The fans hopefully saw a West Brom team that set about to be positive in everything they did, on the front foot from the outset, and wanted to take the game to Swansea,” he said.\n\nSwansea gave Albion a helping hand in that respect by sitting deep and doing little to try to capitalise on the fragile confidence among a group of players that are all but resigned to relegation. “It was not a good game,” Carlos Carvalhal, Swansea’s manager, said. “We expected to play the way we did after we conceded the goal – to press more, to be more dynamic. With the ball we must do better. When we conceded the goal it was like we were free.”\n\nWith four of their final six matches at home, Swansea are not in the worst position and Carvalhal is entitled to think that they will be a different proposition against Everton on Saturday, when Jordan Ayew, their leading scorer, is back from suspension. Yet it still felt alarming to see Swansea play with such caution here.\n\nAlbion were far from free-flowing themselves but they certainly carried the greater threat. Lukasz Fabianski repelled a 25-yard piledriver from Chris Brunt and the Swansea goalkeeper made an even better stop on the stroke of half-time, when he produced a one-handed stop to keep out a close-range shot from Rodriguez. Sandwiched between those two moments André Ayew should have scored when he ran onto a through ball from Sam Clucas, only to spear his left-footed shot narrowly wide with only Ben Foster to beat.\n\nIt was hard to see where the breakthrough would come from in a drab game but the goal arrived in the 54th minute and was simple in its execution. Matt Phillips crossed from the left, Salomón Rondón flicked the ball on and there was Rodriguez, ghosting in at the far post, to turn the ball home from no more than two yards out.\n\nSwansea huffed and puffed in response but needed a set piece to bring parity. Brunt needlessly conceded a corner, Clucas delivered the ball from the right and Abraham, getting ahead of Jake Livermore, nodded beyond Foster. “Tammy’s progressing well,” said Carvalhal. “With the age that he is, to come to the Premier League is not easy.”"}, {"date": "07/04/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54259, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name":

Or, at least, they thought they had. Blue smoke bombs were being let off. The first euphoric chants of “championees”, could be heard and the Etihad was overdosing on schadenfreude given the history of these teams and the prospect of a title-winning victory that would have meant so much in this divided city.\n\nWhat followed was extraordinary. Manchester United scored, quickly added another and then one more to complete an improbable feat of escapology against the Premier League’s champions-in-waiting. From 2-0 down to 3-2 up in the space of 16 second-half minutes – the game had been turned upside down and, at the final whistle, the television cameras even picked out a few home supporters in tears.\n\nJosé Mourinho hails ‘phenomenal’ Paul Pogba after Manchester United sink City Read more\n\nReminder: City are 13 points clear at the top of the table. Mourinho congratulated them afterwards for winning the title.\n\nIt was a wild, eccentric derby and one of the stirring United comebacks from a team, in Sir Alex Ferguson’s day at least, that used to make a habit of these kind of thrilling recoveries. United, to put it bluntly, were abysmal in the first half. Vincent Kompany and Ilkay Gundogan had both scored for City and it could easily have become a rout if Raheem Sterling had not been having one of those days when he seemed to confuse the measurements of David de Gea’s goal with a particularly troublesome barn door. Sterling’s misses did not feel so consequential at the time, with City winning 2-0, but they did by the end.\n\nUnited certainly rode their luck bearing in mind the two incidents when penalties should have been awarded against Ashley Young – the second one, at 3-2, a studs-up lunge on the substitute Sergio Agüero that should also have resulted in a red card – but it was a triumph, ultimately, for the strength of personality within Mourinho’s team and if City defend this way against Liverpool on Tuesday their chances of reaching the Champions League semi-finals are somewhere between minimal and non-existent. This is the first time in Guardiola’s coaching career that one of his teams have conceded three goals in successive matches and Nicolás Otamendi, in particular, was badly exposed during the period of the game when Paul Pogba scored twice and Chris Smalling turned in the winner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ashley Young plants his studs on Sergio Agüero’s shin but Manchester City’s furious penalty claims fell on deaf ears. Photograph: Manchester City FC/Man City via Getty Images\n\nUntil that stage, Pogba was part of a midfield that was being over-run and Alexis Sánchez had found it difficult to make any kind of favourable impression.\n\nYet the game swung on the moment, five minutes into the second half, when Gundogan’s shot flicked off the angle of crossbar and post. After that, United’s A-listers seemed to remember they were supposed to be elite performers. Pogba demonstrated his more attractive qualities and Sánchez – involved in all of his team’s goals – chose a good day to remind everyone why United made him the best-paid footballer in the land.\n\nFor Guardiola, it must have been startling to see the way City unravelled once Sánchez had drawn Otamendi out to the right wing and then swivelled away from him to help create Pogba’s first goal. Ander Herrera chested Sánchez’s cross into Pogba’s path and once the Frenchman had aimed his shot beyond Ederson it was remarkable how quickly the game swung United’s way.\n\nJosé Mourinho the ultimate party pooper rains on Guardiola’s parade | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nTwo minutes later, Sánchez crossed from the left and Pogba eluded Otamendi to equalise with a precise header. Smalling’s goal was another cross into the penalty area, this time from Sánchez’s free-kick, and the centre-half was completely alone as he side-footed his shot into an exposed net.\n\nFor all the praise they have attracted this season, City have not actually kept clean sheets in successive home matches since September. Their vulnerabilities at the back can often be overlooked when they attack so beautifully. Yet the last two games have shown how susceptible they can be against top-level opposition and this was one occasion when Mourinho could never be accused of ultra-defensive tactics. As Jürgen Klopp said last week, sitting back is not the way to hurt City. From Mourinho, there was no parking of the bus.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Pogba beats Ederson to launch United’s incredible comeback. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nGuardiola chose not to blame the referee, Martin Atkinson, in his post-match analysis. Indeed, he had to ask his press officer for the referee’s name, which made a refreshing change compared to the response it might have incurred had it been Mourinho in that position. Yet there was nothing of note from City’s manager to explain why and where it went wrong and, by the final whistle, this was one of the few occasions since he Guardiola joined the club that a few supporters behind the dugout could be seen taking exception with his decisions. Only a few – but still noticeable.\n\nGuardiola had taken the calculated gamble of starting with Kevin de Bruyne on the bench. Gabriel Jesus and Kyle Walker were also rested with Tuesday’s game against Liverpool in mind and Guardiola resisted any temptation to fast-track the fit-again Agüero into the starting lineup. Yet it scarcely seemed to matter when Kompany powered in Sané’s corner and five minutes later Gundogan swivelled past Nemanja Matic to stab in City’s second goal.\n\nManchester City 2-3 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAt 2-0, the mood was euphoric. City were on course to win the league with six games to spare. No side would have done it any earlier, date-wise, since United beat Blackpool 2-1 on the same day to seal the 1955-56 championship and Mourinho said afterwards it would have felt “like death” for his team’s supporters. Instead, it was the players in red celebrating a highly memorable victory and City will have to wait until next weekend, at the earliest, to wrap up their third title in seven years.\n\nMore likely, it will need a little longer, given the chances of United losing at home to West Bromwich Albion.\n\nAn exhilarating high had turned into an excruciating low, and vice versa. “Wow”’ Guardiola said.

"report": "For anyone down at the bottom there is a sense of inevitability that the breaks will go to the opposition. This was Stoke City’s lament. They had held their own at a typically edgy Emirates Stadium until Bruno Martins Indi stretched into a penalty-box challenge on Mesut Özil in the 74th minute.\n\nIt looked clumsy and a little risky but TV replays confirmed that Martins Indi had got a toe to the ball. Craig Pawson’s penalty award felt like a kick to the guts.\n\nStoke have only ever tasted defeat at this venue – their last away win against Arsenal came at Highbury in 1981 – and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang set the latest reverse in motion when he converted the penalty.\n\nArsenal 3-0 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAubameyang added a lovely second before the substitute Alexandre Lacazette gave the scoreline a gloss that had not looked likely at half-time – when Arsenal were booed off – with another penalty. It was Lacazette’s first action since mid-February and knee surgery. He had replaced Danny Welbeck, who suffered a back problem.\n\nArsenal were dreadful in the first half and it was easy to think they had their minds on the Europa League quarter-final first leg against CSKA Moscow on Thursday night. But the roof fell in on Stoke after the first penalty and Paul Lambert could not hide the frustration.\n\n“I respect the referees,” the Stoke manager said. “I just think in big moments in big games, you have to be 100% sure. It was a game-changer. It was pretty soft.”\n\nMartins Indi said: “I touched the ball and it was not a penalty. The referee’s angle was not good enough. He said that I stretched my leg and made a foul. He needs to watch it again. The cameras don’t lie.”\n\nLambert made the point that moments earlier Xherdan Shaqiri had curled an inswinging corner against the far post. Not for the first time during his nine-match tenure, he and his team were on the wrong side of the finest of margins.\n\nIt should be said that Stoke’s lack of goals remains a huge concern – they have scored only four in eight matches. But there were pleasing aspects to the performance, particularly in the first half, in terms of their discipline and the platform they constructed to press into the final third.\n\n“I am still 100% confident we will stay up,” Lambert said. “The only thing missing from our game is Lady Luck.”\n\nArsenal’s preoccupation with the Europa League was reflected in Wenger’s lineup – he rested a clutch of players – and by that in the stands. There had been a virtual full house for the second leg of the Milan tie in the last 16 of Europe’s second-tier competition but there were thousands of empty seats here. It had been the same story for the previous home league fixtures against Watford and Manchester City. Wenger blamed the “family happening” of Easter Sunday but he did concede that the turn-out was influenced by the fact his team “don’t go for a lot in the league”.\n\nLambert went through agonies in the first half as Stoke worked a few promising breaks only to miss the final pass or dribble. Shaqiri bent a shot just wide on four minutes while Joe Allen caught the eye with his skills in tight areas, passing and pressing.\n\nAaron Ramsey managed a deft chip up and against the crossbar in the 24th minute but, that apart, it was lethargic stuff from Arsenal before the interval. Their game was marked by sloppiness and a lack of structure in attacking areas. Wenger said he felt “we could lose in the first half”.\n\nMohamed Elneny saw a shot blocked by Martins Indi in the 59th minute and Arsenal turned the screw with 20 minutes to go. Jack Butland denied Aubameyang one-on-one after Özil’s through-ball; Calum Chambers could not finish from a corner and it took the first penalty award to break Stoke. It was worrying to see how they folded thereafter. Ramsey rounded Butland but could not convert; the goalkeeper blocked from the substitute Henrikh Mkhitaryan and he also punched clear from Özil. From the corner, when the ball broke to Aubameyang, he cut across his shot to send it screaming past Butland.\n\nThe second penalty followed Badou Ndiaye’s barge on Lacazette.

Not since Gary Lineker wrestled himself free of a scrum of bodies at the far post to nod a late Nayim cross down and beyond Dave Beasant had their travelling fans, on an exposed terrace that afternoon in February 1990, been able to revel in this arena at Chelsea’s expense, or bounce their way gleefully through the post-match crowing while the locals skulked away.\n\nSpurs have since seen a title challenge wrecked, and far too many humiliations for comfort. Their team have been put to the sword almost as a matter of course, a succession of managers and lineups thrashed out of sight. In that context this must have felt exquisite, even before the extension of the gap from fifth to eight points – such a healthy advantage with seven games to play – had been taken into account. “I will celebrate the win like I celebrate any win,” said Mauricio Pochettino, whose half-hearted attempts to play down the achievement fooled no one. “But winning at Stamford Bridge again is a massive thing for our fans and for Tottenham.”\n\nIt was Dele Alli, born more than six years after this club’s last win in these parts and making his 100th top-flight appearance here, who capitalised on the hosts’ shortcomings to exorcise the ghosts of 27 winless visits to this stadium. Chelsea had been punctured by Christian Eriksen’s fine equaliser and never really recovered their poise, though it was Alli whose calm ruthlessness in front of goal put them to shame. Just after the hour a straight pass, lofted from inside the centre circle by Eric Dier, bypassed the hosts’ backline and the midfielder, darting into a hint of space between Andreas Christensen and César Azpilicueta, controlled wonderfully with his first touch and finished emphatically with his second.\n\nIt was a flash of brilliance to encapsulate the midfielder’s qualities, and a reminder of his capabilities after a difficult week with the national team. He celebrated it with gusto, cupping his ears to the Shed End as the abuse rained down – and he had more pain still to inflict. Four minutes later Eriksen’s cute flick sent Son Heung‑min sprinting beyond Marcos Alonso down the right. Willy Caballero smothered the South Korean’s attempt, but the ball was never properly cleared in the confusion which ensued. The goalkeeper and Christensen were unable to repel it from the goal mouth as Son attempted to hack it home, with Alli – a calm head amid the mayhem – eventually squeezing out enough space to prod away his shot from close range.\n\nHe has now been involved directly in 60 goals over his century of Premier League games. “People will still be disappointed with the way I played,” he said, “but I don’t think I had a point a point to prove. I just had to get in the starting XI and help the team.” In the end, Harry Kane was required for just the last 17 minutes, and his return from an ankle injury with the game already won almost felt like Pochettino taking his chance to rub Chelsea’s noses in it.\n\nThis had all been achieved as he sat with his feet up on the bench. That said much. Antonio Conte had kicked over a cage of drink bottles in his exasperation at the sloppiness at that concession, bemoaning the inability of inexperienced players to “shoot the ball into the stand”. This defeat will have scarred the Italian. That chasm to Spurs feels unbridgeable, and success in the FA Cup alone would appease neither the head coach nor the board. A slog of a season is heading towards a painful denouement. The divorce is imminent. Conte had actually spied promise in his team’s incision on the counterattack early on, and had seen them bask briefly in a lead when Hugo Lloris missed a punch at Victor Moses’s cross and Álvaro Morata guided a header easily into a gaping net.\n\nHad they retained that advantage at the interval then they might have prospered further on the break as anxiety mounted in opposition ranks. Yet sloppiness, not for the first time in recent weeks, ended up costing them in stoppage time at the end of the period, Moses surrendering possession weakly and deep inside Chelsea territory with the ball shifted to Eriksen, alone in a pocket of space around 25 yards out with N’Golo Kanté reluctant to engage. The Dane collected, sized up his options and belted a right-foot shot which Caballero initially thought would soar over his goal, only for the ball to dip viciously, kiss the underside of the crossbar and billow the net.\n\nThat was all it took to shatter the hosts’ conviction, reflecting the brittle confidence of a team who have now taken only 11 points from their 10 league games since the turn of the year. Spurs have plundered 27 from their 11 games in the same period, which reflects the shift in momentum. Chelsea’s entire project suddenly feels under scrutiny: the long-term planning; the reliance upon Champions League football; the levels of investment required in the squad; and, not least, the future of the head coach. The sight of Spurs progressing at their expense will have left the locals wincing.\n\nChelsea 1-3 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more"}, {"date": "31/03/2018", "arena":

after the final whistle Jürgen Klopp strode over to Liverpool’s travelling supporters and pumped his fist in delight – nothing new there but the gesture appeared to carry a little extra thrust, as if he recognised the significance of his side’s triumph.\n\nLiverpool were below par but showed the character they are often accused of lacking not only to shore up a top-four Premier League place but to secure a boost ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League match with Manchester City. It was a rare ugly win for one of Europe’s most thrilling sides and one that cynics would suggest they ultimately got away with.\n\nJesse Lingard shines as quickfire Manchester United cruise past Swansea Read more\n\nThis was because, as well as being frantic, this was a contest marked by controversy, namely the referee Neil Swarbrick’s decision not to show Sadio Mané a second yellow card after the forward, who had equalised for Liverpool after they had fallen behind to Luka Milivojevic’s first-half penalty, grabbed the ball outside Liverpool’s penalty area on 60 minutes following a challenge from Andros Townsend.\n\nMané expected to be given a free-kick but Swarbrick disagreed and awarded Crystal Palace one of their own, with a subsequent expectation among those in attendance that he would send off the Liverpool striker for handball having already booked him for simulation. But the official kept his cards in pocket, raising the ire of Crystal Palace’s players and fans, and their frustrations were increased on 84 minutes when Liverpool struck for a second time. The goalscorer? Who else – Mohamed Salah.\n\nIt is now 37 goals in a remarkable debut season for the Egyptian and, while he was far from his best here, the manner of Salah’s finish further underlined his talent. Lurking at the back post as Andrew Robertson delivered a first-time cross, the 25-year-old took the ball away from the sliding Mamadou Sakho with his left foot before firing the ball past Wayne Hennessey with his right. It was composed, calm and ruthless.\n\n“That’s what makes him a proper striker,” Klopp said. “If you only score when you have a perfect day, you can’t score all the games he has. He is outstanding. This game was hard work. Both teams were not at their best, so it was a question of who will shoot one more goal. It was us. I am pleased with that.”\n\nPlay Video 1:08 Jürgen Klopp hails Liverpool's 'fighting spirit' after win over Palace – video\n\nThat much could be detected by Klopp’s demeanour at the end and he was right to say Liverpool were not their usual selves. They lacked fluency in attack, cohesion in midfield and composure in defence, never more so than in the opening stages when Palace came at them with pace and purpose.\n\nWilfried Zaha was the chief tormentor and, having caused panic in Liverpool’s ranks as early as the eighth minute, he was at it again soon after, running on to Christian Benteke’s flick before being wiped out by Loris Karius having lifted the ball over the Liverpool goalkeeper. Swarbrick pointed to the spot and Milivojevic did the rest, drilling a low shot into the corner of the net to register his ninth goal of the season.\n\nLiverpool continued to dominate possession but they were struggling to carve out chances and that perhaps explains why Mané hit the turf in desperate fashion on 23 minutes. His leg was clipped by James McArthur but the contact was minimal.\n\nMarko Arnautovic double lifts West Ham and sinks Southampton Read more\n\n“Diving is without contact and there was contact, 100 per cent,” Klopp said. “He didn’t wait for contact – he felt it and everybody could see that.”\n\nKlopp admitted Mané was “lucky” not to be booked again following the handball – “I thought it was au revoir, see you later,” – and it did not come as a surprise when he substituted the player. It had been an erratic afternoon for Liverpool’s No 19 – a neat finish from James Milner’s 49th-minute cross but a display from which he ultimately needed saving.\n\nPalace responded well to conceding and would have taken the lead again had Benteke converted one of the hugely presentable chances that came his way in a matter of minutes. Liverpool then suffered the setback of seeing Adam Lallana go off five minutes after coming on as a substitute having landed awkwardly following a challenge with Milivojevic. Klopp described the midfielder’s injury as “really serious” yet, by the end, this was an occasion for him to savour.\n\nFor Roy Hodgson, it was a case of what could have been. The manager refused to blame Swarbrick for Palace’s fifth defeat in six league games, insisting he wanted to focus on “football watch and not referee watch”, adding: “A point was the minimum we deserved.”"}, {"date": "31/03/2018", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30629, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

appeared to be struggling even to go through the motions. Then Glenn Murray was given the perfect opportunity to fire the home team towards a victory that would have put a comforting distance between them and the relegation zone. But Kasper Schmeichel saved the striker’s penalty – and then the rest of the Leicester team sprung into action, Vicente Iborra and Jamie Vardy scoring a goal each to deepen Brighton’s anguish.\n\nTwo weeks ago Murray was dreaming about going to the World Cup with England. Now, after being left out of Gareth Southgate’s last squad, he must wonder whether his miss could be among the reasons for Brighton no longer being a Premier League club by the summer. There are teams in more precarious positions, of course, including Huddersfield, who visit Brighton next week. “It’s a massive game,” acknowledged the Brighton manager, Chris Hughton.\n\nBefore Schmeichel’s penalty save, Murray had spurned the best chance of the game, blasting wide from 10 yards after being put through by Pascal Gross in the first half. But the spot-kick failure was identified by both managers as the game’s turning point. “It gave them the lift that saw them go on to score,” lamented Hughton. “It was a great boost for us and the opposite for Brighton,” agreed the Leicester manager, Claude Puel.\n\nPuel had cut an angry figure for most of the match because his team were so sloppy. For long periods the only entertainment came from watching the normally even-tempered Frenchman build to a thunderous rage on the sidelines as his players repeatedly gave the ball away. On countless occasions Leicester got opportunities to spring counterattacks, only to abort the move by either over- or under-hitting an intended through-ball. Shinji Okazaki was a serial offender before being withdrawn in the 55th minute. Vardy was isolated. And Puel’s angry contortions in front of the dugout suggested he felt personally trolled. “We didn’t come back from the international break, I think,” said Puel of his team’s first-half slackness.\n\nBrighton, in greater need of three points, were more sprightly. Jürgen Locadia impressed on his first Premier League start since signing from PSV for more than £14m in January. Powerful and adroit, the Dutchman made several dangerous incursions down the right before he faded and was replaced in the 75th minute.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Glenn Murray’s penalty is saved by Leicester’s Kasper Schmeichel.

Harry Maguire was the culprit, giving possession to Murray, who scurried forward before lashing a shot just over from the edge of the box. Three minutes later Murray squandered a better chance, blasting wide from 10 yards after being sent through by Gross.\n\nJermain Defoe rescues late point for Bournemouth at Watford Read more\n\nLeicester improved after Fousseni Diabaté’s introduction in the 55th minute. They found a little more urgency and accuracy. But a Brighton substitute seemed to swing the game in the hosts’ favour in the 78th minute, when Solly March wriggled his way into the Leicester box before feeding José Izquierdo, who was brought down by Wilfred Ndidi. Murray stepped up to extend a hot streak that had seen him score six goals in his last eight matches. But Schmeichel, who came into this game in poor form, flung himself to his left to tip the shot away.\n\nFive minutes later Iborra struck, getting a strong downward header to a cross by Ben Chilwell. As Brighton hunted an equaliser, Ndidi was unlucky to be shown a second yellow card when Shane Duffy tumbled under a legitimate tackle. By this stage Duffy had shifted from defence to attack and Leicester exploited that fact in stoppage time, when Demarai Gray crossed for Vardy to stab in from close range."}, {"date": "31/03/2018",

100th Premier League goal and Alexis Sánchez rediscovered his finishing prowess, though this comfortable victory over slow-starting Swansea was about more than Manchester United’s expensive acquisitions.\n\nFollowing on from his excellent performance for England against Italy on Tuesday, Jesse Lingard was not just the star of another show, at times in this game he was running the show. Watching the 25-year-old lay on both United goals it was hard to believe he was considered peripheral a few months ago, or that his first-team appearances seemed likely to be rationed after the arrival of Sánchez.\n\nMo Salah earns Liverpool victory as Sadio Mané courts controversy Read more\n\nAt the moment it is Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial who are suffering that fate, the attacking pair once again on the bench, but there is no doubt that Lingard deserves his place in the side. From being a link-up figure with a useful sideline in spectacular goals, the Warrington-born player is fast becoming the go-to man. In the No 10 position with Sánchez and Juan Mata either side of him, Lingard occasionally finds himself occupying the same space as the other two, but United were at their most effective when he was calling for the ball in the middle then calling the shots with his unerring distribution.\n\nThe two first-half goals both came in that manner, with Lingard sending Lukaku through on goal after just five minutes, then doing the same favour for Sánchez with the help of an unwitting deflection off Federico Fernández that might have spared the Chilean an offside flag.\n\nSlick as United were in those opening stages, they were helped by some fairly naive defending, with Swansea trying and mostly failing the play a high line. Lukaku could have had another in the first half when Sánchez’s flick sent him clear, except this time the finish was not as instinctive and Lukasz Fabianski was able to save.\n\nLingard himself could have scored on a couple of occasions, first missing the target from an Antonio Valencia cross, then controlling a short pass from Lukaku to elegantly make space for a shot from the edge of the area but taking one touch too many to carry the ball too wide.\n\nCarlos Carvalhal’s response to a 2-0 interval deficit was to send on Tammy Abraham and Tom Carroll for the second half, closely followed by Wayne Routledge when Sam Clucas was injured.\n\nPlay Video 0:48 José Mourinho signals intent to finish second after victory over Swansea – video\n\nAbraham at least made a difference – David de Gea was given something to do for the first time in the match. The substitute twice tested the United goalkeeper early in the second half to discover that inactivity had not dulled his reactions. De Gea flew to his right to produce a one-handed save from Abraham’s initial shot on the turn, then got down low to make a more routine stop when the striker slightly scuffed an attempt from near the penalty spot.\n\nUnited were not sitting back, Sánchez and Mata both put difficult chances over the bar when found by Lukaku and Pogba respectively with their backs to goal, but in the second half Swansea looked more like their old selves, or perhaps their new selves since Carvalhal arrived to transform their chances of survival. All the same, Lukaku should have made the margin of victory more emphatic 10 minutes from the end when he took Pogba’s unselfish cross on his chest but fired straight at Fabianski from point-blank range.\n\nJermain Defoe rescues late point for Bournemouth at Watford Read more\n\nThe three points ensure United will go to Manchester City on Saturday in second place in the table – for a few hours after Liverpool’s win at Crystal Palace they were back in third – and José Mourinho insists that is a sign of progress. “We want to be the top team in the Premier League but that is not realistic this season,” the United manager said. “It is clear for everyone to see that this club is in a moment of transition, but we are 10 points better off than we were last season, we have scored more goals, and that first-half performance was almost perfect.\n\n“We should have killed the game in the first half, because in the second the intensity dropped, and I think you can blame the international games for that. We will now fight every match to stay in second.”\n\nSwansea continue to fight to reach safety, though Carvalhal was encouraged by the second-half improvement. “We struggled to control Pogba and [Nemanja] Matic in the first half,” he said. “We made a few adjustments in the second and Old Trafford would have been a nervous place but for two fantastic saves from De Gea.”"}, {"date":

right foot Ayoze Pérez pushed Newcastle within touching distance of Premier League survival and intensified Huddersfield’s relegation fears.\n\nDo not be deceived by the skinny scoreline; Rafael Benítez’s side deserved a win which showcased Jonjo Shelvey’s claims to an England playmaking spot on a day when David Wagner’s players seemed to have run out of ideas and adrenaline.\n\nWest Brom look booked for relegation as Chris Wood goal seals win for Burnley Read more\n\n“Huddersfield are well organised and dangerous on the counterattack,” said Benítez who, perhaps significantly, did not find a place on the bench for the previously influential but latterly out-of-sorts Mikel Merino. “But I told the players to stay calm and a chance would come.”\n\nWhen it did, it lifted Newcastle to 12th, seven points clear of the drop zone. Benítez’s side now have 35 points, four more than Huddersfield but Wagner remains optimistic that his team can also survive.\n\n“We wanted to frustrate Newcastle and minimise their chances,” said the German. “It was defensively one of our best performances and this gives me enough confidence for the future. But we deserved at least a point for the great defending and great attitudes my players have shown.”\n\nThe first half was punctuated by much nervous defending from an edgy Huddersfield as they were hit by wave upon wave of Newcastle attacks. Fortunately for the visitors, Benítez’s players were more than a little anxious themselves, their desperation to claim an early goal reflected in considerable snatching at the ball as pass after pass was rushed.\n\nAs a result, bar Jonas Lössl watching a Shelvey shot whizz past a post and then doing extremely well to divert Matt Ritchie’s goalbound effort with his feet, Wagner’s goalkeeper was surprisingly under-employed at St James’ Park.\n\nJonathan Hogg found the going particularly tough against Shelvey and Mo Diamé. His consequent frustration was manifested by a booking for a foul on Pérez, which led to the concession of a free-kick, from which the industrious Dwight Gayle sent a clever lob over the advancing Lössl before watching it drift narrowly wide of an upright. Gayle subsequently connected with DeAndre Yedlin’s cross only to shoot fractionally too high.\n\nIf Shelvey’s repertoire of vision-fuelled, defence-splitting passes lifted the gloom on an unseasonably cold, extremely wet Tyneside afternoon - which saw Benítez unusually, and strangely reluctantly, resort to wearing a coat - Laurent Depoitre symbolised Huddersfield’s travails.\n\nIsolated, he did his best to defend from the front but, generally, had a solitary timeand foraged ever deeper for possession.\n\nAs the hour mark approached, though, Depoitre issued the defence with a warning. Belying his imposing physical bulk, he swivelled before dragging a low shot just wide. Newcastle were losing control of the tempo and allowing opponents who had previously appeared incapable of stringing two passes together back into things.\n\nMarko Arnautovic double lifts West Ham and sinks Southampton Read more\n\nThe time had come for the lesser-spotted Islam Slimani’s long-awaited debut. Sure enough, in the 75th minute Benítez’s hitherto injured £2m January loan signing from Leicester, pulled on a pair of woolly black gloves and stepped off the bench to replace Gayle.\n\nWithin minutes Slimani had a hand in Pérez’s goal. The Algeria striker served as a nuisance value filled decoy, distracting Lössl before the Spaniard directed the ball low into the bottom corner from close range following Christian Atsu’s cross and Kenedy’s unselfish, quietly brilliant, short flicked pass. Appropriately Pérez had begun the move courtesy of a glorious pass to Atsu dispatched with the outside of his boot.\n\nAlmost imperceptibly the skies above Gallowgate switched from slate grey to

have 37 points and I don’t know how many points you will need at the end of the season to remain in the Premier League,” Gracia said.\n\n“Maybe this will be enough, but never mind about the points, I focus on the next three points and how to get them.”\n\nHowe concurred with his counterpart, adding: “With six games to go we just want to get as many points as possible.”"}, {"date": "31/03/2018",

seat on the plane to Russia. Before Chris Wood sealed an unwanted club-record eighth successive Premier League defeat for West Bromwich Albion, his strike-partner, Ashley Barnes, scored a spectacular acrobatic overhead-kick – his fourth goal in as many games – to keep the Somerset-born striker, capped by Austria at Under-20 level but eligible for England, dreaming for club and country.\n\nAt this rate, Burnley are on course for a seventh-place finish and securing an unlikely spot in the Europa League, should one of Chelsea, Manchester United or Tottenham Hotspur lift the FA Cup. “We’re all going on a European tour,” echoed deliriously from the away end as a sparse Hawthorns emptied before the final whistle. This latest damning defeat condemned them to a ninth straight defeat in all competitions for the first time since 1996.\n\nMo Salah earns Liverpool victory as Sadio Mané courts controversy Read more\n\nSalomón Rondón struck late on to give them the smallest glimmer of hope but they remain marooned at the foot of the table, 10 points from safety with just six games to play. Things are looking rosy for Sean Dyche’s side, though. James Tarkowski, Jack Cork and Nick Pope have been included in squads by Southgate in recent months and, with seemingly one place in attack still up for grabs, there may be room for one more yet.\n\n“I think he continues to adapt to the challenge and his game improves season-on-season with us,” Dyche said of Barnes, after his 100th win as Burnley manager. “With football, everyone wants it yesterday but it’s not that easy. Year-on-year, he keeps developing, learning and improving, and he’s another one that keeps doing that with us.”\n\nPardew insisted the international break refreshed his players but his side’s first-half display was abject, and, even before Barnes’ wondrous strike, the home crowd was painfully flat. When Rondón passed the ball straight out of play, Pardew was among those who could do little but grimace. A penny for the thoughts of the chief executive, Mark Jenkins, present here in the directors’ box, who this week expressed his shock at the state of the club’s finances, given they will need to lean on an overdraft for the first time in 10 years. The reaffirming thing is that the club are at least readying themselves for the inevitable event of relegation. Lifeless until just before the interval, when Rondón forced Pope into a low left-handed save and Jay Rodriguez mustered an effort at goal, Pardew sought a change of personnel, introducing Matt Phillips.\n\nJesse Lingard shines as quickfire Manchester United cruise past Swansea Read more\n\nVery little changed for West Brom until Rondón’s strike on 83 minutes, when Burnley were caught daydreaming in defence. The striker drilled home and West Brom suddenly discovered a sense of urgency as the game came to a climax with Brunt driving wide from Phillips’s cross but it was simply too little too late.\n\n“That team was not not trying,” said Pardew, who also confirmed the injured Gareth Barry had not breached any curfews after being pictured at a Birmingham nightclub on Friday night. “They were just nervous and under massive pressure. I sympathise with them a little bit but part of me is going: ‘You have got to be stronger than that.’ The only thing I would say for our fans, really, is that I hope they understand that a little bit.”"}, {"date": "31/03/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56882, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

"What a relief it was for the West Ham hierarchy that the only boos at the London Stadium floated out of the away end. There were no pitch invasions, no missiles thrown at the directors’ box. David Gold and David Sullivan were able to keep Sir Trevor Brooking company until the final whistle this time and if there was a hint of mutiny, it came from the Southampton fans who watched their bedraggled team sink closer towards the Championship on an afternoon when the hosts found a way to keep their bitter civil war hidden from their guests.\n\nOf course, it should be pointed out that Southampton did not even begin to flirt with the idea of testing the strength of West Ham’s truce. Mark Hughes’s side wilted in the face of some vintage East End defiance, collapsing in wretched fashion in the opening 45 minutes and wasting a fine opportunity to move out of the bottom three at the expense of their opponents.\n\nAyoze Pérez’s late strike helps Newcastle add to Huddersfield worries Read more\n\nDavid Moyes could not have asked for a better response from his players. The mavericks in his team rose to the occasion, with Marko Arnautovic and João Mário tearing the visitors to shreds, and the victory moved them five points above Southampton, who are two behind 17th-placed Crystal Palace with seven matches left.\n\nOne look around this unloved stadium was enough to revive memories of the pitch invasions and protests that marred the Burnley game. Stewards in bright yellow jackets lined the perimeter of the pitch, there was a sizeable police presence inside the ground and barriers below the directors’ box were intended to stop supporters from getting too close to Gold and Sullivan, West Ham’s unpopular owners.\n\nThe operation added £60,000 to the security bill, which was footed by taxpayers, and amid all the focus on events in the stands it was almost possible to forget that a game of football was taking place. It began in a lively atmosphere, signalling the crowd’s determination to remain supportive, and West Ham tore into the early challenges, rattling Southampton with energetic pressing.\n\nMark Hughes picked an attacking 4-4-2 for his first league game, with Charlie Austin fit enough to start up front for the first time since tearing a hamstring on 23 December, but Southampton’s lack of intensity in midfield and organisation in defence in the first half was startling. West Ham roared forward and took the lead when Mario Lemina cheaply lost possession in the 13th minute, allowing Cheikhou Kouyaté to charge down the right and find Mário, who controlled before walloping a brilliant shot past Alex McCarthy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joao Mario’s effort beats Alex McCarthy in the Southampton goal to put West Ham ahead. Photograph: Victoria Jones/PA\n\nMário’s first goal since arriving on loan from Internazionale in January shocked the visitors. West Ham’s bench contained four players without a single Premier League start and Moyes could have done without an inconsolable Michail Antonio limping off in the ninth minute, especially with Andy Carroll, Manuel Lanzini and Javier Hernández already unavailable. Yet Southampton were too feeble to expose those weaknesses.\n\nArnautovic had already spurned one glorious opportunity, screwing a shot wide after being released by Mark Noble, but the forward’s eighth goal of the season arrived in the 17th minute. The marking from Wesley Hoedt and Jack Stephens left much to be desired when Mário crossed from the right and although McCarthy saved Arnautovic’s initial header, the Austrian bundled in the rebound.\n\nWest Brom look booked for relegation as Chris Wood goal seals win for Burnley Read more\n\nHughes looked disgusted on the touchline. Pierre-Emile Højbjerg and Lemina were overrun in midfield, Dusan Tadic and Nathon Redmond sunk into their shells on the flanks and Southampton’s fans greeted Jon Moss’s half-time whistle with jeers.\n\nIn Southampton’s defence, perhaps it was simply their misfortune to be caught in the middle of Arnautovic’s feud with Hughes. Arnautovic enraged the former Stoke City manager when he inspired West Ham to a 3-0 victory over his old side in December and he was at it his cocky best here, scoring his second in added time with a spectacular volley. A deep cross from Arthur Masuaku, who impressed at left wing-back after returning from a six-match ban for spitting, hung in the air and Arnautovic’s vicious effort flew past McCarthy.\n\nShane Long replaced Manolo Gabbiadini at half-time, but Southampton did nothing to test Joe Hart’s brittle confidence.

Victory number 27 was delivered in style and comfort at Everton to leave Pep Guardiola’s team one win from a third championship in seven seasons. The Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium next Saturday could realise a dream for the blue half of the city, the stuff of nightmares for the red.\n\nA Champions League quarter-final first leg at Liverpool beckons before then but City were not distracted from completing a clean sweep of triumphs over Premier League sides this season as they brushed aside Sam Allardyce’s team at Goodison Park. David Silva was magnificent, Fernandinho imperious and Leroy Sané, Gabriel Jesus plus Raheem Sterling scored before half-time to extend City’s haul to a remarkable 84 points from 31 matches. No other team has collected so many points at this stage of a season. Few have cruised towards a championship in such style. Securing the title with victory over José Mourinho’s United would be a fitting way to complete a campaign of total domestic dominance.\n\nPep Guardiola: City must focus on European tie before United title game Read more\n\n“Manchester United, Arsenal but after that, no,” said Allardyce, when asked whether he had witnessed a better Premier League side than the champions-elect. “You try to do something to stop them but they can play around anything. That’s the beauty of this team. Brilliant. I’m gutted, but they were brilliant.” They were also sportingly applauded off by a home crowd that heard their manager call for belief before kick-off only for their team to play without any. Everton appeared resigned to chasing maroon shadows from the start. With good reason too: they were comprehensively outplayed by a vastly superior team and two goals down inside 12 minutes, both as a result of devastatingly swift and precise City attacks.\n\nThe visitors set course for victory – Guardiola’s first over Everton – with 238 seconds on the clock. Silva was the architect and, in doing so, became the third City player to reach double figures for assists this season after Kevin De Bruyne (15) and Sané (11). Silva’s immaculate touch and awareness were evident as he found Aymeric Laporte on the left. He immediately darted into the area and, taking a perfectly weighted return pass in his stride, lofted the ball to the back post where Sané volleyed beyond Jordan Pickford. The procession, the exhibition, was underway.\n\nGuardiola had selected Laporte, the second-most expensive defender in world football, at left-back with Fabian Delph easing his way back from injury and Danilo on the substitutes’ bench. Everton had occasional joy when targeting the former Athletic Bilbao centre-half and it requires no stretch of the imagination to suspect Liverpool and Mohamed Salah will target that area with greater quality on Wednesday. City are unlikely to meet such passive, feeble and vulnerable opponents on their return to Merseyside.\n\nYannick Bolasie should have levelled when Dominic Calvert-Lewin escaped behind Laporte and crossed for the winger to head wastefully over. “The cruel turning point,” claimed Allardyce. Bolasie still had his head in his hands when City swept down the other end and doubled their lead.\n\nEderson drilled the resulting goal-kick to Sané in central midfield. The Germany international flicked the ball over Morgan Schneiderlin and cushioned a volley out to De Bruyne on the right. One glance across goal was enough for De Bruyne to know where Jesus was heading and, from another inch-perfect delivery, the Brazilian powered a header past Pickford at close range.\n\nGoodison was witnessing a gulf in class but, even taking that into account, the home crowd did not disguise its displeasure at the lack of fight and organisation from those in royal blue. Silva, Sterling and Kyle Walker went close before City cut Everton apart once again with the speed and accuracy of their passing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raheem Sterling scores Manchester City’s third goal. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nFernandinho, who would complete 62 passes in the first half (the entire Everton team completed 64), released Silva down the left and the Spaniard swept a low cross along the face of Everton’s recovering defence. Sterling sprinted ahead of Leighton Baines, making his 400th Premier League appearance, and gave the over-worked Pickford no chance with a powerful finish.\n\n“We’ll win the league on derby day” sang the travelling faithful, and they were also able to revel in a rival’s misery in the present. Wayne Rooney enjoyed numerous successes against City during his Old Trafford career but this was an evening to endure. Deployed alongside fellow ex-United man Schneiderlin in central midfield the former England captain was repeatedly overrun before being withdrawn to his obvious disgust and the away section’s delight early in the second half. His replacement, Tom Davies, helped spark much-needed improvement.\n\nIt was Davies’s challenge that enabled the home side to retain possession and pressurise the City defence for the first time after the restart. Calvert-Lewin, switched from the No 10 role to central midfield, found Bolasie and his low drive crept beyond Ederson and in via the inside of a post.\n\nGoodison briefly sensed a recovery, or at least something resembling a contest, but Guardiola’s gifted team quashed that notion by controlling the tempo and the ball.

West Brom have been resigned to it for a while but an eighth successive defeat was further shattering evidence that the club will be playing Championship football in August. After failing to see out what would have been a rare win Pardew’s men are 10 points from safety with seven games remaining.\n\nA tendency for West Brom to undo their hard work has blighted them all season and did so again here as Ben Foster was caught cold by Jordon Ibe’s swerving effort on a biting afternoon on the south coast before Junior Stanislas’s postage-stamp free-kick sealed victory two minutes from time.\n\nLuka Milivojevic seals vital win for Crystal Palace at Huddersfield Read more\n\nIn reality squandering leads is only a small slice of a fairly miserable story. The manner of this defeat, after a spirited if unspectacular performance, left the Albion manager deflated.\n\n“I am under contract here for another three years and we have got to keep fighting,” said Pardew, who denied there is a release clause in his contract in the event of relegation. “I keep saying it to my players: we have got to keep showing pride in what you do, and I will keep doing that until such time I am told not to.”\n\nPardew’s men have dropped 24 points from winning positions – more than any other team in the division – and sustained that miserable trend after Bournemouth rallied to ensure Jay Rodriguez’s opener, coming after smart work by Salomón Rondón, was worth nothing. Asked if his team have left themselves with too much to do, Pardew said: “If you look at our record since the start of the year, you would have to say yes but, of course, we have to keep battling on. It’s getting near last-chance saloon so we needed to get something today.”\n\nA comical first half punctuated by a couple of half-hearted penalty claims passed without any real incident but four minutes into the second half Rodriguez smashed home from close range. Bournemouth looked as though they were going to be punished for a lax display until they sprung into life when Ibe’s devious effort from distance eluded Foster down to his left. That goal set up a grandstand finale. When Craig Dawson felled Joshua King 25 yards from goal, Stanislas stepped up to sink Albion with a peach of a free-kick.\n\nAn exasperated shake of the head by Pardew as Charlie Daniels, the Bournemouth defender, hacked off the line from the substitute Matt Phillips with seconds left said it all. For Bournemouth, who now fly to Dubai for a warm-weather training camp, this victory makes a fourth successive season in the top flight look ever more likely. “We had to dig very deep and it was the hardest way [to win] but I’ll take any way at this stage of the season,” said Eddie Howe."}, {"date": "17/03/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 23980, "home_team": {"name":

A first-half goal by James Tomkins followed by a second-half penalty by Luka Milivojevic lifted Roy Hodgson’s team out of the relegation zone and to within a point of Huddersfield, who had hoped to distance themselves from the squabbling near the bottom of the table but instead remain in the fray after an uncharacteristically tepid display.\n\nThe only downside for Hodgson was that midfielder Jeffrey Schlupp was forced off with a twisted ankle in the 20th minute. Wilfried Zaha limped off one minute from time but the manager said that was because of “little knocks and a bit of fatigue” rather than anything more serious. That is a boon for Palace because Zaha performed with typical class on his first start after a five-week layoff.\n\nPalace travelled to west Yorkshire on the back of a seven-game winless streak but apparently full of confidence, the returns of Zaha and Mamadou Sakho, plus of substitutes Yohan Cabaye and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, giving them extra cause for optimism. Hodgson ordered his team to attack from the outset.\n\nBournemouth’s Junior Stanislas sends West Brom toward brink with stunner Read more\n\nBarely one minute had elapsed before a corner by Milivojevic provoked mayhem in the home box. Huddersfield scrambled it away but were less vigilant when Milivojevic delivered another in the 23rd minute.\n\nSteve Mounié’s attempt to clear at the near post amounted to nothing more than an embarrassing decoy that duped his own team-mates, allowing the ball to run through to Tomkins. Jonas Lössl made an instinctive close-range save from Tomkins’ first shot but was helpless to prevent the Palace defender from poking the rebound into the net.\n\nPalace had already threatened from open play, their fleet of tricky dribblers making constant mischief. Zaha, inevitably, was the peskiest. When he pounced on a loose ball in the 18th minute he slalomed between two opponents and dabbed a nice pass through to Christian Benteke, whose shot brought a brilliant block from Christopher Schindler, who had earlier made a similar one to deflect a shot by Zaha over.\n\nDavid Wagner’s side began hunting an equaliser, but lacked precision. Palace’s centre-backs, Tomkins and Sakho, easily repelled a succession of hopeful crosses. Tom Ince made no progress against Palace’s impressive young right-back, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, before being replaced on the hour. By then Huddersfield still had not mustered a dangerous shot. They might have been two goals behind if Benteke had been awarded a penalty after Mathias Jorgensen wrapped an arm around him in the box.\n\nMoments later Tomkins nearly scored again when another corner found its way to him via a weak header by Jorgensen. But this time Mounié rescued his team, booting his shot off the line. Mounié then came close to doubling the value of that block by scoring at the other end, but he flashed a snapshot just wide after a good cross by Florent Hadergjonaj.\n\nPalace secured the points in the 68th minute after Jorgensen sabotaged a counterattack by upending Andros Townsend. Miliovjevic sent Lössl the wrong way from the spot.\n\n“Credit to Palace, they deserved to win but we had a big part in that because we were below par,” admitted Wagner. “If you can put immediate pressure on them, then their speed is not a threat.

Everton’s Cenk Tosun met the challenge here, claiming a second-half brace to earn victory for the visitors in a tempest of snow.\n\nStoke’s prospects of avoiding relegation worsened with the weather and they will feel aggrieved at this defeat. The Potters had Charlie Adam sent off in the first half during treacherous conditions. They also fought their way back into the match from one down, with Tosun’s opener itself prompting suspicions of offside. But a diving header from the Turkish international in the 84th minute proved the game’s decisive action.\n\nAdam was sent off for the fourth time in the Premier League after sliding in on Wayne Rooney on the half-hour. The contact was not great but the tackle, especially given the surface, looked reckless. Paul Lambert accepted the decision after the match but railed against the lack of an intervention in Everton’s opener.\n\n“I can understand why Martin Atkinson has given it‚” he said. “If you’re going in with studs in the modern game, you put yourself in a position. So I can understand that. But their first goal is offside. The linesman’s got to see that. How he’s missed that I don’t know.”\n\nFor Sam Allardyce there was no doubt about the red card: “It looked dangerous‚” he said. But with Everton recording their first away victory in the league for three months, Allardyce was happy to concentrate on more positive aspects of the match, such as the performance of Tosun, his £27m January recruit from Beşiktaş.\n\n“It’s because of the quality of our frontman that we’ve won the game”, Allardyce said. “He’s adapting much quicker than lots of front men who come to the Premier League from abroad. He’s got the whole array of finishing in his locker; right foot, left foot, head. It also looks like he’s got the knack of being in the right place at the right time, which you can’t coach.”\n\nStoke looked as if they had stabilised after losing Adam, and Everton as if the match was passing them by until Tosun scored his third goal in as many games in the 69th minute. He looked offside in the first movement on a Rooney set-piece, his header then turned away by Jack Butland. Dominic Calvert-Lewin drove the ball back in again, however, and when Butland parried once more, Tosun forced home the rebound.\n\nLambert responded by going on the attack, bringing on Saido Berahino alongside Peter Crouch and replacing Ramadan Sobhi with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting. The changes paid off quickly as Stoke equalised from their own set piece, Joe Allen swinging the ball to the back post, where Choupo-Moting bundled home.\n\nChoupo-Moting was immediately forced off with a groin injury which he sustained as he scored, and five minutes later Everton won the match. Theo Walcott had time to shape a cross to the penalty spot and Tosun buried it with a diving header.\n\nStoke face Arsenal and Tottenham next, with a gap of three points between themselves and safety. “The effort and commitment was spot on from the players‚” Lambert said. “But it was a game that we lost and they’re certainly down in the dressing room.”"}, {"date": "17/03/2018", "arena": "Anfield",

In a season containing nearly as many superlative descriptions as goals scored, Mohamed Salah continued to write his own Liverpool destiny with four superb finishes in a personal performance at Anfield that was as complete and as ruthless as anything this famous stadium has seen down the decades.\n\nWatford will have returned home last night wondering how they were on the end of such a sobering scoreline. They were by no means a shambles. Yet, in sport, ability generally finds a way of shining through and Salah’s class is so clearcut, so emphatic and so enjoyable that he is comfortably the Premier League’s most attractive sight at present.\n\nLiverpool 5-0 Watford: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe really frightening thing was he barely broke sweat – his goals completely dismantled Watford yet he maintained a relaxed, smiley air throughout.\n\nTwo of his goals carried the same jinking manner and positional nous as that displayed by Lionel Messi, and Jürgen Klopp noted that Salah’s form this season is making comparisons between the two increasingly valid.\n\n“I think Mo is on the way [to being the best in the world],” Klopp said. “In a way that’s good. I don’t think Mo or anybody else wants to be compared with Lionel Messi. He is the one who is doing what he’s doing for what feels like 20 years or so.\n\n“The last player [before Messi] I know who had the same influence on a team performance was Diego Maradona, another Argentinian. Mo is in a fantastic way, that’s for sure. As it always is in life if you have to have the skills, you have to show that constantly. Consistently he is very good and he helps us a lot.\n\n“Conditions were difficult. It was obviously slippery and everybody suffered, but not Mo in that situation. It was really special.”\n\nThe joie de vivre that Salah both played with and provoked was evident from as early as the third minute when he gave Liverpool a lead they never once looked like losing.\n\nSalah’s remarkable season began with a goal against Watford on the opening day of the campaign, and it continued with aplomb here as he latched onto a Sadio Mané ball, bamboozled Miguel Britos to such an extent that he eventually fell over, and then calmly threaded past Orestis Karnezis.\n\nThe goal meant Watford’s parsimonious gameplan lay in tatters but, to their credit, they did manage to keep Liverpool relatively quiet for the remainder of the first half – although Roberto Firmino was denied what would have been a stunning second goal when his 20-yard shot was superbly stopped by Karnezis.\n\nLiverpool would not be denied for long, though. Just before the break they again swarmed forward and when the ebullient and rock-steady Andy Robertson delivered a pinpoint cross to Salah in the middle of the six-yard box, the Egyptian could not miss.\n\nLiverpool’s Jürgen Klopp fumes about ‘breakfast’ kick-off for Merseyside derby Read more\n\nAfter the restart Liverpool’s attacking prowess became ever more concentrated, never more so than when Firmino backheeled in a cross from close range to make it 3-0 after 49 minutes.\n\nWho provided the cross? The scorer of the first two goals – indeed Salah was the answer to virtually every question as he continued to expunge all memories of his difficult afternoon at Old Trafford the previous Saturday.\n\nThe horrendous conditions then played their part in the second half flattening out, but even that will have pleased Klopp. There were few of the defensive wobbles here that have so often punctured his side’s self-belief, and little complacency was to be found. Aided and abetted by Watford’s reluctance to try anything remotely attacking, Liverpool consolidated and then smelt further blood in the water.\n\nWith 13 minutes remaining, Salah sealed his hat-trick as he somehow managed to thread the ball into the back of the net while simultaneously falling over. When he thrashed home his fourth, and his side’s fifth, from 10 yards out with five minutes left, his afternoon was complete.\n\n“We know we play against one of the best teams in Europe at this moment and they were much better than us,” Javi Gracia said of his Watford team afterwards. It was just about the only thing the visitors got right all day.\n\nSalah, now with 36 goals to his name for his club this season, can do no wrong."}, {"date": "12/03/2018", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium",

their flight to Abu Dhabi last night enjoying the view from the top of the Premier League, 16 points clear of Manchester United once again, and safe in the knowledge they can wrap up the title against their neighbours on 7 April if they win at Everton the weekend before.\n\nManchester City must feel like they are within touching distance of that crown after David Silva delivered another midfield masterclass on an evening when Pep Guardiola’s side cantered to their 26th league win of the season to leave Stoke mired in relegation trouble. Returning to the team after being allowed compassionate leave to spend time with his wife in Spain, where the couple’s prematurely born son continues to receive medical attention, Silva scored two splendid goals and was a joy to watch throughout.\n\nRaheem Sterling set up the first and Gabriel Jesus, who started up front in place of the injured Sergio Agüero, created the second as a cold night in Stoke presented few problems for a City side who will be guaranteed a warm welcome in more ways than one when they touch down in the middle east.\n\nDid Upton Park die for this? – Football Weekly Read more\n\nWith eight matches remaining, City have already accumulated more points than they did in the whole of last season and this was another of those occasions when the opposition were only allowed fleeting glimpses of the ball. The visitors were dominant from the outset and although Paul Lambert took consolation from the fact Stoke “never capitulated” in the way they in October, when City put seven past them at the Etihad, the truth is the margin of victory could easily have been much wider.\n\nCity were more forgiving than normal in front of goal, with Sterling guilty of squandering a couple of excellent second-half chances against a Stoke side who showed plenty of endeavour but offered little in the way of an attacking threat in a game that always felt like an exercise in damage limitation.\n\n“We are very close now,” said Guardiola, looking a picture of relaxation as he reflected on City’s commanding position. “We have 81 points, which is a lot. I understand it is important to our fans to win it against United but the target is the next game at Everton. After that, if we play like today, sooner or later we will be champions.”\n\nGuardiola was full of praise for Silva, who made it sound as though stepping on to the pitch is a form of escape for him at the moment when it comes to his personal life. “When I play football I forget about everything else,” he said. “My private life is very hard for me but my son is fighting and getting better.”\n\nPlay Video 0:48 Guardiola insists it doesn't matter when Manchester City win the title – video\n\nSilva’s opening goal, with only 10 minutes gone, was beautifully constructed and showed Guardiola’s team at their elegant best. Sterling played a pass infield to Fernandinho that the winger got back via a terrific reverse ball from Jesus. With space to run into on the right flank, Sterling scampered forward and delivered a cross that was so perfectly weighted that Silva, arriving into the penalty area between Kurt Zouma and Moritz Bauer, did not have to break his stride. Expertly opening up his body and letting the ball run across him, the midfielder coolly dispatched a left-foot shot beyond Jack Butland.\n\nStoke were pinned in for long periods, yet they could easily have equalised in the 21st minute when Badou Ndiaye, running on to Xherdan Shaqiri’s cut-back, swept a low shot that took a slight deflection off Fernandinho to take the ball the wrong side of the post.\n\nAlthough there was another moment of consternation for City when Ederson tipped Kyle Walker’s clearance over the bar, it always felt like a matter of time before Stoke conceded again.\n\nThat moment arrived five minutes after the restart and once again it was a terrific passage of play that carved Stoke open. Exchanging passes with Jesus on the edge of the penalty area, Silva showed wonderful composure to hook a bouncing ball past Butland, who had dashed from his line.\n\nAs Guardiola and his players head off into the sunshine, Stoke have another big home game to prepare for, with Everton the visitors on Saturday.\n\nStoke have won only one of their past 11 league games, with this defeat leaving them second from bottom and badly in need of three points against Everton to boost their survival prospects.\n\n“City are as good a team as I’ve seen in a long time,” Lambert said. “But this game was never going to define our season.”"}, {"date": "11/03/2018", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59131, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

was the game between the games that matter for Arsenal and for long spells there was a stuffed Sunday lunch feeling to it all. But it turned into something palatable for Arsène Wenger – a comfortable Emirates Stadium win decorated by second‑ half flickers from the January signings Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang.\n\nMkhitaryan played in Aubameyang to make it 2-0 and, after Petr Cech had saved a penalty from the pantomime villain, Troy Deeney, Aubameyang teed up Mkhitaryan to finish for 3-0.\n\nArsenal 3-0 Watford: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nArsenal’s focus has shifted from the Premier League to the Europa League, which has come to represent their only route into the Champions League next season and they are back here on Thursday night for the second leg of the last-16 tie against Milan in which they are 2-0 up from the first leg.\n\nWenger’s team selection had reflected his changing priorities. He rested Laurent Koscielny, who he said had a slight calf problem, and Aaron Ramsey, while Jack Wilshere and Calum Chambers were used as second‑half substitutes. The latter replaced Shkodran Mustafi – the scorer of the opening goal – who limped off with a groin problem, which will be assessed on Monday.\n\nThe game had been framed, to some extent, by Deeney’s headline-grabbing comment from last October, when he questioned the cojones of the Arsenal players after Watford’s victory against them at Vicarage Road. He was the one that failed to measure up on this occasion. Deeney put his head down and blasted the penalty only for Cech to stick out a hand and beat the ball away. Schadenfreude barely covered it.\n\nIt helped Cech to his 200th Premier League clean sheet – a milestone he has waited some time to bring up. The 199th had come in the 1-0 home win over Newcastle United on 16 December. It had been the longest run of his career – 11 games – without a clean sheet. The 35-year-old was at fault for both concessions in the 2-1 defeat at Brighton last Sunday, which had followed Arsenal’s defeats against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final and the league.\n\n“It’s quite fortunate the penalty save was against Deeney,” Wenger said with a smile, before he considered whether Deeney’s comments had served to motivate his players. “All these things come in always a little bit. How much I don’t know but, of course, it plays a part. Cech’s situation shows how football is. In one week he went from hell to heaven.”\n\nIt is debatable whether the Arsenal support have ascended to such a peak after this win and the Emirates was once again pockmarked by empty seats – a sign of the dissatisfaction at the club’s direction under Wenger. The manager said that the stay-aways were “understandable” after the “nightmare week” they had endured with the City defeats and the one against Brighton and he was unsurprisingly keen to dismiss it as a blip.\n\n“We have some work to do but overall we are in a good way,” Wenger said. “This gets us out a little bit of that negative spiral we were in. There’s a lot of negativity. It’s like the rain in England – it’s easy to get. I focus on my job. I’ve shown in 22 years I can do that.”\n\nMustafi gave Arsenal an early lead when he eased into a seam between Adrian Mariappa and José Holebas to head home Mesut Özil’s free-kick, while Watford were indebted to Orestis Karnezis for first-half one-on-one saves from Aubameyang and Özil. Aubameyang also stretched for a Sead Kolasinac cross but could not quite get there.\n\nWatford should have been level at the interval on the balance of chances and there was the nagging sense that Arsenal’s patched-up backline had an error in them; that a ball in behind would expose them. Wenger reported that Héctor Bellerín (knee) and Nacho Monreal (back) could return against Milan.\n\nCech saved from Abdoulaye Doucouré and Richarlison while, between times, the goalkeeper pushed out a Richarlison free-kick to present Roberto Pereyra with an inviting chance. He blazed off target. Cech was not entirely convincing when asked to get down low with any degree of speed.\n\nAubameyang’s short Arsenal career has not been characterised by the work he has done away from the penalty box.

There was a battling victory for the visitors to enjoy, one that moved them up to third and allowed all concerned to clear their heads following their eviction from the Champions League by Juventus last Wednesday. But a gloomy afternoon on the south coast was not without a gloomy moment, namely the injury to Harry Kane that threatens to rule Spurs’ top scorer out for the rest of the season and places questions over his involvement at the World Cup.\n\nThe prognosis does not look good given he departed the stadium with the aid of crutches and a protective boot following a collision with Asmir Begovic. The pair tangled in the 34th minute as Kane converted a cross only to be ruled offside, with his right ankle taking the brunt of the impact.\n\nMauricio Pochettino confirmed the 24-year-old has twisted the joint but refused to put a timescale on the striker’s absence before assessing the results of a scan on Monday. Tottenham’s manager insisted Kane was in a positive mood but the player’s reaction when he left the pitch would suggest otherwise. Having received treatment, the usually mild-mannered Kane threw a water bottle to the ground in frustration as he made his way down the tunnel.\n\nThat is understandable given the deja vu nature of the injury. Kane hurt the same ankle on two occasions last season, in September and in March, missing 14 games as a result. Tottenham have a maximum of 11 games left to play this season, with the FA Cup and Champions League qualification still to play for. The worst possible outcome is a grim one, then, with a Cup quarter-final against Swansea City next up followed by a visit to fellow top-four contenders Chelsea. And that is before England’s friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy this month are taken into account. Gareth Southgate names his squad for those games on Thursday and will surely be without the forward. The worry for him is that Kane’s absence from international duty will be even more protracted.\n\nMore will be known after his scan and until then Tottenham would be wise to focus on the positives. As Pochettino said, his players needed to show a reaction following their midweek heartbreak and they did just that, recovering from Junior Stanislas’s early goal to stretch their unbeaten domestic run to 17 matches. While the scoreline may ultimately have flattered Spurs, victory did not and it bodes well for them that this was another occasion in which Son Heung-min shone having taken Kane’s position in attack after the striker’s withdrawal.\n\nThe South Korean led the line with his usual mix of hard running and clever movement, scoring twice in the process to take his tally for the season to 17 in all competitions. Pochettino described Son’s display as fantastic and on this form there is no reason why he cannot spearhead Tottenham’s attack for however long Kane is out of action.\n\nBut Pochettino was quick to stress that this was a collective show of skill, strength and durability by this side. The visitors dominated possession and territory and during the second half in particular left Bournemouth dizzy with their slick interchange play. Érik Lamela impressed having come on for Kane, as did Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli, with the latter scoring the goal that brought Spurs level on 35 minutes.\n\nFollowing a flurry of passes down Tottenham’s right Serge Aurier delivered a cross into the area that Alli sent past Begovic having darted between Simon Francis and Steve Cook. The finish was smart and sparked relief among the visitors’ ranks given that up to that point they had largely been second best.\n\nBournemouth had started really brightly, playing with great intensity and organisation and deservedly took the lead with Stanislas’s low drive on seven minutes. The goal was the forward’s fourth of the season and was a moment of redemption given his glaring miss three minutes earlier.\n\nTottenham were rattled and their afternoon appeared to be spiralling out of control when Kane limped from the fray. But then Alli scored and, following sustained pressure, Son struck twice in the space of 25 minutes, converting Alli’s cross with a miscued volley before finishing off a counterattack having run into space and calmly rounded Begovic.\n\nThat was the cue for some home supporters to leave with many no doubt cursing Mike Dean’s decision to rule out Callum Wilson’s 83rd-minute strike for a push on Davinson Sánchez. Eddie Howe described the decision as soft and he could only look on with further despair as Aurier got his first goal for Tottenham with a stoppage-time header."}, {"date": "10/03/2018", "arena": "Old

know enough about north-west rivalries to understand why this counts as one of the more pleasing results of Manchester United’s season. It may not make a jot of difference when it comes to the destination of the league title, with Manchester City haughtily observing from a long distance away, but Rashford chose a good day to remind everyone of his penetrative qualities.\n\nThis was Rashford’s first league start since the turn of the year and, on this evidence, maybe the break has done him good. He has struggled at times this season and his return to form is certainly well-timed from the perspective of Gareth Southgate. The England manager was watching from the Sir Bobby Charlton stand and will have appreciated Rashford’s two diagonal finishes; Southgate’s latest England squad will be announced on Thursday. Of more immediacy is the fact those goals have helped consolidate United’s position in the battle for second place, albeit they remain 13 points behind City.\n\nJosé Mourinho blasts Old Trafford crowd for giving Scott McTominay stick Read more\n\nFor Liverpool that will be a source of intense frustration when they had so much of the ball in promising positions during the second half and the six minutes of stoppage-time. Jürgen Klopp was entitled to say his team could have saved themselves during that part of the match.\n\nUltimately, though, Liverpool’s problem was that none of their big-hitters reached their usual levels. Mohamed Salah in particular picked a bad day to put in one of his least effective performances and it was unusual to see Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané so subdued.\n\nPerhaps that was because of the way United defended so deeply in the second half, protecting themselves against the counterattack. But that was not so relevant in the opening 45 minutes when the home side were clearly buoyed by Rashford’s goals and there was even the sight of Eric Bailly taking the ball around Salah with a little pirouette. The crowd loved Bailly’s impudence and, though Mourinho did not look quite so thrilled with that kind of risk-taking, it was a reflection of the home side’s confidence in that period.\n\nIt was shortly afterwards when Romelu Lukaku’s long crossfield pass picked out Rashford on the left, the ball was clipped into the penalty area and Juan Mata flashed an overhead kick narrowly wide. Had that one gone in it would have been a goal-of-the-season contender.\n\nUnfortunately for Bailly, not everything he tried came off so elegantly. Midway through the second half, the centre-back went to clear Mané’s left-wing delivery and somehow slashed the ball the wrong way to divert it past David de Gea. It was an eccentric own goal, ensuring a blistering and tense finale and, for United, it was a desperate scramble at times to hold on.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liverpool players rush to retrieve the ball after Eric Bailly’s bizarre own goal. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nTheir tactics throughout the final exchanges could be encapsulated by Mourinho’s decision to bring on Marouane Fellaini for Rashford. Fellaini blocked and tackled, jumped and harried and got in the way. It was exactly what United needed.\n\nLiverpool will think back to the moment 10 minutes into the second half, when Andrew Robertson’s cross struck Antonio Valencia’s hand inside the penalty area only for the referee, Craig Pawson, to give United’s captain the benefit of the doubt. Klopp also mentioned a risky penalty-box challenge from Fellaini on Mané but there was no real explanation as to why it took Liverpool so long to get into their stride. Their nervousness in the first half was unusual when they have scored even more away goals this season than Manchester City.\n\nFor United, perhaps the only slight downside came in the form of Alexis Sánchez’s continuing difficulties in adjusting to his new team. At one stage he had the chance to set Rashford free but chose the wrong pass to Lukaku and overhit it anyway. A bemused Mourinho turned to his coaching staff and drew back his foot to show how it should have been played.\n\nA case of Dejan vu all over again for Lovren the Liverpool fall guy | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nSánchez had a poor match but that did not matter too greatly when the players around him were rising to the occasion and it did not take long for it to become clear that Rashford could make this a difficult game for Trent Alexander-Arnold. In the 14th minute, Lukaku flicked on De Gea’s goal-kick and Rashford had his first chance to take on Liverpool’s right-back. He eluded him with a clever cut-back, changing direction at speed, and beat Loris Karius with a shot of power and precision.\n\nLukaku was involved again for what turned out to be the decisive goal. This time, Mata had the first chance, running on to the striker’s weighted pass, but Virgil van Dijk came across to turn the ball away. The problem for Liverpool was that Karius was now out of position and the ball was rolling invitingly towards Rashford. Again, he went for the corner he had picked out 10 minutes earlier and the ball flicked off Alexander-Arnold’s heel to deceive Liverpool’s goalkeeper."}, {"date": "10/03/2018", "arena": "Goodison

than watching their team, though in fairness to Sam Allardyce and his players this was not a bad performance in the end. The home side started slowly but improved and the visitors eventually lost their composure to the extent of going down to 10 men, but only after Everton had scored their two goals.\n\n“Quality told in the end,” Allardyce said. “We’ve been missing Leighton Baines, Séamus Coleman and Yannick Bolasie for too long. We’ve won seven of our last 10 home games and drawn two, so at Goodison we are a top-six side. Away from home we are right at the bottom but at least we only have the one thing to fix.”\n\nHuddersfield unable to break down Swansea despite Jordan Ayew dismissal Read more\n\nWhile Allardyce was able to select Baines for the first time, Idrissa Gueye’s absence through illness let in Wayne Rooney as a makeshift defensive midfielder. Brighton were prepared to sit back and let their opponents have most of the possession but for an hour Everton struggled to find openings. Coleman went close early on from a rare move that led to a sight of goal but otherwise in the first half Mat Ryan was troubled only by a Phil Jagielka header from a corner and Bolasie shooting into the side netting when Gylfi Sigurdsson sent over another set-piece cross.\n\nThe action had become so tepid it was quite a shock when Brighton suddenly produced an opportunity of their own from open play. Glenn Murray’s shot was probably never going to beat Jordan Pickford but he struck it well enough, from Anthony Knockaert’s pass, and it was a welcome reminder that at least one of the sides knew the way to goal.\n\nShane Duffy blocked a Rooney shot at the start of the second half before Everton surprised Brighton by taking the lead. They probably surprised themselves as well. Bolasie had spent the afternoon searching in vain for an end product, yet after an hour of trying he cut in from the left and floated a delightful cross to the far post, where Theo Walcott popped up beside Gaëtan Bong to pressure the defender into an own goal. Everton had in effect lulled Brighton into a false sense of security, the visitors paying the price for a momentary lapse of concentration in defence.\n\nKenedy’s early double steers Newcastle to victory over insipid Southampton Read more\n\nIt turned out not to be their only one. All Brighton’s work counted for nothing when Cenk Tosun crashed in a shot off the underside of the bar 14 minutes from the end, just after Walcott had left the field with a muscle strain. The visitors first made the mistake of allowing Baines to carry the ball into the area, then they completely failed to spot Tosun unmarked in front of goal and waiting for a pass. Brighton’s woe was complete a couple of minutes later when Knockaert collected their first red card of the season for a reckless studs-up lunge at Baines.\n\nThere was still time for Duffy to concede a penalty against his old club, barging Dominic Calvert-Lewin over, and for Rooney to miss it, or at least to allow Ryan to make a diving save low to his right.\n\nPickford was also called into action in stoppage time, producing a good stop to deny Pascal Gross, but Brighton could have no complaints. “I was surprised by our performance,” Chris Hughton said. “I can only put it down to the effect of playing really good sides every week. We didn’t play at a level that allowed us to take anything from the game.”"}, {"date": "10/03/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 23567, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield

exacerbated Southampton’s own fears of falling into the Championship.\n\nMauricio Pellegrino’s side have now won only one of their last 17 league games and, with Mario Lemina and company well off the pace, they seemed to surrender here. Pellegrino was subjected to chants of “you don’t know what you’re doing” from visiting fans and later acknowledged that his side had given up.\n\nWest Ham chaos as pitch invaders and crowd trouble mars Burnley’s win Read more\n\nDominant in central midfield against opponents apparently averse to competing for second balls, Newcastle’s duo of Mohamed Diamé and Jonjo Shelvey, impressive as they were, have rarely enjoyed such a straightforward afternoon.\n\n“I’m really disappointed,” said Pellegrino, who worked under Benítez at Liverpool and Internazionale. “We were never a threat to Newcastle. I must apologise to our supporters because we did not represent our club well enough. You can have good players but without personality it’s really difficult to compete. We have to switch on our spirit. The players are intelligent; they know what they did.”\n\nWhile Pellegrino grimly nodded agreement with a reporter’s assertion that Southampton had “given up”, Benítez’s relief was obvious. “We still have to win two or three games but we had control today,” said the Newcastle manager. “Kenedy’s using his quality to make a difference to us.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino has won only five Premier League games this season. Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters\n\nThe same goes for Shelvey. In the second minute he lifted a long pass in Kenedy’s direction and the Chelsea loanee responded by chesting it down, swivelling imperiously past Cédric, who was too tight, and guiding a shot into the bottom corner.\n\nThe frown creasing Pellegrino’s forehead deepened when Kenedy soon scored a second. It was initiated by Ayoze Pérez, who broke from deep after the unconvincing Lemina, under pressure from Diamé, failed to win a header following a Southampton corner. A wonderfully fast, fluent attacking move concluded with Dwight Gayle unselfishly sliding a first-time pass to Kenedy, whose left foot did the rest.\n\nIf Shelvey’s through-balls continually caught the eye, Diamé’s somewhat less showy display alongside him arguably proved just as important. With the Senegal international diligently protecting his defence by destroying Southampton attacks at the source, Pellegrino’s horizon looked as bleak as the Tyneside skies.\n\nCenk Tosun wraps up Everton win to ease the pressure on Sam Allardyce Read more\n\nIcy rain was falling when Matt Ritchie registered a third and Shelvey was once again the provider.

dodged Jamaal Lascelles and unleashed Southampton’s first shot on target, directing it straight at Martin Dubravka, almost an hour had passed.\n\nIf that faulty connection seemed emblematic of

Pardew admitted it has now reached the stage where he needs to approach the board to see if they wish to make a change.\n\nWest Ham chaos as pitch invaders and crowd trouble mars Burnley’s win Read more\n\nThe West Brom manager made it clear he is not the sort of character to “lay down tools”‚ yet this was the sort of performance that suggested the players are resigned to their fate. West Brom collapsed from the moment Riyad Mahrez put Leicester ahead in the second half and by the time Vicente Iborra headed in Leicester’s fourth goal, deep into injury time, the majority of the home supporters had already made their way to the exits.\n\nWest Brom have won only one of their past 28 league matches and it is nigh on impossible to see any scenario other than relegation.\n\nPardew has been in charge for 15 of those games, collecting only eight points in the process without ever giving the impression he is capable of hauling his club out of trouble.\n\n“Before you even ask me the question, ‘will I speak to upstairs?’, yeah, of course I will, because it’s getting difficult,” Pardew said. “My pride on the sideline is such that I don’t want to stand there for that last 15-20 minutes and watch that. My teams are better than that and I want my team here to be better than that. I said to the players afterwards, that last period of the game is unacceptable.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alan Pardew looks helpless as West Brom slide to another defeat.

For me it’s about planning next week and what will be a difficult game down at Bournemouth. But I’ll still talk to [the board] and get a feeling of what they think because they might think a change is a better thing for the club.\n\n“But the one thing I’m not going to do is lay down tools. I was saying to the players you’ve got to fight to the end and I’m criticising them for the last 20 minutes that we weren’t fighting.\n\n“I don’t care what job you’re in, if you’re under pressure and you ain’t going to fight, then don’t bother turning up. So I’ll continue to fight, because that’s in me.”\n\nAlthough West Brom took the lead through a well-taken volley from Salomón Rondón and came close to scoring a second when Kasper Schmeichel pushed Grzegorz Krychowiak’s volley on to the bar, their fragile confidence was soon exposed.\n\nCenk Tosun wraps up Everton win to ease the pressure on Sam Allardyce Read more\n\nJamie Vardy equalised with an exquisite volley – the England striker allowed Mahrez’s perfectly weighted pass to drop over his shoulder before striking it sweetly into the far corner – and Mahrez neatly tucked away Kelechi Iheanacho’s lovely pass early in the second half to put Leicester in front.\n\nPardew withdrew Krychowiak a few minutes before that goal and the manager made it clear he was unhappy with the midfielder’s reaction to be substituted. “I do have a problem with it, because I’ve supported him and played him and stuck by him when he’s not been particularly great. To come off and not shake my hand, I made it very clear to him on the bench I’m not expecting that. He’s a player on loan [from PSG] and he should show respect.”\n\nLeicester, who were without a win in their previous five league games, then started to turn the screw. Kelechi Iheanacho’s bright cameo saw him score his first Premier League goal for the club when he nodded in Ben Chilwell’s cross and Vicente Iborra headed in Marc Albrighton’s corner to complete the

hundreds of fans gathering in front of the directors’ box after Burnley took the lead in the second half. A female steward was knocked to the ground in the crush, Mark Noble, West Ham’s captain, threw one of several pitch invaders to the turf and the Metropolitan police received two allegations of assault.\n\nWest Ham players fear toxic stadium atmosphere will damage survival bid Read more\n\nDavid Sullivan and David Gold, West Ham’s co-owners, were escorted from their seats in the 84th minute, sparking derisive jeers from the seething protesters, who chanted for the board’s removal. It is understood missiles were thrown at the directors’ box and one coin struck Sullivan in the face, however his glasses protected him from the possibility of serious injury. Some fans could be seen making throat-slitting gestures at members of the board.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A West Ham supporter stands on the pitch holding a corner flag aloft as ugly scenes overshadowed the match. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nWest Ham are likely to face punishment from the FA. The governing body will take a dim view of what took place, especially bearing in mind there was crowd trouble at the London Stadium on several occasions last season, and said in a statement: “The FA strongly condemns the crowd disturbances at West Ham United versus Burnley and will be seeking observations from West Ham as well as awaiting the match referee’s report.”\n\nA spokesman for the Met said: “Towards the end of the fixture between West Ham and Burnley at the London Stadium on Saturday 10 March, four separate pitch invasions by individual home fans took place. During the pitch incursions an impromptu protest took place within the stadium with around 200 people gathering under the directors’ box. Two allegations of assault have been received by police. These are being investigated. Exit from the stadium following the game passed without incident. At this stage there have been no arrests.”\n\nQuick guide Why are West Ham fans so angry with their owners? Show Hide What is the board’s biggest perceived failing? A lack of investment in the transfer market. West Ham’s recruitment has lacked focus in the past two years, players have left without replacements being identified and the result is an unbalanced squad. Is there a way to improve recruitment? The last transfer window ended with Tony Henry, the club’s head of recruitment, losing his job after making offensive comments about African footballers. Soon Sullivan was indicating a willingness to give more control over signings to David Moyes. But is he truly capable of taking a step back? Although Sullivan has told the Guardian that he is not the director of football, he was referred to by that title when the accounts were released last week. “David Sullivan in effect takes a Football Director role in helping to select and negotiate all football transfers alongside the manager,” Karren Brady, the vice-chairman, wrote. Nobody at the club has come up with an explanation for the publication of that line. Does that sum up the club’s PR problems? You could say that. Remarks by Brady were said to have scuppered a deal to sign Islam Slimani from Leicester in January, while Sullivan caused anger with derogatory remarks about members of the squad in December. Is there any reason for fans to be hopeful? Perhaps West Ham can rebuild if Moyes keeps them up, but it is difficult to see how the board can regain the fans’ trust after the frenzied protests during Saturday’s home defeat by Burnley. Jacob Steinberg Photograph: Christopher Lee/West Ham United FC\n\nWest Ham, who do not play again until hosting Southampton on 31 March and are three points above the bottom three with eight matches left, plan to take swift action. “West Ham United have immediately launched a full and thorough investigation into the incidents which marred the second half of today’s match and are committed to taking decisive and appropriate action,” the club said in a statement. “An emergency meeting has been called with all London Stadium stakeholders. There will be no further comment at this time.”\n\nKenedy’s early double steers Newcastle to victory over insipid Southampton Read more\n\nAs disgraceful as the scenes were, however, they had always felt possible bearing in mind the ugly circumstances surrounding the cancellation of a protest march before the game. The response from security after Ashley Barnes gave Burnley the lead was bewilderingly slow.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Farewell Boleyn: the end of an era for West Ham United – video\n\nThe goal stemmed from an inspired change by Sean Dyche, who replaced Jeff Hendrick with Chris Wood and saw the substitute tee up Barnes for a fine finish in the 66th minute.\n\nThe mood swiftly turned sour. A fan ran on to the pitch, with no steward tackling him for at least a minute, and clashed with Noble, who threw him to the ground. While that fan was led away, two more ran on. Burnley scored again in the 70th minute, Wood turning a loose ball past Joe Hart. The striker would score his second after an error by the recalled Hart.\n\nBy then attention had turned to the astonishing scene in front of the directors’ box, where hundreds of fans overwhelmed a handful of stewards. There were more pitch invasions. One fan made off with a corner flag and stuck it in the centre circle. Play stopped briefly while the referee, Lee Mason, spoke to both benches.\n\n“As a supporter you can’t cross the line,” David Moyes said. “You know you can’t come on the pitch. That’s the rules.” The West Ham manager was soon facing questions about what it would be like to have to play games behind closed doors.\n\nWest Ham United (@WestHamUtd) The Club have made a statement regarding the incidents today. https://t.co/C97BbJBhAu\n\nBoth managers praised the officials for calming the game and Moyes admitted he was worried Noble would be sent off.

But the way in which they let their performance drift in the final half hour here was a reminder of the Blues’ more wayward moments in an inconsistent season.\n\nFor Palace, it was the opposite. After the home side scored twice in the first half, with both goals going in via Palace’s Martin Kelly, the visitors bounced back. The introduction of the returning Wilfried Zaha at the interval gave the visitors renewed heart and after Patrick van Aanholt scored in the 89th minute the nerves of the Stamford Bridge crowd were jangled unduly. Antonio Conte may have been the cheerier of the two managers afterwards, but the manner of this topsy-turvy encounter left you unsure that Roy Hodgson wouldn’t take greater heart from it.\n\n“I think this win was very important‚” Conte said. “We played really well, especially in the first half; we created many chances. It was a pity that at the end we conceded the goal and the last three minutes were a bit nervous. After you dominate a game you hope to play it out in a more relaxed fashion.”\n\nFor his part, Hodgson rued Palace’s inconsistent performance. “It’s a shame we didn’t play the whole match as we did the second half,” he said. “There was far too big a difference between the teams in the first half, both defensively and offensively, and we paid the price. A second half repeat could have ended very badly and the temptation to bring on a player of [Zaha’s] quality was too strong.”\n\nBoth coaches read the first half right. Chelsea were dominant and assertive. They also had a plan that was working. With Olivier Giroud playing as an actual striker, Eden Hazard was given licence to return to the areas he loves to roam in best. Alongside him Willian continued his imperious form of late, registering his fifth goal in as many games in the 25th minute when he drifted in from the left wing to open the scoring with a low shot that spun off Kelly’s calf and in off the near post.\n\nKelly doubled Chelsea’s advantage seven minutes later in strange fashion. A whip-smart piece of Chelsea play ended with Davide Zappacosta firing a shot past Wayne Hennessey. Kelly was in position to block the shot, but his clearance only hit the head of his flailing keeper. The ball bounced backwards, came off Kelly’s own knee and dribbled into the net.\n\nGiroud missed two more chances to open his Chelsea account in the second half. He was “unlucky” according to his manager. Willian, meanwhile, “is playing in a fantastic way but, I want to underline, not only with the ball”. The Brazilian has been in and out of Conte’s team this season despite his attacking consistency. The Italian was letting everyone know the reason for it.\n\nHodgson made his own cryptic remark, claiming Palace’s second half recovery was down to everyone putting their body on the line. “We didn’t have 11 doing that in the first half,” he said. The inference would be that Christian Benteke was among those who had disappointed, as it was he who was hoicked off at half-time for Zaha, who made his first appearance after missing a month with a ligament strain. Either way the returning talisman not only gave the visitors a cutting edge but a sense of belief.\n\nThe Norwegian striker Alexander Sørloth took a Zaha pass and thumped the post with it just after the restart. He then had the ball in the net with five minutes left, but the referee Anthony Taylor ruled it out for a foul by Jaïro Riedewald. Hodgson said “the ones who have studied it on video” told him it should have been allowed.\n\nThree minutes later and Palace had their goal as Zaha played a delightful blind pass out wide to Van Aanholt, who fired home with confidence.\n\nPalace have now lost to Tottenham, Manchester United and Chelsea in consecutive matches, but each has been close and Hodgson knows the lesson to draw from those defeats. “In the last eight games we have to reproduce the form of five of these last six halves,” he said. “We have to make certain we leave no stone unturned in the fight to stay in the division.”"}, {"date": "05/03/2018", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25840, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

he pinched himself through his post-match interviews. The Serb had not scored for Manchester United since his summer arrival from Chelsea, so few would have envisaged him plucking a frenzied game’s decisive fifth goal as the ball looped to him well outside the penalty area. Yet, with the match deep into stoppage time and fatigue gripping, it was time for one last swing.\n\nLuka Milivojevic, the Crystal Palace captain, edged tentatively forward as if to block but turned his back as his compatriot connected. Matic’s connection was true, the ball arcing viciously to swerve away from Wayne Hennessey and the goalkeeper’s footwork was hesitant as if he had been taken by surprise. By the time the ball billowed his net, despairing team-mates were already sinking to their haunches as Matic wheeled away in celebration. United, a team who had trailed by two just before the hour mark here and would not be spared scathing criticism by José Mourinho, will go into Saturday’s game with Liverpool above their rivals and restored to the top two.\n\nFitting Pogba and Sánchez together cannot be franchised out by Mourinho | Paul MacInnes Read more\n\nThis ultimately appeared reward for United’s persistence but it owed much to the manager’s impact from the sidelines. There had been a rebuke at half-time for his players’ sloppiness in making “so many mistakes”, albeit that ear-bashing did not prevent the visitors shipping a “disgraceful, childish second goal” immediately after the break. As it transpired, necessity forced Mourinho to be bold in his substitutions and, with Marcus Rashford pinning back the impressive Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Juan Mata prompting centrally and Jesse Lingard filling in at right-back, they eventually forced their way back into the contest.\n\nChris Smalling had halved the deficit, nodding Antonio Valencia’s cross easily into the corner having been played onside by James Tomkins – how the hosts had craved maintaining that healthy advantage a while longer – with everything thereafter too frantic for Palace’s comfort. Roy Hodgson, his own bold gameplan rather swept away, would glance up to see “Rashford, Lukaku, Mata, Lingard, Sánchez and Luke Shaw flying forward” and a patched-up, depleted home side in retreat. Christian Benteke had already scrambled one Matic attempt from the goalline, but Palace would crack 14 minutes from time.\n\nSánchez’s shot looped up off Martin Kelly to bounce from the angle of post and bar, with Lukaku calmly gathering the rebound, patiently eking out space in a cluttered penalty area, and forcing a finish through the mess of bodies and beyond the unsighted Hennessey. A point would still have been cherished by Hodgson, a manager attempting to stave off relegation with an entire team of senior players currently crocked with ligament damage, broken bones or assorted strains, but Matic would wreck that prospect late on.\n\n“I am very proud of the performance and can’t criticise any player for the effort they put in, their discipline tactically,” he offered through the numbness of defeat. “I just feel very sad for them all.”\n\nMaybe the cold light of day will highlight the positives, for all that a trip now awaits on Saturday to Chelsea, the wounded defending champions. Palace had been aggressive and direct, encouraged by Benteke’s personal revival – the Belgian would draw a fine save from David de Gea immediately after United’s equaliser as he sought a first goal here since May – and Alexander Sørloth’s muscular running, Andros Townsend’s delivery and Wan-Bissaka’s enthusiasm and quality even up against Sánchez.\n\nTownsend had earned them an early lead, his shot deflecting wickedly off Victor Lindelöf to loop beyond De Gea. Jeffrey Schlupp’s quick thinking at a free-kick, slipping Patrick van Aanholt free into enemy territory while Matic complained about the referee’s decision, earned them a second. Van Aanholt’s finish was crisply dispatched inside the goalkeeper’s near post.\n\nJosé Mourinho praises ‘fantastic comeback’ but rues earlier mistakes Read more\n\nThe majority inside the arena could hardly contemplate such a healthy lead though, in truth, it actually served to spark United into life. The manner in which they flooded forward thereafter, encouraged by Smalling’s reward, and took their rewards boded well for their strength of character even if the sloppiness was still playing on the manager’s mind in the aftermath.\n\n“A remarkable comeback, but we made mistakes. A fantastic comeback, but mistakes …” muttered Mourinho. “But the attitude, the intensity, the quality, the dynamic, the risk were fantastic.

It was the 34th minute, their team were 2-0 down to Chris Hughton’s in-form Brighton & Hove Albion and all they could do was conclude that Arsène Wenger’s time was up.\n\nArsène Wenger insists he is ‘still the right man for the job’ at Arsenal Read more\n\nIt is a judgment that has been reached by many but when the hardcore travelling fans broadcast it, the impression is somehow stronger, more absolute. It was certainly a dismal first half for Arsenal, even if they rallied at the end of it, and it is true that when they are bad, they are horribly so.\n\nBrighton were very good. They punished Arsenal’s defensive slackness, in which Petr Cech was the most glaring culprit, and they might have had more during a period when Arsenal were gripped by indecision and nervousness. On the back of goals from Lewis Dunk and Glenn Murray, this was a win that reinforced the sense that Hughton and Brighton are staying up – and with a degree of comfort.\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang got Arsenal back into it with a close-range finish in the 43rd minute and even then the reaction from the away support was sarcastic. “We’ve scored a goal,” they chorused. Wenger’s team pressed hard on to the front foot thereafter but, although they enjoyed the territorial advantage and hogged 68% of possession, they failed to create too much of clear-cut note. They sorely lacked sharpness. Their away-day travails go on – they have now taken only 13 points from 15 matches this season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsène Wenger cut a forlorn figure on Arsenal’s bench. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nWenger tried to draw an analogy afterwards between Arsenal and a naked man, who had been left exposed. He talked about the need to rebuild – or get dressed properly – although he rather got himself into a tangle. It was nothing compared to how his team slumped after a decent enough opening five minutes.\n\nBrighton’s first forward thrust through Ezequiel Schelotto had set the alarm bells ringing and it led to a debatable corner, which Pascal Gross stood up towards the far post. It looked like one for Cech to claim except that he got himself boxed in and, rather abruptly, there was Shane Duffy going up for the ball with him and winning it. From Duffy’s header, Dunk stretched to steer home.\n\nIt was the prompt for Arsenal to fall apart. Wenger described his team as “passive, struggling for confidence and heavy-legged” from the concession of the first goal to about the 40-minute mark and that was putting it kindly. It was the kind of period to give him nightmares.\n\nThere were excruciatingly few options for the man in possession; so little movement ahead of the ball – tell-tale signs of rock bottom self-belief – and the errors duly followed. Alex Iwobi lost the ball when he had nothing on and, in a flash, Gross had supplied Anthony Knockaert and he was denied by a smart Cech block. Cech had previously saved from Gross while Brighton threatened from further corners. Dunk sent one free header over the bar.\n\nBrighton’s second goal followed a loose Laurent Koscielny pass out from the back and they worked it to Gross on the right. Shkodran Mustafi allowed Murray too much space behind him and, when Gross crossed, the striker headed down and in. The ball squirmed underneath Cech too easily.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lewis Dunk celebrates after giving Brighton the lead. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nArsenal’s frustration was summed up when Jack Wilshere jumped into a wild tackle on Knockaert in the 40th minute and was booked.

Aubameyang, who had seen an early shot blocked by Duffy, touched home from Granit Xhaka’s pass, after good work by Iwobi. And on 44 minutes Koscielny rose to flick a deflected header on to the post from Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s cross.\n\nWenger had omitted Héctor Bellerín, Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck from his starting line-up with an eye on Thursday’s Europa League tie at Milan but he must have reasoned there was enough on the field to get a result.\n\nThey were a little better in the second half. Mesut Özil drove at the area and extended Mathew Ryan and Aubameyang rounded Ryan only to see the goalkeeper get back. It was nowhere near enough.\n\nSead Kolasinac escaped a second booking after he cleaned out Schelotto, although Hughton said there was “nothing malicious” to the barge. Schelotto was forced off, having seen stars, and he looked to have recovered afterwards. But when Aubameyang could not squeeze his shot past Ryan in stoppage time, there would be no escape for Arsenal."}, {"date": "04/03/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54328, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [24], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [46], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Foden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Trevoh Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emerson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "For once, it did not really feel necessary to go through all the well-worn superlatives that have accompanied Manchester City on their procession to the title. That is 14 successive home wins now in the Premier League. No team have ever racked up so many passes – 902 – since the league’s inception and Ilkay Gündogan’s total of 174 was another record for the modern era.\n\nPep Guardiola’s side had won with something to spare and by the time it was all over, with an 18-point gap opening up at the top of the table, it was difficult to remember that it was the players wearing the darker shade of blue who were, in fact, the champions of England.\n\nAntonio Conte hits back at comments by Jamie Redknapp and Gary Neville Read more\n\nFor City, that honour will be theirs in a few weeks – quite possibly when Manchester United visit here on 7 April – whereas Chelsea should be embarrassed that those kind of record statistics could happen on their watch. They barely laid a glove on the team that, lest it be forgotten, finished 15 points below them last season and it was startling to see their regression, the ultra-defensive tactics employed by Antonio Conte’s side and, more than anything, the sheer lack of gumption at 1-0 to do anything about it. Chelsea are supposed to be a big club with lofty ambitions, but what does it say for the current team that they were the patsies on the day one of their rivals produced an unprecedented show of keep-ball?\n\nThe only surprise was Guardiola’s men restricted themselves to Bernardo Silva’s goal 33 seconds into the second half and that, for all the intelligent promptings of Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva and the flowering brilliance of Leroy Sané, they did not make it a more emphatic win. The home side played every sort of pass – 508 in the first half alone – but there were not too many of the killer variety. This was actually the first time in City’s winning run on their own ground that they have not managed at least two goals, but that seldom felt like an issue when their opponents were so vapid. No team can accumulate the kind of statistics City did here if they were being chased and harried and that, perhaps, was the most alarming aspect for Conte. N’Golo Kanté was missing because of a virus and, without their most combative player, it was startling to see the lack of enthusiasm among Chelsea’s players to make a tackle or raise their voices – anything to show they cared.\n\nQuick guide Manchester City player ratings Show Hide Ederson The Brazilian was a virtual spectator throughout – the boon of being the goalkeeper in this Daimler of a side. 6/10\n\nKyle Walker With Bernardo Silva, the right-back was a continual threat in City’s relentless desire to attack. 7 Aymeric Laporte Rarely pressured by a Chelsea team who failed to pose any serious questions of the Frenchman. 6 Nicolás Otamendi Played as the first point of attack from his defensive berth – made one important stop from a Willian cross. 6 Oleksandr Zinchenko Made a De Bruyne-like pass into Walker that split Chelsea open – booked for a lunge on Moses. 6 Ilkay Gundogan Smooth and silky all contest, the midfielder is a fine “stand-in” for the injured Fernandinho. 7 Bernardo Silva One miss was so bad that Pep Guardiola seemed to chuckle to himself but the Portuguese later scored the winner. 8 Leroy Sané Drifted in-field from the left to terrorise Chelsea – one touch-and-shot for the German deserved a goal. 8 David Silva Operated towards the left and it was from there he delivered the ball for his namesake’s finish. 7 Kevin De Bruyne The Belgian’s pass-radar was on from the start as yet again he was in imperious form off both boots. 7 Sergio Agüero Overran one chance when he might have passed but did make himself a nuisance for his team’s opener. 6 Subs Gabriel Jesus (for Aguero 85) 6; Danilo (for Zinchenko 87) 6; Phil Foden (for D Silva 91) 6. Ratings by Jamie Jackson\n\nChelsea have now lost four of their past five league games and there was a telling moment late on, just before the amount of stoppage time was announced, when Conte withdrew Eden Hazard to bring on Álvaro Morata, giving the Spaniard all of four minutes to conjure up an equaliser. Hazard walked past his manager without even exchanging a look. Too much can be made of these moments sometimes, but the strained body language was reminiscent of a similar incident involving Hazard and José Mourinho, shortly before the Portuguese was sacked from Stamford Bridge in 2015.\n\nConte explained afterwards that he had had to be realistic about City’s superior position and adapt his tactics accordingly. He had a point, but could they not have shown a touch more ambition? It was difficult to think of another side that has visited the Etihad Stadium this season and had so little impact, attacking-wise, and Conte’s analysis did not take into account that City, for all their counter-attacking brilliance, can often leave themselves vulnerable because of the sheer nature of Guardiola’s lineup.\n\nQuick guide Chelsea player ratings Show Hide Thibaut Courtois The visiting No 1 could do nothing about Bernardo Silva’s goal and had to be constantly alert. 6/10 César Azpilicueta A difficult afternoon trying to “mark” Sané featured a brilliant near goal-line stop when the German seemed certain to score. 6 Andreas Christensen Felt pressure from Agüero throughout and fashioned a howler for Bernardo Silva’s strike he will wish to forget. 3 Antonio Rudiger Got hit by a Drinkwater ball that summed up Chelsea’s inferiority, was clumsy in possession and booked. 4 Victor Moses Anonymous contribution from the right-sided midfielder who spurned a golden chance in the second half. 4 Cesc Fàbregas Struggled to weave his patterns because of City’s ball dominance and often found David Silva at his back. 5 Danny Drinkwater The absence of N’Golo Kanté made Drinkwater’s holding job against the fluid City attack play even harder. 4 Marcos Alonso Often pinned back to deal with the threat of the Walker-Bernardo Silva axis along his left flank. 4 Willian Starved of the ball, he impressed when it did find him but was given scant support by team-mates. 6 Eden Hazard The natural No 10 was ill-used by Antonio Conte, the manager fielding him as the No 9. 5 Pedro It was difficult to recall him making any telling contribution in a weak Chelsea forward line. 4 Subs Olivier Giroud (for Willian 78) 5; Emerson (for Pedro 82) 5; Álvaro Morata (for Hazard 89). Ratings by Jamie Jackson\n\nCity had an attacking midfielder, Oleksandr Zinchenko, at left-back. Kyle Walker is the most forward-thinking right-back in the league and Gündogan, operating as a holding midfielder, is another whose first instincts are to go forward. The trick for City’s opponents is getting the balance right between defence and attack. Yet Chelsea rarely ventured to find out why City had kept only two clean sheets in their previous nine home games and, among the blizzard of statistics confirming the home side’s superiority, one in particular jumped off the page – Hazard had only 33 touches of the ball, 18 fewer than Thibaut Courtois, the Chelsea goalkeeper.\n\nEden Hazard woe as Chelsea’s roughed-up false nine toils at Manchester City | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nChelsea employed the same tactical plan against Barcelona in their Champions League first leg, but it works only if the team defend at their absolute best. Instead, Andreas Christensen’s mistake let in Lionel Messi for Barcelona’s equaliser and, again, the centre-half had to accept a proportion of the blame when City scored the goal that leaves them needing four more wins to confirm the title.\n\nWhen Christensen’s attempted clearance struck one of his own team‑mates Sergio Agüero was on the ball in a flash. David Silva was overlapping on the left and Bernardo Silva, coming in at the far post, showed more interest to get to the cross than Marcos Alonso, turning his shot into the bottom corner.\n\nChelsea still had plenty of time to save themselves but their problem was getting the ball, and this is the other thing about City that sometimes goes unnoticed: when they do lose the ball they work devilishly hard at getting it back as quickly as possible."}, {"date": "03/03/2018", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 20802, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Nick Pope",

"Sam Allardyce talked his way into trouble during his ill-fated spell as England manager. He may not be talking his way out of it during an increasingly unhappy time at Everton. After a sixth successive away defeat prompted the travelling Evertonians to turn on him for the first time, Allardyce claimed: “I feel worse than the fans.” He had the self-awareness to add “they won’t believe this” and, given the level of discontent, that seems a safe assertion; they won’t. The supporters had told him in no uncertain terms where to go when he substituted the goalscorer Cenk Tosun. Further vitriolic dissent followed the removal of the excellent Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\nIf there is a crisis of leadership at Goodison Park, Ashley Williams contributed. Allardyce’s chosen captain was sent off for elbowing Ashley Barnes. “Silly,” said his manager, who will fine the defender. “It sums up our day.” Once again, Everton contrived to undermine themselves but while Allardyce was offered ample indications their supporters want him consigned to the past, Burnley made a minor piece of history. Sean Dyche’s side had not tasted victory since the heady December night when they went fourth. This was the first time since 2010 they have won a Premier League game where they conceded first, a 53-game run ended by a combination of spirit, directness and managerial intervention. Dyche brought on Chris Wood for the ineffective Jeff Hendrick at the break and Burnley’s record signing justified the switch to 4-4-2 by heading in the winner. “I thought it worked,” said Dyche.\n\nBurnley 2-1 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIn the process, Burnley beat their past. Michael Keane’s return to Turf Moor felt traumatic. Burnley pocketed £30m for his services last summer. Barnes escaped from his former team-mate to score the leveller. Wood outjumped the man whose sale helped finance his arrival for the decider. Nor did Keane’s centre-back sidekick fare any better. Williams was the first to lose Wood when Johann Berg Gudmundsson centred. “We decide not to defend a corner properly,” said Allardyce.\n\nUnder other circumstances, he may have been congratulating himself on his decision-making, even if that still felt illogical. Rewind to the comparatively balmy days of early February and he suggested Tosun was struggling with the English weather. Brought in from the cold, but into the cold, the £27m striker opened his Everton account in an accomplished display to render it a mystery that he had not started for six weeks. “He worked extremely hard,” said Allardyce, who said the Turkey international’s unpopular departure came because he was tiring.\n\nTosun’s graft had been allied with craft, a lovely curling pass bringing a chance for Theo Walcott. His goal had shown predatory expertise and the sort of aerial ability Allardyce tends to appreciate in a striker. Tosun headed in when the returning Séamus Coleman flicked on Walcott’s cross.\n\nSon Heung-min steers Tottenham to comfortable win over Huddersfield Read more\n\n“We lost it by not scoring the second goal,” Allardyce said. Walcott was the major culprit, but Sigurdsson was the creator in chief of a series of openings. He was incisive, inventive and influential, illustrating what he could do when Wayne Rooney was benched.\n\nYet Everton faded. “To see the players underperform in the second half is very disappointing,” Allardyce added. The one exception was Jordan Pickford, who pressed his case to be England’s World Cup goalkeeper in front of the watching Gareth Southgate. He amounted to a one-man resistance, making two terrific saves from Barnes, thwarting Ben Mee and denying Aaron Lennon a goal against his old employers.\n\nBut Burnley were relentless. Matthew Lowton created three wonderful chances and a through ball was weighted and curled perfectly for the onrushing Barnes to level. “As good a pass as you will see,” said Dyche. It led to a first win in 13 attempts. “Facts are facts,” the Burnley manager added. “It’s been a tough run.” Now, however, Burnley should be safe. “It is a big marker to get to 40 [points] with nine games to go,” Dyche added. Burnley’s future seems secure, Allardyce’s rather less so."}, {"date": "03/03/2018", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31384, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [20]}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrien Silva", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [20], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksander Dragovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fousseni Diabate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [35], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "What a way for a player to prove his class and his commitment to a cause. Whether that cause be his team’s pursuit of points or his own desire to show that he is an elite player to whom the exceptional is routine, Riyad Mahrez delivered the last word here in glorious style, stepping forward seven minutes into stoppage time to curl a sumptuous free-kick into the net and salvage a draw for Leicester.\n\nIt was the Algeria international’s first goal since the stand-off provoked by Manchester City’s attempt to prise him away from Leicester in January. He missed training for more than a week while he digested his disappointment over that thwarted transfer, but since returning he has got on with demonstrating why Pep Guardiola is among his many admirers and why Leicester were so keen to keep him.\n\nHis goal here – a low curler from 25 yards around a four-man wall – could hardly have been better timed for his team. Nor more painfully timed for Bournemouth. Until the 97th minute Eddie Howe’s side were on course to claim three precious points in their bid to stay clear of the relegation zone.\n\nSwansea leap out of the relegation zone by thrashing feeble West Ham Read more\n\nClaude Puel was delighted with what the goal said about Mahrez and the way Leicester handled the transfer hoo-hah. “He has given his best, the same as before the transfer window,” said the Frenchman. “I am proud of him and his team-mates. It was a good thing for the whole squad that he came back with a good spirit. When he came back into the team he had good support from the fans and I think they can see that Riyad is here with us and he can make the difference because he’s a great player but also because he has a good mentality.”\n\nMahrez had also had Leicester’s first chance of the game, pouncing on a loose pass in the 14th minute and racing through on goal. On that occasion he was foiled by Asmir Begovic. That was the home side’s best chance in a first period in which they were second best.\n\nLeicester had struggled to pick a way through packed defences in their two previous league matches here – 1-1 draws against Swansea and Stoke – and Bournemouth were proving more pesky than those visitors: slicker and more adventurous. It was no shock when they scored before the break, Josh King with a penalty after being fouled by Marc Albrighton.\n\nThe visitors’ first-half chances all came after Leicester lost Daniel Amartey to injury in the 20th minute and Albrighton had to shift from left-midfield to right-back. That position is not entirely alien to the Englishman but Bournemouth made it a harrowing reassignment. They first got in behind him through a sweeping move involving Callum Wilson and Charlie Daniels before the latter pulled the ball back to Junior Stanislas, whose shot from 15 yards flew past the top corner. One minute later King fired straight at Kasper Schmeichel after being teed up by Wilson.\n\nTroy Deeney’s late winner for Watford leaves Alan Pardew on brink Read more\n\nLeicester became increasingly dishevelled, losing the central midfield battle and finding it difficult to keep track of the elusive running of Stanislas, King and Wilson. That was never more plain than in the 35th minute, when, after disjointed defending in the face of another incursion by the visitors, Albrighton was beaten to a breaking ball in the box by King and wound up clunking into the forward. King sent Schmeichel the wrong way from the spot.\n\nIt took an hour for Leicester to work up a head of steam. Then they threatened to overwhelm Bournemouth. Wes Morgan missed a couple of awkward headers from close range before Kelechi Iheanacho flicked a shot wide from two yards. Wilson cleared another off the line. “Once we’d weathered that mini-storm I thought we were going to be OK,” said Howe. “But you have to give credit to the moment that [Mahrez] produced. Knowing that it’s probably the last kick of the game, it’s a great strike.”"}, {"date": "03/03/2018", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30335, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wesley Hoedt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua Sims", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guido Carrillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Bednarek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moritz Bauer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Martins Indi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kostas Stafylidis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papa Alioune Ndiaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxim Choupo-Moting", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [23]}], "subs": [{"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [23], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jakob Haugaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Time really is running out for Southampton and Stoke. This stalemate does few favours for either side, with the outlook increasingly bleak after both teams seemingly froze with fear in a dour meeting in which profligacy ruled.\n\nPaul Lambert’s side also had Jack Butland to thank for what the manager described as world‑class saves but the painful reality is Southampton’s attack – nothing short of slapstick in nature at times – failed to infiltrate the leakiest defence in the division.\n\nSaints supporters have had little to shout about on home turf for a while; they have won just four league games here in the past 13 months. This result made history for the wrong reasons: a record eighth successive Premier League home game without victory. With nine matches left, three of which are at home, including Manchester City’s visit on the last day of the season, the numbers are simply not adding up for Mauricio Pellegrino.\n\nSwansea leap out of the relegation zone by thrashing feeble West Ham Read more\n\nAsked whether this stalemate, which keeps his side teetering above the relegation zone, will affect his future as manager, Pellegrino replied: “For me, the most important now is Southampton. This is more important than me. It’s more important than the players, the manager, every single person that works.”\n\nSouthampton were roundly booed off at half-time and at the final whistle, with the worry that they are sleepwalking towards the Championship. Pellegrino is concerned about his players’ mentality but there is no quick fix. “For managers, the easier things are the tactical or technical things to put players on the pitch but to connect with human beings who have their feelings, beliefs and values,” he said. “We have to be behind them, support them and be demanding because, at this level, it’s not easy to be there.”\n\nNeither team was truly rattled in a poor first half but Lambert introduced Peter Crouch at the interval and the former Saints striker made an immediate impact, flicking on a header for Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting to race through on goal, but he scooped the ball harmlessly over Alex McCarthy.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri cut a frustrated figure throughout, none more so than when fuming at Mame Biram Diouf’s failure to latch on to his pass, with the Stoke pair through two on one, with Jack Stephens, the Southampton defender, backpedalling. But Shaqiri supplied Stoke’s attacking vigour, flighting a wonderful diagonal pass for the onrushing Badou Ndiaye, only for the January signing to glance wide.\n\n“He [Shaqiri] excites you when he’s got the ball; he makes things happen and he has been outstanding in the six games I’ve been here,” Lambert said. “He can keep doing his frustration if he keeps doing what he’s been doing, because he’s genuinely a world-class footballer.”\n\nEverton fans turn on Allardyce as Chris Wood completes Burnley comeback Read more\n\nWith full-time approaching, Southampton swarmed the Stoke back line but never with belief – more in a state of panic. Butland superbly denied Nathan Redmond late on, getting a left hand to the Southampton winger’s curling effort before gleefully cradling Josh Sims’s devious low cross, preventing Guido Carrillo, the £19m club-record signing, notching his first goal since arriving from Monaco in January.\n\n“I think he’s the best one around and I think he’s got a fabulous future ahead of him,” Lambert said of the England goalkeeper. “He’s a proper bloke, just a really nice professional, low maintenance and looks after himself.”\n\nThe Southampton substitute Sofiane Boufal squandered the best chance, though, heading wide after leaping high to meet Redmond’s cross. Neither team’s run-in makes for pleasant viewing and, after failing to seize three priceless points here, both are in for an uneasy ride until May."}, {"date": "03/03/2018", "arena": "The Liberty

United as André Ayew, the player they sold to Swansea City in January, inspired Carlos Carvalhal’s team to an emphatic victory that lifts the Welsh club up five places in the table and above their

his West Ham players felt the same way. West Ham were awful, totally outplayed in the first half in particular and unable to come to terms with the intensity of Swansea’s approach.\n\nAndré Ayew, almost inevitability, revelled in the occasion. The £18m club-record signing was involved in three of Swansea’s four goals and left the field to a standing ovation when he was withdrawn 12 minutes from time. Ki Sung-yueng, who was outstanding in the centre of midfield, opened the scoring, Mike van der Hoorn added the second and Andy King marked his first Swansea start since joining on loan from Leicester with the third. André Ayew then won the penalty that led to Jordan, his brother, scoring the fourth.\n\nSadio Mané and Mohamed Salah on target as Liverpool see off Newcastle Read more\n\nAlthough Michail Antonio pulled a goal back for the visitors 11 minutes from time, that was little consolation for Moyes on a hugely disappointing afternoon for the West Ham manager. This was a second successive 4-1 defeat and leaves his side only three points above the relegation zone. To compound a miserable afternoon for the club, Winston Reid left the pitch on a stretcher with a potentially serious knee injury and David Gold, the club’s co-owner, was confronted by an angry supporter as he tried to leave the Liberty Stadium.\n\n“A day of embarrassment,” said Moyes. “It was the worst performance since I’ve been at West Ham. We just never really looked at any time as if we were in control. From a throw-in we lost the first goal – one that I think we should save. We conceded two goals from corner kicks and one from a penalty kick, so from my point of view they were all avoidable. A poor performance and poor all round.”\n\nCarvalhal, in contrast, was in buoyant mood on the back of a seventh consecutive home victory. Referencing the need for Swansea to “dance to the music that opponents put to us‚” the Swansea manager described his team’s performance as “rock and roll”‚ and praised the “collective” rather than singling out André Ayew.\n\n“It looked like we played with 11 brothers on the pitch instead of two,” Carvalhal said.\n\nSwansea got off to a perfect start and, in truth, never looked back. They were ahead within nine minutes after Ki, picking up possession from André Ayew, drilled a low left-footed shot from 22 yards beyond Adrián and into the corner. Although the shot was well-placed, it carried little power and the West Ham goalkeeper should arguably have done better.\n\nRiyad Mahrez’s late stunner snatches Leicester draw against Bournemouth Read more\n\nCarvalhal’s side were denied a second when Declan Rice cleared Federico Fernández’s shot off the line but it was only a temporary reprieve as Swansea continued to pour forward. Adrián repelled André Ayew’s left-footed shot but was powerless to prevent Van der Hoorn from heading in Ki’s corner after Rice allowed the Dutchman to get away from him.\n\nMoyes replaced Patrice Evra with Michail Antonio at the start of the second half to try to give West Ham more of an attacking threat, yet it was Swansea who struck again. André Ayew met Sam Clucas’s corner with a twisting header, forcing Adrián into an instinctive save that ended with the ball dropping invitingly for King to stab home. Jordan Ayew’s penalty, after Cheikhou Kouyaté clumsily brought down André Ayew, embellished the scoreline before Antonio drilled a low shot past Lukasz Fabianski late on."}, {"date": "03/03/2018", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 68311, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [20], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27, 54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Moura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Terence Kongolo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Collin Quaner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [33]}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Rajiv van La Parra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Malone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philip Billing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [33], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The ease with which Spurs won this match might suggest a run-of-the-mill win. But the quality Mauricio Pochettino’s side displayed, in his 100th victory as a Premier League manager, does not deserve to go unremarked upon. Tottenham are purring right now, and Juventus should be worried as they approach their Champions League decider on Wednesday.\n\nA goal from Son Heung-min in each half was the bare minimum the hosts deserved from their 17th consecutive match unbeaten. It was not a lead they ever looked like giving up either, even at 1-0, as attacking prowess was matched by defensive power.\n\nHuddersfield, for their part, were far too meek, clearly struggling to believe they could get anything from the game. Such an assumption was probably correct but it does not reflect well on David Wagner’s men. Their submission was certainly a compliment to Tottenham, however, and shows that Wembley is no longer an advantage for away teams.\n\nSouthampton’s Soufiane Boufal left to hold his head as Stoke escape Read more\n\n“I’m happy with a very professional performance,” Pochettino said. “Our objective was to win three points and we did that. We are in the league table fighting, and in the battle for the top four. I am so pleased with the fantastic run we are on. The fact we can now say Wembley is our home is so important for the team. Playing here last season was a strange feeling but now, both for the fans and for us, it feels like our home. The results here are positive.”\n\nPochettino picked what many consider his strongest side for this match, despite the imminent confrontation with the Italian champions. Partly a reflection of the competitive nature of the league table, it likely also shows his faith in preferred players to get the job done efficiently. With Son’s goals coming in the 27th and 54th minutes, the game was decided soon enough for the manager to give some of his players a rest.\n\nBoth goals were of the highest quality. They also conformed to a similar pattern: advanced Huddersfield possession being disrupted and then converted at the other end in the blink of an eye. Rajiv van La Parra was dispossessed by Christian Eriksen for the first goal, the Dane then poking the ball to Eric Dier. He chipped a pass forward to Harry Kane, who chested down to Dele Alli, who split the defence with a pass to Son, who rounded Jonas Lössl and then finished inside the far post. It was absolutely perfect.\n\nLa Parra was the culpable party for the second goal, too. This time the Dutchman was forced into a misplaced pass by Alli, and the ball was pushed forward to Kane just inside the Huddersfield half. The forward took a touch or two out of his feet then whipped a cross fully 35 yards to the back post where Son, running in, headed it home on the bounce. It was the South Korean’s second headed goal for Spurs and his celebration seemed somewhat muted by shock.\n\nWagner called Kane’s cross “unbelievable”, and was as verbally in awe of his opponents as his team were physically. Wagner did try to affect the game, replacing the winger Collin Quaner after just half an hour. Quaner, who had been forced into playing as a second full-back in a defensive line of six, threw his gloves on the floor as he stormed off.\n\n“At the end we have to say this was a deserved defeat‚” Wagner said. “We were defeated by quality. We’ve tried to confront them with effort, attitude and fighting spirit but this was not enough. For the second goal we had a half-chance, then made a misplaced pass. Then there was an unbelievable pass from Harry Kane and they scored. That says everything about the teams that met today.”\n\nTroy Deeney’s late winner for Watford leaves Alan Pardew on brink Read more\n\nOn Quaner’s reaction to being taken off, Wagner added: “Collin was angry about his performance: he had every reason to be. But he is human. Today wasn’t his day and this is why I reacted.”\n\nSpurs have not lost since their December defeat at Manchester City. Their form has also been continually improving during that time. Their attacking play is now that bit faster, that bit more assertive than in the opening half of the season.\n\nPochettino also appears to be timing things exceptionally well, but he is not one to get carried away. When told that his record of 100 wins from 197 Premier League games is equal to that of Kenny Dalglish, the Argentinian replied with a smile: “Kenny Dalglish is a legend, but I am only a simple man.”"}, {"date": "03/03/2018", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20022, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Orestis Karnezis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Carrillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [54]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dodi Lukebakio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Zeegelaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefano Okaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [54], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Hegazy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Grzegorz Krychowiak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Field", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Alan Pardew did not hang around. As soon as the final whistle blew he headed down the tunnel. Out of sight but, as far as the West Brom supporters here were concerned, not out of mind. “Alan Pardew, get out of our club,” they chanted having bellowed “You’re getting sacked in the morning” at the manager shortly after Troy Deeney had struck. The atmosphere was toxic and, for Pardew, the end feels increasingly near.\n\nThe 56-year-old arrived here with his job on the line and it is hard to see him still being in charge by the time Leicester arrive at The Hawthorns on Saturday. It is now one win in 15 Premier League games since he succeeded Tony Pulis in November with this the first time West Brom have suffered five successive league defeats since January 2011.\n\nEverton fans turn on Allardyce as Chris Wood completes Burnley comeback Read more\n\nThey are stranded further in last place – eight points from safety with nine fixtures remaining – and after everything else that has happened, most notably the squad’s eventful jaunt to Barcelona and Chris Brunt’s row with Pardew following last week’s 2-1 loss to Huddersfield, change may be best for all involved.\n\nThat, ultimately, is a decision for West Brom’s owner, Guochuan Lai, and it is a decision he will have to make after Pardew once again made it clear he will not resign. He accepted losing his job was a potential consequence of the team’s slump but there was more defiance than deflation from the former Crystal Palace manager following a display which he described as committed and a huge improvement on the one his players delivered seven days ago.\n\nPardew was correct. While West Brom may have enjoyed less possession than Watford and created fewer chances, they were arguably the better side. Having been told by Brunt during that dressing-room row that 4-4-2 did not work, Pardew started the Northern Irishman in a 4-1‑4-1 formation through which the visitors displayed admirable organisation, resilience and dedication to the cause.\n\nOperating as a left-sided central midfielder, Brunt was their best performer but there were other notable displays from those in blue and white. Ahmed Hegazi was solid at the back while Jake Livermore and Grzegorz Krychowiak worked hard to close down Watford’s midfielders. Out wide, meanwhile, Matt Phillips and Jay Rodriguez were a constant threat, while up front Salomón Rondón worked hard in an isolated role.\n\nUltimately, however, it is Rondón who may well have the biggest regrets regarding West Brom’s failure to secure at least a point. The Venezuelan spurned a number of chances to score, none more glaring than the header from Kieran Gibbs’s cross on 54 minutes that he sent wide of the post from a close-range, unmarked position.\n\nIt felt like a big moment and even more so after the final whistle, with Pardew not only ruing his side’s lack of ruthlessness in front of goal but also the moment on 71 minutes when Daryl Janmaat and Rodriguez collided as the latter attempted to meet Phillips’s cross.\n\nPardew was adamant Janmaat, who he briefly worked with at Newcastle, had fouled Rodriguez and, therefore, the referee, Paul Tierney, should have awarded his side a penalty.\n\nSouthampton’s Soufiane Boufal left to hold his head as Stoke escape Read more\n\nIt was not to be and soon after Watford struck. Krychowiak lost possession to Will Hughes in midfield who in turn played a quick through pass to Deeney. The striker ran clear of West Brom’s backline and, having kept his cool, curled the ball past the onrushing Ben Foster and into the back of the net for his second winning goal in two games here.\n\nPardew described the goal as West Brom’s one mistake of a bitterly cold afternoon and it was certainly a cruel moment for the visitors given Watford had produced little threat before Deeney’s finish, with a shot from Stefano Okaka on 75 minutes that Gibbs cleared off the line the best they had offered.\n\nNot that the home supporters cared. Having roared with delight in response to a goal that lifts them up to ninth, they turned their attention to the opposition manager. It soon spread to the away end and all Pardew could do was stand motionless and look on. His suffering may soon be over.\n\n‘This is about West Brom, not me’\n\nAlan Pardew has accepted his job as the West Brom manager is on the line following the 1-0 loss to Watford but has insisted he can still save the team from seemingly inevitable relegation.\n\nIt is now one win in 15 Premier League games for Pardew since he succeeded Tony Pulis in November with Albion having suffered five straight league defeats. They are bottom, eight points from safety and look increasingly doomed.\n\nAs does Pardew, who was nevertheless defiant here and made it clear that he expects to be in charge when Leicester visit The Hawthorns on Saturday.\n\n“People turn this into a personal situation, but this is about West Brom, not me,” he said. “If the consequences are that I lose my job that is what it is. I just hope what we saw today will be enough.\n\n“In terms of difference in performance this week from last week, it was a huge improvement. Today was a committed performance and unfortunately we have come out the wrong side.\n\n“We have nine games to play and there are still a lot of points to play for. If we get a win that can change the dynamic, but when you look at our win and goals ratio you question that. So we have to try and get that win.”\n\nThere was sympathy for Pardew from Javi Gracia after he oversaw a third successive home win as Watford manager and one that lifts the team to ninth. “I respect Alan Pardew and wish him the best for the future,” said the Spaniard."}, {"date": "03/03/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53287, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Loris

"sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Liverpool were not at their sparking best on a bitterly cold and slightly foggy evening on Merseyside, though partly thanks to Mohamed Salah keeping up his scoring run they were too lively for Newcastle and are now up to second in the table. Their supporters probably do not expect them to stay there for very long but the significance of this result, apart from bringing up 200 Premier League goals under Jürgen Klopp, is that should Chelsea lose to Manchester City on Sunday there will be a seven-point cushion between Liverpool and the dreaded fifth place. Unless Chelsea win, in fact, the fight for top-four places could be as good as over.\n\nEarly interest was provided by the question of how quickly Salah could get onto the scoresheet. The Egypt international had scored in each of his last six Liverpool games before Saturday, and one more here took him to 32 in all competitions this season, exactly the same as the entire Newcastle team have managed thus far.\n\nChances were unlikely to be abundant with Newcastle falling back into a flat back five when they were without the ball, which was most of the time, but Salah got his first sight of goal after 11 minutes and managed to catch Paul Dummett in the face with his shot. A couple of minutes later Emre Can hoisted a ball forward from halfway that allowed Salah to easily run through Newcastle’s square defence, only to put his first-time half-volley into the side-netting.\n\nLiverpool 2-0 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nNewcastle were content to do more defending than attacking, though there was one moment midway through the first half when DeAndre Yedlin was able to show off his startling pace, kicking the ball past Andrew Robertson and beating the Liverpool left-back to it even after taking the long way round.\n\nAfter Dejan Lovren brought a save from Martin Dubravka with a header from a corner there was another chance for Salah when Can dispossessed Yedlin. Roberto Firmino found Salah in the area, but in attempting to guide the ball around Kenedy he gave Florian Lejeune the opportunity to intercept.\n\nThe visitors had a lucky escape when Dubravka came for a Salah corner and missed, the ball travelling harmlessly across goal and out of play for a goal-kick, before a measured pass from Virgil van Dijk almost played Roberston into the area from half way, the full-back just failing to control the ball with a headed touch.\n\nIt was clear that Liverpool would not be kept at bay for long, and the breakthrough finally arrived five minutes from the interval. Naturally it was Salah who applied the finishing touch, though Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain deserves credit for seizing on a loose ball following a Newcastle mistake in the centre-circle and powering instinctively towards goal. At first he looked to be shaping for a shot, but as Mo Diamé closed in the Liverpool midfielder released the ball to the fractionally better placed Salah, whose low left-foot shot went through the goalkeeper’s legs.\n\nGoing behind ought to have forced Newcastle to play with a little more adventure, though at times this season Rafa Benítez’s priority has been to keep the margin of defeat to a minimum with an eye on the eventual goal difference. Things could be that tight at the end of the season, though in fairness Newcastle almost managed an instant reply on the stroke of the interval. Diamé was on target with a shot from the edge of the area after beating Can to the ball, and Newcastle would have been level but for Loris Karius leaping to his right to make a last-gasp one handed save.\n\nSon Heung-min steers Tottenham to comfortable win over Huddersfield Read more\n\nThe second half began in the same way as the first, with Newcastle keeping everyone except Dwight Gayle behind the ball and denying Liverpool space to run into. Allowing them to dominate possession when they boast forwards as tricky as Salah, Firmino and Sadio Mané is a risky strategy, however, and the home side had already been denied a fair claim for a penalty when Mané extended their lead in the 55th minute. Salah’s shot clearly hit Jamaal Lascelles on the arm as the centre-half tried to fling himself in the way, though as he was in the process of turning his back and not looking at the ball it was probably reasonable of Graham Scott to allow him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nNewcastle respite was brief. Mané started the move which led to the second goal, then moved into the area to finish it following a neat final ball from Firmino. Newcastle were expecting the ball to be moved out wide, though in typically Brazilian fashion Firmino went for the more difficult option, the pass to feet through the middle, and Benítez’s defenders had no answer to such eye-of-the-needle precision.\n\nNeither was there any attempt to throw caution to the wind and fight back. One misplaced Isaac Hayden header was the sum of Newcastle’s attacking efforts in the second half. Salah might have won a penalty right at the end, though Lascelles’ foul was actually outside the box and the referee appeared to be unsighted. In three returns to Anfield Benítez has never before finished on the losing side; this time he surrendered quietly.\n\nLascelles should have received red card, says Klopp\n\nJürgen Klopp described Jamaal Lascelles as “a lucky man” after his stoppage-time foul on Mohamed Salah went unpunished.\n\nThe Liverpool manager initially thought his player deserved a penalty and was fuming on the touchline, though replays suggested the challenge had occurred outside the area. Yet Lascelles was clearly the last defender and Salah in a position to score so Klopp was confused as to why Graham Scott failed to take any action.\n\n“I can see now it wasn’t a penalty but it was 100% a red card,” Klopp said. “The Newcastle defender is a lucky man to be able to play the next game.”\n\nRafa Benítez rather diplomatically suggested the referee might not have had a clear view, though privately he must have taken a dim view of Lascelles’ action when the game was all but over and Newcastle cannot afford to have their captain and best defender suspended.\n\n“I didn’t get a good view of the incident and maybe the referee was the same,” the Newcastle manager said. “Overall I was happy with the team’s workrate but I can’t be happy with the result. A gameplan has to be good for 90 minutes, not just 40. You can never guarantee you will not make mistakes, and against top sides you will pay for that.”\n\nThe managers agreed a save by Loris Karius from Mo Diamé at the end of the first half was a key point in the game. “That would have been a perfect moment for Newcastle to score and a bad time for us to concede,” Klopp said. “Loris is an outstanding goalkeeper who happened not to make a good start to his Liverpool career. I believe in him, though, the save was almost as good as scoring a goal. I would be the biggest idiot in the world to keep lining him up if he wasn’t good enough.”"}, {"date": "01/03/2018", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 58420, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [32], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [53], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Holding", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edward Nketiah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [19], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [28], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Foden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The countdown has started. Manchester City now need just five wins from their remaining 10 games to secure a third Premier League title in seven years. If everything goes as serenely as it has done for most of the season, they could sew it up at Tottenham Hotspur on the night of Saturday 14 April. Circle it in your diary. It would be the coronation of a superbly slick and worthy champion team and the latest layer to Pep Guardiola’s managerial legend.\n\nArsenal’s bad old habits prove their undoing once again in City defeat | Nick Ames Read more\n\nAs for Arsenal, a more macabre countdown is in train. Arsène Wenger has pledged to fight into next season – the last on his managerial contract – but nobody believes he can stay beyond the summer. On this evidence, his players are the principal naysayers.\n\nAfter the 3-0 humbling at City’s hands in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final, they needed a performance to restore a measure of pride. Instead they got another one of those 90 minutes when their fragility was exposed in glaring fashion.\n\nArsenal have not lost this heavily at home to City since they dropped the Woolwich from their name, but there was nothing surprising about the result. Their self-belief has come to feel non-existent and the manner in which they were picked off by City in the first half reflected the sense of drift.\n\nLeroy Sané made the difference. The City winger helped set up goals for Bernardo Silva and David Silva before he scored the third himself and Arsenal were left to consider a 30-point chasm that has opened up between themselves and their opponents.\n\nIt was an occasion when the home support appeared to vote with their feet. The Emirates was half-empty and at kick-off time there was the feel of an early round cup replay. The biting cold was a factor but – on paper, at least – this was one of the showpiece fixtures of the season. The low attendance laid bare the supporter disenchantment.\n\nWenger’s team had actually started well. With Aaron Ramsey prominent, they hustled and probed. Ramsey cut back a cross that hit Vincent Kompany and forced Ederson into a smart save while Henrikh Mkhitaryan also worked the City goalkeeper.\n\nBut it took only one flicker from City to see them in front and, very quickly, Arsenal’s confidence disintegrated. “You go up by the stairs, you go down by the lift,” Wenger said of the difficulty in building belief and the ease with which it can slide.\n\nArsenal’s movement and spontaneity abandoned them, but not nearly as noticeably as their resolve at the back. It felt as though City would score with every forward thrust before the interval.\n\nSané was the catalyst. Showing his balance, control and acceleration, he left three Arsenal players for dead before working it wide right for Bernardo Silva. Sead Kolasinac decided to show the winger inside, on to his favoured left foot, and the finish was curled beautifully into the far corner.\n\nArsenal 0-3 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nArsenal tried to look forwards and they had half-chances in the first half. But they were cut to shreds on the counterattack and, if it was easy to wince at the defending, it was also pertinent to scrutinise the lack of defensive midfield cover. Arsenal were grotesquely open.\n\nThat said, City’s cohesion and ruthlessness was really something. Sané was the architect of the second goal, dropping his shoulder to destroy Shkodran Mustafi before squaring for Sergio Agüero. He touched through for David Silva, who fired high inside Petr Cech’s near post. City’s third came with indecent haste. Agüero spun clear and they worked the ball with precision via Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker to Sané, who had got in on Héctor Bellerín’s blindside. He finished almost apologetically.\n\nAgüero ought to have added a fourth before the interval, only to be denied by Cech, and there were the inevitable boos from the home crowd at half-time. A small section of the Arsenal support chanted that their players were not fit to wear the shirt.\n\nArsenal even threw in a penalty miss early in the second-half – Ederson springing to his left to deny Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, after Nicolás Otamendi had fouled Mkhitaryan – and it would have been worse for them had Cech not saved from Agüero on 78 minutes. The stadium was practically empty of Arsenal fans at full-time but those who did stay jeered the players as they left the field.

The England striker had endured the type of afternoon that would send most forwards apologetically back into their shells, a pair of misses from point-blank range surely playing on his mind as Tottenham ran aground on a blanket defence. Yet Roy Hodgson, frantically reorganising his back-line as the contest drifted towards its denouement, must have known how this tends to play out.\n\nThe Crystal Palace manager, when in charge of the national team, had once looked to Kane to salvage situations and here was the striker peeling away from the clutter in the six-yard box at Christian Eriksen’s late corner to eke out space at the far post.\n\nDamien Delaney, a 36-year-old thrown into a rare appearance off the bench after the excellent James Tomkins had cramped up making a clearance, seemed to lose his bearings as he stared into the glare of the early afternoon sun. He should still have been stronger but he twisted too late in trying to stifle his opponent. Kane had squeezed out enough room in which to work.\n\nCrystal Palace 0-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHis header was cushioned delightfully to arc back beyond Wayne Hennessey, via a touch of the goalkeeper’s glove, and over Christian Benteke and James McArthur on the line to ripple the far corner of the net.\n\nKane’s 11th goal in 10 games, 24th in the league this season and 150th of his club career, was ultimately a thing of delicate beauty, even if Hodgson spent what little time remained thumping his head back against his seat in the dug-out spitting livid frustration. “Harry’s character made him keep pushing to achieve what we needed,” said Mauricio Pochettino. “All talented players miss chances but what makes a top player different is that, when he makes a mistake, he forgets about it almost immediately and takes the next.”\n\nSpurs, now on their best unbeaten run since 1999 at 15 matches, were thankful for his stubborn refusal to wilt. They had monopolised the ball in a contest that had long since degenerated into an exercise of attack versus defence but were starting to run out of ideas when their reward was plucked from the game’s last knockings. Dele Alli had been reduced to seeking out contact in the penalty area – the midfielder might have had an argument for an award but for his increasingly familiar tendency to over-elaborate the collapse to the turf, which may be dissuading officials from making decisions in his favour – with Hennessey and Palace’s rejigged rearguard was thwarting everything flung at them.\n\nThose two Kane misses felt more significant with every block or save mustered by the hosts, Tottenham’s anxiety rather summed up by Serge Aurier further blighting an erratic display with a trio of foul throws.\n\nPalace had handed Kane his first chance when Patrick van Aanholt sliced an attempted clearance from Alli’s diagonal to the forward’s feet, only for Hennessey to dart out and deflect the shot over the bar. Early in the second half a period of Spurs possession had culminated in Eriksen’s delivery, lofted into the six-yard box with the outside of his left boot, only for Kane, his body shape uncharacteristically awkward, to plant his volley wide. It was to his credit that he summoned the composure to score at the end and give the visitors the win they merited.\n\nEven Hodgson would not deny Tottenham had “the best of the play and created all the chances”, though the finale still felt cruel. Palace, outside the bottom three only on goal difference with Manchester United and Chelsea to face next, had been denied 12 senior players through injury even before Tomkins hobbled away with “severe cramp”. Aaron Wan-Bissaka had been asked to quell Eriksen’s considerable threat on senior debut, the first Palace academy graduate to make a full league debut for the club in 2,148 days – a rather stark statistic – and performed capably, but all the hard work and endeavour of the collective went only so far.\n\nThey had harried and hassled admirably, threatening occasionally through Andros Townsend’s pace or Alexander Sørloth’s muscular running, but mental and physical fatigue kicked in before the end. All the chopping and changing eventually took its toll. Hodgson may have Martin Kelly back from a hamstring injury against United next Monday, when Timothy Fosu-Mensah is ineligible, and Jeffrey Schlupp is due to resume training. The manager is still none the wiser as to when Mamadou Sakho, whose wife gave birth to the couple’s third child in France last week, will feel ready to test his calf in competitive action again.\n\nThese are increasingly desperate times and, given the fixtures ahead, the situation is likely to worsen before it can improve. “After seven games we were eight points adrift and at least now we’re level,” said Hodgson. “If we get the players back who are unfit at the moment, who knows? In our best moments, with our best team, we can be quite effective.” Their run-in is going to be excruciatingly tense."}, {"date": "25/02/2018", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75060,

a win that took Manchester United back into second place ahead of Liverpool.\n\nThe creator was Romelu Lukaku, his neat cross finding the substitute, after the No 9’s first goal for United against top-six opposition had cancelled out Willian’s opener.\n\nJosé Mourinho praised a fine display from his centre-forward. “He played fantastically well. He had in my opinion the same start as the team, the team didn’t start well and it happened to him: he was losing some balls in the first control. He was a little bit lost but then he went together with the team – improving, improving.”\n\nThe victory means Chelsea slip to fifth and United are six points clear of the London club in the race to secure a Champions League place.\n\nManchester United 2-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAfter Mourinho (perhaps studiously) failed to namecheck Antonio Conte in his programme notes there was a pre- and post-match handshake between the feuding pair and they were later seen sharing a smile. The United manager made two changes: Anthony Martial replaced Juan Mata and Paul Pogba was reinstated for the injured Ander Herrera after being dropped for the draw at Sevilla. Conte stood down Pedro for Álvaro Morata and Cesc Fàbregas for Danny Drinkwater.\n\nIt was the latter who prompted Chelsea’s opening foray, with a sweeping ball that won a corner. It came to nothing, yet when the visitors next attacked David de Gea was beaten.\n\nFortunately for United the bar was not, with a fluid move in which Eden Hazard found Marcos Alonso on the left ending when Morata volleyed the ball off the woodwork from his team-mate’s first-time delivery.\n\nFrom here United gained a foothold. Anthony Martial, Lukaku, Alexis Sánchez and Nemanja Matic all began to see the ball. When Sánchez floated in a diagonal free-kick, though, it went straight into Thibaut Courtois’s hands.\n\nPogba’s opening contribution was to find Antonio Valencia along the right and after he crossed Sánchez might have done better with Lukaku’s chest-down.\n\nThe early exchanges were open. Chelsea utilised wide areas to create space, with Victor Moses probing near United’s goal on the right.\n\nUnited emerged from the ensuing lull on top. Lukaku twice received the ball in a threatening position but his first touch, then a lack of space, blunted his potency. Sánchez was guilty of a bad miss when arriving late for a Martial pass. The Chilean had only to stab home either side of Courtois; instead he dribbled the ball straight to the goalkeeper.\n\nPogba’s best moment of the half drew a yellow card for N’Golo Kanté. Yet after his barracking run caused the midfielder to foul him, disaster for Pogba and delight for Chelsea followed.\n\nValencia dinked in a cross and Willian headed clear. Yet after Pogba failed to challenge, the ball went again to the Brazilian and he found Hazard. After galloping alongside his team-mate in the inside-right channel, possession came back to him via a delightful return pass from the Belgian. Now, Willian took a touch and smashed the ball home past De Gea, who should have done better, the ball passing near enough to his body for it to be repelled.\n\nA fine equaliser was soon to follow, though. This was intricate, impressive stuff. Matic found Sánchez, whose precise ball hit Martial’s feet and when his equally exact pass went to Lukaku, the Belgian scored his 22nd United goal.\n\nThat meant United began the second half in classic Mourinho stick-or-twist territory. Despite being the home side and proud progenitors of attack-first football, this is just not the Portuguese’s default mode.\n\nHis team, though, did go for the win. Pogba threaded a ball forward, Sánchez collected on the area’s edge and the home crowd responded noisily. Next zipped passes between Matic, Pogba and Sánchez moved United forward at a rare speed. The attack eventually led to a corner from which Sánchez committed the cardinal sin of hitting the first defender.\n\nHarry Kane leaves it late for Spurs in win over Crystal Palace Read more\n\nDe Gea atoned for his earlier error by saving a Drinkwater shot that came dipping in the mid-afternoon sun, in what was a warning to the home side.\n\nFor the last 25 minutes Mourinho introduced Lingard for Martial. His first contribution was to dispossess Willian and launch a United attack.\n\nThey were finishing the stronger. Scott McTominay outmuscled Hazard and Chelsea were spun out of position. When the ball eventually came to Sánchez his pivot-cross was hammered instantly at Courtois by Lukaku.\n\nFour minutes from time Morata scored a goal that was adjudged offside. Conte said: “Yeah, but for sure it was onside – this type of situation can change the final result and for this reason I am very positive they should use VAR.”\n\nHe did confirm that Hazard’s earlier substitution was not for an injury. “It was a tactical decision,” Conte said."}, {"date": "24/02/2018", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31769, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City",

goalkeeper but his uncharacteristic blunder here did not help either of those prospects. Everything was looking rosy for Stoke until the 70th minute thanks to a beautiful goal by Xherdan Shaqiri but things grew thorny when Butland fumbled a cross by Marc Albrighton into his own goal.\n\nPaul Lambert and several Stoke players put their heads in their hands, barely believing the error they had witnessed from their normally reliable goalkeeper. All Butland could do was get up and get better and, to his credit, that is what he did, producing several fine saves to stop Leicester from claiming all three points. The draw, in the end, was a fair result but a deeply frustrating one for Stoke, who would have climbed out of the bottom three with a win.\n\nSteve Mounié and Huddersfield push Alan Pardew to brink at West Brom Read more\n\nLambert felt no need to criticise Butland, choosing instead to file the game-changing gaffe as a rare mishap from an outstanding player. “Butland, for my opinion, is the best goalkeeper in Britain, without a shadow of a doubt,” said the manager. “He will make mistakes like any other footballer. But more importantly, he’s a top-class keeper and a top-class guy around about the football club. He’s an absolutely brilliant goalkeeper. I’m just disappointed he’s not Scottish.”\n\nIf the late saves that Butland made suggested that Stoke can rely on him to keep his standards high for the remainder of their fight against relegation, other plus points also emerged for Lambert from this game. The most obvious was the form of Shaqiri, whose third goal in three matches showed the Swiss international is coming to the fore in his team’s time of need.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Xherdan Shaqiri celebrates after his opener. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Images\n\nShaqiri’s goal was a gem. Joe Allen helped to craft it, dispossessing Wilfred Ndidi by the touchline before feeding Shaqiri, who scurried infield and curled a low shot beyond Kasper Schmeichel and into the bottom corner from 25 yards. “It was a world-class goal and he’s a world-class footballer,” said Lambert.\n\nUntil that goal, the first half had been mostly dismal, characterised by sloppy passing, especially from Leicester. The meagre flair on show came from Riyad Mahrez, who seemed determined to prove his worth on his first Premier League start since last month’s thwarted transfer to Manchester City. But neither he nor anyone else looked like making a breakthrough for the home side.\n\nStoke have conceded more goals than any other team in the Premier League this season but for most of this match their defence was not in peril. That was partly because of the protection provided by a sturdy midfield trio of Allen, Badou Ndiaye and Geoff Cameron, but also because of the failings of Leicester, who did not test a back four in which Kostas Stafylidis was making his first start since his arrival from Augsburg in January and Bruno Martins Indi was returning from a long injury lay-off and had to hobble off again before the end.\n\nLeicester City 1-1 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe hosts could have fallen further behind in the 54th minute when the ever-dynamic Allen beat Matty James to a shanked clearance by Schmeichel. The Welshman again gave Shaqiri rapid service and the Swiss tried to fire into the net from 35 yards before Schmeichel got back to his goal, but the shot went wide.\n\nEventually Leicester improved. But it still took Butland’s blunder to bring them level. After that, however, the goalkeeper foiled Mahrez by flinging himself to his right to tip away a fine shot. Harry Maguire then cracked a shot off a post. Kurt Zouma made an excellent block to prevent Mahrez from having the last word, and James headed against a post. Stoke finished up clinging on for a draw, and wishing Butland had been able to hold on to Albrighton’s cross."}, {"date": "24/02/2018", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10808, "home_team":

teams made arguments for both the prosecution and the defence in a lively draw.\n\nNewcastle, quite simply, should have won after taking a two-goal half-time lead with a double from Dwight Gayle. Only after Jonjo Shelvey missed a chance to wrap up victory, with 10 minutes remaining, did Bournemouth begin to threaten, but two goals followed in a final blitz that left Rafael Benítez apoplectic on the touchline.\n\nSteve Mounié and Huddersfield push Alan Pardew to brink at West Brom Read more\n\nBournemouth did not perform well enough in this match, and hardly for the first time this term. But neither did they lose their belief or willingness for the fight. Which of these two factors prove to be the more telling come season’s end will be a subject that lingers on Eddie Howe’s mind.\n\n“My heart is being tested to the max this season‚” the Bournemouth manager said. “Today was tough. We weren’t good enough for 70 minutes, to be honest, but once again I have to praise the character, the spirit and the attitude in the team to come back. It’s not easy in this division to do that.\n\n“We played a team that’s in and around us and it’s very important you don’t get beat. It was a massive 20 minutes for us. The substitutes made a big difference, we changed system, and suddenly we were able to turn the screw and pen them in their own half, which is what we had wanted to do earlier but couldn’t.”\n\nNewcastle opened the scoring after 17 minutes and Shelvey started it with a perfect pass from the halfway line. Matt Ritchie latched on to the ball on the dash and, as the ball reached the byline, hit a first-time cross low towards the penalty spot where Gayle backheeled it home at the second time of asking.\n\nJack Butland’s own-goal blunder costs Stoke victory at Leicester Read more\n\nThe lead was doubled in injury time. Again Ritchie was involved, the former Bournemouth favourite returning a Paul Dummett delivery low across goal. Asmir Begovic misjudged the ball and let it pass through him. Gayle, in roughly the same place as before, this time scored decisively.\n\nBenítez was in full micromanagement mode throughout the first half, snapping instructions at his defence even when they were in no position to hear them. After his team also controlled the first 25 minutes of the second half, Benítez looked to close the game down, withdrawing Gayle for the midfielder Isaac Hayden with 20 minutes to go. This plan did not work as the home side pushed on and a previously resolute Newcastle buckled.\n\nThe game had entered the final 10 minutes when Shelvey had his fateful moment, spooning the ball over the bar from six yards on the counterattack. Bournemouth pushed back up the other end and, after Josh King created space on the left, a cute flick from Lewis Cook teed up substitute Adam Smith, who curled the ball calmly in off the underside of the bar.\n\nBenítez reinforced his strategy to the players again but Bournemouth kept coming. In the 89th minute another cross went all the way across the box and was turned back by Simon Francis to Nathan Aké. The Dutchman found Dan Gosling in far too much room and the midfielder rifled home.\n\nAfter a dominant performance was undermined by momentary weakness, Benítez, too, has his dichotomies to resolve. “We miss a chance, we concede a goal and we lose control in the match‚” he said. “We didn’t switch off but there was a lack of concentration. It’s not easy to do everything perfect and sometimes you have to credit an opponent but we need to learn quickly to manage that situation in a different way.”"}, {"date": "24/02/2018", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30523, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ezequiel Schelotto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [85], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [18, 69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Goldson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jürgen Locadia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike van der Hoorn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [36]}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tammy Abraham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [36], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chalk up another win for Chris Hughton over Carlos Carvalhal, in one of football’s most pleasant rivalries. When the Swansea manager was in charge of Sheffield Wednesday, the two competed good-naturedly for Championship promotion, but in six games the Portuguese only won one.\n\nMake that one from seven now, after Brighton’s comfortable 4-1 win, inspired by a Glenn Murray double and delivered via a team performance to nourish souls on the south coast. The result pulled Brighton further away from the relegation zone but dunked Carvalhal’s men back into it, a reminder that their recent run of fine form will not be enough for survival.\n\nDwight Gayle’s Newcastle double cancelled out by late Bournemouth rally Read more\n\nOne of Brighton’s problems this season has been goals but they scored four here and the victory might have been even more emphatic. “We could have got more, and there haven’t been too many occasions when we could say that,” said Hughton.\n\nAnd yet the key moment of the game probably came just before the break, when Brighton were only 1-0 up and a low drive from Swansea’s Jordan Ayew hit the post, then rebounded on to the Brighton keeper, Mat Ryan. On a lucky day for the visitors that would have trickled in but it merely popped out to Martin Olsson, who dragged his follow-up wide.\n\nFrom there Carvalhal was forced to change his system to go for goals, which did not come, and open his side up at the back. The Portuguese manager can usually be relied upon for an eccentric analogy for his side’s performance but this time we had to settle for something more conventional. “When you bet that high you can win all the money or lose it,” he said. “We knew if we scored one we could change the game. We gambled in the game and lost the gamble.”\n\nThe goals from the 34-year-old Murray were his sixth and seventh in his last nine games, and took him to 10 for the season: for what it’s worth, that’s one more goal than Alexandre Lacazette, and in less time. Murray gave Brighton the lead when Mike van der Hoorn brainlessly blundered into the small of his back in the 18th minute, Mike Dean pointed to the spot and Murray casually stroked the kick down the middle. The second came after José Izquierdo and Pascal Gross combined smartly down the left, the former cut back to Murray in the middle and he swept home.\n\nThis was a curiously disjointed game for long spells, frustration growing at some points in the stands after missed chances and a series of minor but unfavourable refereeing decisions. Indeed, the home fans gave referee Dean a standing ovation when one did go in their favour: as a man who tends to shirk attention, he was presumably very embarrassed.\n\nBrighton put the result way beyond doubt when the impressive Gross played in Anthony Knockaert, who flicked delicately home with the outside of his left foot.\n\nMohamed Salah strike helps Liverpool to resounding win over West Ham Read more\n\nSwansea were ragged by this point, looking nothing like the side who have been revived by Carvalhal. This was just their second defeat in eight league games under the Portuguese, but it was a performance more reminiscent of the previous 20.\n\nA Lewis Dunk own goal – his fourth of the season, a joint-record in the Premier League era – represented a late consolation for Swansea, but that was rendered even more meaningless when the substitute Jürgen Locadia turned home a fourth in the final minute.\n\n“It’s big that we can kill games off,” said Hughton. “My first full season here in the Championship, we just missed out on promotion and we put that down to too many draws. At the moment, we’re in good form.”\n\nGood form indeed. They are now unbeaten in six and this result inched them towards the top half of the table. They face Arsenal next Sunday, and bearing in mind how easily Swansea beat Arsène Wenger’s side a few weeks ago, don’t rule out an even bigger win then."}, {"date": "24/02/2018", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 20982, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [67], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georges-Kevin N'Koudou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Marney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wesley Hoedt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guido Carrillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jérémy Pied", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Bednarek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua Sims", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Sean Dyche was left to rue events outside his control after struggling Southampton snatched a contentious late point. Turf Moor bore witness to controversy rather than quality on an afternoon when the hosts looked to edge victory through Ashley Barnes’s second‑half header. However, Burnley’s winless run stretched to 12 matches in all competitions after the substitute Manolo Gabbiadini rifled home to secure his relegation‑threatened side a 1-1 draw at the death.\n\nThe referee Bobby Madley’s accidental block on Ashley Westwood was key in the break that brought the visitors’ leveller, one of several decisions that irked the Burnley manager. “Another interesting afternoon,” Dyche said. “I thought we’d done enough to win the game. Without being brilliant, we were solid today. You can only control the controllables. There were things out of our control today that went against us.\n\n“I feel for the fans today, because they just want an even contest ... The game is petering out to a nice win, really. Apart from Nick Pope making a fantastic save, I think we’ve delivered a good enough performance today to get a win.”\n\nDwight Gayle’s Newcastle double cancelled out by late Bournemouth rally Read more\n\nDyche was aggrieved by the Southampton goalkeeper, Alex McCarthy, going unpunished for handling outside the penalty area and felt his side should have got a penalty for a push on Barnes before his opener. “The moment the referee unfortunately gets hit, that puts them on the counter,” the Burnley manager continued. “Then [as] the ball is pulled back, Kevin Long is pulled by his shirt and he goes down. There’s not a lot in that, by the way, but it’s important to reference the whole league when everyone goes down and gets a free-kick for that normally, which we didn’t.\n\n“Then Barnes gets pulled down at the end by his shoulders right at the death, so it’s hard. We can’t control those moments, so you’re bound to be a bit aggrieved and you can see the fans were today.”\n\nGlenn Murray scores twice to help buoyant Brighton down Swansea Read more\n\nMauricio Pellegrino understood Dyche’s frustrations, but the Southampton manager said such moments are “part of football” and that a draw was fair. “The game was really tight from the beginning until the end,” the Argentinian said. “I imagined this type of game, because they are a team that don’t concede too much. Defensively they are really well organised and they try to put their opponent under pressure with direct play and second balls. In this aspect, they are maybe a little bit better than us.\n\n“We were really focused mentally, we played with aggressiveness but we were a little bit nervous and didn’t play in the way we can do. In the second half, we start to do a little bit better, we created a couple of chances. In the way we equalised, I think it’s a fair result.”"}, {"date": "24/02/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53256, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Loris Karius",

"Leapfrogging Manchester United into second was “a nice moment” for Jürgen Klopp but Liverpool’s response to pressure from West Ham and their Champions League chasing rivals felt much nicer. “The other teams are flying,” he said. “So we have to fly as well.” Here was another example of Liverpool’s ability to soar.\n\nVictory ultimately came at a canter for Klopp’s team at Anfield, where the remaining fab three of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané were all on the scoresheet once again and David Moyes endured a 15th game here without a win. Yet this was a test of Liverpool’s character as well as the established quality of their mesmerising attack.\n\nTroy Deeney’s goal earns Watford narrow win over Everton Read more\n\nWest Ham caused problems at both ends of the pitch in the first half and were unfortunate not to take the lead through Marko Arnautovic. After the restart, however, and amid a howling wind, West Ham were blown away by the power of a Liverpool team that can score four and miss several more even when shy of their fluent best. Liverpool now have 103 goals for the season. Salah has 31, as many as Luis Suárez scored in his most prolific campaign for the club in 2013-14.\n\nKlopp said: “To get the points was very important. We all put pressure on each other with results. We have no time to rest, no time to waste one point. It is really intense for all the teams involved. I don’t think United and Chelsea will think too much about us but they know we are around. I would have taken a 1-0 today with West Ham hitting the post four times and Loris Karius making 20 saves because we need the points. West Ham is in a really good moment and have had fantastic results against the other top teams so to play a game like this today I do not take for granted.”\n\nMoyes’ plan was to defend in numbers and use the polished linkup play of Arnautovic, João Mário and Manuel Lanzini on the counterattack. It succeeded to a degree before the interval, with Liverpool often contained and unnerved when the visitors broke, but could have been undone after 140 seconds when Salah struck the inside of a post via the fingertips of Adrián.\n\nMinutes later Virgil van Dijk headed straight at the West Ham goalkeeper from a James Milner corner and at that point it seemed Anfield was set for another Liverpool onslaught. Last-ditch defending and an impressive display from Arnautovic delayed it, although their defence was eventually breached by a set piece when Emre Can headed home Salah’s corner at close range.\n\nThe Germany midfielder misplaced several headers in the first half but not the one that mattered and brought up Liverpool’s 100th goal of the season. Can rose above Patrice Evra to open the scoring – the 36-year-old was making his West Ham debut having had his contract terminated by Marseille and was booed throughout by a home crowd that continues to blame him for Suárez being banned for racial abuse.\n\nDwight Gayle’s Newcastle double cancelled out by late Bournemouth rally Read more\n\nArnautovic had almost opened the scoring with a glorious chip that Karius tipped superbly on to his crossbar. Pablo Zabaleta also went close and the Liverpool goalkeeper denied Arnautovic a second time as the West Ham travelling section, sporting commemorative T-shirts to mark the 25th anniversary of Bobby Moore’s death, went into half-time with hope that vanished quickly after the restart.\n\nSalah struck Liverpool’s second when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain steered the ball into his path inside the area. The Egypt international took one touch to make space for himself then cut a left-footed shot back across goal, through the legs of Aaron Cresswell and inside the far corner.\n\nThe third arrived shortly afterwards as the wind and weak West Ham defending helped Firmino to his 13th Premier League goal of the season. Adrián’s free-kick held up in the Anfield breeze and Mário attempted to control but was easily dispossessed by Can, who swept an inch-perfect chip in to the unmarked Firmino. The Brazilian sidestepped the onrushing keeper and calmly converted into an empty goal.\n\nThe West Ham substitute Michail Antonio made an immediate impact when he took a Cheikhou Kouyaté pass down the right and found the far corner with a low shot across Karius.\n\nIt was no more than a consolation and Liverpool’s three-goal cushion was restored when Mané, who struck a post with a gilt-edged chance created by Oxlade-Chamberlain, made amends to complete a flowing Liverpool attack. Firmino released Andy Robertson overlapping down the left and the full-back delivered an inviting first-time cross for Mané to flick the ball over Adrián and in off a post."}, {"date": "24/02/2018",

the eve of this game, Alan Pardew could be forgiven for thinking that it is only matter of time before he is asked to gather the rest of his belongings and clear his desk at the Hawthorns. Another damaging defeat amid growing supporter unrest leaves Pardew on the brink and West Brom with one foot in the Championship.\n\nMohamed Salah strike helps Liverpool to resounding win over West Ham Read more\n\nBy the end of the game, the home fans had turned on their manager as well as their players as Albion’s miserable season plumbed new depths. “You’re getting sacked in the morning,” sang a section of the Albion supporters as Pardew cut a forlorn figure on the touchline in the closing stages. “You’re not fit to wear the shirt,” was directed at the players earlier in the second half as anger and frustration came to the surface after Huddersfield scored their second goal of a hugely satisfying afternoon for the visitors, who have given their own survival hopes a huge boost.\n\nAlbion, in contrast, look doomed. They remain anchored to the bottom of the table, seven points adrift of the last safe spot with just 10 fixtures remaining, and it is hard to see how a team that have registered only one victory in 26 league matches can put together the sort of run that will be needed to pull off such an act of escapology.\n\nThe bigger question now is whether Albion decide to stick or twist with their manager. Pardew was only appointed in late November, following the dismissal of Tony Pulis, yet the brutal truth is that he has had no impact whatsoever on the team’s fortunes since he walked into the building. Albion have won only once in 14 league games under him and on top of that there is the recent fiasco in Barcelona, when Pardew’s decision to take the squad on a mid-season team-bonding trip spectacularly backfired after four players broke a midnight curfew and allegedly stole a taxi.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alan Pardew watches on with dismay and the home fans let him know their feelings by the end. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA\n\nGareth Barry was one of that quartet and the loud boos that greeted the sight of his number being raised in the second half, when the midfielder was withdrawn, told their own story. By that stage Albion had managed to pull a goal back through Craig Dawson but the damage was done. Rajiv van La Parra and Steve Mounié punished some dismal Albion defending early in the second half and there was never likely to be any way back for a team with such fragile confidence.\n\nReferencing the statistic that Albion have won only one of their past 37 league matches, Pardew made a point afterwards of highlighting the fact that the origins of the team’s malaise can be traced back to way beyond his own arrival at the club. He had a fair point in that respect, yet there is still no getting away from the absence of any improvement under his watch.\n\nBuoyant after putting four past Bournemouth in their previous home game, Huddersfield must have sensed that Albion were there for the taking. In a scrappy and poor game, Huddersfield passed up the chance to take the lead in the 36th minute, when Alex Pritchard’s shot was blocked by Mounié, but David Wagner’s side were not so generous when Albion’s defence gifted them an embarrassing amount of time and space shortly after the interval.\n\nJack Butland’s own-goal blunder costs Stoke victory at Leicester Read more\n\nWith Jonny Evans standing off him, Collin Quaner slid a low ball into the feet of the unmarked Van La Parra, who dragged a shot from about 10 yards into the near corner. Albion looked shell-shocked and within the blink of an eye Huddersfield added a second as Pritchard played a lovely reverse pass into the path of Mounié. With Albion appealing in vain for offside, Mounié escaped and dispatched a low shot beyond Ben Foster. That was the cue for some Albion supporters to head for the exits.\n\nThe introduction of Chris Brunt from the bench briefly re-energised Albion and it was the Northern Irishman’s corner that Dawson headed in with Jonas Lössl stranded in the Huddersfield goal.\n\nBrunt later saw a free-kick tipped over the bar by Lössl and at the other end Danny Williams came close to scoring a third with a 25-yard volley. “A massive and deserved result for us,” Wagner said, beaming.\n\n‘We’ve got to find a way to win a game’\n\nAlan Pardew is fighting to save his job as West Brom manager after home supporters turned on him and the players following yet another chastening defeat. Asked whether he hopes to see the job through, Pardew replied: “Well, I hope so but that decision is not with me.”\n\nPardew felt that the supporters’ reaction was down to poor results over a prolonged period of time, not just since his arrival. “I think it’s frustration. I think this team has won three games in 37 – that says everything. We’ve got to find a way to win a game. My job is to try and get ourselves up as best we can for next week and try and win away from home. That’s what I’m going to try and do. This was an opportunity to get us rolling, and we’ve let that slip.\n\n“Unfortunately we can’t wind the clock back. We’ve lost the game and we need to go to the next game and stick our chest out and show a bit of pride and try to win a game of football.\n\n“We’ve got to all stand up. There’s no point me defending myself or defending players. I’m going to stand up and manage the team and they’ve got to stand up and give us performances where we get seven, eight and nine out of 10 performances.

That may have been something of an exaggeration but it was not wholly inaccurate – yet ultimately this was an occasion to savour for Watford’s captain.\n\nHis first league goal from open play since April was both stunning and decisive, securing the hosts a victory that moves them into the top half of the table and revenge over the club whose behaviour precipitated the sacking of his previous manager.\n\nThat’s how the Watford hierarchy will see it, anyway, if the statement the club released in late January to explain their decision to part ways with Marco Silva is anything to go by. Everton’s pursuit of the Portuguese was described as an “unwanted approach” and “the catalyst” for his departure following a run of one win in 11 matches. The acrimony has lingered but just over a month on, there may well be a sense of closure in these parts.\n\nWatford 1-0 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nOn the balance of play a draw was perhaps a fair result, but it is hard to begrudge Watford victory given they had more possession and more shots on goal (nine compared with six). Javi Gracia also deserves credit given the attacking nature of his second-half substitutions, most notably introducing Kiko Femenía and Stefano Okaka on 56 minutes. The pair combined for Deeney’s 79th-minute winner.\n\n“I am happy because we got three important points against a very good team,” said Gracia. “It was a tough game but we worked a lot and scored a good goal.”\n\nIt is now back-to-back home victories for Watford since Gracia arrived as Silva’s successor and while this one was not as emphatic as the 4-1 thrashing of Chelsea earlier in the month its significance cannot be overstated. At the start of the day, Watford found themselves 11th, just four points above the relegation zone.\n\nBy the end they were 10th and six points clear of the bottom three. It is only a slight improvement but as they prepare for West Brom’s visit next Saturday it allows players, staff and supporters to believe they can end this season on an optimistic note.\n\nThe same cannot be said of Everton. They remain ninth on the back of their fifth straight away defeat in all competitions and this was another occasion where they rarely if ever looked like scoring. The visitors had just two shots on target: a first-half cross from Oumar Niasse that was deflected towards goal and a header from the substitute Cenk Tosun in the closing stages that was comfortably held by Orestis Karnezis.\n\n“We don’t have a finisher to put the ball in the back of the net and if you squander your opportunities in the Premier League, you pay the price,” said Sam Allardyce.\n\nMohamed Salah strike helps Liverpool to resounding win over West Ham Read more\n\nWhen asked which chances Everton had squandered, a prickly Allardyce pointed to a header from Michael Keane in the second half that drifted wide, as well as the two that went on target. But really, that was it.\n\nThose in blue showed a decent level of commitment but they remain an alarmingly blunt outfit. Little creativity, little spark and, as such, the supporters are left with little hope. It was hard to blame those who headed for the exits as soon as their team fell behind. As they walked out, those in the home seats roared in celebration.\n\nA goal had not seemed to be coming but then Femenía played a pass into the path of Okaka and he reversed the ball towards Deeney, who, from a central position inside Everton’s penalty area, spun and hit a rising shot into the net.

third goal bulged West Brom’s net as this contest drifted into its final quarter, with Eden Hazard punching the air in celebration, that Chelsea could truly relax and bask in a restorative victory.\n\nThe Belgian had darted across the edge of the area away from a floundering Jonny Evans before ripping a shot inside Ben Foster’s near post. It was the kind of emphatic finish to breathe belief back into the ranks of the doubters.\n\nChelsea 3-0 West Bromwich Albion: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHazard would suggest post-match that Thierry Henry’s input with the Belgium national squad has encouraged that kind of snapshot, fired off before Foster could adjust his feet in anticipation of it. In truth neither centre-half nor goalkeeper could match Hazard’s speed of thought or mastery of execution and that was what in effect set the champions apart. The visitors competed ruggedly enough, recovering from the loss of Daniel Sturridge inside the opening few minutes to test local nerves, but were unpicked and undone by those dashes of quality. Their predicament is troubling. Chelsea, in contrast, are fourth, three points off second.\n\nHow they needed an occasion like this, when luck was with them and ruthlessness restored to their approach. Those desperate displays and hefty defeats by Bournemouth and Watford shocked this squad to its core. Had Jay Rodriguez, early on, not snatched at his shot in front of goal, dragging the effort wide after Victor Moses nervously headed a loose ball into his path, then all those anxieties might have flooded back. The same might have applied had Salomón Rondón’s booming header not flown wide or, when Chelsea’s lead was still narrow, had Thibaut Courtois not instinctively denied the Venezuelan after he had bullied Andreas Christensen off the ball early in the second half.\n\nEvans, rising at the resulting corner, guided a free header high and wide. Had one of those chances gone in, then Albion, even as a team who have forgotten how to win, might yet have piggybacked on Chelsea’s anxieties to prosper. “I know what this place is like; it can turn,” said Alan Pardew.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Olivier Giroud proved an influential presence in a bruising encounter for the former Arsenal forward. Photograph: DigitalSouthSHM/REX/Shutterstock\n\nYet, with each opportunity missed by the visitors, Chelsea were roused further out of their lethargy with Hazard and Olivier Giroud steadily finding their feet. That partnership already looks promising, for all that the Frenchman ended only his second Premier League start of the season with his head bandaged courtesy of Ahmed Hegazi’s boot and bruised on his calf after Evans’ foul.\n\nIt was his subtle touch, holding off the Egyptian centre-half, from Hazard’s fizzed pass that helped squeeze out the lead. The playmaker, such a livewire, darted at pace away from Gareth Barry and planted his shot into the corner with a flourish before any visiting player could react. That rather summed it all up. He was operating on a different plain, thriving on Giroud’s Arsenal-esque touches. “He is a great target man, maybe one of the best in England,” said Hazard. “He is a good point of reference.”\n\nThat was missing in those two recent defeats, where Chelsea’s front-line lacked presence and power, and Hazard was forced to scurry from the centre in search of the ball in areas opponents could contain his threat. Here he could revel in that free role confident that first Giroud and then Álvaro Morata, recovered from a back injury to emerge off the bench for the final half-hour after a month-long absence, would lead the line. Pedro’s selfless running, dragging markers out of position, and Cesc Fàbregas’s probing from the centre were just as significant. It was the latter’s prod into the box that Craig Dawson deflected into Victor Moses’ path, with the wing-back duly converting the second.\n\nJosé Mourinho’s stodgy, unstructured Manchester United are labouring | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nEach setback had Pardew cursing on the sidelines. Albion must be one of the great mysteries of this season, a squad who, on paper, look to have enough quality to be mid-table but who, instead, have now won once in 25 league games.

Huddersfield held a fireworks party with their Chinese sponsors on Saturday night, then celebrated their best performance of 2018, ending a sequence of five league defeats with a convincing victory that temporarily at least lifts them out of the bottom three.\n\nBournemouth, in contrast, saw a seven-game unbeaten sequence come to an end in West Yorkshire. The Cherries have seen off Chelsea and Arsenal in recent weeks but they possibly underestimated their opponents here. Huddersfield ditched the defensive tactics that have brought so little reward since Christmas and went for the win, their confidence seemingly lifted by the four goals they scored against Birmingham in the FA Cup in midweek. The visitors began tidily enough but by the second half were offering scant resistance.\n\n“We attacked very well, we were aggressive and focused,” the Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, said. “We have always had belief we could stay in the Premier League. Now is the time to fight for our survival. Most of the difficult opponents are now behind us, so we need to build momentum against some of the teams around us.”\n\nSergio Agüero hits fizzing four in Manchester City’s mauling of Leicester Read more\n\nHuddersfield got off to a great start, cleverly exploiting the space on the flanks that Bournemouth’s back three could not quite cover. Scott Malone’s superbly weighted ball down the left gave Steve Mounié the run on Simon Francis, and the striker made it all the way to the goalline before finding Alex Pritchard in the middle, a stabbed left foot finish bringing the January arrival his first goal for the club. The home side’s lead lasted only seven minutes, with a defensive lapse of their own giving Ryan Fraser all the space he needed to cross from the right and pick out Junior Stanislas, free in front of goal and able to take his time placing a low shot into Jonas Lössl’s bottom corner.\n\nBut Huddersfield were not to be denied: their effective pressing game kept Bournemouth at bay and produced a succession of promising opportunities, although it was from a set piece that they regained the lead. While Bournemouth probably knew what to expect when Aaron Mooy prepared to swing a free-kick into the penalty area, they were still powerless to do anything about it. Mooy’s delivery was perfect and Mounié reached the ball first, placing a firm downward header beyond Asmir Begovic’s dive. Steve Cook did manage to strike the outside of an upright with a shot from a Charlie Daniels corner but the rest of the first half was all Huddersfield’s.\n\nA third goal was still needed to make sure of the points and Huddersfield gained a reward for their attacking just past the hour when Mooy, inevitably, sent in a low cross from the left that Mounié met with a side-foot that Steve Cook helped deflect past Begovic. Mooy had seen a shot roll narrowly wide and provided a cross that Tom Ince headed over from close range, so there was no surprise when the goal eventually arrived.\n\nThe only downside from Huddersfield’s point of view was that Mooy lasted only a few more minutes before departing on a stretcher with a knee injury after coming off worse in a collision with Lewis Cook. The Terriers will hope their main playmaker’s absence is a short one and Wagner indicated the injury would require stitches rather than surgery. “It is only a cut, we will just have to see how long it takes to heal,” Wagner said.\n\nIn the six added minutes occasioned by the Australian’s treatment the home side managed a further goal without him. The impressive Pritchard was pushed in the area by Dan Gosling when he appeared to be going to ground anyway. Rajiv van La Parra stepped up and tucked away a confident penalty to leave and his side with plenty to think about on the long journey home.\n\n“We were below par. We lost too many duels and just faded away,” the Bournemouth manager, said. “Apart from the goal I’m struggling to find any positives. I can only apologise to supporters who got up early to make the trip. We are still in a relegation battle. I’ve said that all along and results like this don’t help.”"}, {"date": "11/02/2018", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52309, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Martin Dubravka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Lejeune", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jacob Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Hayden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mikel Merino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "At the end of a day when Jonjo Shelvey really did look worthy of an England place, Paul Pogba appeared a mere mortal and Martin Dubravka shone on his debut in goal for Newcastle United two things remained unchanged for José Mourinho. Manchester United’s manager had still not won a Premier League game on Tyneside and his second-placed team continued to trail Manchester City by 16 points.\n\nIn marked contrast Rafael Benítez would hardly be human if he were not tempted to regard a hugely restorative win as potentially a season-altering moment. This timely reminder of Benítez’s coaching abilities at the expense of an often bothersome old rival represented much more than a rare moment in the sun during what has turned into a painful slog of a campaign: instead Matt Ritchie’s well‑taken second-half winner offered real hope that Newcastle can avoid relegation after all.\n\nRafael Benítez’s win was ‘a beautiful thing’, says José Mourinho Read more\n\nBenítez’s players have a habit of starting well before self-destructing and they began as crisply as the weather. David De Gea was soon required to stretch out a hand and divert Shelvey’s goalbound shot, while Mohamed Diamé made dispossessing Nemanja Matic appear easy.\n\nYet not for the first time this season Newcastle could not quite convert their chances. With Islam Slimani, Benítez’s new Algeria striker borrowed from Leicester, failing to recover from a thigh strain in time for involvement, the overwhelming suspicion was that the home side were simply flattering to deceive before indulging in a late, by now almost habitual, surrender.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, Mourinho’s players had invested too heavily in this theory. As the clock passed 30 minutes they were still to conjure a proper chance and Dubravka, on goalkeeping duty for the first time since arriving on loan from Sparta Prague, had not been called to arms. A big part of the reason for that was Shelvey’s excellence alongside Diamé in central midfield. The moment when Shelvey whisked the ball off Pogba’s toes proved emblematic of an afternoon when his passing looked capable of unhinging almost any defence.\n\nEventually, though, Matic woke up to the fact that he and Pogba were being upstaged and unleashed a matching riposte, expertly threading a pass between two defenders for Anthony Martial to run on to. Martial shot but Dubravka proved more than equal to the danger, spreading himself adroitly before tipping the effort to safety.\n\nThat opening arrived in the 36th minute, three minutes after Dubravka’s first significant involvement, namely another impressive save which pushed Jesse Lingard’s shot round a post following incisive approach work from Alexis Sánchez.\n\nIf Sánchez, deployed in a left-sided attacking role, showed off some superior touches, the biggest worry for Mourinho will surely have been Pogba’s lacklustre display, epitomised by much severely inhibited movement. Granted those clever feet did supply the odd classy pass but, overall, the Frenchman was far from his best. He will surely be expected to raise his game appreciably in southern Spain this week when United’s Champions League campaign resumes at Sevilla.\n\nBenítez clearly believed Craig Pawson to be guilty of similar under-achievement, after the referee turned a blind eye to what looked a clear penalty occasioned by Chris Smalling’s unintelligent trip on Dwight Gayle. No foul was given and Newcastle’s manager seethed as Mourinho’s side escaped punishment before proceeding almost to score themselves as Sánchez created a chance for Romelu Lukaku, whose shot was deflected over the bar.\n\nEarly in the second half Lukaku, having a decent game, succeeded in heading in beyond Dubravka but that effort was rightly disallowed due to pushes from the centre‑forward and Smalling, whose own header across the box had created the opening.\n\nMohamed Salah seals the points as Liverpool cruise past Southampton Read more\n\nWhen Florian Lejeune, excelling at centre-half, performed wonders to block Sánchez’s goal-bound shot, Newcastle fans probably feared the imminent reprise of a recently familiar losing script.\n\nIn the event, though, Benítez’s team were about to score. After Smalling had been rightly booked for a ridiculous dive Shelvey’s swerving free-kick was headed down by Lejeune and cleverly backheeled into Ritchie’s path by Gayle. All that remained was for Ritchie to beat De Gea with a left-foot shot dispatched low into a corner of the net.\n\nPerhaps noting Pogba had done nothing to subdue Lejeune’s role in the goal, Mourinho hauled him off as the ground echoed to the strains of Blaydon Races. There was still time for Dubravka to be required to save brilliantly from the substitute Michael Carrick but this time the Geordie choir were not destined to be silenced."}, {"date": "11/02/2018", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31915, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wesley Hoedt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guido Carrillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [37], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [6], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "By the end Southampton’s support seemed unsure as to where they should direct their scorn. They had booed Virgil van Dijk throughout his return to the south coast, merely grumbling at Sadio Mané’s incisive contributions, while Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren were heckled during their own late cameos. Yet, as plenty of the home fans flooded forlornly away, it was Mauricio Pellegrino who shivered through the last rites of this latest defeat. The chorus of discontent from those who remained at the final whistle told its own story.\n\nVirgil van Dijk grins in the face of fans’ fury on happy return to Southampton | Stuart James Read more\n\nThere can be no living with Liverpool on their travels at times, so incisive is their play and slick their passing. Teams near the foot would not normally consider a visit from Jürgen Klopp’s progressive side as an opportunity to instigate a revival. But Southampton’s was still a meek surrender. Swansea had demonstrated last month what can be achieved against this opposition with a blend of resilience and ruthlessness, and yet Pellegrino’s team offered neither. Sloppiness presented their visitors with an early lead and their second-half display amounted to little more than a whimper.\n\nThat lack of response, even against superior opponents, reflected the fragility of the mood on a day when eye-catching wins by Huddersfield and Newcastle had cast this team into the relegation places. All the positivity generated by that victory at West Bromwich Albion has dissipated. That remains their solitary league success since November which puts talk of a revival – they had actually been unbeaten in six matches in all competitions prior to this game – into proper context. “We had to be braver,” said Pellegrino. “The biggest ‘defeat’ was the way we played the second half, for me. Little by little our confidence dropped.”\n\nA glance at the home side’s bench, where there is quality and experience aplenty, might normally offer encouragement that a recovery can be mounted over the last 11 games. But in Southampton’s case it tends to expose under-achievement. They may be one victory from 13th in a congested division but, as a squad, they are surely capable of far better than this. They are a team blunted by Charlie Austin’s injury and, dare it be said, left exposed by Van Dijk’s defection. “Liverpool didn’t have to do much to win easily,” Pellegrino said. “One mistake, one amazing one-two, and that finished the game.”\n\nThat was brutally honest. His team were dismissed here by a side gearing up for the resumption of the Champions League and now persuasively targeting a top-two finish. Liverpool have scored 34 away goals this season, more than 11 top-flight teams have managed in total, with the energy and precision of Mané, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino utterly irresistible. This team are equally adept at flooding forward on the counter-attack or pinning opponents so deep that they eventually crack. Their first-half goals reflected both skills, even if each benefited from jittery Southampton defending.\n\nWesley Hoedt endured life as the fall guy. He and Mario Lemina had already almost contrived to liberate Firmino beyond their own back-line when, six minutes in, Loris Karius bowled the ball out to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right flank for the midfielder to sprint and bend a pass upfield towards Salah. The delivery was ambitious but Hoedt fluffed his attempted interception and duly presented the Egyptian with space in which to charge. Cedric Soares tore across in a vain attempt to intercept, but Salah kept his head and merely squared for Firmino, one of two team-mates who had arrived untracked at his side, to convert.\n\nMatt Ritchie goal gives Newcastle shock victory over Manchester United Read more\n\nThere had been barely 10 seconds between Van Dijk nodding the ball back to Karius and Alex McCarthy being breached at the other end. The boos marking the Dutchman’s touch were choked and drowned amid the raucous celebrations of those in the away section. “It’s not too complicated,” Klopp said of the ferocity of that counter-attack. “The transition at the start is most important, so that first sprint from Ox, that was very important. Then the pass, that little miss ... it was just good.” It deflated the mood in an instant.\n\nBriefly, tantalisingly, Southampton had threatened an equaliser with Karius doing well to deny Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and James Ward-Prowse. Yet in what time remained before the break Liverpool merely responded with a spell of pressure, squeezing the conviction from their hosts as they pressed them deeper into retreat. Mané might have flung over a centre in hope from the left but chose instead to retain possession and find his deepest-lying team-mate, Joël Matip. The centre-half, still well inside Southampton territory, slid the ball to Salah on the edge of the area and, under only vague pressure from Oriol Romeu, the Egyptian exchanged passes with Firmino. The Brazilian’s back-heel beyond Jack Stephenswas perfectly placed and paced. Salah collected and converted crisply into the corner for a 29th goal of term.\n\nEverything thereafter was a procession, Liverpool passing up opportunities to add a third but the game long since won.

The Tottenham striker rates his late headed winner against Arsenal in February 2015 as the finest goal of his career. He was at it again here in a moment to sum up the difference between bullying Spurs and fragile Arsenal.\n\nBen Davies’s cross from the left was inviting and Kane simply wanted it more than anybody in the vicinity. Timing his leap to perfection, he appeared to hang in the air, towering above Laurent Koscielny, before planting the header into the far corner. Arsenal’s players shouted for a push on Koscielny and so did Arsène Wenger but the appeals smacked of desperation. It was Kane’s seventh goal in seven Premier League matches against Arsenal.\n\nThis was a demonstration of Tottenham’s superior power and fitness, as much as their technical ability. After a tepid first half, Kane’s goal was the prompt for them to put the boot on their rivals’ throats. They pressed down hard and as Arsenal lost their shape it was a wonder how it did not turn into a beating. The visitors owed a debt to Petr Cech for keeping the scoreline respectable.\n\nMousa Dembélé is fast becoming the ultimate midfield controller | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThe structure belonged to Tottenham whereas Wenger flung on attacking players in an increasingly frantic attempt to find a solution. It almost came off. Alexandre Lacazette had lifted one shot high when well-placed and in stoppage time he ran away from Davinson Sánchez, who had misread a through-ball from another substitute, Alex Iwobi. Lacazette had only Hugo Lloris to beat but his low shot went past the far post. Had he scored, it would have got Arsenal out of jail. It would not have masked the gulf between the teams.\n\nArsenal’s optimism had surged after last Saturday’s 5-1 home thrashing of Everton when their new attacking signings, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, had starred, although Aaron Ramsey, scorer of a hat-trick in that game, was missing through injury. They believed they had turned a corner. They ran into a wall here. Where Kane and his team-mates made things happen, those in red shirts shrank. Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan were anonymous.\n\nArsène Wenger: 'It was more than just a derby' – video\n\nHow Arsenal needed a statement victory over a big-six rival away from home. They must go back to January 2015 to find one – 17 matches ago – the 2-0 success at Manchester City. How they needed an away win of any description. Their form on their travels in the league this season has been unacceptable and, as Wenger pointed out, it has not only been because of defensive lapses. They have struggled to score. They have managed 15 in 14 games.\n\nArsenal’s hopes of a top-four finish have been left to hang by a thread and Wenger was not about to sugar-coat the picture. They are six points off the pace and the gap could grow when Liverpool and Chelsea play their games in hand. “We could not afford to lose today,” he said. “It makes it much more difficult now [to finish in the top four]. There was more at stake than just the derby.”\n\nArsenal had a couple of flickers in the early running when they almost got through on counterattacks only to miss the final pass. Unusually, Mesut Özil was culpable but Wenger’s claim that his team ought to have had the game sown up because of those moments was overblown. They were also denied by an offside flag after Jack Wilshere put Aubameyang clean through on 13 minutes. The decision was fiendishly tight.\n\nTottenham had more of the ball in the first half but the chances were sparse. A big one came on 27 minutes when Christian Eriksen unfurled a wonderful delivery for Kane but he could not direct the header. Cech had pushed away from his own player, Shkodran Mustafi, early on while Eric Dier almost turned in Mousa Dembélé’s mis-hit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Kane soars to score the winner. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt – AMA/Getty Images\n\nThe intensity had been strangely absent in the first period. Tottenham brought it with a vengeance after the interval and Arsenal cracked. Kane’s goal was another classic and Wenger had the good grace to admit his initial complaints were misplaced. “It is a regular goal,” he said. “We can only look at ourselves.” For the umpteenth time, Mauricio Pochettino called Kane “one of the best in the world”. So did Wenger. “He is a super striker,” the Arsenal manager said. “He scores against everybody.”\n\nTottenham attacked in waves. Kane put a free header wide from Dier’s cross before working Cech with a stinging volley while the goalkeeper pawed away Eriksen’s free-kick. Wilshere extended Lloris with a thumping shot but it was otherwise all Tottenham. Dele Alli and the substitute, Érik Lamela, could not finish while Cech kept out a Kieran Trippier volley.

His team were three goals up and cruising to a second successive home win when Morgan Schneiderlin trotted on as an 80th-minute substitute for the injured Idrissa Gueye. The home crowd greeted him with a chorus of boos.\n\nIt was a horrible, chilling reception for the £20m midfielder who, in the week since the 5-1 capitulation at Arsenal and previously, has come to symbolise the expensive transfer mistakes and perceived lack of commitment that has scarred Everton’s campaign. Crystal Palace were soundly beaten for the third time in 16 league games and stand two points clear of the relegation zone but showed a unity that is conspicuous by its absence at Everton.\n\nJavier Hernández strike sets West Ham on the way to victory over Watford Read more\n\n“I was surprised, very surprised,” said Allardyce of Schneiderlin’s treatment. “I’ve not heard that before. Morgan is a very important part of our squad this year. A lot of players haven’t performed up to their potential, we know that, but they are doing it at home. I can’t ask for more from them at home but away from home it has been a problem.”\n\nDespite animosity and anaemic performances Everton are now two points behind Burnley in seventh after Gylfi Sigurdsson and Oumar Niasse, both striking early in the second half, plus Tom Davies sealed an ultimately comfortable win.\n\nRoy Hodgson finally got an apology from his successor as England manager for mocking his speech 17 months ago. His injury-plagued side could have got a result too but poor defending after the restart undermined an otherwise committed approach.\n\nHodgson said: “Sam called me on Thursday and apologised. I was happy to receive and accept that apology and, as far as I’m concerned now, that matter belongs in the distant past and I have nothing more to say on the subject. I certainly have no issues with it.”\n\nEverton held the edge throughout with Theo Walcott again impressing on the right and Wayne Rooney’s intelligent distribution standing out in central midfield, although they rarely tested Wayne Hennessey in the Palace goal in the first half.\n\nFifty seconds after the restart, however, their productivity turned on a touch of good fortune. A long clearance by Jordan Pickford was headed skywards by James Tomkins and Niasse turned the second ball onto Sigurdsson. The Iceland international cut across Timothy Fosu-Mensah and though his low shot was on target it deflected off Tomkins and sailed out of Hennessey’s reach and into the bottom corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gylfi Sigurdsson leads Everton celebrations.

The first, a Christian Benteke header from a glorious Yohan Cabaye cross, was steered wastefully wide. The second, an Alexander Sørloth header, was foiled by a fine save from Pickford. Big moments.\n\nDavies ensured there would be no comeback with his first goal of the season. Hennessey scrambled clear when Niasse’s shot was deflected goalwards but only as far as Sigurdsson who clipped the ball back from the byline for the young midfielder to convert from close range.\n\nLuka Milivojevic denied Pickford the clean sheet his performance merited from the penalty spot after Ashley Williams handled late on but Everton’s victory will be remembered for another reason.

However exciting the conclusion, however, the fact remains the hosts are in real relegation trouble.\n\nInsipid and incoherent in a first half during which Brighton took the lead with a crisp team goal, Stoke rallied in the second but had to rely once again on a moment of individual skill from Xherdan Shaqiri to draw level.\n\nThen, as the game reached the 88th minute, Dale Stephens tussled with Jesé in the box and Bobby Madley pointed to the spot. Charlie Adam’s effort was well saved by Mat Ryan though and, as the Scot waited to tap in the rebound, he was robbed by a sliding challenge from Lewis Dunk. Seconds later a goalbound header from Mame Biram Diouf was turned away by the diminutive Anthony Knockaert. You could practically hear the hair being torn from the heads of the crowd.\n\n“I’m desperately disappointed‚“ said Paul Lambert. “When you get a penalty in the last minute it’s a big opportunity to win the game. But we win as a team and we lose as a team. I think in the second half we were well on top. Xherdan scored a great goal but in the second half we were much better.”\n\nFor Chris Hughton there was also frustration. His side controlled the first half with a tactical plan that nullified Stoke and offered real penetration on the counterattack. Their goal came from a prolonged spell of possession with Izquierdo playing one-twos with Solly March and Dale Stephens before firing low under Jack Butland for his second goal in as many matches.\n\nIzquierdo also had a sight of goal the second minute only to blaze over, and nearly flummoxed Butland with a piledriver with five minutes remaining. Davy Pröpper also should have scored but saw his low first-time effort turned wide by the England keeper.\n\n“On balance we had the better chances,” Hughton said. “I thought the goal was excellent, a great team goal. I thought we were good, particularly on the counter, and we had the better opportunities over the 90 to score.”\n\nFor Stoke there was solace to be taken from their persistence in adversity, something that hasn’t always been apparent this season. There was also the return of Jesé to encourage the fans; the Spaniard constantly pushed the Brighton defence backwards, which was crucial in creating space for Shaqiri to turn the ball inside Ryan’s right-hand post to equalise.\n\nBut only one of these two teams looked like a side at ease with their status in the Premier League and that was the visitors. Yet the pair remain separated by just three points in a ridiculously congested league table.\n\n“I think we have felt comfortable in this division, but we don’t want to feel too comfortable,” Hughton said. “It’s going to be very tough between now and the end of the season for a lot of teams.”\n\nEverton fan discord mars easy win against Crystal Palace Read more"}, {"date": "10/02/2018", "arena":

their revival with victory over Burnley. Ki Sung-yueng struck nine minutes from time – his first goal since May 2016 – to lift Swansea into 15th place, two points above the relegation zone.\n\nKi’s winner came after Carvalhal had made two attacking second-half substitutions. André Ayew, making his second Swansea debut after rejoining the club from West Ham on transfer deadline day, and Tammy Abraham make the difference.\n\nIn a game light on chances Ki drilled home from the edge of the penalty area when Jordan Ayew, André’s younger brother, allowed Kyle Naughton’s pass to run to Ki and his unerring shot gave the Burnley goalkeeper, Nick Pope, no chance.\n\nEverton fan discord mars easy win against Crystal Palace Read more\n\n“We have an expression in Portugal at times like we had in the second half,” Carvalhal said. “We say it was time to put all the meat on the barbecue. We did that to try to win – and we got the three points. But I felt we deserved it against a strong team and I am very proud of my players. Burnley are a difficult team to beat, the third best defensive team in the competition, so it was not easy to score. But in the second half, my players want to win a lot and we tried to help them do that with the players we put on.”\n\nSwansea have won more points, 14, in Carvalhal’s seven games in charge than the 13 his predecessor Paul Clement collected in 20 matches. It is a remarkable revival that has seen Swansea, bottom of the table and five points adrift of safety when Carvalhal took over in late December, climb clear of the relegation zone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Swansea keeper Lukasz Fabianski in action with Burnley’s Sam Vokes and Ben Mee.

We won some games, to put our noses out of the water – it was the first time we’d smelled the fresh air. Now we have started swimming and we can go to the coast but we must continue to swim to reach the coastline.”\n\nBurnley have now gone 10 games without a victory – the longest winless run in the Premier League. They had shaded a drab first half but it was Swansea who looked the more probable winners as the game developed. “The margins are tight and you have to find a way of getting on the right side of it,” Sean Dyche said.\n\n“Even at the start of the season, when we were going so well, I said they were tight games. I have said to the players we’re not far away. We’ve got to get players back fit, that will allow this squad to take stock and breathe again.

Instead of aiming jeers at the people in the posh seats, the crowd at the London Stadium kept their focus on the pitch and pushed West Ham United over the line.\n\nMarko Arnautovic was given a standing ovation when he strutted off in the closing stages – presumably in recognition of his seventh goal of the season rather than his dyed silver hair – and by the end it was easy to understand why David Moyes decided to gamble on his mercurial Austria forward’s fitness by starting him after only three days of training.\n\nFortune favoured the brave. Having toiled while their record signing was nursing a sore hamstring for a few weeks, West Ham fed off Arnautovic’s guile to secure their first win since 13 January, quell Javi Gracia’s mini-revival at Watford and move five points clear of the bottom three.\n\nJavier Hernández also made a vital contribution, repaying some of his £16m fee by scoring his third goal in his past four matches and Moyes was a satisfied man after a tense match.\n\n“We’ve never been level with Watford since my first game against them but today we’ve drawn level with them,” West Ham’s manager said. “It’s amazing what it can do to be out of the bottom three. But the minute you are you look to see how many are behind you.”\n\nEverton fan discord mars easy win against Crystal Palace Read more\n\nA useful way to gauge the sense of unease was that David Sullivan had felt compelled to issue a rallying cry via the club’s in-house TV channel on Saturday morning but it will take more than platitudes about the importance of sticking together for West Ham’s unpopular board to win back the trust of an increasingly mutinous public. Assertive action is required and it was intriguing to hear Sullivan, the club’s powerful co-owner, reveal plans to introduce a new scouting structure in the summer.\n\nAs for the present, at least West Ham’s injury crisis had eased in time for their latest assignment. Michail Antonio and Arnautovic were available, enabling Moyes to inject greater invention into his attack, and there were glimpses of a brighter future. Arnautovic was determined to make up for lost time, creating West Ham’s first sight of goal with a zigzagging run, only for Orestis Karnezis to deny the impressive João Mário with a sprawling save.\n\nAlthough Adrian Mariappa tested Adrián’s reflexes with an early header, Watford were uninspired. They displayed none of the brio that allowed them to crush Chelsea last week, with Gerard Deulofeu and Richarlison failing to find space on the flanks, and were fortunate when the lively Hernández had a goal ruled out by a tight offside decision in the 31st minute.\n\nWest Ham took a deserved lead seven minutes later. Antonio surged past Daryl Janmaat and the left wing-back floated a hanging cross on to Hernández’s head. Moyes praised Antonio, who was dropped for last month’s draw with Crystal Palace after arriving late to a team meeting, although Watford were entitled to wonder if Hernández had got away with a push on Marvin Zeegelaar. “I would like to see this goal,” Gracia said, “but it is not an excuse. I try to help the referees.”\n\nWest Ham had not kept a clean sheet in the league since 16 December and Watford exerted control in midfield after the break. Deulofeu was unfortunate to see Adrián push his free-kick away.\n\nHowever James Collins and Angelo Ogbonna produced gnarly defensive performances and the game was over as a contest after farcical defending from Watford in the 78th minute. José Holebas’s attempted clearance crashed off Aaron Cresswell and rebounded to Arnautovic, who finished from close range.\n\n“When he came in with his hairdo yesterday, I didn’t want to say I thought it looked bad,” Moyes said. “I said: ‘That’s great Marko.’ He was happy. I thought it was purple rinse.” Arnautovic cherished the limelight."}, {"date": "10/02/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54416, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48, 53, 77, 90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lukas Nmecha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Foden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brahim Diaz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksander Dragovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrien Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Fousseni Diabate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eldin Jakupovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Benalouane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Manchester City will fly to Basel for Tuesday’s Champions League last-16 match in fine heart after this impressive win. Their lead at the top of the Premier League is 16 points – although Manchester United play on Sunday – and they need a maximum 21 more for a third Premier League title in six years.\n\n“My advice for the players is not to think how many games are left, just to look to the next one,” Pep Guardiola said. “If we are able to win the title it will be something special.”\n\nSergio Agüero gave the latest illustration of his excellence with a second hat-trick in three home games and ended with his count for the club at 197. His third came on 77 minutes and was the result of a Kasper Schmeichel mistake that ceded the ball to him. Agüero calmly chipped the Leicester No 1 to make it 4-1 to end the contest before he smashed in a fourth at the close.\n\nIt left his manager purring. “Sergio has an amazing talent in the box,” Guardiola said. “So we try to create a lot of chances to score, and he always does. Congratulations to him because it’s not easy to score four goals.”\n\nThe City manager made two changes after the draw against Burnley last weekend, dropping Danilo and Vincent Kompany to the bench for Oleksandr Zinchenko and Aymeric Laporte. Claude Puel decided Ben Chilwell and Matty James should start for Leicester and that Danny Simpson and Kelechi Iheanacho should be substitutes. Riyad Mahrez’s exile ended, with the Algerian taking a place on the bench against the team who tried to buy him late last month.\n\nManchester City have only lost once at home under Guardiola and what any opposition do not need is to concede early. But after 125 seconds Leicester did exactly that. This, inevitably, was created by the sublime Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian sliced the ball behind a stricken defence and there was Raheem Sterling to poach his 20th goal of the season.\n\nGuardiola marvels at Manchester City points total – video\n\nFrom here Guardiola’s side performed lightning-quick play that is almost impossible to defend against. One move had the ball relayed from Sterling to Ilkay Gündogan through to Agüero and suddenly he was clear though but could not finish.\n\nNow, Leicester gave a warning with their own quick break, the ball pinging between Christian Fuchs, Fousseni Diabaté and Jamie Vardy. After Agüero again dallied at the end of Manchester City’s next break, Leicester equalised.\n\nIt stemmed from a howler by Nicolas Otamendi, the occasionally suspect centre-back misplacing a pass straight to Vardy. After Zinchenko and Gündogan each tried and failed to tackle, the centre-forward raced in on Ederson’s goal and beat him with a sweet right-foot finish for a 14th league strike and four in four outings.\n\nCity’s draw at Burnley was a rare recurrence of one of last season’s main issues for Guardiola’s side: profligacy in front of goal. Until the second-half goal glut, there were signs the problem might cost City more points. Kyle Walker took up an excellent position for a cross but spooned it over his team-mates. Then De Bruyne found Sterling and he rounded Schmeichel but hit Aleksandar Dragovic’s flailing leg.\n\nNormal finishing service was resumed three minutes into the second half. Yet again it was De Bruyne who made Agüero’s goal after Sterling passed to him. De Bruyne’s speed of thought and execution is always a fraction ahead of the game and the way he found Agüero from a running, sideways-on position was superb. It handed the striker a simple finish and his 25th goal of the season.\n\nThe 26th came moments later and yet again De Bruyne was provider for a 14th league assist, the competition’s highest. His pass found Agüero who did the business, though Schmeichel will be disappointed the finish went under his body.\n\nOn 62 minutes Puel made a decision. On came Mahrez and Iheanacho for Diabaté and Chilwell. It was a positive move but Agüero killed the match in his signature style to make it 13 in his last 10 appearances.\n\nOf Mahrez’s cameo, Puel said: “He made perhaps a mistake.

The Italian was emotionless as Eden Hazard belted his team improbably level eight minutes from the end. He was just as impassive while Watford ran riot in what little time remained. It was as if he had seen it all coming and, judging by the fog of discord that has enveloped the club for too long this season, maybe he had.\n\nThe champions can point to the reality that they remain in the top four, with FA Cup and Champions League campaigns to be resumed, but a third chaotic defeat in four games has reinforced the sense that this season is veering from them. Everything seems to have taken its toll, from disagreements between head coach and hierarchy over recruitment, to a cluttered schedule on a squad clearly not built to compete on four fronts. Now results have turned. Conte could emerge through his post-match gloom insisting his “conscience is clear” in terms of the effort he is putting in but Roman Abramovich tends to react when he sees his team’s prospects of finishing in the top four on the wane.\n\nCallum Wilson sparks shock Bournemouth rout of Chelsea Read more\n\nMuch more of this and the divorce anticipated for the summer would surely be brought forward. This, like the defeat by Bournemouth last week, was a drubbing, a thrashing that was telegraphed in the opening half-hour while the visitors were still blessed with a full complement and confirmed when Watford seized their chances late on.\n\nChelsea had done well to stay in the contest as long as they did but they always lacked cohesion. Pumping long balls towards Hazard was never likely to yield reward. More tellingly, the ease with which Daryl Janmaat and Gerard Deulofeu, the game’s outstanding performer, scythed through the visitors’ frazzled backline in those madcap last six minutes was enough to drain what little colour remained in Conte’s cheeks. By the time Roberto Pereyra was squeezing out enough space in stoppage time to belt across Thibaut Courtois and into the far corner, Chelsea were broken.\n\nThe teams who have overwhelmed them in the past week had both started against Chelsea looking at the foot of the table. Conte’s charges can now feel Tottenham on their shoulder and Arsenal not far behind. In so many ways their struggles here were personified by Tiémoué Bakayoko’s nightmare of a game. Focus will be drawn to the two bookings the midfielder picked up for clumsy fouls on Étienne Capoue and Richarlison that had him dismissed on the half-hour – the second was arguably rather harsh – but, after his red, it was tempting to wonder which team benefited more from his departure. His 28 touches had been littered with errors, from a weak header picked up by Abdoulaye Doucouré, a former team-mate at Rennes, to misplaced and sloppy passes presented to Deulofeu, Capoue and Richarlison. All four errors led directly to shots at goal.\n\nThe Frenchman had trudged down the tunnel bravely offering the away support at the far end a clap of appreciation – the chorus bellowed back was far from friendly – but he would, at present, appear to typify the fear that is gripping this team. Watford, excellent even prior to the dismissal, would eventually capitalise. They had their own motivation in Javi Gracia’s first home game in charge and a team who had won once in their 12 previous league games were outstanding. Janmaat’s pass cut Chelsea open, the ball eased beyond Gary Cahill for Deulofeu to chase. Courtois slid out and failed to reach the ball with the Spaniard, seeking his own contact, sprawling to the turf. There were few Chelsea protests as Troy Deeney converted the penalty, even if his one-fingered celebration may bring sanction.\n\nThereafter, profligacy rather spared the visitors until Hazard, whipping in a glorious equaliser that dipped under Orestis Karnezis’s outstretched left hand, made it level. Briefly, tantalisingly, Chelsea dared to consider inducing another late Watford implosion but it would be the champions who unravelled. Janmaat, Deulofeu and the substitute Pereyra would each glide into space to drive home their advantage while the majority inside the arena pinched themselves in the giddiness of victory. “It’s difficult to explain how I feel at this moment,” said Gracia. “We needed the three points badly but for motivation and to believe in our possibilities, in our work, today was very important.”\n\nHis team should sprint back into mid-table safety on the back of this riotous success. The ramifications for Chelsea could be just as far-reaching. West Brom are at Stamford Bridge next Monday and in any other circumstances a visit from the division’s bottom club would feel like an opportunity. Yet, while the fear still grips, it is the champions who look there for the taking."}, {"date": "04/02/2018", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25746, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timothy Fosu-Mensah", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luka Milivojevic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [55], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexander Sørloth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dion Henry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jairo Riedewald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [22], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Martin Dubravka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jacob Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Hayden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Lejeune", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mikel Merino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The grumble on the final whistle, with its undercurrent of anxiety, told its own story. This was a result which did little for either of these teams as they strive for survival in a division whose lower reaches are so congested that a win can thrust any of those currently labouring around the cut-off into the deceptive security of mid-table. Every missed opportunity is made to feel all the more excruciating in that context.\n\nThe locals gnashed the loudest at the inadequacy of a point. Crystal Palace have lost only against Arsenal their last 15 top-flight games but are cramped at present by the prospect of collisions with Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool in five fixtures from the end of this month. That looming run made beating Newcastle all the more significant, and left them cursing Ciaran Clark’s goalline blocks to deny Christian Benteke, a player whose body language sometimes suggests he will never score again in these parts, and Yohan Cabaye as the hosts’ frenzied pressure threatened, tantalisingly, to yield another late success.\n\nThe visitors, in contrast, with their raucous support bellowing for the removal of Mike Ashley, would rightly point to their own dominance up to the moment Clark was penalised for a shirt tug on the Belgian early in the second period as evidence they merited reward. Had Kenedy, liberated by Ayoze Pérez’s pass, not been thwarted by Wayne Hennessey’s chest, the goalkeeper then springing up to turn aside the Spaniard’s curled follow-up, then they might have secured a fourth away win. “That would have made the difference,” offered Rafael Benítez. “But if you don’t score a second, you’ll find yourself under pressure against a good team.”\n\nJosé Izquierdo’s stunning strike lights up Brighton against weary West Ham Read more\n\nThey were under the cosh through most of the second period with Wilfried Zaha, restored to the flank, focused and formidable. The Ivorian is the player who can make the difference at Palace, a talent who can set them apart from the others condemned to labouring against the drop. He tormented DeAndre Yedlin for long periods, teasing space on the flank and benefiting from Patrick van Aanholt’s revival at his back. It was Zaha’s cross which Benteke strained to meet early in the second half only for the assistant to spot Clark pulling down on the forward’s shirt. The Belgian had, in truth, been grappling with the defender, but the stretch of red and blue was more eye-catching.\n\nLuka Milivojevic scored from the penalty spot via Karl Darlow’s glove – “I was unlucky against Manchester City, and lucky today,” he offered post-match through a grin – and, thereafter, every ball flung into the Newcastle area provoked panic. Darlow’s display rather withered, his composure suddenly drained. James McArthur and Zaha might have won the day, but it was Clark who would save it two minutes from time. Benteke’s header was powerful and goal-bound, and the floored Cabaye’s follow-up on target, but each was smothered and scrambled clear by the defender with Darlow out of position and exposed. Jonjo Shelvey’s pull on McArthur at the resultant corner went unnoticed, and Newcastle had their point.\n\nRoy Hodgson admitted to “frustration” that the late pressure had not pilfered greater reward but Palace cannot rely upon late rallies as often as they do. In truth, he is a manager who must be perplexed as to his own side’s inconsistencies. His team start games at a snail’s pace too often, their squad stretched to breaking point by injuries to six senior players and Martin Kelly the latest to pull up with hamstring trouble. The signings of Alexander Sǿrloth, Jarolsaw Jach and Erdal Rakip have bolstered numbers, but none was used here. It says much about Hodgson’s resources that the last tactical substitution he felt able to instigate was at Southampton on 2 January.\n\nBenítez should have the luxury of Islam Slimani against Manchester United on Sunday, and the Algerian’s bite and brawn in front of goal will be needed over this team’s own daunting run of games. His team had impressed early on, Darlow blocking well from Benteke and Yedlin from Zaha when Palace threatened, but Shelvey dominated when offered time to orchestrate the play and Kenedy, Dwight Gayle and Pérez were always pesky on the counter. It was the Spanish playmaker who gained a slight touch on Kenedy’s low corner midway through the first half as the ball fizzed across the six-yard box and Mohamed Diamé, having spun untracked out of the mass of bodies in the middle, poked in at the far post.\n\nThen came Hennessey’s saves, Kenedy cutting inside James Tomkins to force the Welshman to block and Pérez then thwarted from distance, which pepped Palace’s belief that they might yet revive. “It may come down to our ability to recover,” Hodgson said. “That ability to come out and be a totally different team. I know we had 21 strikes at goal, but we put the ball into the penalty area a lot.” Zaha may be this side’s inspiration but, if Benteke found some form, they would surely scramble clear."}, {"date":

celebration of Mohamed Salah’s magnificent 21st league goal of the season. His goalkeeping coach, John Achterberg, performed a forward roll on to the pitch, clipboard still in hand. It was the 91st minute at Anfield and Liverpool had taken a significant step towards Champions League qualification against Tottenham Hotspur. In the 95th, it was taken away.\n\nSpurs departed with the point their second-half dominance merited but only because of a contentious penalty, their second of the game, after Virgil van Dijk was adjudged to have kicked Érik Lamela deep into stoppage time. Harry Kane had failed to convert from the spot 10 minutes earlier but made no mistake with his unexpected opportunity to make amends and claimed his 100th Premier League goal. “Big, big balls,” explained his manager, Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nJürgen Klopp blasts officials over decision-making on Tottenham penalties Read more\n\nLiverpool were incensed. Jon Moss had initially waved play on but was swayed by the insistence of his assistant, Edward Smart, that Van Dijk kicked Lamela on the back of the knee as one last ball dropped inside the Liverpool area. He did. Klopp claimed Lamela had deliberately backed in, looking for and maximising contact. He did.\n\nBetween the 85th and 95th minutes, two disputed penalties sandwiched a fabulous solo goal from Salah. An enthralling contest came to a dramatic and controversial climax and there was no disguising the happier manager on the final whistle. Pochettino punched the air while Liverpool players berated the officials, chants of “Cheat, cheat” rolling from the stands and Klopp raged at what might have been.\n\nA five-point gap in the race for a top-four finish was returned to two with Kane’s spot kick, and controversy overshadowed a stunning contribution from Salah. Victor Wanyama, another Spurs replacement, injected his own touch of quality to cancel out the Egypt international’s early opener. Tottenham remain firmly in the hunt for a Champions League spot.\n\nThe game started and ended in a frenzy, of Liverpool’s and Smart’s making respectively. Klopp’s team swarmed forward from the off and did to Spurs what they had done to Manchester United in midweek in making a swift breakthrough. The goal was a personal milestone for Salah and a moment to forget for Eric Dier. In attempting to assist Kieran Trippier and Davinson Sánchez in clearing up Sadio Mané’s dangerous flick, Dier succeeded only in playing Salah clean through. Quickest to spot the possibility, Salah burst ahead of Sánchez and convincingly beat Hugo Lloris with a cool strike into the bottom corner.\n\nQuick guide Ten minutes of Anfield madness Show Hide 84 mins Harry Kane, clearly in an offside position, is played through on goal by Dele Alli before being taken down by Liverpool’s under-fire keeper Loris Karius in front of the Kop. 87 mins Kane dusts himself down after being upended by Anfield’s No 1 but the keeper makes amends for his error by saving the England man’s poor penalty to leave it 1-1. 90+1 mins Somehow Liverpool’s player of the season Mohamed Salah wriggles free of the Tottenham defence and fires beyond Hugo Lloris to set Anfield alight. 90+3 mins Liverpool’s big-money signing Virgil van Dijk touches Erik Lamela in the box and, after lengthy consultation with his assistant, Jon Moss gives Spurs a second penalty. 90+5 mins Kane, after the long wait, keeps his cool this time around to silence the Kop and make it 2-2 to notch up his 100th Premier League goal and finish a breathless match. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP\n\nThe finish and the celebration that followed were those of a player who finds the Kop goal as a matter of routine. It was the Egypt international’s 20th Premier League goal of his debut campaign at Liverpool, arriving in his 25th game. No Liverpool player has reached that tally faster in the Premier League era – and they’ve had a few good ones.\n\nPochettino started with a midfield diamond of Mousa Dembélé at the base, Dier and Dele Alli right and left respectively and Christian Eriksen at the tip. It created and protected little in the first half but their improvement in the second half, when Eriksen shifted left and Alli advanced, was marked.\n\nLiverpool could have established a more comfortable lead by then. The hosts posed the greater threat before the break only for a consistently poor final ball to undermine their efforts. At one stage Mané was unable to pick out Roberto Firmino having dispossessed Sánchez on the touchline. In the final seconds of the half Mané repeated the trick, found Salah and burst clear into the area but the return pass from the goalscorer was overhit, to Klopp’s obvious disgust. Firmino also sent a glancing header wide and Lloris saved from the commanding Van Dijk.\n\nPlay Video 1:10 Klopp bemoans penalty decision as Liverpool held by Tottenham – video\n\nAlli was instrumental in turning the game Tottenham’s way after the interval. The visitors dominated possession and territory, but were struggling to find a way past Loris Karius until Wanyama’s thunderbolt. Alli sent Son Heung-min clear with an exquisite flick but the Liverpool keeper stood tall and blocked the shot, the England international driving the rebound wide. Alli was then booked for simulation when he collapsed in the penalty area, looking for a Dejan Lovren tackle that never materialised.\n\nLiverpool 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nTottenham’s attacking impetus increased with Pochettino’s bold introduction of Lamela for Sánchez, a central defender. His second substitution, bringing Wanyama on for Dembélé, had a immediate impact. With his first touch the midfielder found Eriksen in space on the left. With his second he found the top corner from 25 yards. Eriksen’s first-time cross was punched straight out by Karius. Emre Can failed to clear, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain failed to react and Wanyama got there first to send an unstoppable finish beyond the Liverpool goalkeeper.\n\nThe drama had only just begun. Spurs were awarded a penalty with five minutes remaining when Kane rounded Karius and tumbled over the German stopper. The striker was offside when Alli released him inside the area but the ball deflected off Lovren and, after a lengthy consultation with his assistant, Moss stuck to his original decision. Liverpool thought justice done when Kane sent the spot-kick straight down the middle and Karius saved comfortably.\n\nIn the 91st minute Salah appeared to win the game for Liverpool with another moment of brilliance. From a throw-in on the right he somehow wriggled clear of Alli, Ben Davies and Jan Vertonghen before prodding over Lloris from close range. The Liverpool bench erupted in joy. Moments later it erupted in anger."}, {"date": "03/02/2018", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21658, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

Sterling was City’s prime culprit missing a series of easy chances, the last of which came inches out of an open goal, apparently moving Pep Guardiola to replace him for the final quarter.\n\nThe manager, though, said this was not the reason. “No, it is football. Next day he is going to score. Today he missed. That is football. That can happen. We played so good, we just missed the last moment to try to score the second one and playing away in the Premier League, in the last 10 minutes anything can happen. I’m so happy for the performance, it was outstanding overall.”\n\nIlkay Gündogan, Sergio Agüero and Kevin De Bruyne were also guilty of spurning chances, though given City’s lead Guardiola is hardly concerned. He will also be happy that after leading a City chorus of complaints about dangerous tackles, none were meted out here.\n\nGuardiola had surprised by naming only six substitutes, his reasoning being that as seven players were ill or injured he did not have any more. This meant that despite the £200m spend on the City Football Academy Guardiola decided against taking an elite development squad player as the EDS side played on Friday. It seemed odd, because the experience gained of mixing with talents such as Agüero and De Bruyne would surely have been invaluable.\n\nBurnley 1-1 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAsked if an under-23 player might have joined up after playing, Guardiola said: “Maybe but we decided they are not going to play.”\n\nSean Dyche made two changes from the midweek draw at Newcastle United. Sam Vokes and Aaron Lennon – making a full debut – came in for Scott Arfield and Ashley Westwood. Guardiola brought in Vincent Kompany for Aymeric Laporte, Danilo for Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gündogan for the injured David Silva.\n\nDanilo proved the sole City player whose radar was not awry. Midway through the first half, Bernardo Silva fed the left-back and he stepped inside and let fly a 20-yard scorcher that was always beating Nick Pope to his left, Burnley allowing the Brazilian space to work in.\n\nAt this stage, Burnley may have feared the kind of steamrollering City can hand out. Twice Agüero broke. First, he took the wrong option in shooting when Sterling was free. Then the Argentinian did feed the winger but his effort went straight at Pope.\n\nAs the half-hour passed Burnley finally troubled Ederson, the goalkeeper saving a Ben Mee effort. The home captain had the next chance, too, but he headed wide from a corner.\n\nThis succour for Dyche’s men faded as City swept forward. Kevin Long was booked for a challenge on Gündogan and moments later De Bruyne was in prime position to pot City’s second but could find only Pope, with Agüero unable to slot home the rebound.\n\nDe Bruyne then fashioned one of his specials: a curving right-to-left pass that sliced apart Burnley and landed at Agüero’s feet. The No 10 should have added a 25th goal of the season but got his feet wrong and the danger faded.\n\nDyche brought on Matthew Lowton for Phil Bardsley at half-time and the right-back had an immediate impact, pinging the ball towards Ashley Barnes, Kompany stooping to clear.\n\nAt the other end Lowton was a saviour, too, his back ensuring Agüero’s attempt was deflected away. Three corners followed but there was no second City finish and Guardiola was later left fuming at Sterling sailing the ball high with the goal at his mercy.\n\nDyche surely felt the same when Danilo was again allowed time and acreage to let fly at Pope; a shot that warmed his fingers.\n\nSoon after came Sterling’s most glaring miss, putting the ball wide. Then, from Lowton’s free-kick the Icelander Gudmundsson equalised, to leave City wondering what might have been.\n\nA contented Dyche, whose side had been beaten by three goals at the Etihad in both the league and FA Cup, said: “It is a very good point. We have lost to City twice. We stayed in it and you have to. Then we grew into the game.”"}, {"date": "03/02/2018", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10614, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [13]}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [59], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [13], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moritz Bauer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papa Alioune Ndiaye", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [5], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxim Choupo-Moting", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kostas Stafylidis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramadan Sobhi Ahmed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Paul Lambert said he was “absolutely gutted” after Stoke City lost at Bournemouth and admitted he would have been disappointed with a draw.

conclusion to a transfer window and the dismissal of their head of player recruitment following his remarks about African footballers, and the atmosphere surrounding them had descended to new levels of toxicity once it was over.\n\nFor David Sullivan and David Gold, West Ham’s deeply unpopular owners, the temptation to close their eyes and stick their fingers in their ears must have been overwhelming long before the final whistle of this damaging defeat. “RIP WHU” was the message on one banner in the away end, where the travelling supporters needed little encouragement to increase the volume of their protests.\n\nWest Ham offered meek opposition in the face of a robust performance from Brighton, whose first victory since 23 December eased their relegation fears, and it was a match when the visitors’ self-destructive tendencies in the transfer market were ruthlessly exposed.\n\nDavid Moyes spent a dismal second half turning to backroom staff in despair. West Ham had travelled to the Amex Stadium hoping for some respite after sacking Tony Henry, their transfer chief, on Friday night.\n\nWith their messy efforts at strengthening their squad still fresh in the memory, the mood darkened when Brighton scored after eight minutes. Chris Hughton’s team made a pulsating start and it was a slick counterattack that culminated in Glenn Murray beating a shoddy offside trap.\n\nThe move developed at impressive speed after a West Ham attack fizzled out and Brighton were grateful to Roger East, the referee, for playing on when Aaron Cresswell brought down Anthony Knockaert with a poor tackle.\n\nUnfortunately for Cresswell, the ball was already nestling in West Ham’s net by the time he was booked. Pascal Gross released Murray, who was played onside by Declan Rice, and the striker slipped the ball underneath Adrián to claim his fifth goal in his past seven matches. Both managers denied any knowledge of Cresswell and Knockaert clashing in the tunnel at half-time.\n\nWest Ham were protecting a six-match unbeaten run in the Premier League and they crept back into the game, equalising through Javier Hernández in the 30th minute.\n\nThe Mexico forward retrieved possession, Mark Noble fizzed a pass into João Mário and the Portuguese midfielder’s deft flick found Hernández, who sidestepped Lewis Dunk and Gaëtan Bong before lifting his shot beyond Mathew Ryan’s reach.\n\nBrighton regained control after the break and were rewarded for their pressure when José Izquierdo stunned the visitors in the 59th minute. West Ham failed to clear a corner and the winger took a touch before whipping a magnificent effort into the far corner from the left of the area. “I knew we had to raise our game again,” Hughton said. “I thought the second half was close to being as good as we’ve been this season.”\n\nIzquierdo celebrated wildly and was booked for whipping off his shirt. Brighton did not mind. Despite introducing Michail Antonio, who was dropped for last Tuesday’s draw with Crystal Palace for arriving late to a team meeting, West Ham lacked guile without Marko Arnautovic and Manuel Lanzini. They are three points above the bottom three – Brighton trail them on goals scored – and are in danger of losing momentum.\n\n“We just never seemed to get a grasp of the game in the second half,” Moyes said. “It was disappointing.”\n\nMoyes, who denied that Henry’s dismissal had distracted his players, was preparing to give Jordan Hugill his debut with 15 minutes left. But the striker’s jog up the touchline merely granted him a better view of Gross thumping a superb shot past Adrián from 18 yards.\n\nBrighton had failed to score in nine of their previous 13 league matches, yet they have scored six in two games against West Ham.\n\n“Where’s the money gone?” the West Ham fans chanted.

The Algerian’s value is clear – Leicester have failed to win the four Premier League matches that Mahrez has missed since the start of last season – and Claude Puel must curse that moment when Manchester City came knocking on their door just before transfer deadline day.\n\nAlthough Leicester started brightly and took a deserved lead through Jamie Vardy’s 13th goal of the season, they lost their way in the second half and lacked the creativity and imagination to break down a resolute Swansea side after Federico Fernández had punished some poor defending to equalise.\n\nLeicester resorted to pumping long balls into the Swansea area in the second half as frustration grew among the home supporters and it was tempting to wonder how much different life may have been had Mahrez been weaving his magic on the wing. The 26-year-old has not showed up for training since last Monday, however, and it is impossible for anyone to say when he will be wearing a Leicester shirt again. “Riyad is not my preoccupation straight after the game,” Puel said.\n\nThe Leicester manager was clearly exasperated that his side had allowed two points to slip through their fingers at the end of an extremely testing week. “A big frustration,” said Puel as he reflected on the way that Leicester, who were utterly dominant against Swansea for the first half an hour, failed to add a second goal before the interval. “We played very well but without finding the clinical edge.”\n\nCarlos Carvalhal, in contrast, was delighted with the way that Swansea recovered in the second half to continue their upward path and collect the precious point that lifts them out of the relegation zone. “A point is like gold for us at the moment,” said Carvalhal, who has lost one of his six league games in charge.\n\nThe only bad news for Swansea was the potentially serious Achilles injury that caused Leroy Fer to leave the pitch on a stretcher in the first half. By that stage, Swansea were a goal behind after Vardy, set up by Kelechi Iheanacho, expertly opened up his body to steer the ball beyond Lukasz Fabianski.\n\nLeicester should have had a second 12 minutes later but Fabianski repelled Fousseni Diabaté’s shot and Iheanacho’s follow-up effort was blocked on the line by Alfie Mawson.\n\nThat felt like a turning point, especially when Fernández got away from Christian Fuchs to head home Ki Sung-yueng’s corner and punish the sort of slack marking on set-pieces that has been a feature of Leicester’s season.\n\nAlthough Diabaté side-footed a first-time effort narrowly wide later on, after a nice exchange with Vardy, that was a rare Leicester chance in a second half when the home team huffed and puffed without much finesse."}, {"date":

United is that Manchester City’s lead has been cut to 13 points. The bad news, apart from the fact that 13 points is still a lot, is that this performance was not a vast improvement on the one against Tottenham at Wembley.\n\nWhile Huddersfield were overcome in the end they were hardly put to the sword, and now the optimism of early season has evaporated they look more like a Championship outfit with every dispiriting result. And not a particularly impressive Championship side either. Though the points were welcome United will not frighten any of their top-four rivals playing like this and José Mourinho even expressed disappointment with the atmosphere, describing Old Trafford as “a quiet stadium”.\n\nIt certainly was for this game. Considering Mourinho now believes he has an unimprovable front line the wow factor is taking its time to return to Old Trafford. Long stretches of the first half were positively stodgy, with most of the game passing Romelu Lukaku by and Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard only occasionally looking threatening.\n\nWhile the one-man entertainment industry that is Alexis Sánchez was eye-catching throughout, it was not always in a good way. The way he made space for a right-foot shot from the edge of the penalty area that forced a scrambling save from Jonas Lössl was sublime, as were a couple of his passes to Mata and Antonio Valencia, yet he ended the first half furious that the referee had not awarded him a free-kick in the middle of the pitch and lost his cool to the extent that he was booked in stoppage time for an unnecessary foul on Florent Hadergjonaj.\n\nHuddersfield were much more solid than they had been in losing to Liverpool in midweek, though they were lucky to reach the interval level after the referee, Stuart Attwell, somehow failed to see Terence Kongolo’s blatant barge into Scott McTominay as a penalty. McTominay fell awkwardly and hurt himself but managed to struggle on, as one might expect of a player selected ahead of Paul Pogba.\n\nIt had looked as if the home side might be in for an easy afternoon when Sánchez helped send Lingard clear after eight minutes to bring the first save from Lössl, yet it was a false impression. Huddersfield defended well and United rarely summoned that attacking fluency again.\n\nThey did take the lead early in the second half, however, capitalising on the visitors giving the ball away in their own half. Nemanja Matic lost no time in finding Mata in space on the left and his cross gave Lukaku something to attack for the first time. The striker was alert enough to seize his opportunity, sticking out a foot to beat Christopher Schindler to the ball and send a shot into Lössl’s bottom corner.\n\nUnited breathed a little easier after that with Mourinho feeling relaxed enough to send on first Pogba and then Marcus Rashford.\n\nBetween the substitutions the lead was increased, Sánchez first winning a penalty against Michael Hefele, seeing his spot-kick saved but tucking away the rebound to register his first United goal on his home debut. The Chilean deserved it, if only for the number of times he was fouled.\n\nJust about all of the Huddersfield back line had a go, partly because Sánchez ended up at centre-forward and played all across the pitch, and while there was nothing especially nasty or dangerous it was tediously repetitive. Anyone who did not know better might have concluded that Sánchez earns his prodigious wages for constantly picking himself up off the grass.\n\n“Old Trafford will suit him despite it being a quiet stadium,” Mourinho said. “Alexis is a fantastic player but he’s not a prima donna, he’s a humble guy. He came in for some attention but he’s used to that, he never stopped running. He was nearly dead at the end but I think he enjoyed the game.”"}, {"date": "03/02/2018", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25911, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Hegazy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [4], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [72], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Field", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rekeem Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Jameson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [43], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wesley Hoedt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [55], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Guido Carrillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Southampton, so often wasteful, produced a rare display of efficiency to complement their nimble play and deservedly prevail in this battle of two beleaguered sides. By coming from behind to claim a first Premier League away win since September, they climbed out of the relegation zone, eased pressure on Mauricio Pellegrino and plunged West Brom into deeper bother.\n\nThe home team took an early lead through Ahmed Hegazi but wound up soundly beaten. A smattering of boos at the final whistle suggested many locals found little consolation in the fact this was relatively entertaining fare. West Brom were again more enterprising than they had been under Tony Pulis but the result means they have won only one league match since Alan Pardew took over in November. They were a point above the relegation zone then; this defeat leaves them four adrift at the foot of the table.\n\nWith both teams in the bottom three before play began, the Hawthorns might have been gripped by tension but the atmosphere before kick-off was quite different – appreciative, almost joyful – thanks to a wonderful celebration of the life of Cyrille Regis. It was suitably warm and powerful.\n\nAfter attention turned to the match, West Brom fans leapt to rejoice at Hegazi’s opening goal. The manner of it seemed ominous for Southampton, as the centre-back brushed easily past Jack Stephens in the fourth minute to head Chris Brunt’s corner into the net. The visitors had failed abysmally to defend against West Brom’s most obvious threat.\n\nSouthampton looked to be in trouble and it was not long before Pellegrino was targeted by a rendition of “you’re getting sacked in the morning”. But his team soon shut up the singers, turning the tables with two goals just before the break and a third shortly after it.\n\nMario Lemina, integral to most Southampton moves, struck their first goal in the 40th minute, lashing into the net from 25 yards. Three minutes later, Stephens atoned for his earlier mistake by giving Hegazi the slip at a corner and glancing James Ward-Prowse’s delivery into the net.\n\nWhen Southampton were awarded a free-kick just outside the box in the 55th minute, Sofiane Boufal demanded to take it. But Ward-Prowse refused to give him the ball and the Moroccan was ushered away by team-mates. Then Ward-Prowse curled the ball beyond the West Brom wall and into the net. Point proved.\n\n“It’s good when you are positive and want to do it,” said Pellegrino of Boufal’s attempted usurpation. “But when you’re too ambitious, it’s not too good. But all of them are young and will learn and think to do what is best for the team.”\n\nThe 3-1 scoreline reflected the play in the first hour because, once they came to terms with their rude awakening, Southampton were the better side. Yet for all their fluent play, they suffered for a while from a familiar lack of edge. Even their record signing, Guido Carrillo, fluffed a couple of early chances on his first start. Gradually Southampton grew teeth. Carrillo would have equalised from a header around the half-hour if not for an excellent one-handed save by Ben Foster.\n\nDaniel Sturridge fired a cross-shot inches wide after a delightful through-ball by Brunt. The Liverpool loanee twinkled on his first start for West Brom but faded before being withdrawn in the 62nd minute. That was probably down to a lack of fitness and a dearth of regular service. West Brom’s long injury list was a factor in that and also, according to Pardew, in the result. “The squad was a little light today and I think that showed,” he said. “Southampton looked a little fresher.”\n\nPardew threw on every available attacker as West Brom went in search of a route back into contention.

For Arsenal this was an evening of instant ignition, a 5-1 win that scarcely reflected their superiority against a meek and muddled Everton.\n\nArsène Wenger had enjoyed one of his more frantic January transfer windows, the doors of the Emirates revolving like the barrels on a Las Vegas slot machine. On a chilly north London day the fruits of those toils clicked beautifully into place. Most notably Henrikh Mkhitaryan produced a wonderfully deft display of attacking craft, creating three of Arsenal’s goals, while Aaron Ramsey rampaged unimpeded in central midfield and scored the first hat-trick of his career.\n\nArsenal 5-1 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThere were riches all over the pitch. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored on his debut and showed signs of the supercharged speed he still has in reserve, the kind of speed that alters the entire feel of a game, and which Arsenal have lacked in a centre-forward since Thierry Henry left. Behind Aubameyang the re-signed Mesut Özil played like he had just woken up surrounded by the most wonderful array of birthday presents.\n\nEven before kick-off there were elements of the Premier League at its brash, shopaholic best, with intriguing nuggets of rejig and relocation shot through both sides. Eliaquim Mangala made his debut for Everton while his team-mate Theo Walcott was applauded warmly on his return.\n\nPlay Video 0:47 Wenger excited by new Arsenal arrivals Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan – video\n\nFor Arsenal the new challenge of finding the space to cram in all their mature attacking galácticos saw Mkhitaryan and Özil providing a dreamy-looking creative fulcrum alongside the muscular prompts of Alex Iwobi. It all fell into place. The first half in particular had a sheen of quick-passing perfection as Everton were repeatedly scythed apart, albeit an Everton who seemed to have forgotten not just how to defend, but that defending existed as a concept in the first place. Afterwards Sam Allardyce described his team’s performance as “pathetic” and “crap”, complaining bitterly of the inability of his players to follow a gameplan\n\nInstead the traffic flowed one way, beginning with a beautifully worked goal after six minutes. Özil played a neat pass into Aubameyang, who laid the ball out to Mkhitaryan on the right. From his low cross Ramsey had space to tuck the ball home at his leisure. It was a goal that had some of that deceptive old Arsenal ease about it, the high-speed passing football Wenger is so keen to return to. And so it went on.\n\nWith 13 minutes gone Aubameyang had his first sight of goal, his shot from Ramsey’s cross blocked by a sprawling challenge. From Özil’s corner Shkodran Mustafi flicked on and Laurent Koscielny was free, almost on the line, to dive and head in the second.\n\nEuropean roundup: Ribéry and Rodríguez help Bayern see off Mainz Read more\n\nTime and again in those early moments Everton struggled to track the movement of Arsenal’s midfield and the runs of the forward players into space behind the wing-backs. The third goal duly arrived on 19 minutes at the end of another lovely move. Özil’s run and pass found Ramsey with enough time to think for a bit, scratch his ear and finally decide on a sidefoot shot that found the top of the net via a deflection off Mangala.\n\nShortly after there was a glimpse of Aubameyang in full flight, scampering away into the open green spaces and leaving four blue shirts for dead before his low shot was well saved by Jordan Pickford. His goal was coming. It duly arrived two minutes later. Iwobi found Mkhitaryan, who turned and played the perfect nudged pass into Aubameyang’s run. His dinked finish on the move was a thing of beauty, the ball hanging gently in the north London air before nuzzling into the corner of the net with Aubameyang already celebrating.\n\nEverton began the second half with a surge of Sam-driven energy. For a while they swarmed over Arsenal’s midfield as the home team looked a little sleepy and sated. Oumar Niasse hit a post but really should have scored, sliding on to Walcott’s low cross and colliding heavily with Petr Cech. They deservedly pulled one back, the substitute Dominic Calvert-Lewin planting a fine header past Cech from Yannick Bolasie’s cross. Cech left the field injured shortly afterwards, suffering from his collision with Niasse.\n\nTom Davies and Morgan Schneiderlin had been key for Everton in that period, as the visitors finally began to compress the spaces in central midfield. Ramsey demonstrated the other side of this on 74 minutes, striding forward and pinging a low shot past Pickford to complete his hat-trick from another perfectly weighted Mkhitaryan cross. With the decks cleared of malcontents and an infusion of high-class blood this felt like a fresh start to the season for Arsenal.\n\nMkhitaryan and Aubameyang in particular, so familiar from their Dortmund days, performed like a genuinely alluring bolt-on attacking part.

So much of this new start would have reminded him of his darker days at Arsenal. Only 24 hours previously he had been summoned from the bench in South Wales as his old team succumbed to Swansea, then the Premier League’s bottom club. Now, having been prised away by the champions, he endured having to watch his new side capitulate against another team apparently threatened by the drop.\n\nThe Frenchman was supposed to have left nights like this behind. Instead he shivered in disbelief as Chelsea succumbed to their worst home defeat since April 2016. Bournemouth were excellent, rugged when they needed to be and ruthless in a blistering spell after the break, and ended up running riot. Their first three-goal haul away to a top-six opponent must rank as their most startling top-flight victory, a game which exposes their previously lowly position as a deception.\n\nPerform like this over what remains of the season and they will nestle more permanently in the top half, where they have now clambered. “When we won here in our first season in the Premier League it was an historic day but it was backs against the wall,” said Eddie Howe, whose team have now gone six games unbeaten in the league. “But there was no luck connected to today. It was a very strong performance throughout and a huge moment for us this season. The best performance that we’ve had at this level and a result to match.”\n\nChristian Eriksen’s lightning start for Tottenham blindsides Manchester United Read more\n\nChelsea, their own eight-match unbeaten league run in tatters, suddenly look distinctly vulnerable in fourth. Their own title defence had long since faded, with this in effect a loss in a competition they stand no chance of winning. But it was the humiliation, and the looming possibility of being overhauled by Tottenham, which will have stung Antonio Conte in the dugout and, more pertinently, the hierarchy up in the directors’ box. Bournemouth have made a habit of beating reigning champions since rising to this level but the comprehensive nature of this win said much about these teams’ current trajectories. It ended up as a rout.\n\nThe visitors had frustrated Chelsea up to the break, crowding out Eden Hazard when the Belgian sought to inspire from his central brief and hinting at the threat they might carry on the counterattack. Where the hosts were lethargic, Bournemouth were energetic. Their incision would be far sharper and more obvious after the interval. Chelsea, with Conte looking on in disbelief, simply fell to pieces, unable to contain the direct running of Callum Wilson and Junior Stanislas. The home side had not conceded a goal at home in the league for 489 minutes. Yet, to gasps of astonishment from the sidelines, they would ship three in 16 minutes around the hour-mark.\n\nPlay Video 0:42 Conte insists he's doing 'great job' despite Chelsea rout – video\n\nA defence shorn of the hamstrung Andreas Christensen merely disintegrated. Chelsea were still digesting Marcos Alonso’s near miss from a free-kick at the other end when Tiémoué Bakayoko dawdled in possession and, in the counterattack that followed, Jordon Ibe collected from the excellent Wilson and slipped a pass between Gary Cahill and Antonio Rüdiger for the striker to accept. The finish was calmly and confidently slid under the advancing Thibaut Courtois. Within minutes any hopes of recovery were choked by another incisive and precise move upfield, again featuring Wilson’s driving run and pass to Stanislas at his side. The winger finished through Courtois’ legs and Chelsea seemed broken.\n\nTheirs was a panic the kind of which has not gripped these parts since the unravelling of José Mourinho’s second spell in charge. Another Bournemouth corner duly inflicted more pain, Chelsea failing to clear before Stanislas’ shot was flicked in by Nathan Aké, formerly of these parts, from close range. Howe described it as “the best display” he had ever overseen at Bournemouth, which says much given their rise from the third tier. The home support defiantly chanted Conte’s name, preferring to reaffirm their support of the head coach than berate the team’s disjointed display, but they can see the signs.\n\nToo many of this squad are fatigued by their schedule, with Ross Barkley still horribly rusty and withdrawn from his first start. Others are succumbing to muscular tweaks and strains. The Champions League resumes in a few weeks and there was admirable black humour to the locals’ ironic chants of “Barcelona, we’re coming for you”. That tie looks increasingly daunting.

The night belonged to Séamus Coleman, a player who had given everything to grace this famous old ground once again. Everton, and Theo Walcott in particular, thrived on his quality and passion to record a crucial first win of the year.\n\nTen months on from suffering a double leg fracture at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin, the Republic of Ireland captain returned to the Premier League with a performance that not only allayed doubts about his powers of recovery but instantly underlined his importance to Everton.\n\nColeman came to the fore as Sam Allardyce’s team took control against Leicester and Walcott announced his arrival from Arsenal in style with his first two goals for the club. The defender was also prominent in repelling a late fightback from Leicester that had seemed unlikely until Wayne Rooney fouled Wilfred Ndidi inside the area and Jamie Vardy scored from the penalty spot. Strong in the tackle and rampaging forward even in stoppage time, Coleman set the example for Everton to follow in claiming their first victory for eight matches.\n\nThe respect he commands was evident on the final whistle. Vardy and Kasper Schmeichel offered hugs and words of praise. Goodison resounded to the sound of “Sixty Grand, Sixty Grand, Séamus Coleman”. Nights like this make 10 months in the gym worthwhile. “For Séamus to finish the 90 minutes and in the 92nd minute go on a run of 80 yards with the ball was outstanding for me and an example to every player at this football club,” said Allardyce. “To perform with that energy and quality when you’ve been out for 10 months is just marvellous to see.”\n\nWalcott struck up an instant rapport with the Irish captain on Everton’s right flank and provided the cutting edge the team have lacked all season to continue his fine start since arriving from Arsenal for £20m. His energy and confidence also proved infectious to Everton, who started with a sluggishness reminiscent of their last home appearance against West Bromwich Albion before claiming the upper hand and a deserved win.\n\nClaude Puel claimed his Leicester team would not make an excuse of Mahrez’s absence as he waited in vain to join Manchester City but the distraction was unavoidable. The visitors started the brighter and could have established a comfortable early lead when Harry Maguire headed over from a Marc Albrighton corner and Ndidi steered another header against the crossbar, but their levels plummeted as soon as they fell behind.\n\nCuco Martina instigated the breakthrough by dispossessing Ben Chilwell just outside the Leicester penalty area. The ball broke for Gylfi Sigurdsson, who picked out Walcott arriving unmarked at the back post and he converted with ease past Schmeichel.\n\nOumar Niasse, favoured in attack to the new £27m signing Cenk Tosun, should have doubled Everton’s lead but dragged horribly wide with the goal gaping. Goodison was a mass of people with hands on heads at the miss, but moments later it was forgotten. Sigurdsson and Rooney combined in midfield for the latter to send a deep cross to the back post where Michael Keane and Daniel Amartey duelled for the header. The ball appeared to spin off the Leicester defender’s head and fell perfectly for Walcott, standing unmarked on the other side of the area, to volley home his second under the exposed Schmeichel.\n\nEverton squandered several chances to extend their lead and it was only after Vardy’s late penalty that nerves crept in and Leicester rallied.

As Rafael Benítez’s relegation fears intensified it was crystal clear that Islam Slimani’s loan signing from Leicester City has not come a moment too soon.\n\nWith another loanee, Chelsea’s Kenedy, shining on his debut, Benítez should have celebrated a first home Premier League victory since October but instead Burnley’s Sean Dyche was the manager smiling broadly at the end after the substitute Sam Vokes forced Karl Darlow into an equalising own goal.\n\n“We had to win but we couldn’t do it,” said Newcastle’s manager, who is angry with the club’s owner, Mike Ashley, for not completing more transfer business much earlier on a night Aleksandar Mitrović left to join Fulham on loan and Slovakian goalkeeper Martin Dubravka arrived from Sparta Prague, also on loan. “We knew that bringing in players early was important for us, especially with games like Swansea [also drawn] and Burnley here this month.”\n\nThis was a night Newcastle’s supporters also made clear their feelings about Ashley. Prior to kick-off, a huge banner was unfurled in the Gallowgate End that read: “He is only one man, we are a city.”\n\nKenedy had created the opening goal for Jamaal Lascelles, the breakthrough arriving shortly after news filtered through that Slimani had finally joined. As Slimani completed his medical, Kenedy announced his arrival with a ferocious shot which, much to the Gallowgate End’s disappointment, was tipped on to a post by Nick Pope. Although Christian Atsu met the rebound, the winger’s follow up shot was weak and easily saved by Dyche’s goalkeeper.\n\nSignificantly Mo Diamé had been heavily involved in the preamble and, operating in his preferred holding role, the Senegal midfielder enjoyed a decent game. Diamé helped ensure Newcastle dominated possession but Burnley are nothing if not resilient and they took perverse delight in weathering the Geordie storm before gradually highlighting vulnerabilities in Benítez’s defence.\n\nLascelles has so often proved the cornerstone of that unit but he seemed shaky in the face of Ashley Barnes’s manoeuvres, regressing to bad old habits at times. Across at left-back, Paul Dummett might have conceded a penalty after fouling Jack Cork, while Barnes had the ball in the back of the net only for that ‘goal’ to be disallowed for his perceived push on Lascelles. Disagreeing, Dyche thought it was a mere hand on the back and the defender had collapsed too easily.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A huge banner in protest at Newcastle United’s owner, Mike Ashley, is unfurled in the Gallowgate End prior to kick-off. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images\n\nNewcastle should have taken the lead from the penalty spot after Kenedy was felled by Phil Bardsley. Joselu took the kick but never looked confident ahead of a poor attempt which the diving Pope saved easily.\n\nEarlier Ciaran Clark had missed a highly inviting headed chance which felt strangely emblematic of the numerous opportunities Benítez’s players have created but failed to convert in recent month. Slimani’s penalty area presence is much craved.\n\nThe bad news for Dyche is that he must cope without Steven Defour for at least two months after Burnley’s star creator underwent knee surgery this week. All the early indications are that, further north and east, Kenedy can provide a similar sort of catalytic spark, not to mention helpfully join the dots between midfield and attack.\n\nFrom Kenedy’s corner Joselu might have scored but instead headed over from six yards. At the other end, though, Barnes curled a left-footed shot fractionally off target after the striker had again given Lascelles the slip and only a splendid Dummett tackle came between Johann Berg-Gudmundsson and a goal for Burnley.\n\nAt the time the latter cameo seemed a potential watershed moment for Benítez, an impression reinforced when, shortly afterwards, Lascelles redeemed himself by scoring.\n\nAnother Kenedy corner was met by the defender who out-jumped all comers before powering a header beyond the suddenly helpless Pope. Newcastle were ascendant but, when Joselu subsequently missed a sitter, doubts began intruding on those wearing black and white, inhibiting their clarity of decision-making.\n\nSure enough, as Vokes connected with Cork’s corner, Karl Darlow initially tipped his header on to the bar, only to end up pushing it into his own net.\n\n“A hard won point for a patched up side,” said Dyche, whose side improved following Aaron Lennon’s introduction. “The first half was a bit soft from us. Newcastle were better, although we should have had a penalty. But, in the end we gave everything to get something.”"}, {"date": "31/01/2018", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30034, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex

thin.\n\nSouthampton paid a club-record £19.2m for the striker Guido Carrillo last week but it was Stephens’ second-half backheel that earned Saints a point in the fight for survival at home to a Brighton side who led through Glenn Murray’s penalty.\n\nThis meek performance and result extended Saints’ winless Premier League run to 12 matches – equalling a record set during the 1994-95 season – and did little to suggest they will waltz out of the bottom three anytime soon. Pellegrino had likened the manager’s job to being in an electric chair and at times this was a painful exercise for all concerned parties.\n\nManchester City end interest in Riyad Mahrez after rejecting £95m price tag Read more\n\nAsked if his job hinges on victory at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, the Southampton manager replied: “I don’t want to be naive, I know that in football results are everything. But, in two or three weeks’ time, everything can change.” Time, however, is running out, with Saints having tasted victory only four times in the league all season, three on home turf.\n\nIn a game of such magnitude, Southampton’s slack start was alarming. With only 27 seconds on the clock José Izquierdo blasted over. Saints did not heed the warning signs and when Izquierdo sped beyond Cédric Soares, he unselfishly squared for Solly March, who swivelled inside the box before being caught by Wesley Hoedt’s trailing leg. The referee, Mike Dean, pointed to the spot and Murray calmly side-footed home his ninth goal of the season.\n\nIn the directors’ box, where Les Reed, the executive director, and Ralph Krueger, the chairman, watched on, there were only glum expressions. Pellegrino admits the board’s continued backing is “one of the most important victories”.\n\nSouthampton quickly ran out of ideas although almost earned what would have been a freak lifeline. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg chased down Mathew Ryan’s clearance and the ball cannoned off the back of the Saints midfielder and smacked the crossbar, incensing Chris Hughton.\n\nSomething had to change at the interval, with a home defeat non-negotiable for an increasingly volatile home crowd. Carrillo entered for his league debut but it was Stephens, the match-winner at home last Saturday, who got the faintest of touches on James Ward-Prowse’s deflected free-kick to draw Saints level.\n\nAs for Brighton’s record signing, Jürgen Locadia, Hughton is hopeful he can play some part against Stoke City next weekend.\n\nSuddenly the weight was thrown off Southampton’s shoulders. Carrillo drove wide before Steven Davis sent Ryan sprawling. Pellegrino cut a figure of panic, desperately trying to get hold of the ball as it bounced over the advertising hoardings during three minutes of added time.

"report": "Manchester City took care of business on a night when a 22nd league win of their ever-more dazzling campaign took them to 101 goals in all competitions.\n\nOnce more Pep Guardiola’s side dominated, making West Brom appear the Championship team they may become, as they returned home still rooted to the bottom. At the close the City manager was again unhappy at a challenge meted out to one of his players, Brahim Díaz. Matt Phillips was the offender, catching the Spaniard late and high as the final whistle neared. Kevin De Bruyne had also been caught by James McClean, in the buildup to his goal.\n\nAll of this followed Leroy Sané suffering ankle ligament damage thanks to Cardiff City’s Ryan Bennett on Saturday. Of the challenge by Phillips, Guardiola, who was visibly unhappy on the touchline, said: “We spoke with Kevin [Friend], the fourth official. They [match officials] have an opinion, I have another one, they’re the bosses, I accept that. Today we were lucky, three or four days ago we were unlucky with Leroy [Sané]. The image speaks for itself. I could repeat what I said after the last game but it’s not necessary.”\n\nYet Alan Pardew pointed to Fernandinho, who may have stamped on Grzegorz Krychowiak in the first half, the Pole having to be replaced. “It was a poor challenge, make no mistake about that,” said West Brom’s manager of Phillips. “Fernandinho made a similar one in the middle of the pitch. I’m not sure if the referee saw it. I thought Pep’s comments at the weekend affected the crowd. Every challenge they were saying: ‘You’re not protecting our players, referee.’ There were a few songs sung about him [Robert Madley] but I actually thought he had a decent game. His calls were correct and it was a yellow card for Phillips no doubt. Gregorz struggled after that but I haven’t seen it. He didn’t think it was particularly great.”\n\nOn a frantic day in which City ended their interest in Riyad Mahrez due to Leicester’s £95m valuation, Aymeric Laporte – who on Tuesday became City’s club record signing – started in central defence alongside Nicolás Otamendi.\n\nThe Frenchman was one of two changes from City’s last league outing 11 days ago, along with Bernardo Silva, who came in for Sané. While Laporte’s selection may have been due to a John Stones illness, West Brom’s bench featured Daniel Sturridge, who joined on loan from Liverpool on Tuesday. Pardew made five changes from the previous league fixture.\n\nManchester City v WBA, Chelsea v Bournemouth and more: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nCity were a blue blur throughout, their opener arriving via Fernandinho, who made a schemer’s run to finish a supreme De Bruyne ball. As the interval neared this had become akin to a shooting practice session for the Belgian. One chance featured a one-two with Sergio Agüero, then Ben Foster had to fling himself high to keep the deficit at one. The half ended with David Silva having to be replaced by Ilkay Gündogan due to what looked like a back problem.\n\nGuardiola’s instructions to his men for the second half may have been to keep on probing and more goals would surely follow. From the kick-off City were again in Baggies territory, making life uncomfortable for them. Gündogan immediately displayed his ability. A shimmy was followed by a pass to Sterling and, now, City seemed certain to double their lead. Yet after the forward did the hard part – a drag-back that removed a defender from the equation – his dipping effort missed wide to Foster’s left-hand post.\n\nNow came some of Guardiola’s particular man-management. After Claudio Yacob felled Gündogan, Sterling was frantically waved over by his manager. When the No 7 reached Guardiola he was rewarded with a warm embrace that included a smacker on his cheek, to console him for the miss.\n\n“When you ask me what can he improve – it is that [finishing],” said the Catalan. “When he can he’ll be a top-class player.” De Bruyne did, finally, score in a move he also started, finishing from Sterling’s pass as McClean’s challenge brought boos, and he was booked. Agüero made it 3-0, moments after the challenge from Phillips on Díaz, for which he received only a booking.\n\nBy the close City had coasted to their latest emphatic victory.

prospects.\n\nJavi Gracia, who was in charge of his first Premier League game since becoming Watford’s manager, is entitled to take some satisfaction from collecting his first point, yet it was hard to see how Paul Lambert, his opposite number, could glean many positives from a stalemate that was every bit as bad as the scoreline suggests.\n\nThe one piece of good news for Stoke is that they are out of the relegation zone, although it is hard to escape the feeling this was two points dropped for the home team on a night when Jon Moss, the referee, was as busy as anyone.\n\nCallum Wilson sparks shock Bournemouth rout of Chelsea Read more\n\nTempers boiled over time and again, just as they did in the corresponding fixture at Vicarage Road in October, after which Troy Deeney was retrospectively banned, and it was something of a surprise the game finished with 22 players on the pitch.\n\nIt was a fractious, scrappy affair from start to finish and the smattering of boos at the final whistle were as predictable as the result. Stoke looked desperately flat, there was no real tempo to their game and a glaring lack of conviction in front of goal, where the absence of a centre-forward with a real presence continues to handicap them. Their best chance fell to Xherdan Shaqiri, who thumped a shot straight at Orestis Karnezis, the Watford goalkeeper, shortly after the hour mark.\n\nWatford could, and possibly should, have snatched victory in the 84th minute when the ball dropped invitingly for Roberto Pereyra, who was only about six yards out. The Watford substitute ended up hitting the ball with his shin more than his boot, enabling Jack Butland to save.\n\nAlthough Stoke’s Mame Diouf and Maxim Choupo-Moting had early chances, and Richarlison lifted Gerard Deulofeu’s cross over the bar from only six yards out for Watford, goalmouth action was in short supply in a game that had no real ebb and flow. The flurry of bookings hardly helped – four for Stoke and three for Watford – and at times it threatened to get a little out of hand. Christian Kabasele, the Watford defender, appeared to be guilty of play-acting, when he dramatically fell to the floor holding his face after clashing with Diouf.\n\nIt was that sort of game and not one that will live long in the memory, with the biggest cheer of the night reserved for Badou Ndiaye, a £14m signing from Galatasaray, who was introduced to the Stoke supporters on the pitch at

of strange sub-plots and a personal ordeal for several Manchester United players, but the most important detail is that Tottenham Hotspur had outplayed, out-thought and out-fought them and that, more than anything, will be the abiding memory of a night when José Mourinho officially gave up the pretence that the title race was still alive.\n\nIt was certainly difficult to make total sense of a night when Mourinho abandoned the first half by heading down the tunnel on the 43-minute mark, substituted Paul Pogba with half an hour to go and described his team as “ridiculous” for conceding a goal after 11 seconds. Christian Eriksen’s first touch in a brilliant Spurs performance was not quite the quickest goal of the Premier League era – that record belonging to another Spurs man, Ledley King, for scoring 10 seconds into a game against Bradford City in 2000 – but it is difficult to think there has been another occasion in United’s history when the ball has been in their net before any of their players has managed a single touch.\n\nUltimately, though, the real story here was of Spurs putting on their most enthralling display since beating Real Madrid at the start of November, of “olés” sweeping round the largest crowd, 81,978, there has been in the Premier League and of an opening 45 minutes when Mauricio Pochettino’s players were so dominant that a number of their opponents, most notably Phil Jones and Chris Smalling, looked as if they might need a dose of smelling salts at the interval.\n\nJones, in particular, had a wretched night and it was not just with his own goal, putting Kieran Trippier’s low cross past David de Gea after 28 minutes, when it was difficult to remember he was supposed to be England’s first-choice centre-half. Harry Kane had him on toast. Yet this was not just a one-man failure and it must have been startling for Mourinho to see the way his entire team looked ill at ease when the home side swarmed forward. If anything, it was just a surprise Spurs did not add more goals and Kane was understandably aggrieved with Son Heung-min for trying, and failing, to beat De Gea with a second-half effort when a sideways pass would have left the striker with an open goal.\n\nSmalling found it just as difficult as Jones to keep order and, as well as scoring twice during the first half, Spurs could conceivably have had a penalty for Antonio Valencia’s scything challenge on Dele Alli. Lucas Moura, the club’s £25m recruit from Paris Saint-Germain, was in the stands and it was a thrilling way to introduce the Brazilian to his team-mates. On this evidence Moura’s only concern ought to be how to shoehorn himself into the side when Eriksen, Alli and Son are so effective in the spaces around Kane.\n\nAlexis Sánchez must certainly have hoped his first league appearance for United would be a happier occasion and it felt very much as if Mourinho was making a point when he withdrew Pogba during the only period of the game, conversely, when the away side were daring to think a revival was possible. Mourinho, like his players, did not have an impressive night and the changes did not lead to any improvement in a midfield where Nemanja Matic looks jaded and is not having anything like the influence he exerted earlier in the season.\n\nThe substitute Marouane Fellaini was withdrawn seven minutes later and, at the time, it felt in keeping with the rest of the night that Mourinho had simply decided it was a mistake to have brought him on. Not so, the United manager insisted afterwards, revealing the Belgian had suffered a recurrence of a knee injury.\n\nMourinho’s post-match press conference lasted the grand total of three minutes, revealing his mood on the evening that a 15-point gap opened up between his team and Manchester City at the top – the same gulf that exists between Burnley in seventh place and West Bromwich Albion in bottom spot.\n\nSpurs, in fifth place, are now six points clear of Arsenal and, when they play with this energy and vibrancy, it is a surprise they are not even higher up the league. The only real moments of danger for Pochettino’s men in the second half came early on when Hugo Lloris saved from Romelu Lukaku and there was a penalty appeal for a handball by Son.\n\nThat apart, the home side dominated virtually the entire game after that extraordinary start when Mousa Dembélé turned the kick-off back, Jan Vertonghen’s next pass went long and Kane beat Jones to the header to give Alli the chance to shoot with his first touch.\n\nAlli could not get a clean connection but the ball fell invitingly for Eriksen to score the 50th Tottenham goal of his career."}, {"date":

hope that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is a man of his word because this was the sort of listless performance that could easily prompt a rethink. Arsenal, as has been the case so often this season away from home, delivered a meek and spineless display that suggested it will take much more than a club-record signing up front to address their problems.\n\nJust about everything that could go wrong did go wrong for Arsenal on a sobering night for their manager and players. They conceded within 60 seconds of taking the lead, Petr Cech then presented Swansea with their second goal when his awful miscue landed at the feet of the indefatigable Jordan Ayew and Arsenal’s ignominy was complete when Sam Clucas scored his second of the evening in the closing minutes.\n\nArsène Wenger angry at ‘unconvincing’ Arsenal after shock Swansea defeat Read more\n\nSwansea, bottom of the league at the start of the day, deserve huge credit for ruthlessly exposing Arsenal’s weaknesses. They are now out of the relegation zone for the first time since the beginning of November and the turnaround since Carlos Carvalhal took over as manager from Paul Clement is truly remarkable. The sight of Clucas, who was a maligned figure six weeks ago, leaving the pitch to a standing ovation from the home supporters when he was withdrawn late on feels emblematic of just how much life has changed in these parts following the arrival of their Portuguese manager.\n\nSwansea have picked up 10 points from five games under Carvalhal, won back-to-back league matches for the first time this season – against Liverpool and Arsenal – and look totally unrecognisable from the team that were sleepwalking towards the Championship barely a month ago. That Carvalhal has not added a single player to his squad in that time makes the transformation all the more impressive.\n\n“We are very happy,” the Swansea manager said. “To win against Arsenal after beating Liverpool means I’m proud of my players. They deserve all the credit. I told the players we are ready to do something different and I said after the win at Watford we are not dead, we are breathing. We have a chance of staying up. We are not in intensive care but we are not far away from the doctor saying we can go home.”\n\nArsenal, as things stand, are far more in need of emergency treatment. Wenger was left bemoaning “huge and massive mistakes” as Arsenal played into the hands of a Swansea side that were set up to sit deep, frustrate and strike on the counterattack. That was Carvalhal’s game-plan and Swansea executed it perfectly in the second half in particular. The opening 45 minutes was a different story as Swansea accepted Arsenal’s invitation to attack them and created a succession of early chances.\n\nLiverpool’s Roberto Firmino bamboozles flat-footed Huddersfield Read more\n\nIt was half an hour before Arsenal fashioned an opportunity of note, when Alex Iwobi broke free on the edge of the area to drill a left-foot shot that Lukasz Fabianski turned behind. That rare attack proved to be a warning because three minutes later Wenger’s side took the lead. Mesut Özil was the architect, the German given far too much time and space to look up and deliver a perfectly weighted inswinging cross from the right that picked out the run of Nacho Monreal, who ghosted in behind Kyle Naughton to score.\n\nSwansea’s response was instant and from Arsenal’s point of view it was a desperately poor goal to concede. Özil was guilty of losing possession too easily to Martin Olsson deep inside his own half and questions will also be asked about Granit Xhaka’s failure to track Clucas’s run as the midfielder burst on to Alfie Mawson’s threaded pass. Clucas made the next bit look remarkably easy as he took a touch to take the ball away from Laurent Koscielny before steering a fine left-foot shot inside Cech’s near post.\n\nAlthough that equaliser was the least Swansea deserved on the balance of play in the first half, Arsenal dominated the opening 15 minutes after the interval. Chances, however, were few and far between as the home side defended resolutely and made it hard for Arsenal to play through them, prompting Wenger to introduce Henrikh Mkhitaryan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsène Wenger instructs Henrikh Mkhitaryan as he prepares to come on as a substitute for his first Arsenal appearance. Photograph: Matthew Ashton - AMA/Getty Images\n\nWithin a minute, however, Arsenal conceded a second in farcical circumstances. Monreal elected not to keep the ball in play, much to Wenger’s anger, and Shkodran Mustafi, under pressure from Nathan Dyer, passed back to Cech from the throw-in that followed. On a sodden pitch the Arsenal goalkeeper sliced his intended clearance horribly and Ayew had the simple task of rolling the ball into the unguarded net from no more than eight yards for his seventh goal of the season.\n\nIn a final act of desperation Wenger introduced Olivier Giroud, who has all but agreed to join Chelsea, as Arsenal forlornly chased an equaliser.\n\nYet it was Swansea who struck again when Clucas, who caused no end of problems with his dynamic forward running, converted at the near post, leaving Wenger and his players to reflect on that all too familiar feeling away

are still standing displayed no inclination to hide on a night that demanded inspiration rather than perspiration on the pitch. A point was a respectable reward for their efforts, bearing in mind that they were deprived of nearly an entire first team, and David Moyes was satisfied with the way that his weary team soldiered on in trying circumstances.\n\nThey demonstrated their character to fight back after Christian Benteke’s early goal for Crystal Palace, offering another reminder of the excellent job that Moyes has done since replacing Slaven Bilic, and their performance contained enough grit to suggest they are capable of clambering towards safety. Yet they cannot afford any complacency. West Ham are four points above the bottom three – Palace are a point worse off – and Moyes needs his bosses to use every negotiating tactic at their disposal to bring him at least one new signing.\n\nWest Ham’s manager was coy on reports that he will rival Palace for Lille’s Ibrahim Amadou and he confirmed that Swansea City have lodged a bid for André Ayew, with Ki Sung-yeung potentially going the other way. “We’re considering it but we need players in and until we do we can’t make a decision,” Moyes said.\n\nAs for the players at his disposal, Moyes revealed that a breach of discipline forced him to drop Michail Antonio, who was expected to feature after missing a month with a groin injury. “He turned up late for a team meeting and it wasn’t the first time,” he said. “I’m not having it. He’s been in and apologised. He’ll be back training tomorrow. On time.”\n\nFor all that they have missed his dynamism, West Ham cannot tolerate that kind of attitude from Antonio. But with his squad stretched to breaking point by the absence of nine players, it was tempting to wonder if Moyes had spent the day searching for a few ringers. Barely a week goes by without another victim joining West Ham’s injury list and the sight of five callow academy players on the bench was a damning indictment of the hierarchy’s indecisiveness.\n\nYet while a £15m deal for FC Krasnodar’s Fyodor Smolov is doubtful, Moyes was pleased with an enterprising full debut from João Mário. The midfielder almost scored after three minutes, snatching a shot from the edge of the area, and on this evidence signing the Portugal international on loan from Internazionale looks like a good call. “He looked as if he had a diesel engine,” Moyes said.\n\nFor Palace, this was a slog and they were disappointed not to hold on after taking the lead in the 24th minute. Andros Townsend surged past Declan Rice and his cross caught out Angelo Ogbonna, enabling Benteke to head past Adrián for his second goal of the season.\n\nYet Palace’s rhythm was disturbed when Bakary Sako departed with a potentially serious injury. “The medical staff don’t think it looks good at all,” Roy Hodgson said. “We don’t really have the luxury of losing a forward player. You could say it makes it a little bit more imperative that we bring some players in.”\n\nWest Ham responded with heart, dragging themselves level in the 43rd minute. Mário’s impressive persistence forced the ball to Javier Hernández and James Tomkins did his former team a favour when he clumsily fouled the Mexican. Mark Noble converted the penalty to claim his 50th goal for the club.\n\nThe sense that Palace would grow stronger as the match wore on proved misplaced. West Ham hunted in packs to restrict Wilfried Zaha’s space, with the wily Pablo Zabaleta warming to his role in defensive midfield, and they had the best opening in the second half.\n\nMário was starting to relish his new surroundings and when he fed Sam Byram, the wing-back’s delivery ought to have been finished off, only for Hernández to plant his header too close to Wayne Hennessey. It was a fine reaction save from the Palace goalkeeper but Hernández lives for chances like that and it was a surprise not to see him make the net bulge.\n\nAs the hour approached, the game was becoming broken and a bit more to Palace’s liking. However, they were limited in possession. Townsend picked up a booking for diving and thoughts were turning to the spectacle of deadline day long before the end."}, {"date": "30/01/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance":

beginning to look like a Pyrrhic one through being followed by two unexpected defeats against teams from the bottom of the Premier League, so there was considerable relief when first-half goals from Emre Can and Roberto Firmino helped Jürgen Klopp’s side stop the rot in West Yorkshire.\n\n“It was not brilliant but it was deserved,” the Liverpool manager said. “It was the reaction we needed. Sometimes a little bit of pressure is not too bad, it can make you perform.”\n\nThat ought to encourage David Wagner, though the Huddersfield manager knows his players are under much more pressure now.\n\nStrictly speaking Town are not yet a bottom-of-the-table team, though without a league win since mid-December they look to be heading that way. They offered token resistance here, have picked up two home wins since beating Manchester United in October and their next game is at Old Trafford this Saturday. “The quality side won,” Wagner said. “That tends to happen if you don’t have much luck. I see effort and commitment from my players but our confidence isn’t the highest.”\n\nMark Noble on spot to earn makeshift West Ham draw with Crystal Palace Read more\n\nWhile not at their best Liverpool were still slick enough to secure the points to all intents in the first half and could have won by a more convincing margin but for squandering chances later.\n\nThe visitors surprisingly started without Virgil van Dijk, at £75m the most expensive substitute in Liverpool history, while the home side switched to three at the back and gave Laurent Depoitre and Steve Mounié a rare outing together up front. The former was involved in the first opening of the game, stabbing a first-time shot that forced a save from Loris Karius after Philip Billing had flicked on Chris Lowe’s cross. It was a better opportunity than Huddersfield possibly realised but, although Depoitre had a clear sight of goal, the ball was running away from him and he did not have time to steady himself.\n\nHuddersfield were left regretting that when Liverpool took the lead midway through the half. Can had already brought a routine save from Jonas Lössl with an optimistic shot from outside the area but, when a headed clearance from Christopher Schindler came his way a minute later, he had no hesitation in having another go from a similar distance. Philip Billing’s attempt to close him down was a little late and more than a little half-hearted and the midfielder succeeded only in deflecting Can’s effort beyond Lössl.\n\nThat seemed to settle Liverpool, even if the travelling support was well aware that taking the lead against West Brom in the last game had been the signal for their opponents to hit back with three goals.\n\nResurgent Swansea make Petr Cech pay as Sam Clucas double sinks Arsenal Read more\n\nHuddersfield were unlikely to do the same by retreating behind the halfway line, yet that is precisely what they did, inviting Liverpool to pass the ball around the edge of their area. Liverpool are quite good at that and, when Andrew Robertson beat Florent Hadergjonaj to reach the byline, it took a timely intervention by Schindler to prevent his cutback reaching James Milner.\n\nThe only response Huddersfield made before half-time was from a free-kick just outside the area when Chris Löwe’s shot flew narrowly wide. If that was hard luck, Huddersfield had only themselves to blame for going two goals down on the stroke of the interval. The interplay between Milner and Sadio Mané that sent Firmino into the area would have been hard for anyone to counter, though once the Brazilian began to dribble along the goalline towards Lössl the home defenders positioned themselves for a cross. Firmino punished this presumption, squeezing a shot between the goalkeeper and his near post from an impossibly narrow angle.\n\nMané should have increased Liverpool’s lead early in the second half but could not quite summon the power or the placement with a header and, when Milner tried a rising drive from outside the area, the goalkeeper was alert enough to tip his effort over the bar. Mané was wide with another header as the game moved into its final quarter and Mohamed Salah could find only the sidenetting after rounding Lössl.\n\nHuddersfield did have a penalty claim before the end but Kevin Friend waved away appeals for Robertson’s challenge on Collin Quaner, just before awarding one at the other end for Billing’s clumsy but harmless stumble into Can. Salah stepped up to score and further incense the crowd, yet it simply had not been the home side’s night and it could easily have been worse."}, {"date": "22/01/2018", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20886, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike van der Hoorn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roque Mesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver McBurnie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "For Liverpool it is jarring anomalies like these that have blighted their attempted transition into title contenders.

For Swansea, with the season already six months old, perhaps this is lift-off. Alfie Mawson’s first-half goal from Sam Clucas’s corner handed Swansea victory and at the same time destroyed the myth that Liverpool’s set-piece woes would end with the arrival of Virgil van Dijk, who made his league debut, in defence.\n\nSwansea City v Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nSwansea remain bottom but a result that moves them to within three points of safety enhances their fight for survival. They are six points off 10th-placed Watford.\n\nThere was a minute’s applause before the kick-off in memory of Jimmy Armfield and Cyrille Regis after which Swansea began brightly but Liverpool, who had a light training session along the M4 at Port Talbot Town on Monday morning, took 45 minutes to find their stride. It was Emre Can who instigated their first threat when his diagonal pass found Sadio Mané, who had crept in behind Mike van der Hoorn. But by the time Mané latched on to the ball, Lukasz Fabianski smothered the danger. Swansea issued their own warning, when Jordan Ayew, who left the field to a standing ovation, lashed home but only after running the ball out of play.\n\nSwansea were organised defensively but Carvalhal also demanded his full-backs, Martin Olsson and Kyle Naughton, to fly forward. But when Mawson tugged at Mohamed Salah’s shirt 25 yards from goal, one could forgive the home support for shuddering. From the resulting corner Van Dijk put a header just wide. It was role reversal a moment later when the Dutchman lofted the ball over the Swansea backline, only for Salah, first time, to volley over. Van Dijk’s centre-back partner, Jöel Matip, then rampaged forward unchallenged, playing a give-and-go with Salah, but the defender got himself in a tangle.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alfie Mawson makes a late block to deny Adam Lallana after Roberto Firmino hit the post for Liverpool. Photograph: McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIf that was an unfamiliar sight, then the moment Mawson steered home only the seventh league goal Swansea have scored at home this season was almost as unexpected. Van Dijk’s headed clearance from Clucas’s corner cannoned off Federico Fernández to Mawson, who swivelled and squeezed the ball beyond Loris Karius.\n\nKlopp was not drawn into changing personnel at half-time but his team’s intentions altered. They were camped inside Swansea’s half for much of the second period, leading to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain flighting a superb ball in for Firmino, who wrestled in between van der Hoorn and Fernández before the Swansea captain hacked the ball away. Liverpool dominated possession as the hosts lost sight of the ball altogether, retreating further and further. Robertson twice found space and would have shot goalwards but for Naughton’s magnificently-timed interception.\n\nTransfer swap shop, another stung Hornet and Lyon tamers – Football Weekly Read more\n\nWhen Ki Sung-yueng clumsily upended Mané, Swansea surrendered a free-kick 20 yards from goal. Liverpool formed a five-strong queue around the ball but it was Salah whose curling effort brought a fingertip save from Fabianski. Swansea, understandably, were a nervous wreck but continued to fight their corner relentlessly.\n\nAs Carvalhal paced the touchline, Klopp sought changes in the shape of Adam Lallana and Danny Ings. The latter jinked away from Van der Hoorn before blasting at Fabianski, who cradled the ball in his arms. Then Van Dijk and Salah fired over and wide respectively.

It is almost five years since they introduced Pochettino’s gifts to English football and their gradual decline has been dispiriting to watch. Yet this gutsy performance was a reminder of happier times, filling Southampton with hope in their fight against relegation, and they took pride from making their former manager let out his frustration so visibly at the end of this absorbing game.\n\nIf there was a disappointment for Mauricio Pellegrino after weeks of mounting speculation over his future, it was that Harry Kane’s 99th Premier League goal denied his team a first league win in 11 matches, keeping them in 18th place with 14 matches left this season. They might have nicked it when Michael Obafemi, a 17-year-old striker, spurned a glorious opportunity to score on his debut after replacing Manolo Gabbiadini in the 82nd minute. Yet it spoke volumes that Southampton’s efforts earned them applause from their crowd after the final whistle. Their commitment restricted Tottenham to few clear opportunities and they can be confident of staying up if they maintain this level.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read more\n\n“We played against an amazing side, but I think we created problems,” Pellegrino said. “I think we are on the right path. I am sure we will improve. Obviously we are in trouble, but in three or four weeks everything can change.”\n\nPochettino agreed with his fellow Argentinian’s assessment of an even contest, refusing to make excuses despite a virus that depriving him of Hugo Lloris and Christian Eriksen and leaving many of his players feeling jaded in difficult conditions on the south coast. “We made a lot of mistakes in possession,” Pochettino said. “We gave them a lot of chances for transitions. The pitch wasn’t great, but it was the same for both teams.”\n\nWhile Pellegrino’s default response to questions about his job security has been to point out that he is trying to lay the foundations for a brighter future at Southampton, his team’s early vigour gave the impression he is under no illusions about the rising culture of impatience in the Premier League’s packed lower reaches. Marco Silva’s sacking by Watford earlier in the day was a reminder of the insatiable desire for instant success and Pellegrino must have been heartened by the sight of his players tearing into their guests straight from kick-off.\n\nThe hosts were quick to the ball in midfield, with Mario Lemina catching the eye and Dusan Tadic’s sparking performance meant that they always had a threat in the wide areas. Southampton displayed an intent that has not always been evident under Pellegrino and it did not come against the run of play when they took an early lead.\n\nLloris’s absence unsettled Tottenham’s defence and Southampton had spotted that Serge Aurier can be guilty of questionable positioning. Aurier is an enterprising attacking force from right-back and his pace can get him out of tight spots, but the Ivorian was nowhere to be seen when Pierre-Emile Højbjerg almost set up Gabbiadini for a simple finish and he did not do enough to stop Ryan Bertrand from zipping a low cross across the slippery surface in the 15th minute. Gabbiadini was lurking again and the Italian’s presence forced Davinson Sánchez to slide and turn the ball past Michel Vorm, who was making his first start in the league this season.\n\nHowever Southampton’s attempt to protect their advantage left much to be desired. Tottenham sought an instant response, with Eric Dier rapping the woodwork, and they were level when Kane peeled away from Jack Stephens to head Ben Davies’s corner past Alex McCarthy three minutes later. The thought occurred that Virgil van Dijk would have kept a tighter grip on the striker.\n\nThere was no stopping Kane once he had a yard on Stephens, though, and the sheer force of will that he displayed to meet Davies’s delivery underlined why reports of Real Madrid targeting the striker in the summer were dismissed so vociferously by Tottenham’s manager. “Again?” Pochettino said. “I am not going to speak about rumours. If I give a message to every rumour, I need to give my opinion at every press conference.”\n\nThe bigger concern for Pochettino was that Tottenham missed an opportunity to improve their hopes of finishing in the top four before games against Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Liverpool will go five points above them if they win at Swansea City on Monday.\n\nMoussa Sissoko went close after meeting Davies’s driven cross, but Tottenham missed Eriksen’s craft. Dele Alli struggled to shoulder the creative burden and Son Heung-min did not have the beating of Cédric Soares.\n\nStephens’ last-ditch block denied Érik Lamela and Alli was inches away from turning

felt restorative and will be remembered most for the exquisitely incisive rat-a-tat of passes which earned them breathing space.\n\nThere was something hypnotic about that early exchange between Willian, Michy Batshuayi and the irrepressible Eden Hazard, a flurry of accurate touches fizzed first time at breakneck speed while six Brighton players, all in the vicinity, were left feeling dizzy.\n\nNone came close to an interception, each Chelsea touch dropping them further off the pace, before Batshuayi eventually flicked Willian free to rip a finish gloriously beyond the diving Mathew Ryan from just inside the area. This attack has been toothless over recent weeks, their centre-forwards enduring mid-season crises of confidence and the approach play too often running aground. Those deficiencies had prompted the emergency calls querying the availability of Andy Carroll and Peter Crouch, plus Christian Benteke and Edin Dzeko. But this was also a timely reminder of the current crop’s devastating best.\n\nChelsea’s hunt for a medieval big man adds intrigue to football’s space race | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nChelsea are a team capable of slicing opponents apart on the counter, and a collective inspired by Hazard’s jaw-dropping talent. The Belgian had already scored by the time he joined the celebratory huddle sparked by Willian’s fine finish. Having gratefully accepted Victor Moses’ cutback, prodded to him tentatively by Dale Stephens on the stretch, Hazard sent the 100th league goal of a career spent in France and England beyond Ryan.\n\n“Against a player of his ability, you just hope you have a good day and can stifle them a bit with your system, or individuals can,” Chris Hughton said. “You know he’ll produce moments like he did. You just hope they don’t lead to goals. Unfortunately, today they did.”\n\nHis 101st league goal would be scored before the end, Hazard scurrying unchecked from inside his own half before cutting across the penalty area and finishing crisply into the far corner. Whenever the visitors were permitted a gallop, they revelled. Ryan alone denied Willian and Batshuayi further reward, the former after another glorious move comprising a dummy from Hazard, a clever touch from Batshuayi, and a return skip and pass from the No 10. There is no living with Chelsea when they find rhythm as upbeat as this.\n\nBrighton have lost all seven games against the top six this season, scoring once, though this was no meek surrender. Until wilting at the last, the hosts had carried a threat, usually from Pascal Gross’s delivery, but were undermined by profligacy and, as Hughton suggested, refereeing oversights.\n\nTomer Hemed’s inability to bury a close-range header from a Gross cross felt wasteful, providing another reminder of why Jürgen Locadia, a club record £14m signing from PSV Eindhoven who was paraded on the turf before kick-off, could be key once recovered from a hamstring injury.\n\nWilly Caballero was unconvincing, particularly at set plays, as he deputised in the Chelsea goal for the injured Thibaut Courtois, who should return from an ankle injury on Wednesday at Arsenal. Davy Pröpper would loop a header on to the top of a post early in the second half, which summed up Brighton’s luck.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Under the lights in the rain at the Amex. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTheir real frustration lay at Jon Moss’s refusal to award a penalty after the excellent Ezequiel Schelotto had tumbled over Caballero’s outstretched left leg. The goalkeeper later said “it didn’t feel as if I touched him” but, even if the referee’s view of the incident had been blocked, his assistant was perfectly placed to see the contact which brought the Italy international down.\n\n“He was 20 yards away from it,” Hughton said. “It was an incident waiting to happen and there was always going to be a decision to make, so I’m hugely disappointed.” Schelotto would be booked for dissent before the break after tangling with Tiémoué Bakayoko in the box, with Moss again waving away the penalty appeals.\n\nSchelotto’s exasperat ion rather summed up Brighton’s mood, with their industry unrewarded throughout, even after Andreas Christensen had retired with “a contusion” according to Antonio Conte, after a clash of heads. Chelsea were quick to insist the Dane had shown no signs of concussion.\n\nThey would rouse themselves again courtesy of Hazard’s second before, minutes from time, the substitute Charly Musonda produced a fine pass from deep that Moses collected and converted after easing away from Markus Suttner.\n\nAfter weeks of frustration which masked the reality they are unbeaten in 12 matches in all

The Arsenal forward was not at the Emirates Stadium because, according to Wenger, he had driven north to put himself in position to complete his January transfer to Manchester United. Yet Sánchez still managed to colour the narrative.\n\nWenger talked about how the saga involving his club’s best player had affected everybody. “For us, it’s not only to lose a world-class player – it’s a period of uncertainty that creates a strange feeling in the dressing room,” the manager said. “What is very difficult is that, for the first time, we are losing one of our big players in January. It’s a bit more destabilising than usual.”\n\nManchester United agree Henrikh Mkhitaryan swap deal for Alexis Sánchez Read more\n\nWenger put forward the silver lining. “Once things are clear, the team responds and focuses on the job,” he said. Sánchez had left the team hotel on Friday night and it now looks pretty certain that the next time he appears in these parts, he will be wearing a United shirt. Henrikh Mkhitaryan is primed to move in the opposite direction and Wenger said that part of the deal was affecting the timing of it all.\n\nAgainst a Crystal Palace team that simply did not turn up at the outset, Arsenal stepped boldly into the post-Sánchez era. Wenger will always say that the pitch is the only place where anything matters and this was a reminder of what his team can do when it all clicks.\n\nWhen Arsenal play like this – they were 4-0 up after 22 minutes – it begs the question as to why they can be so weak on other occasions.\n\nNacho Monreal was the unlikely star on his comeback from an ankle problem. He scored the opening goal and laid on the second and third before departing, as a precaution, on 33 minutes after a kick to his hamstring. Monreal was not the only Arsenal player who retuned from injury to good effect. Laurent Koscielny scored the third goal while Mesut Özil decorated the afternoon with some lovely touches, not least his flick for Alexandre Lacazette’s first goal in 10 games.\n\nRoy Hodgson could not believe what he was watching. It was a day when virtually nothing went right for him and his Palace team, down to Yohan Cabaye being taken off on a stretcher with ankle ligament damage in the closing moments. It looked like yet another serious injury problem for the club.\n\nArsenal laid waste to Palace in an early bombardment and it was shocking to see how loose the visitors were at the back. Wenger’s team twisted the knife with relish. The game was over after only 13 minutes, when Monreal eluded James McArthur and ran around the back to meet Granit Xhaka’s corner. Monreal hooked into the danger area and Koscielny rolled home.\n\nMonreal’s goal set the tone for both teams. McArthur let him go on a Xhaka corner and the defender advanced into yards of space to thump home his header. The goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey, was caught in no man’s land. McArthur put his head in his hands. Palace were on their heels all too regularly and it was particularly pronounced on Arsenal’s second.\n\nTimothy Fosu-Mensah stretched to cut out Alex Iwobi’s ball for Lacazette but when it broke Monreal was allowed to power into the left side of the area. He cut the ball back and Alex Iwobi, in so much space, swept past Hennessey from close range.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cyrille Regis is remembered at the Emirates Stadium. Photograph: Dan Weir/PPAUK/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nArsenal enjoyed themselves, pulling out the party tricks; Palace gasped for breath. The fourth was all about the interchange between Özil and Jack Wilshere. The final pass came from Özil – a sumptuous backheel – and Lacazette beat Hennessey for power.\n\nIt was a humiliation for Palace. Özil and Wilshere drew aahs with first-half flicks and the damage at the interval might have been heavier. Iwobi twice worked Hennessey while James Tomkins leapt into a saving block on 15 minutes to deny Xhaka.\n\nPalace, who the have completed the signings of the defender Jaroslaw Jach from Zaglebie Lubin and the midfielder Erdal Rakip on loan from Benfica, were better after the interval, although they could hardly have been any worse. Wilfried Zaha wanted a penalty following a challenge from Mohamed Elneny while Bakary Sako found Christian Benteke with a glorious ball on the break. Benteke could not beat Cech when one-on-one.\n\nIwobi was again denied by Hennessey while Lacazette had a stoppage-time penalty appeal turned down after Tomkins jumped in on him. Palace’s consolation came when Luka Milivojevic took a touch on his chest, spun and found the far corner following Cabaye’s corner. It rang hollow.\n\nBefore kick-off, it emerged Arsenal had failed with a €50m (£44m) bid for the Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

Winning is all José Mourinho’s men can do and while it was a patchy victory they will hardly care.\n\nUnited were pushed close during the five extra added minutes at the end, when two corners and a free-kick needed defending, but they escaped and came away with three points that they just about deserved. If Alexis Sánchez does arrive from Arsenal the hope will be he can add some much needed quality in front of goal.\n\nAlexis Sánchez move to Manchester United 'so close', says José Mourinho Read more\n\nSean Dyche made one change from the defeat at Crystal Palace, replacing Sam Vokes for Ashley Barnes. Having described Luke Shaw as among the finest left-backs currently playing on Friday, meanwhile, United’s manager dropped him for Ashley Young.\n\n\n\nWhile Mourinho explained that Young better suited Burnley, he configured the XI in a 4-1-4-1 that had Paul Pogba pushed ahead of Nemanja Matic. It was the Frenchman who posed the Clarets a first question, linking down the left with Martial before being shepherded out.\n\nMoments later James Tarkowski should have done better with a header he steered wide of David de Gea’s right post. Next, Young repaid his manager’s faith with a chip into Pogba’s path; the No 6 hit a first-time lob that beat Nick Pope but was too high.\n\nBurnley had not won since moving briefly into fourth place with a 1-0 win against Stoke here on 12 December, a run of seven matches. Yet despite picking up only three points in the sequence and losing their last two league games they were confident throughout. One move had Jeff Hendrink finding Johann Berg Gudmundsson but after the Icelander cut inside the shot was weak.\n\nVirtually all of United’s forays were occurring down the left. Juan Mata was Mourinho’s nominated right-hand attacker yet he more than once appeared on the opposite flank. One of these occasions came ahead of a cross that aimed for Romelu Lukaku and which Burnley did well to clear.\n\nLax defending allowed Gudmundsson a free header from a corner and when the Icelander’s pace later allowed him to skate at United a flailing Jesse Lingard tackle was required to halt his progress.\n\nAs half-time approached United’s performance had been fluid, yet scrappy near Pope’s goal. When Lingard switched the ball from right-to-left to find Martial, Mourinho’s men sensed a chance but once more a move broke down.\n\nThey neared the interval with a moment of quality, a surge past two players taking Young close to the six-yard box, but his curled right-footed attempted missed the target. Martial then did an unwanted repeat after trading passes with Pogba. A soft-shoe shuffle created space but he hit the ball the wrong side of Pope’s left post.\n\nMourinho will hardly have liked Lukaku’s first contribution after the break. When being crowded out near the Burnley D he appealed to Michael Dean, the referee, for a free-kick, rather than chase back and having the debate after the passage of play ended. Better, though, was the way Matic fed Mata and his quickfire ball along the turf that won a corner, though nothing came of it.\n\nUnited’s opener was not long coming though, initiated by Phil Jones’s fine intervention deep inside his own half. He looked up, found Lukaku, and after the No 9 bundled the ball into space he took advantage of this luck with a fine pass to Martial. The Frenchman stepped forward and smashed in an 11th goal of the season.\n\nIt warmed the packed away end on what was becoming a cold late afternoon. The rest of Turf Moor came close to the same feeling when Gudmundsson strode up to take a 25-yard free-kick but the ball crashed to safety off De Gea’s bar.\n\nMoments later the home support appealed for a penalty when Gudmundsson’s header rebounded off Chris Smalling – it appeared marginal and Dean was unmoved.\n\nFrom here the contest became more open. Pogba had an age on the ball as Lukaku implored him to slip it in behind Burnley but the midfielder chose to shoot and the danger fizzled out.\n\nAs is their way under Dyche, Burnley continued to play. An embarrassing moment for Lingard came when he was fouled by Stephen Defour near the touchline. Play continued and Lingard rolled off the pitch, only for Mourinho to spring from his seat and roll him back on, to widespread derision.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Burnley and Manchester United players pause for a minute’s applause to remember Cyrille Regis, who died last week.

himself with the knowledge that things should have been even worse.\n\nEverton, bereft of confidence and any semblance of cohesion, deserved nothing against West Brom but came away with a drop of encouragement that had never seemed likely. It will do Theo Walcott’s self-esteem no harm that, on an otherwise quiet debut, he provided the headed assist from which Oumar Niasse equalised 56 seconds after arriving on the pitch. A point was saved but Everton still had a heavy cost to count.\n\nJoe Allen strike sees off Huddersfield and gives Stoke renewed hope Read more\n\nThey were struggling to mount any kind of response to Jay Rodriguez’s early goal when, on the hour, yet another sluggish passing move broke down and Salomón Rondón was presented with a chance to put the away side out of sight. He was stopped from pulling the trigger by the cleanest of recovery tackles from James McCarthy, hurtling in at full speed, who took the ball before collapsing in agony.\n\nAllardyce said McCarthy had fractured his tibia and fibula, confirming what had seemed likely at the time. Rondón, in particular, was visibly upset by the incident and appeared to be in tears, requiring Alan Pardew to console him by the touchline as McCarthy was stretchered off.\n\n“He’s paid a heavy price for his commitment,” Allardyce said of a player who has been blighted by injuries over the last 10 months. It did not escape him that his team had contrived the situation McCarthy had been pressed to salvage. They were sloppy from start to finish, only livening up for a brief spell after Niasse’s sharp near-post volley, and appeared not to have heeded his instructions to tighten up after last weekend’s capitulation at Tottenham.\n\n“The performance is a big blow for me,” he continued. “The first goal, I think an under-11s team could have scored against us, the defending was that bad.”\n\nFrom West Brom’s point of view, the goal came from a beautiful pass from Grzegorz Krychowiak, who had missed a good chance moments previously but sent Rodriguez clear of a hopelessly square defence with the outside of his right foot. The finish, a third goal in five games for the forward, was unerring, and for long periods thereafter Albion were untroubled.\n\nEverton looked like strangers and that was not far from the truth. Walcott had trained at Finch Farm for the first time on Friday and this was also a home debut for Cenk Tosun, who barely had a meaningful kick. The battle on Everton’s right between Walcott and his former Arsenal team-mate Kieran Gibbs had been eagerly anticipated but, particularly in the first half, it consisted purely of the new arrival haring down blind alleys.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Salomón Rondón of West Brom is comforted by team-mates after seeing James McCarthy’s suspected broken leg. Photograph: Adam Fradgley - AMA/WBA FC via Getty Images\n\n“Our players have to have an understanding of where Theo likes the ball and they didn’t today,” Allardyce said, although they looked equally ignorant of anyone else’s predilections. Walcott did, at least, provide what his new manager described as Everton’s only moment of quality within minutes of his far-post nod back to Niasse, stinging Ben Foster’s palms with a firm volley.\n\nIt was West Brom, though, who looked the likely winners even after their hosts’ reprieve. Rondón, who was the best player on the pitch, gathered himself to continue after Pardew’s words of encouragement and rattled the crossbar with a vicious long-range strike in added time.\n\nHe also came close with two headers in the final 10 minutes, while Krychowiak and Matt Phillips drew smart saves from Jordan Pickford with the game poised. They would have merited a win to honour the memory of Cyrille Regis, the subject of resounding applause from both sets of fans before kick-off, but with one defeat in six they are moving in the right direction.\n\n“The feeling in the dressing room was one of disappointment,” Pardew said. “Hopefully, the signs and experience I have are that we’re looking OK.”\n\nAllardyce, meanwhile, could only savour cold comfort. Niasse’s introduction, in Tosun’s place, was jeered by the home fans before the mood temporarily altered. Their reaction at full-time, though, showed nobody had been fooled. “It went from a boo to a cheer,” he said. “The boo at the end was well deserved but the boo on the substitution wasn’t.” It was as much of a defence as he, or Everton, could muster."}, {"date": "20/01/2018", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31891, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper

It was a clear penalty and Vardy dispatched his 11th goal of the season into the bottom corner.\n\n“We have to keep this good concentration on the pitch,” Claude Puel said. “We cannot look forward, it’s a good time to keep a good focus.”\n\nWith little inspiration and Richarlison’s early-season influence fading Watford never recovered. They have now failed to keep a clean sheet in 12 top-flight games.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riyad Mahrez celebrates scoring Leicester’s second goal. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe second half began with Karnezis gathering Shinji Okazaki’s low effort before Marvin Zeegelaar denied Vardy a second when he intercepted Okazaki’s cross. A 66th-minute snapshot from Andre Gray’s snapshot being after 66 minutes, easily held by Schmeichel, was a rare sign of life from the visitors.\n\nLeicester were then furious minutes later when Mahrez went down in the area under Doucouré’s challenge in the area but Lee Probert ignored the penalty appeals. The hosts showed more threat and energy but they relied on Harry Maguire’s excellent block with 17 minutes left to stay ahead when Gray raced through but took too long. Mahrez made the game safe in stoppage time with an excellent run and low effort after bamboozling Christian Kabasele.\n\nSilva was left ruing injuries. “If the best teams in the Premier League don’t have six players in the starting XI think how the team is different,” he said. “It’s important for people to pay attention to this.”"}, {"date": "20/01/2018", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance":

start as Paul Lambert’s first game in charge delivered the precious victory that breathes fresh life into their troubled season. Joe Allen and Mame Diouf scored the goals that lifted Stoke out of the relegation zone and had Lambert manically running on to the pitch to celebrate.\n\nThe 48-year-old was way down Stoke’s original list of candidates to replace Mark Hughes and news of his appointment was not exactly welcomed by the supporters, yet few will be complaining if this result proves to be a sign of things to come. This was Stoke’s first win in five league matches and their first clean sheet since October.\n\nJamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez double-act sees Leicester City sink Watford Read more\n\nLambert, whose last game as a Premier League manager was almost three years ago, looked like he was determined to make up for lost time. The Scot paced up and down his technical area throughout, heading and kicking every ball and working himself up into such a sweat that he pointed to the bench and asked for a second bottle of water after only 15 minutes.\n\nStoke took rather longer to get going but they never looked back from the moment that Allen, the best player on the pitch, converted Eric Choupo-Moting’s cross eight minutes into the second half. Choupo-Moting was also involved in the second goal, which was clinically dispatched by Diouf with a little over 20 minutes remaining, and in effect killed the game on an afternoon when the Stoke fans rediscovered their voice. “I’m delighted for the players and the supporters,” said Lambert. “I thought they bounced off each other.”\n\nHuddersfield, it has to be said, were obliging opponents. David Wagner’s side rarely troubled Jack Butland, the Stoke goalkeeper, during a listless performance and the large number of away supporters here could be forgiven for fearing that their season is starting to unravel a little. Huddersfield are 14th but only three points clear of the relegation zone and have now failed to win in six league matches. “It was a deserved defeat,” Wagner said. “We tried our best but Stoke limited our offensive game and were too aggressive for us today.”\n\nAlthough both teams were poor in the opening 45 minutes, when Xherdan Shaqiri squandered an excellent chance to score on the stroke of half-time, Stoke improved significantly in the second half. The opening goal arrived after Charlie Adam’s lovely pass set Choupo-Moting free down the left and, although the forward’s cut-back eluded Diouf, the ball ran into the path of Allen, who steered a crisp first-time shot inside Jonas Lössl’s near post.\n\nStoke did not have to wait long for a second goal. Choupo-Moting fed the ball into the feet of Shaqiri, whose clever backheel released Diouf. One-on-one with Lössl, Diouf squeezed his low shot in off the upright and Lambert was running around with his arms aloft. “We won’t win every game but if we can keep that level of intensity, we’ll be fine,” the Stoke manager said."}, {"date": "20/01/2018", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56948, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Byram", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Martinez Lopez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Cullen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [71], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This game came and went in almost 60 seconds. Ryan Fraser’s sweet strike gave the visitors an unlikely lead only for it to be cancelled out in little over a minute by a typical finish from Javier Hernández.\n\nThat aside, it was a match of missed opportunities. For David Moyes there was not only two home points dropped against a bottom-half rival but two more injuries to a threadbare West Ham squad. Aaron Cresswell limped off with cramp in the final knockings and Manuel Lanzini will have to undergo a scan after apparently damaging a hamstring. Eddie Howe, meanwhile, said he was frustrated not to have left with three points but Bournemouth were there for the taking for much of the match.\n\n“We’re disappointed because the team that took the lead should be able to hold on in that situation,” he said. “We were pretty slow out of the traps and did well not to concede under early pressure. It was a similar start to the second half but then we scored the goal. I thought that might be good enough but it wasn’t to be.”\n\nHowe was full of praise for Fraser who ran on to a through-ball from the substitute Junior Stanislas before smashing it home with his left foot for his fifth goal of the season. “When players from the wings start scoring regularly, it’s fantastic,” Howe said.\n\nJoe Allen strike sees off Huddersfield and gives Stoke renewed hope Read more\n\nCrafted from fast incisive play, it was the type of goal West Ham had been threatening to score themselves. But the home side’s equaliser, straight from the restart, was the result of a long ball and a flick on, before Hernández pounced on Marko Arnautovic’s blocked shot with trademark alacrity.\n\n“We played well but missed a cutting edge,” Moyes said of his second game of the week, Tuesday’s FA Cup replay with Shrewsbury running to extra time before West Ham won 1-0.\n\n“For me it’s progress. The players who’ve been a handful all year didn’t quite have the magic we needed but with 15 to go, we were on our knees. I’d have taken a point then.”\n\nIt is seven matches unbeaten for West Ham, a statistic Moyes was not unaware of. But in that opening spell, during which Arnautovic and Lanzini ran riot, his team played some of their best football under their new manager and it was notable the crowd showed their appreciation.\n\nMoyes said: “I’ve been looking for more and there were bits of that more today.”"}, {"date": "20/01/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54452, "home_team": {"name":

Agüero, one assumes, might have been left wondering what it meant for his own position. It is all hypothetical now Sánchez is heading Manchester United’s way but, on this evidence, it does seem perplexing that Agüero’s place had ever come under threat and that Pep Guardiola felt it necessary to investigate changing his attacking options.\n\nManchester United and Anthony Martial dig deep to battle past Burnley Read more\n\nThis was Agüero’s 11th hat-trick in City’s colours and he has now scored 14 times in 12 league games against Newcastle. Agüero scored 30 goals last season in what was supposedly a below-par year. He has 22 this season and his obsession with scoring could probably be gauged by his mild indignation when asked whether he had made contact with Kevin De Bruyne’s cross for the opening goal. “I think it touched my hair,” City’s record scorer clarified.\n\nThere was no doubt about the other two, his second goal coming from the penalty spot and the hat-trick originating from a brilliant slaloming run from Leroy Sané that later left Guardiola fielding questions about whether it had reminded him of Lionel Messi.\n\nIt was a satisfying way for City to bounce back from their defeat at Liverpool and there was only one part of the match, at 2-1, when they had a wobble against a Newcastle side who were probably shocked to still to be in the game. Sané’s quick feet and Agüero’s sharp instincts, firing in with his left foot, soothed the crowd’s nerves and made sure the Premier League leaders retained a 12-point lead.\n\nA measure of how the game panned out is probably best summed up by the fact City had 81% of the possession. At other times, it was even higher in favour of the home side and, by the 38-minute mark, there was a telling statistic that Newcastle had managed a 33 passes – or to put it another way, three per player.\n\nNobody should have been too surprised by Newcastle’s tactics only three weeks after a similar backs-to-the wall operation at St James’ Park, but it was still something to see one team having so much of the ball and another spending so long chasing it. The corner count – 18-0 – was another accurate gauge.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Newcastle’s Karl Darlow dives but fails to reach Sergio Agüero’s strike for Manchester City’s opening goal. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images\n\nWith that kind of pattern, it came as a jolt when Ciaran Clark played the outstanding pass of the game for Jacob Murphy to run clear and clip the ball past Ederson four minutes after Agüero had made it 2-0 with what Rafael Benítez described as a “very soft” penalty.\n\nJavier Manquillo had definitely clawed at Raheem Sterling’s shoulder as the winger darted past him. Whether it was enough to put Sterling off balance was another matter but the referee, Paul Tierney, ruled in favour of the attacking player and when Agüero clipped the penalty past Karl Darlow it was tempting to think Newcastle’s only remaining objective was to keep the score down.\n\nInstead, Murphy’s clever finish encouraged Newcastle to play with a touch more ambition and in the following quarter of an hour there was some erratic goalkeeping from Ederson to encourage the away side into believing they might salvage an implausible draw against the side who had beaten them 6-1, 5-0, 4-0 and 4-0 in their previous four visits to the Etihad.\n\nThe problem for Newcastle was that chasing an equaliser meant they had to show a little more adventure than had been apparent throughout the rest of the match and they found out what can happen when Guardiola’s team are given space to exploit. In another era, City might have panicked. Not this team, however. Darlow turned one effort from Sterling against the post and Agüero sealed his hat-trick after Sané had followed up his elegant run into the penalty area by deceiving DeAndre Yedlin and picking out the striker with a low cross.\n\nFor Newcastle, it is now one point from their 11 games against teams in the top half of the table and there were loud, mutinous chants from the away end to remind the club’s owner, Mike Ashley, of his diminished popularity.\n\nThose supporters would clearly prefer their team to operate with more ambition but, as it stands, Newcastle should not necessarily be criticised for their tactics when there was such an obvious imbalance of talent.\n\nAgüero scored five on Newcastle’s last visit to this stadium and if City had conjured up one more goal in the last seven minutes it would have been the first time since Spurs against Blackburn in the 1960s that one side had scored four or more against a top-division opponent in five successive home matches."},

of Manchester City’s defeat at Liverpool to close the deficit to 12 points with this accomplished win. It is still a chasm but José Mourinho and co will feel better and the club will be boosted further should they secure Alexis Sánchez, with them now firmly in pole position to do so. Paul Lambert, the newly appointed Stoke City manager, watched on from the posh seats but saw United again deny the Potters victory here, their last coming in April 1976.\n\nOf the display Mourinho said: “I didn’t like the first half. I only like [our] two amazing goals. We were confident and organised but a bit slow. The second half was totally different. We accelerated the game.”\n\nThe Portuguese made six changes from the FA Cup win here a week ago. Once again Henrikh Mkhitaryan was excluded completely – due to “doubts about his future”, Mourinho said – while Romelu Lukaku started for the first time in more than a fortnight following a head injury.\n\nEddie Niedzwiecki’s XI showed seven players different from the Cup defeat at Coventry City , with Stephen Ireland’s first league start in 996 days notable, alongside the debut of Moritz Bauer, a 25-year-old Austrian.\n\nManchester United v Stoke City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nCity’s defeat by Liverpool on Sunday should have been ample inspiration for United to make a bright start. Anthony Martial was the first to do so, roving down the left before hitting in a cross Stoke managed to clear. Bauer’s first act in English top-flight football was to appear to fell Martial in the area as the Frenchman chased a Juan Mata ball. From the turf Martial made the appeal but Anthony Taylor, the referee, was unmoved.\n\nSo, too, was Jack Butland, when United opened the scoring on nine minutes. This was because the visiting goalkeeper was given zero chance from Antonio Valencia’s vicious swerving left-foot shot that rocketed past him.\n\nThe captain’s third of the season came courtesy of Paul Pogba’s searing run-then-pass that drove United from near halfway to near goal, before Valencia did the rest.\n\nThis was the kind of dazzling play United are capable of and which makes the yawning gap to City a puzzle. Mourinho had spoken of the benefit of the warm-weather break in Dubai last week and there was an obvious freshness about United. Yet he will have been unhappy at the space Luke Shaw allowed Bauer to run into when Joe Allen slid the ball down the left-back’s corridor. Suddenly Stoke were in behind but Bauer failed to find a team-mate.\n\nPogba was in imperious form, though. One stepover swept him infield and, when his pass found Jesse Lingard, the No 10 drew a foul. Up stepped Mata from 25 yards but his free-kick crashed into the wall.\n\nIreland’s radar had already gone awry when he found himself in front of David de Gea and pulled the trigger. Again he missed the target.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anthony Martial scores Manchester United’s second goal in the 38th minute. Photograph: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Getty Images\n\nThis showed that Stoke could get at what was an uncharacteristically open Mourinho team. When Bauer mishit a cross it became an awkward high ball at which De Gea flapped. The ball bounced to Eric Choupo-Moting but the finish lacked composure.\n\nThis came during a passage of play in which United struggled to escape from their half. When they finally managed this, Lukaku pinged in a cross towards Lingard and a corner was claimed.\n\nIt came to nothing as did a Mata fall in the area that Bruno Martins Indi believed was a dive, though the No 8 was keen to deny this. At the break, though, Stoke were two behind: Martial’s sweet finish from outside the area coming after Pogba rolled the ball expertly to him.\n\nFor the second half Niedzwiecki took off Joshua Tymon for Kevin Wimmer. United began with a move that took in Martial, Lingard, Pogba, Lukaku and Mata, the ball struck around with unerring accuracy.\n\nTo enjoy total control United required a third, given the amount of time remaining. Martial burst through on Butland but the keeper smothered well. Next Pogba – yet again – probed, finding Lukaku. The centre-forward turned and fired a shot that had power but went too easily into Butland’s hands.\n\nManchester United spending a fortune to get Alexis Sánchez at 29 makes sense Read more\n\nAt this point the travelling support began singing “Paul Lambert’s barmy army”, which will have cheered the watching Scot. He could also be content with the quality his new side had displayed. The confidence shown was hardly that of a side lying third from bottom.\n\nMartial was putting in a fine performance but really should have finished from close range yet, once more, he steered the ball straight at Butland. United’s issue of failing, at times, to kill opposition off was again evident when Lingard fed Mata and the forward’s attempted curler missed to Butland’s left.\n\nWhen United put the ball in the net for a third time, on 66 minutes, Mata was adjudged offside. There was no doubt about Lukaku’s later finish, though, the Belgian scoring, under pressure, to close the match out.\n\nOf Stoke’s survival hopes, Niedzwiecki said: “It’s a big challenge staying in the Premier League. We’re still in the pack and now’s the time for everyone to get behind the new manager.”"}, {"date": "14/01/2018", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10836, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Holding", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [52], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edward Nketiah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Alexis Sánchez was nowhere to be seen but this was the same old Arsenal in many other respects. A game that was totally in their control with just over 20 minutes remaining, as they led through Héctor Bellerín’s second‑half goal, inexplicably slipped from their grasp after Bournemouth scored twice in the blink of an eye to pile more misery on Arsène Wenger.\n\nThe narrative feels all too familiar, so much so that it no longer comes as a surprise when Arsenal players troop off the field with heads bowed after failing to see out a match. Once again, Wenger’s team were their own worst enemy, capitulating defensively to gift Bournemouth a route back into a game that they had not looked like getting anything out of for so long.\n\nAlexis Sánchez not in Arsenal squad amid signs he wants Manchester United move Read more\n\nCallum Wilson and Jordon Ibe accepted the invitation to punish ruthlessly the “surprising mistakes” that Wenger lamented, although the Frenchman was honest enough to admit that Arsenal’s problems start, rather than end, at the back. Wenger described Arsenal as lacklustre as an attacking force and bemoaned the lack of creativity on a day when his team registered only three shots on target and Alexandre Lacazette’s goal drought was extended to nine matches. At times Lacazette, the club-record signing, looked lost.\n\nIn truth, there are weaknesses all over the pitch and it was hard to think of any Arsenal player who emerged with any credit apart from Jack Wilshere. Making his seventh consecutive league start after recovering from the ankle injury that forced him off against Chelsea in midweek, Wilshere faded late on but ran the game for long periods, using the ball intelligently and generally doing his best to make Arsenal tick with his energy in the centre of the pitch.\n\nThe supporting cast around him, however, were a huge disappointment. Alex Iwobi produced a lovely pass to set up Bellerín’s goal but offered little else and it is hard to escape the feeling that he would not get near one of those formidable Wenger teams of the past. Danny Welbeck never imposed himself and there is nothing convincing about the three-man central defence of Rob Holding, Shkodran Mustafi and Calum Chambers. As for Ainsley Maitland-Niles, it seems almost unfair to expect a 20-year-old defensive midfielder to fill in at left wing-back, and it was no real surprise that one of the Bournemouth goals originated from a raid down that flank.\n\nPlay Video 0:54 Sánchez could leave Arsenal 'today or tomorrow', says Wenger – video\n\nThere was, in other words, plenty for Wenger to chew over as he headed back to London reflecting on a result that means Arsenal have gone four games without a win at the start of a calendar year for the first time since 1995 and on the prospect of losing arguably his best player. The Arsenal manager took the decision to leave Sánchez out of the squad because he senses that the Chilean’s departure is imminent, with the 29-year-old expected to sign for one of the two Manchester clubs within 48 hours. Whatever anyone thinks of Sánchez at Arsenal – and he has clearly been a destructive influence at times – his ability to score and create goals leaves a huge void.\n\nBournemouth could have been forgiven for thinking that this was the perfect time to be playing Arsenal, yet it took a long time for Eddie Howe’s team to bare their teeth and they also had to come from behind. Bellerín, running on to the pass that Iwobi slid in behind the flat-footed Charlie Daniels, gave Arsenal the lead with an angled shot that Asmir Begovic got a good hand to but was unable to prevent from bouncing over the line in what felt like slow motion.\n\nOther than a Ryan Fraser shot blocked by Chambers towards the end of the first half, Bournemouth had rarely threatened but that all changed in a devastating four-minute spell. First Fraser escaped on the right and delivered a low centre that Petr Cech, rashly, dashed off his line to try to claim. Wilson, alert and unforgiving, got there first to poke the ball into the empty net with two Arsenal defenders watching.\n\nArsenal were still reeling when Bournemouth struck a second. Lewis Cook’s floated pass picked out Wilson, who had so much time and space in the Arsenal area after Holding had stepped up to try to play offside. Wilson took a touch and then another that ran into the path of Ibe, who drilled a low shot past Cech from 18 yards. It was Ibe’s first goal in 52 appearances for the club and gave Bournemouth, who are up to 13th, their first victory over Arsenal."}, {"date": "14/01/2018", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53285, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [9], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [59], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [31]}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [31], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [84], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brahim Diaz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Finally, there is a glimmer of hope for the teams desperately clinging to Manchester City’s coat-tails. Only a tiny glimmer, maybe, and nobody should really imagine it will change too much when it comes to the destination of the championship trophy. Yet it had been 284 days since Pep Guardiola’s team last experienced a defeat in the Premier League. The run stretched 30 games and at least now the other teams towards the top of the table have been reminded the champions-in-waiting can be beaten, after all.\n\nIt has certainly been a long time since City appeared this vulnerable and in that nine-minute blitz when Liverpool rattled in three second-half goals it was remarkable to see the way the most accomplished team in the country disintegrated. More fool us, perhaps, for thinking that City had eradicated the shortcomings that troubled Guardiola in his first year at the club. Liverpool were not flawless either but, equally, let’s not be too critical when they can conjure up this much fun. It was a breathless afternoon and on this evidence, Jürgen Klopp must be pained that there is still a 15-point gap between the two teams.\n\nThis was Liverpool’s first game since Philippe Coutinho’s move to Barcelona and it was some response from Klopp’s players bearing in mind the obvious questions about how it would affect the team. Defensively they are still far too accident-prone, Loris Karius’s goalkeeping can spread anxiety and Liverpool, winning 4-1 as the clock ticked into the 84th minute, came perilously close to throwing it all away. Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gündogan had set up an almost implausible feat of escapology but Sergio Agüero had strayed offside with City’s last chance, four minutes into stoppage time, and the game was denied a final, dramatic twist.\n\nLiverpool 4-3 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nUltimately Liverpool had sufficiently weakened their opponents with the burst of goals from Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah in the 59th, 61st and 68th minutes. Guardiola can think back to that moment, at 1-1, when Nicolás Otamendi headed against the crossbar from a corner but it must have alarmed City’s manager to see the way his team were thrown off their stride by opponents who played a high line, chased them down and refused to be cowed. Or as Klopp put it: “Pressing from another planet.” It was City’s first league defeat of the season and, with the Champions League resuming next month, a lesson for all their potential opponents – albeit with the rider that Guardiola’s team were still the first away side to score three at Anfield in a year.\n\nAs vibrant as they were going forward, Liverpool certainly looked susceptible in defence and Leroy Sané’s goal to make it 1-1, beating Karius at his near post, was just the latest reminder that Klopp’s men will continue to be held back until they have a goalkeeper who is suitable for a club of their ambitions. Karius has previous, of course, and the only possible mitigation was that most of the blame should be apportioned to Joe Gomez for leaving Sané with the chance in the first place.\n\nYet City were even more careless at the back and, at this level, no team can expect to defend this generously and get away with it.\n\nThe way Firmino outmuscled John Stones before clipping in Liverpool’s second goal was a case in point. Mané’s goal two minutes later was a brilliant left-foot finish but it originated from Otamendi losing the ball inside his own half and the next one – in the end, the game’s decisive moment – came after Ederson had hared out of his penalty area to kick the ball straight to an opponent. Unfortunately for him, that opponent was Salah, who promptly curled the ball back over the goalkeeper into an empty net from 40 yards out.\n\nThe only problem for Liverpool at 4-1 was that the game still had more than 20 minutes to go. Silva, one of City’s substitutes, turned in his team’s second goal after a lucky ricochet in the penalty area and when Gündogan prodded another one in, two minutes into stoppage time, it set up a nerve-shredding finale.\n\nYet the final result was a fair one. City had only four shots on target and Liverpool dominated long periods from the moment, nine minutes in, when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain eased unchallenged past Fernandinho and took his shot early, thumping the ball beyond Ederson with a low right-foot drive into the bottom corner.\n\nKarius should certainly have done better with the shot from Sané and, not for the first time, it was strange that Klopp should select him for such a key assignment. It would have mattered a lot more, however, if City had saved themselves late on and the bottom line was that too many of Guardiola’s players were strangely off form.\n\nRaheem Sterling, facing his old club, got little change out of Andrew Robertson and was substituted, to the pleasure of Liverpool’s crowd. Kevin De Bruyne’s nutmeg on Oxlade-Chamberlain was a joy but the Belgian did not have his usual influence and City missed the way David Silva, who was on the substitutes’ bench, knits the team together. Liverpool held on and, for the first time since a 2-1 defeat at Chelsea on 5 April last year, City were reminded what it was like to finish a league game as the losing side."}, {"date": "13/01/2018",

winner deep into stoppage time here, the locals howling in exasperation as Kasper Schmeichel turned Marcos Alonso’s free-kick round a post, but plucking a victory from this mess of a display would have been an injustice. Too much of what they had offered up was inadequate. Discontent is welling in these parts and, for the first time, some of it is being directed at the dugout.\n\nThere were boos when Eden Hazard, for the fourth time in four starts, did not see out the game, and another disgruntled chorus to greet the final whistle. A third successive goalless draw represents a club record and underlines that this team’s domestic campaign has rather run aground. Leicester made them feel so ineffective, of course, and more than merited reward for a display that verged on dominance until the last half-hour. Yet the champions, even with their cluttered schedule, should offer more than this.\n\nThey have become too predictable, too overreliant for comfort upon their Belgium forward and with too few team-mates contributing at Hazard’s side. Álvaro Morata is enduring a lull in his first season in these parts and, one dart to the byline aside, was anonymous until booked three minutes from time, but the striker’s crisis in confidence is seeping into other areas of this collective. In the aftermath of Schmeichel’s save, Victor Moses sliced a shot so wide it almost drifted out for a throw-in. That, or Antonio Rüdiger dawdling in possession to be robbed by Jamie Vardy inside Chelsea’s penalty area, was more typical of his team’s display.\n\nDoucouré hands Watford controversial late draw to deny Southampton Read more\n\nAntonio Conte was apparently not looking for excuses but cited the quick turnaround from Wednesday’s draining draw against Arsenal as key to this lethargic display. “I saw a lot of players very tired, very tired,” he said. “We suffered a lot in the first half and at the start of the second.” He cited fatigue for his decision to remove Hazard and Cesc Fàbregas just before the hour mark and pointed to the burst of energy provided by Pedro and Willian as key to a slightly more acceptable last 20 minutes. “But we must improve if we want to score and to win.” There have been four successive draws since the turn of the year.\n\nThe visitors might normally have been satisfied having played the last 22 minutes with their number depleted after the dismissal of Ben Chilwell, but the better chances and more coherent play had always been theirs. “If it had finished 11 versus 11, we would have got the win,” offered Claude Puel. His own players, their schedule less energy sapping and recovery time awarded in midweek, were sprightly in comparison and had swarmed over their hosts for long periods. No visiting team has managed as many as Leicester’s 12 first-half attempts since the first season of the Roman Abramovich era in south-west London. It was Chelsea’s good fortune that none was taken.\n\nIt was profligacy, a lack of “cutting edge” according to Puel, which saw them survive. An experienced back three were tormented by the pace of Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, who would still blot his copybook with a second-half dive over Andreas Christensen’s outstretched leg in search of a penalty. Gary Cahill had started ahead of the young Dane as the back-line’s central pivot, though he was left dizzied by a brutal first half-hour and would eventually depart prematurely clutching his right hamstring. It was telling that Christensen, rather than David Luiz, was summoned as a replacement.\n\nBy then, the contest should have been settled. Shinji Okazaki, poking awkwardly over the bar, and Vardy, who guided a shot into the side-netting, had both benefited from Chilwell’s fine delivery early on. Wilfred Ndidi thought he had registered at Mahrez’s deflected corner only for Thibaut Courtois to conjure a save at full stretch, with a succession of centres fizzed across Chelsea’s goalline somehow eluding Leicester’s players. There would be further opportunities after the break, with Courtois static and helpless as Mahrez’s shot catapulted off Christensen and dribbled just beyond a post.\n\nRarely under Conte’s stewardship has this side been so disjointed. their set-up clumsy and tentative in the face of their opponents’ frantic press, and uncertainty prevailing with so many players straining to rediscover form and rhythm. Even Hazard could not haul them from their malaise, the Belgian overelaborating in his desperation to make an impact. Conte was asked post-match about José Mourinho’s apparent “contempt” for him but merely batted it back with: “I’m not worried.” His team’s displays will be causing him far more concern.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Vardy reacts to a missed chance – one of 12 attempts on goal Leicester created in the first half.

mistake, Hodgson himself is clear the challenge remains the same as it was when he took over in September and the club was rock bottom, breaking all kinds of the wrong records.\n\n“When I came, I said I was only concerned about the final day of May and being one place above the relegation zone,” he said. But after his scratch Palace side matched Sean Dyche’s Burnley in the gritty part of the game, and won it with the pretty side, their current position of 12th in the table would seem a more likely outcome.\n\nKasper Schmeichel and 10-man Leicester stand firm to deny Chelsea win Read more\n\nBakary Sako scored the only goal of the match midway through the first half, drifting wide to collect Christian Benteke’s looped pass before driving into the box and punching a low shot through Nick Pope. The forward is a symbol of the Hodgson revival, the former Wolves man finally delivering performances that make the best of his combined skill, speed and strength. His total of five goals so far this season is Sako’s best return in his three years in south London, and this was just his second start.\n\n“I don’t know quite how many chances he’s had in the past, but he’s not done well enough to force his way in,” said Hodgson of Sako. “But he’s done really well for us. He would have played today given the injuries we had, but he played on merit and chipped in with a good goal.\n\n“In the second half, he and Benteke worked hard to disturb the centre-halves and help make sure we held on to our lead.”\n\nPalace were without at least seven first-team players for this match. Not only was Sako summoned up front, but James McArthur – “outstanding again”, according to Hodgson – was forced into an unfamiliar position at left wing.\n\nDoucouré hands Watford controversial late draw to deny Southampton Read more\n\nIn midfield, Frank de Boer’s former Ajax protege Jaïro Riedewald also made a rare appearance and applied himself assiduously. There were impressive performances all over the park.\n\nThis was particularly the case in the first half. The goal, celebrated with a collective puffing out of the chest, inspired Palace to kick on. A minute after the restart, Charlie Taylor’s back-pass header was seized upon by Wilfried Zaha, who spun it across an open goal, only for Ben Mee to get his body in front of it just in time. Benteke should have scored shortly afterwards from a Luka Milivojevic corner, but his header looped on to the roof of the net.\n\nAs the period drew to a close, Zaha forced Pope into a one-handed save with a cheeky flick and the now purring Sako flashed a left-foot volley inches past the far post from Timothy Fosu-Mensah’s cross.\n\nBurnley were better in the second half, upping the combativeness and the crosses without ever quite finding the imagination necessary to unpick Palace’s well-drilled resolve. Their best opportunity arrived in the 83rd minute, when a missed clearance by James Tomkins let in Ashley Barnes, only for Wayne Hennessey to rush out and smother the shot at his feet.\n\nSean Dyche knows there is no need to be flustered, despite a run that means Burnley are without a league win in six matches. They are still in seventh place in the table after all. “The second half was at least decent,” he said afterwards.\n\n“We probably deserved to scratch a draw. The margins were tight earlier in the season and they continue to be tight now. But it’s clear that we’ve really moved on from last season.”\n\nDyche was asked about his thoughts on Hodgson’s achievements and the younger Englishman did not hold back in his praise of the 70-year-old. “He’s doing terrific,” he said. “We met for a coffee before the game. We were chewing the fat over the realities and the non-realities of the modern game. Sometimes Roy gets mixed reviews, but the levels he’s worked at, the things he’s achieved, he gets nothing but respect from me.\n\n“He’s settled it down nicely here, but it’s not a surprise to me; it is down to Roy and his staff putting in the work.“"}, {"date": "13/01/2018", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24105, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name":

It was his mistake that gifted West Ham an opening goal, though the midfielder could and did complain that Jonas Lossl put him under pressure with a short pass to the edge of the area. He had a point but perhaps could have reacted more decisively instead of letting first Arnautovic and then Mark Noble hustle him off the ball.\n\nNoble was quick to notice the Huddersfield player was in trouble and on to the loose ball in a flash, breaking forward and beating Lossl with a crisp rising shot.\n\nThat left Huddersfield with work to do, and at first it appeared they might struggle to get back on terms. Tom Ince fizzed a cross over from the left that Laurent Depoitre could not quite reach, then Rajiv van La Parra hit a similar ball over Lolley’s head. The Terriers kept trying, though, and four minutes from the interval gained their reward when Lolley took a pass from Aaron Mooy to cut in from the right and give Adrián no chance with a curler from the angle of the area.\n\nJoselu denies Swansea victory but Shelvey’s insolence alarms Newcastle Read more\n\nIt was quite a goal, though the uplift did not extend beyond the interval. Huddersfield fell behind again before they had even touched the ball in the second half. West Ham kicked off and launched a long ball forward, Cheikhou Kouyaté gained a flick-on and Arnautovic took it away from Tommy Smith to find the net before many supporters had returned to their seats. If that was an unpromising restart worse was to follow. Arnautovic was again involved for the third goal, occupying defenders on the edge of the area before releasing a just-about-onside Manuel Lanzini with a perfectly weighted through pass.\n\nA fourth goal arrived just four minutes later, Arnautovic this time running directly at the heart of the Huddersfield defence and almost finding a way through. He was eventually halted close to the penalty spot, but there was so little of the home defence left it was simple for Lanzini to collect the loose ball and belt it past Lossl.\n\nEveryone has a soft spot for the Terriers, still homely enough to bring squad players on to the pitch for the half-time lottery and gently take the mickey out of their dress sense, though this was a sobering afternoon for a side without a win in their last five games.\n\nHuddersfield were not just overtaken in the table, they were outclassed. “We were below par, too many individual mistakes,” their manager, David Wagner, said. “We’ve had these moments two or three times this season. It’s frustrating, but at least the mistakes were so obvious they should be easy to analyse and put right.”"}, {"date": "13/01/2018", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51444,

disappointment.\n\nA hard-fought point is all very well but Carvalhal’s Swansea City stay bottom. As for Newcastle, they remain far too close to the relegation zone for comfort, have gone seven home Premier League games without a win and are far from ruthless in front of goal. Benítez is doing a fine job in testing circumstances but Mike Ashley’s transfer window parsimony threatens to undo much good work.\n\nKasper Schmeichel and 10-man Leicester stand firm to deny Chelsea win Read more\n\nBy way of exacerbating Geordie misery, there were apparent tensions between Benítez and Jonjo Shelvey, with the clearly annoyed midfielder pushing his manger’s outstretched hand away when he was substituted. Even so, things could have been worse for Newcastle fans, with Mohamed Diamé fortunate to escape both conceding a first-half penalty and collecting a red card following an apparently deliberate handball.\n\n“I don’t know if we’ve achieved one point or lost two, there was a feeling we should have won,” said Carvalhal, whose smart decision to shift Nathan Dyer to a wider, deeper midfield role in the second half left Swansea less vulnerable to home counterattacks.\n\nDuring the opening half Newcastle spurned several decent chances, while the profligate Dwight Gayle rightly had a headed goal disallowed for offside following a corner. Ayoze Pérez unnerved Kyle Bartley before crossing for Gayle to head wide, Lukasz Fabianski parried Pérez’s shot following Matt Ritchie’s clever, lobbed pass and Shelvey lifted a free-kick just over the bar. Then there was the moment when Christian Atsu crossed low for Paul Dummett but the left-back got the ball stuck beneath his feet at the wrong moment and sent the ball ballooning towards the Leazes End.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joselu equalises from a narrow angle for Newcastle United. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images\n\nBar an odd stellar pass from Shelvey – up against his former employers – and Swansea’s Sam Clucas, the watching Gareth Southgate did not have too much to get excited about. Perhaps tellingly, a key sub-plot centred on Bartley’s duel with Pérez, which, considering the centre-half was on a yellow card following a tug on Gayle, guaranteed him a few panicky cameos.\n\nNewcastle’s biggest fright featured Swansea’s penalty appeal in the wake of Diamé’s handball as he endeavoured to redirect Mike van der Hoorn’s goal bound header, with the Senegal midfielder fortunate to get the benefit of the doubt from the referee.\n\nIronically Diamé, deployed deep in midfield alongside Shelvey, enjoyed one of his better games in a Newcastle shirt. “I must admit I didn’t see it at first,” said Carvalhal of the penalty shout. “But it’s the job of the referee to see it. I like him [Graham Scott] he’s a good referee but he made a mistake. If we’d had video technology to help him we would have had a penalty and red card within 10 seconds.”\n\nThe Portuguese’s smile returned when Jordan Ayew headed Swansea in front. That goal began with an excellent right wing cross from Van der Hoorn and featured Karl Darlow making a fine one-handed save from Ayew’s initial header. Fortune, though, did not frown on Newcastle’s keeper, who parried the ball straight back towards Ayew and, within a millisecond, that rebound nestled in the back of the net.\n\nDoucouré hands Watford controversial late draw to deny Southampton Read more\n\nJoselu is often less than incisive but, having replaced Gayle, the Spanish striker momentarily turned fox in the box. When Pérez’s shot was deflected, a twisting, turning Joselu nutmegged Alfie Mawson before defying Fabianski from a tight angle.\n\nIf Joselu could not hide his joy, Shelvey’s petulant reaction to being withdrawn did not impress. Having batted Benítez away he indulged in a bout of head-shaking. Earlier there had been similar dissent when he was passed evidently unwelcome managerial instructions over the execution of a free-kick.\n\n“There are some things we have to correct,” said a shrugging Benítez, who was relieved to see DeAndre Yedlin clear Wilfried Bony’s late shot off the line. “But any player will be unhappy when he’s substituted.”"}, {"date": "13/01/2018", "arena": "Vicarage

observe Mauricio Pellegrino, a manager on thin ice, trying to handle a 10-game winless run, dealt an extremely harsh hand when a precious away victory was snatched away as Abdoulaye Doucouré deftly batted in a late equaliser. In these days of VAR trials, here was a perfect example of the kind of decision that would have been referred, the tap of the hand easily spotted, the goal removed, the points for Southampton retained.\n\nIt would have been understandable had Pellegrino exploded, railed against the officials, damned the system and spoken of injustice. But he didn’t. He even managed to spare some sympathy for the referee, Roger East, who evidently missed the nature of the game’s decisive and defining touch. “Even the referee has pressure too,” Pellegrino reasoned. “For everybody at this level the pressure is to do your best every single day. I imagine the referee is not happy right now.” It was a remarkably dignified response under the circumstances.\n\n“We have to support this person because everybody makes mistakes. My feeling is like all my players in the dressing room. We are a little bit sad,” he added. “For me the level of refereeing is good in the Premier League but this is clear. Sometimes mistakes are for you, sometimes against you, that’s part of our job.” Unsurprisingly he is supportive of the VAR trials but such are his thoughtful appraisals he probably would have said the same had the handball been in Southampton’s favour rather than Watford’s. “We have to try the technology. Every single team sport, technology helps us to make better decisions. Why not football? We have to try and then analyse.”\n\nThe other aspect Pellegrino wishes to analyse is the improvement in his team, particularly in a first half they dominated in style. That gave them the platform that should have helped them to a win at Vicarage Road. The attacking link-up between waspish target man Shane Long, stylish technician Dusan Tadic and the positive James Ward-Prowse was encouraging. They blended their range of characteristics to try to change the picture for the South Coast team.\n\nSouthampton scored midway through the first half, with Long kickstarting the move with a determined drive down the right and when his pull back was flicked into Ward-Prowse’s path, the midfielder took a breath and picked his spot, steering the ball carefully into the far corner of the net past Heurelho Gomes. The second came just before half-time with a smartly worked break, the ball swept from one end of the pitch to the other with pace and precision. Long chased a clearance, and when he clipped a pass to Tadic, the Serb had the composure to present the ball to Ward-Prowse, who was unerring once again in front of goal.\n\nJeers from the home support were understandable, laced with genuine concern about being dragged down into trouble. Marco Silva duly set about reshaping the team and revitalising their effort levels at half time.\n\n“We were really bad in the first half,” he conceded. “We didn’t start strong like we expected. We didn’t play with the right mentality. It was clear for me we were playing too easy. I told them what all of us needs to be in that moment. You cannot have a lack of the right mentality, a lack of confidence. It doesn’t make sense to play scared – we are at home. Of course I need to react. Then we played with more risk, the right mentality, played without fear in the second half. I recognised our team in the second half.”\n\nOn came Troy Deeney, returning from his latest suspension and chucked on to lend his particular brand of character to Watford’s plight. Silva later backed the player to regain the fitness to make an impact for 90 minutes.\n\nWatford pushed up the pitch and suddenly Southampton were cramped back in their own half, hassled by swarms of yellow. Watford’s optimism surged back when Daryl Janmaat’s shot was pushed on to the crossbar and Andre Gray followed up to nod into the goal.\n\nWatford continued to throw bodies forward, but Southampton endeavoured to take the sting out of the game. Their keeper, Alex McCarthy, was booked for time wasting. Redemption came late when Deeney nodded on Pereyra’s cross and Doucouré arrived ahead of McCarthy to have the controversial final say.\n\nJoselu denies Swansea victory but Shelvey’s insolence alarms Newcastle Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Ward-Prowse celebrates after opening the scoring for Southampton.

The hosts maintained their good early spell with another couple of corners, again driven in by Phillips, one of which required a vital touch from Lewis Dunk to deny Evans the chance of another goal.\n\nWest Brom felt they should have had a penalty midway through the first half when a Phillips shot was blocked by Glenn Murray but the appeals were waved away by referee Martin Atkinson, who might now wish he had the luxury of VAR at his disposal as the Brighton striker’s arms were quite high.\n\nWest Ham’s Marko Arnautovic runs show to leave Huddersfield outclassed Read more\n\nBrighton looked a danger on the break and enjoyed their best spell as half-time approached, but a crucial block by Dawson deflected a Dunk shot over the crossbar. At the other end of the pitch, Dawson should have extended the lead but he poked an effort straight at goalkeeper Mat Ryan from close range. He made amends after 55 minutes. Another driven corner, this time from Chris Brunt, was met at the far post by Dawson and his header into the ground bounced up and over Anthony Knockaert on the goalline and into the net.\n\nKnockaert fired a shot over the crossbar when Brighton created a rare opening but Evans and Dawson, together with Ahmed Hegazi, at the back for West Brom were always in total control and the hosts saw out the game comfortably for a much-needed three points.

Tosun’s muscular cameo was an isolated bright spot for Sam Allardyce, who was shocked by his team’s miserable capitulation in the second half, but a resigned chuckle was the best Everton’s manager could muster after being asked about Kane’s poaching masterclass. “He’s very good,” Allardyce said.\n\nThat was an understatement. Kane ended 2017 with the numbers to show he is the most potent attacker in Europe and he shattered another statistic in this thumping victory for Mauricio Pochettino’s side, scoring twice to break Teddy Sheringham’s record of 97 Premier League goals for Tottenham.\n\nKane has a long way to go to surpass Jimmy Greaves as the club’s all-time leading scorer with 266 goals but worryingly for opposition defences, he has no intention of slowing down after becoming the first player in the top division to reach 20 goals this season. “It’s something I’m very proud of but it’s on to the next one,” he said. “We’ve got to keep going.”\n\nTottenham Hotspur 4-0 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThat killer mentality explains why the 24-year-old has succeeded in transforming himself into one of the world’s elite players and Pochettino was effusive in his praise when he was asked if Kane can break Andy Cole and Alan Shearer’s joint record of 34 goals in a single Premier League season. “It is a lot of numbers,” Tottenham’s manager said. “He can do everything. He has the potential to achieve what he wants. He is always thinking and trying to improve.”\n\nKane was not without assistance in a romp that moved Tottenham closer to Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United in the fight to qualify for the Champions League. Son Heung-min also sparkled, creating Kane’s first with an electric burst two minutes after half-time, and the South Korean’s opener in the first half was also a significant moment, allowing him to emulate Jermain Defoe by becoming the second Tottenham player to score in five consecutive home games in the Premier League.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christian Eriksen finishes a dazzling team move to put Tottenham 4-0 ahead. Photograph: Alex James/JMP/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe indignities for Everton piled high. Allardyce accepted some culpability for his part in this chastening defeat, admitting he picked too many offensive players, but he was more troubled by his team’s collapse after a sprightly offering in the first half.\n\n“The gulf was massive,” Allardyce said. “It was a shock. I saw some of the good sides last week against Liverpool and I saw some of the worst sides today. It’s worrying how bad our performances have become in such a short space of time. I didn’t expect to see it and I have to address it as quickly as possible.”\n\nEverton could not be accused of a lack of ambition during the early stages. Failing to react after selling Romelu Lukaku last summer has been a major factor in their muddled campaign but the arrival of Tosun from Besiktas has infused them with fresh hope. The £25m forward was prolific for his former club and Everton could take encouragement from his speed and movement, which troubled Davinson Sánchez at times. “With better service hopefully he’ll do what he did for Besiktas,” Allardyce said.\n\nJoselu denies Swansea victory but Shelvey’s insolence alarms Newcastle Read more\n\nTosun created an early chance for Wayne Rooney after holding the ball up well and his near-post flick from Gylfi Sigurdsson’s corner almost led to Everton taking a shock lead. However, Rooney was just offside as he headed past Hugo Lloris from close range and that scare stung Tottenham into action.\n\nEverton were too open down their left side, with Sigurdsson struggling to track Serge Aurier’s raids, and Christian Eriksen took note of that weakness, finding the buccaneering right-back with a superb, raking pass. Aurier’s delivery can be patchy but here he drove a low centre into the middle, enabling Son to take advantage of poor marking by tapping past Jordan Pickford.\n\nSam Allardyce feeling blue after horror show leaves Everton stuck in another rut | Sachin Nakrani Read more\n\n“We have talked about Son’s performances for four months,” Pochettino said. “He is more mature than last season.” In the 47th minute Son demonstrated his dribbling ability by twirling away from Jonjoe Kenny, rendering the inexperienced right-back an irrelevance as the move unfolded. Mason Holgate was unable to stop him from fizzing the ball into the middle, where Kane was waiting.\n\nAllardyce felt that Kane was offside but Everton were brutally exposed. Out of the FA Cup and winless in the league since 18 December, their season is drifting aimlessly towards an unsatisfactory conclusion, and Kane had already scored his second – guiding home Eric Dier’s low centre – by the time Tosun made way for Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the 62nd minute.\n\nRooney’s late booking for an ugly chop on Jan Vertonghen encapsulated Everton’s frustration and Tottenham finished with a stunning fourth goal, Dele Alli’s lovely backheel teeing up Eriksen for an emphatic shot past Pickford. “Maybe I’ll go back to being a bit more boring,” Allardyce said.

Just as there had been little on for West Ham United for 70 minutes, which had not been a great surprise given the emphasis David Moyes has placed on defensive solidity. Obiang had three Tottenham players in his vicinity but none of them moved to close him down and so he edged forward a little and decided to have a shot.\n\nWhat happened next sent the travelling supporters into raptures and represented the latest step in the right direction for the club’s relegation battle. From fully 25 yards, Obiang aimed a shot at Hugo Lloris’s near, top corner and the goalkeeper could only feel its fizz as it beat him.\n\nPerhaps Lloris was surprised. It was not only West Ham’s first shot of the evening but their first opening of any description. Moyes had instructed Obiang to sit in front of the back five, alongside Mark Noble, and not to stray too far. “I don’t know what Pedro was doing there,” Noble said with a smile. When the ball hit the net, the smash and grab was on.\n\nTottenham were staring at a setback in their attempt to get closer to the top four. They needed a riposte. Son Heung-min provided it. Whatever Obiang could do, he clearly felt he could match.\n\nIt was a similar kind of situation. Son had no clear options when he collected possession and so he tried his luck. He cut across the ball with his right boot and the swerve and power were too much for Adrián.\n\nThe long-range classics brought a drab encounter to life. Rather abruptly, a London derby broke out and West Ham, against the run of play, might even have nicked it. André Ayew, who Moyes felt had made a difference after his introduction as a substitute, wriggled through and Lloris needed to block at close quarters.\n\nDefeat would have been awfully hard on Tottenham, who dominated the game and had 31 attempts on goal to West Ham’s three. They hogged possession and for long periods, it seemed as though they were camped inside the West Ham half. But it was not a night when Harry Kane or any of their attacking talents were able to cut loose.\n\nMoyes put that down to the resilience of his players. “My reaction was disbelief when Pedro’s goal went in,” he said. “It was a brilliant strike. I hadn’t really seen him do it in training. But it was about the players’ resolve tonight. We had one of the worst defensive records in the Premier League when I came in but we’re on a good run.”\n\nWest Ham had already won the most important game of their week – the home fixture against relegation rivals West Bromwich Albion on Tuesday – and the pre-match theory had been that this was something of a free hit, if a must-not-lose derby against hated rivals can be so considered. Tottenham’s previous match had been their 2-0 win away to Swansea.\n\nA feature of Moyes’s tenure has been his cagey approach against so-called big six teams and it had worked in the victory over Chelsea and the 0-0 draw against Arsenal. West Ham had even looked good in the loss at Manchester City. As against those teams, they were under no pressure to come out. They did not.\n\nWest Ham made it into the Tottenham penalty area only once during the first half, through Javier Hernández and, when the striker cut the ball back, there was nobody there. But Moyes has made no apologies for his approach in this type of game and with the unbalanced squad that he has inherited, he need not.\n\nKane was back in the Tottenham starting XI, after only playing the last 22 minutes against Swansea, and he had five flickers in or around the West Ham box in the first half without truly threatening. He worked Adrián from 20 yards and when Serge Aurier headed Jan Vertonghen’s long ball inside, Kane could not meet it.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 1-1 West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nDavinson Sánchez had seen a shot blocked in the early running, after Adrián had dropped a corner, but West Ham could be pleased at their efforts to keep Tottenham at arm’s length in the first half.\n\nMost of the home team’s attempts were from distance and there were a couple of ragged ones from Eric Dier and Aurier, which seemed like signs of frustration. On the other hand, Christian Eriksen fizzed a low one past the post and fully extended Adrián with a deflected shot on 45 minutes, after Dele Alli had teed him up with a nutmeg on Obiang.\n\nTottenham continued to press in the second half; West Ham continued to throw bodies in their way. Eriksen had a volley blocked by Winston Reid and another shot saved by Adrián while Kane turned Reid only for Pablo Zabaleta to step across to make the saving tackle. When the ball looped up, Adrián cleaned out Alli but Mauricio Pochettino did not complain about the non-award of a penalty.\n\n“We did everything to win but sometimes this happens in football,” the Spurs manager said. “We scored from our most difficult situation and, in the end, we need to be happy.”"}, {"date": "03/01/2018", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59379, "home_team":

He caught Hazard’s foot, the Chelsea forward went down and, if the fall seemed exaggerated in real time, Taylor’s decision was vindicated with every replay.\n\nArsenal’s Arsène Wenger unsurprised by ‘again a farcical decision on a penalty’ Read more\n\nHazard beat Petr Cech from the penalty spot and things came to look even more bleak for Wenger and Arsenal when the Chelsea substitute, Davide Zappacosta, rinsed the inexperienced wing-back, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, to cross for Marcos Alonso, who touched home in front of the flat-footed Shkodran Mustafi.\n\nEnter Bellerín, again. In stoppage time, at the other end. After Alonso had only half-cleared with a header, Bellerín crashed a half-volley goalwards and it was still rising when it ripped into the net. On this occasion, his timing was glorious.\n\nArsenal did their best to throw it away. Not for the first time their patched-up back-line evaporated into the night sky and there was Álvaro Morata, running on to a simple long ball, with only Cech to beat. He could not do so – the goalkeeper stood up to make his most important save of the game – and Zappacosta rattled the rebound against the crossbar.\n\nWenger looked shot to pieces at full-time, overtaken by the emotion, and he saw conspiracy at every turn. He wanted to talk about the spectacle and how entertaining it had been, which was certainly true. Why could we not discuss the football alone? In the next breath he was throwing around some pretty serious accusations about how he knew his team would be punished by the referee. Again.\n\nThis was the latest harum-scarum Emirates Stadium ride – after the 3-1 loss to Manchester United and the 3-3 draw against Liverpool. The common denominator has been Arsenal’s defensive looseness and their desire to engage their opponents in a toe-to-toe slugfest. Wenger’s team have played with so little control and structure that it has been difficult to argue their wounds have not been self-inflicted.\n\nIt would have been worse had it not been for Morata, who endured a torrid evening. The Chelsea striker’s first one-on-one chance came on 14 minutes after Calum Chambers had inexplicably ducked underneath Victor Moses’s hopeful punt forward and Mustafi had melted away.\n\nSuddenly Morata was in and he opened up his body for a side-footed finish. He botched it horribly. Morata would also shoot high after brushing past Chambers in the 68th minute. The angle was tighter than his other openings but it remained a glaring miss.\n\nWenger’s hand had been forced by the injuries to Laurent Koscielny, Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac, and his callow replacement back-line was jittery throughout. But Wenger is not the sort of guy to dwell on defending. His focus, as usual, was on what his team could create.\n\nThey enjoyed a purple patch leading up to the midway point of the first half and they would have led were it not for the reflexes of Thibaut Courtois. He tipped Alexis Sánchez’s shot on to the inside of his right-hand post and watched the ball run across his line, kiss the other post and spin to safety. The Chelsea goalkeeper then saved from Alexandre Lacazette after the striker had spun sharply away from Gary Cahill.\n\nEffortless presence of Cesc Fàbregas makes his mark at Arsenal once again | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThe thrills and spills were plentiful – together with the belly laughs. Maitland-Niles provided one of the latter when he clipped his own heel inside the Chelsea area on 16 minutes and went down. He was lucky to escape a yellow card. Wilshere, who was booked for a foul on Cesc Fàbregas, flirted with a second caution when he went to ground too easily from a challenge by Andreas Christensen. He might not have been on the field to score his goal – a thumping, first-time, left-footed drive.\n\nHazard shimmered with menace while Fàbregas twice teed up Tiémoué Bakayoko before the interval with sumptuous passes. From the first Bakayoko saw Cech tip over while he did not read the second. Fàbregas shot high when well placed on 45 minutes but he was otherwise excellent. When he was substituted some of the Arsenal supporters rose to applaud him.\n\nFàbregas played in Hazard early in the second half only for Cech to save while Courtois denied Lacazette at the other end. Mesut Özil had gone close before Wilshere bludgeoned Arsenal into the lead, after Rob Holding’s low pass had flicked off Morata. Lacazette promptly worked Courtois but the game would turn sharply on the Chelsea penalty."}, {"date": "02/01/2018", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 28411, "home_team": {"name":

Palace a victory by missing a penalty against Manchester City but 48 hours later he sealed three points with a beautiful late winner at Southampton.\n\nRalph Kreuger, the Southampton chairman, backed Mauricio Pellegrino this week but the manager’s prospects looked as dark as the weather after this defeat, with the home crowd losing what little patience remained as Saints were beaten despite taking the lead through Shane Long’s first goal in nearly a year. James McArthur equalised, before Milivojevic’s delicate shot from the edge of the box earned Palace the points.\n\nManchester City put Watford to sword after Raheem Sterling’s rapid opener Read more\n\nRoy Hodgson expressed pleasure with Palace’s form. “For any team in this league, if you can look back on 11 games and the only one you’ve lost is to Arsenal, that’s very satisfying,” he said. “When you start as badly as we did, there’s only as many blows you can take. After seven games we were pretty much on the canvas.”\n\nThey are up and punching now. This victory provided a handy marker for how far Palace have come under Hodgson. His first game in charge was against Southampton at home in September, when a Steven Davis goal condemned them to their fifth straight defeat without scoring a goal. Now they are 14th and, while in no way safe, things are looking up.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Southampton. Palace have gained 11 points from losing positions since Hodgson arrived but in the same time Pellegrino’s side have dropped nine after being in front. The way they folded after the break would be even more concerning if it was surprising, but that has been a feature of their play under the Argentinian.\n\n“In the second-half we gave them the possibility to be in the game,” Pellegrino said. “We played five metres deeper – I think it’s the lack of confidence in the players. We didn’t have the intention to go forwards, we just had the intention to pass the time.”\n\nHe was asked whether he feared for his job. “I feel fear for other things, not football. I’m disappointed that we lost but not fear.”\n\nIt was looking pretty good for a while. That Long was the scorer of Southampton’s opener suggested it might be their night. This is not to unfairly question the striker’s abilities but it was his first competitive goal since 11 February last year, thumping Jeremy Pied’s low cross into the bottom corner with the certainty one does not associate with a player who had not scored for 324 days.\n\nFernando Llorente pushes Swansea deeper into trouble as Tottenham win Read more\n\nAs the rain, wind and an already choppy pitch worsened, the visitors improved. Palace, playing their third game in six days and 48 hours after that exhilarating, exhausting performance against City, grew in confidence and endeavour and they equalised after 69 minutes, although the goal probably should not have stood. Andros Townsend clipped a nice cross into the middle, where Christian Benteke was half a yard offside as he knocked it down, but the linesman stayed still as McArthur hammered the ball into the roof of the net.\n\nPellegrino made attacking changes, bringing on Manolo Gabbiadini and Nathan Redmond but it was Palace who scored next. Townsend and the substitute Bakary Sako combined nicely on the right, the former slid a pass to Milivojevic on the edge of the area and he measured a delicate finish into the bottom corner.\n\nBoos rang out and both sets of fans sang that Pellegrino would not be Saints manager for much longer.

boys continue to come back to haunt them and Fernando Llorente became the third summer departee to score against his struggling former team-mates.\n\nThe Spaniard started in place of Harry Kane and took only 12 minutes to head a goal that piled more misery on Swans fans who had seen Jack Cork strike for Burnley and Gylfi Sigurdsson score for Everton earlier in the season. To add insult to injury, TV footage showed Llorente was offside.\n\nManchester City steamroller Watford after Raheem Sterling’s rapid opener Read more\n\n“Maybe Fernando was offside for his goal and maybe Swansea have a right to complain but in football you always need some luck to open up the game,” said Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham manager.\n\n“It was fantastic for Fernando to score. He has been waiting for his time to play and for any player it is good for their confidence when they score. The conditions were so, so difficult but we deserved the victory. I’m very pleased to take the three points.”\n\nStorm Eleanor dumped gallons of water on players and pitch, and made it a miserable night for both. Every pass brought a spray of water as the ball went from player to player and the majority came from the visitors.\n\nCarlos Carvalhal started with three centre-halves and set up Swansea to contain and frustrate Spurs. They barely got a kick, in much the same fashion as in the 0-0 draw between the teams at Wembley earlier in the season, and got caught out at a free-kick.\n\nTom Carroll brought down Son Heung-min, Christian Eriksen floated over an inch-perfect cross and Llorente rose to head home at the near post. There was no celebration from the centre-forward but his goal sunk his former side deeper into the mire at the bottom of the table.\n\nFor Eriksen it was a continuation of his chief executioner role against the Swans. Coming into the game he had scored six goals and provided four assists in eight Premier League games against them.\n\nAndy Carroll’s late winner against West Brom lifts West Ham out of drop zone Read more\n\nThe deluge continued until 10 minutes before half time, by which time the home side had managed one effort on the Spurs goal from a Renato Sanches free-kick. Thankfully, the rain stayed away in the second half and a proper game broke out.\n\nSwansea changed their shape, played with more ambition and confidence, and took some risks. Davinson Sánchez was lucky to escape with a warning from the referee, Bobby Madley, for a foul that looked worthy of a second yellow card when he scythed down Martin Olsson on the edge of the area and it was no surprise Pochettino soon took him off.\n\nThere was action at both ends as the game opened up and twice Lukasz Fabianski had to punch away Eriksen free-kicks from the edge of the area. Then Hugo Lloris went down low to stop Luciano Narsingh at his near post after a great break from the home side.\n\nIt gave Swansea renewed confidence, despite the arrival of Kane on 68 minutes, and Jordan Ayew was thwarted in front of goal by Kieran Trippier after by-passing Lloris. From the corner Mike van der Hoorn hit the post with a header.\n\nAs Carvalhal’s side pressed forward there was every likelihood they might be caught on the break and that is what happened. Kane played in the excellent Dele Alli and even though the midfielder’s first shot was blocked by Fabianski, he managed to fire home the rebound as he stumbled goalward.\n\nIf an eighth home defeat was tough for the fans to take, the Swans manager was not too downhearted after two games in charge. “From what I have seen in these games I have a team of character, with quality and which is brave. Let’s see if we can bring in one or two in the transfer window,” Carvalhal said. “If they play with the heart and soul of tonight I will be a very happy coach.”"}, {"date": "02/01/2018", "arena":

The Football Association is likely to be interested in the club’s observations.\n\nTottenham’s Fernando Llorente pushes Swansea deeper into trouble Read more\n\n“The only thing I know is I see Jake in the crowd, which disturbed me,” Alan Pardew, the West Brom manager, said. “You don’t want to see a player in the crowd. There’s no way he’s going in the crowd, because I know him, he’s a great lad, unless he was provoked severely. That’s all I know. I haven’t had a chance to talk to Jake. I’ll speak to him and we’ll go from there.”\n\nWest Brom, who remain winless since Pardew replaced Tony Pulis, felt the disappointment of this defeat bitterly. They were beaten by Andy Carroll’s winner in the 94th minute and only goal difference is keeping them off the foot of the table.\n\nThe visitors were dead on their feet. While West Ham had enjoyed the luxury of a week off, West Brom had 48 hours to recover from their draw with Arsenal, such is the increasingly weird scheduling over the festive period.\n\n“It was a tough last 20 minutes,” Pardew said. “We were really hanging physically and mentally. It’s very evident on the pitch. We lose Matty Phillips in the warm‑up. It was too much for us. It’s unfair.”\n\nMost spectators had given up hope of seeing a winning goal when Manuel Lanzini and Marko Arnautovic launched one final attack. West Brom, who had felt the lactic acid rising in their muscles as a tight match wore on, were seconds away from earning a valuable point. “It didn’t look likely for long periods,” David Moyes said.\n\nYet West Ham’s manager had an unlikely hero in the form of a striker who has often cut a frustrated, angry figure this season. Carroll had not scored since last April before he cancelled out James McClean’s opener with towering header in the 59th minute and his second goal hauled West Ham a point above the bottom three, leaving West Brom heartbroken in the process.\n\nThe game started so promisingly for Pardew’s side. Their impressive organisation frustrated West Ham and they took the lead when McClean’s shot from 25 yards hit Pedro Obiang and spun over Adrián after half an hour.\n\nLanzini had two efforts saved by Ben Foster in the first half and Carroll spurned a wonderful chance shortly after half-time.\n\nManchester City steamroller Watford after Raheem Sterling’s rapid opener Read more\n\nStarting for the first time since 24 November, Carroll perked up after that miss and he showed there remains a spring in his legs when he leapt to meet Aaron Cresswell’s cross. This was him at his rollocking best as he bullied Jonny Evans and Kieran Gibbs, muscling both defenders out of the way to direct a low header past Foster.\n\nArnautovic went close after being played in by Lanzini but West Brom had a threat on the break. Oliver Burke had two chances after replacing Jay Rodriguez, but Pardew found himself criticising the young winger after he gave the ball away in the buildup to West Ham’s winner.\n\n“I expect him to run it in the corner,” Pardew said. “Maybe because we were under pressure to win he’s stuck it in the box.”\n\nWest Ham flew to the other end, Lanzini found Arnautovic and Carroll converted the Austrian’s cross from a tight angle."}, {"date": "02/01/2018", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53556, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [],

winning ways and the breezy, emphatic nature of the defeat of Watford suggests the ending of their record 18-game winning sequence on New Year’s Eve has merely refreshed Pep Guardiola’s side and made them doubly determined to resume their love of steamrollering opposition.\n\nCity required only 38 seconds to take the lead. Fabian Delph threaded the ball to David Silva along the left. He recycled it to Leroy Sané who beat Daryl Janmaat for pace and crossed. Marvin Zeegelaar missed the ball and Raheem Sterling struck with a confident left-foot finish that made his total 18 for the season.\n\nPep Guardiola: Kyle Walker injury shows schedule is ‘killing the players’ Read more\n\nCity could have doubled the advantage a few minutes later. This time Delph fed Sané, who picked out John Stones in an acre of space in front of Heurelho Gomes’s goal. But what should have been an easy second was spurned, the centre-back spooning over the bar.\n\nGuardiola had made five changes from the draw at Crystal Palace. Sergio Agüero, Stones, Sterling, Delph and David Silva came in but the headline selection was a player who retained his place; Kevin De Bruyne’s presence having been in doubt after a heavy Jason Puncheon challenge at Selhurst Park.\n\nGuardiola said: “He had some pain but wanted to play, if he wants to play then I want him to play. It says a lot [about his character].”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Raheem Sterling sidefoots home Leroy Sané’s cross to give Manchester City the lead inside the first minute. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images via Reuters\n\nMarco Silva drafted in Étienne Capoue and Andre Gray, Watford’s manager hoping his side could repeat Palace’s feat and become only the third side this season to deny City a league win. Yet going behind so early made the ask all the harder. Sané was floating in behind Watford’s defence at will. On one occasion he rolled the ball into the danger area but it was not precise enough for Agüero to take aim.\n\nCity then attacked down the right for the first time and they promptly scored. Silva – again – was the conductor, releasing De Bruyne, and when the Belgian whacked the ball in it ricocheted off a hapless Christian Kabasele past Gomes.\n\nAndy Carroll’s late winner against West Brom lifts West Ham out of drop zone Read more\n\nThe temptation was to consider the contest over after only 13 minutes. When De Bruyne crashed a free-kick off the bar a few minutes later – Gomes may have got a touch – it underlined City’s domination.\n\nA sodden Silva stood in the technical area wondering how Watford might claw their way back into the game. Guardiola, usually a fixture in the zone, signalled his content by not entering it until the 22nd minute. Yet after Stones hit a high ball intended for Sané straight out, Guardiola returned to his seat slapping a thigh in disappointment before Gray came close to pulling one back. A Nicolás Otamendi slip allowed the centre-forward to race at Ederson, who protected his team’s lead with a fine save.\n\nTowards the end of the half Sané and Agüero, twice, nearly breached the Watford rearguard and the visitors will have been relieved to reach the break only two goals down. Guardiola, though, may have been frustrated for such dominance not to have already sealed victory.\n\nHis second-half demand might have been to show more ruthlessness. If so Agüero’s howler of a missed header early on will have displeased him. De Bruyne – who supplied the cross – tried to show the No10 how to finish after Janmaat fouled Sané. From a tight angle on the left De Bruyne hoped to beat Gomes direct from the free-kick but found the side-netting.\n\nCity were now in their familiar attack-versus-defence mode. Sané, De Bruyne, Otamendi, Agüero, Silva, Sterling and Fernandinho relayed the ball in dizzying sequences that caught the eye. Whenever Watford managed to take possession they were harried out of it quickly.\n\nLuka Milivojevic seals Crystal Palace fight back to rock Southampton Read more\n\nJanmaat had to be alert to deny De Bruyne when Silva flipped the ball to him inside the area. It felt only a matter of time before City claimed a third and when it came it was too simple as again Watford made an error. De Bruyne hit the ball in from the right, directly at Gomes, but the goalkeeper spilled it and Agüero scored, his 16th of the campaign.\n\nA little later Guardiola took off Stones for Danilo and followed this by bringing on Yaya Touré for Fernandinho. The manager had shared a smile with the Ivorian as he entered the pitch and there was a long embrace for the Brazilian as he exited. Guardiola was not happy with Gray’s consolation goal, however. André Carrillo moved past Walker, who stumbled, and from the left found Gray for an easy finish.\n\nSilva was left ruing Watford’s opening. “It’s impossible when you start like that,” he said.

Eddie Howe’s side have taken flak for playing themselves into trouble – and they did so again here – but it was Brighton who imploded late on, making a mess of a late corner to allow Callum Wilson to swipe home an ugly equaliser.\n\n“It was not one for the purists but we will take that,” Howe said with a wry smile. “I’m happy with how we came back and fought back. But I’m disappointed with the goals we have conceded.”\n\nGlenn Murray, deemed an unwanted commodity at Bournemouth last summer, had put Brighton back in front against his former club before Wilson took advantage of some slapstick defending 11 minutes from time. For the Brighton manager this was a case of two priceless points dropped.\n\nBrighton 2-2 Bournemouth: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“I am hugely disappointed,” Chris Hughton said after his 150th game in charge of the team. “I am more disappointed with the first goal because set pieces are an area that we have tried to work on. The second one can happen. Players have attempted to clear the ball. It is one of those that every now and then happens.”\n\nBrighton had begun the year in style with Anthony Knockaert rounding off a slick team move inside five minutes. Shane Duffy’s cross-field ball found José Izquierdo, who played a neat give-and-go with the again impressive Pascal Gross before sliding the ball across goal for Knockaert to rattle home with his right foot for only his second goal of the season. After another one-two, this time between Murray and the – on this form – irresistible Izquierdo, the former forced a strong right-hand save from Asmir Begovic in the Bournemouth goal.\n\n“The threat that he gave us, I thought he was very good,” Hughton said of Izquierdo, a £13m club-record signing from Club Brugge last summer. “He is a worker also, if you look at the way that he plays it is not just about making forward runs. He defends well for the team and he wants to do well.”\n\nMurray had toyed with Steve Cook, dummying for Knockaert, who was dashing down the right until being tugged back by Lewis Cook. Bournemouth then woke with Markus Suttner having to hack clear Steve Cook’s goal-bound header. From the resulting corner Cook again rose above Duffy to head home the equaliser off the underside of the bar.\n\nThat goal developed some belief within the visiting side and Lewis Cook’s nimble footwork freed an onrushing Marc Pugh but Mathew Ryan comfortably saved the winger’s effort. Three minutes before half-time Izquierdo started and very nearly finished another fine Brighton move but was superbly denied by Begovic.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anthony Knockaert celebrates scoring the opening goal. Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images\n\nBournemouth survived but swiftly came unstuck after the interval and this time it was of their own doing. Simon Francis, their captain, ran the ball out of defence but straight into Izquierdo who prompted a ruthless Brighton attack, bearing down on Begovic before unselfishly squaring for Murray, who had time to steady himself before slamming the ball home. The Colombian should also have scored himself after galloping 40 yards upfield but shot straight at Begovic.\n\nIn an end-to-end affair, Wilson and Jordon Ibe combined before the latter tested Ryan, and then struck a post after jinking away from Gross. But Bournemouth eventually prospered in unconventional fashion. Wilson juggled the ball in the box – with Dunk appearing to handle – before Brighton tried and failed to clear Ibe’s in-swinging corner on five occasions.

Klavan was a £4.2m buy from Augsburg and, if there is a temptation to say his first Premier League goal may prove his last if he becomes Jürgen Klopp’s fourth-choice centre-back, at least it increased morale and momentum alike.\n\nWhen Emre Can chipped a free-kick into the penalty area in the fourth minute of added time, Lovren leapt highest to meet it. His header may have been going in. Klavan made sure, thrusting himself forward to apply the last touch. A self-effacing figure ended up asking: “Is it true that it is my goal? Oh good. It was on the line so I wasn’t sure.”\n\nIf it brought back memories of Lovren’s injury-time winner in 2016’s extraordinary comeback against Borussia Dortmund, it was another reminder that while Liverpool’s centre-backs can be found wanting at set-pieces in their own box, they occasionally fashion victories in the other.\n\n“A crazy game,” Klavan concluded. More to the point, it was a crazy ending, constructed by two teams with a refusal to be cowed by fatigue or inclement conditions. “We need the wins on the not sunny days,” said Klopp, and he was not just referring to the incessant rain. “It was not fantastic football but it was a fantastic attitude. You need to win with attitude when you are not 100%.”\n\nBurnley’s mentality was impeccable but Sean Dyche was left with a “horrible feeling” at the end. It is also a familiar one after his side conceded a stoppage-time equaliser at Old Trafford on Boxing Day. Yet their own fightback was a sign of their relentlessness and their fitness levels.\n\nBurnley had provided continuity and Liverpool change in a clash of selection policies. “I like rotation,” said Klopp, whose 87 alterations to his league starting XI are by far the most in the division, but rotation produced frustration in last month’s draw with Everton and more beckoned until Klavan’s intervention. He began as Joël Matip was rested. Klopp also started with Roberto Firmino on the bench, while he was without the sidelined Mohamed Salah and Philippe Coutinho. Although cynics suggested the Brazilian’s convenient summer back injury had flared up again as the transfer window reopened, a thigh problem accounted for his absence.\n\nLiverpool were not at their blistering best, shorn of both rhythm and Salah’s explosiveness. A dull match, when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had drawn the only meaningful save from Nick Pope, was enlivened by the lone member of Liverpool’s supposedly “Fab Four” to start. If Sadio Mané had been the least fabulous part of the band, he prospered as a solo artist with a sweet hit. Mané accepted Trent Alexander-Arnold’s pass, span and unleashed a ferocious shot.\n\n“The whole team applauded Sadio Mané when he came in,” Klopp said. The Senegalese has been upstaged by Salah this season, the Egyptian taking on the mantle of the prolific, electric winger. Yet there have been glimpses of his virtuosity, such as his backheel to set up Salah’s leveller against Leicester on Saturday and this was another instance of excellence at a pivotal moment. “We need him, we need him so much,” added Klopp. “He is not playing at his most fluent but a great goal.” Dyche put their absentees into context by arguing: “Four of their front five moved for £28m-plus.”\n\nOne of them, Adam Lallana, made his first start of an injury-interrupted season and was outstanding, Klopp said. Lallana even produced what may have been a potentially goal-saving challenge on Johann Berg Gudmundsson.\n\nLallana’s Burnley counterparts were decidedly cheaper. Scott Arfield, signed on a free transfer, had twice threatened to open the scoring and the £450,000 recruit Ashley Barnes came close to an equaliser.\n\nPope, another bargain, also denied first Alexander-Arnold and then Oxlade-Chamberlain a second goal, allowing Burnley to draw level. Charlie Taylor delivered a cross, Sam Vokes flicked it on and Gudmundsson headed in. “A sniffer’s goal,” said Dyche. The Icelander impressed again, but in vain, courtesy of Klavan.\n\n“Six points in two days; I’ve never had that before,” grinned Klopp. He was left with four days to consider whether to introduce Van Dijk against Everton. “No rush,” he said. “He is on fire, really wants [it] but we have to make sure he can perform. Centre-half is a position which depends on the others in the pitch. That means you have to tune it so you work together. Pre-season is for that usually. It is not important when his first game is but how many good games [he has].” Perhaps, then, there will be a reprieve for Lovren or Klavan before they cede the limelight to their costlier colleague.

The transformation was inspired by Riyad Mahrez, who illuminated the game with a brilliant goal early in the second half before creating another for Islam Slimani, the club’s record signing who was finally entrusted with a first league start since Claude Puel took charge in October. Marc Albrighton added a third goal and, to top off the hosts’ satisfaction, there was a belated appearance for Adrien Silva, who was at last allowed to play for Leicester four months after joining them.\n\nAll that would have made for a perfect start to 2018 for Leicester if not for the fact that their captain, Wes Morgan, was forced off in the first half with a hamstring injury that is expected to keep him out of action for several weeks. And then there is the worry that Mahrez’s latest exhibition may attract bids this month from bigger clubs looking for a slinky and sharp attacker.\n\nRagnar Klavan’s injury-time goal clinches dramatic Liverpool victory Read more\n\n“That is just speculation,” said Puel. “I want to keep all my best players. I am happy to play him and I think he is happy too. He was fresh and had quality and intensity to his play. It was a complete game from him.”\n\nThe Algerian has been in gleaming recent form, seemingly revelling under a manager who declared on his appointment that he hoped to introduce a playing style that would “seduce” Mahrez into resisting offers from elsewhere. Asked how he has coaxed the best out of a player who wanted to leave last summer, Puel quipped: “I speak French”.\n\nThe Mahrez show did not get under way until the second period, as the first half unfolded like a demonstration in support of a winter break. Both teams were playing a fourth match in 10 days and could not mask the ill-effects of a gruelling schedule, with players looking jaded and imprecise. They were also vulnerable to injury, as Morgan proved when hobbling off in the 27th minute following a lumpish tackle on Steve Mounié.\n\nJamie Vardy was absent because of a slight groin strain suffered in Saturday’s defeat at Liverpool but Silva was a notable inclusion among the home side’s substitutes after four months of suspended animation. Leicester paid Sporting Lisbon £22m for him on transfer deadline day in August but submitted the paperwork 14 seconds too late for international clearance to be granted, meaning the midfielder had to bide his time in a bureaucratic limbo until the Premier League could rubber stamp the deal as soon as the January’s window opened. He appeared, to tremendous acclaim, in the 86th minute, pointedly clad in the No14 jersey.\n\nBefore that Silva and all other spectators watched a misleading start to proceedings when Chris Löwe forced a save from Kasper Schmeichel in the first minute. There followed no other shots on target in the first half. Danny Williams had two chances but fluffed them. The first came when he chugged on to a pass by Aaron Mooy but, instead of shooting, he went to ground under mild pressure from Harry Maguire. Huddersfield’s manager, David Wagner, delivered an admirably honest verdict, saying: “I thought he could really go for a goal with the right desire. It wasn’t even a foul.”\n\nMahrez came to the fore in the 53rd minute, depositing the ball into the net with a wonderfully controlled volley from 12 yards. Albrighton had set up the chance by hooking a clever pass to Mahrez after weak defensive headers by Mathias Jorgensen and Mounié.\n\nMahrez created his team’s second goal on the hour, splitting Huddersfield’s defence with a neat pass to his compatriot, Slimani, who produced an equally deft finish, dinking the ball over the advancing Jonas Lossl.\n\nAfter that Huddersfield never looked like averting their first defeat in five matches and were grateful that a late header by Wilfred Ndidi bounced out off the crossbar. They were not so fortunate in stoppage time, when Albrighton scored from close range after strong work by Slimani and Demarai Gray."}, {"date": "01/01/2018", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance":

decision to name a weakened team at Chelsea badly backfired with defeat 48 hours later at the hands of a Newcastle United side who had won only one of their previous 12 matches. Ayoze Pérez scored the goal that piled the pressure on the Stoke manager and prompted loud calls from some of their supporters for the Welshman to be sacked.\n\nPeter Coates was there to witness it all unfold and it was tempting to wonder what was going through the Stoke chairman’s mind when those “Hughes Out” chants broke out in the Boothen end during the dying moments of the game. Boos greeted the final whistle seconds later and the manager cut a forlorn figure as he turned on his heel and made his way along the touchline, drenched and dismayed.\n\nMark Hughes storms out of press conference after Stoke lose to Newcastle Read more\n\nThis was a fifth league defeat in seven matches and leaves Stoke only two points and two places above the relegation zone, with the crucial win over West Bromwich Albion nine days ago already seeming a distant memory. The Stoke board have stayed loyal to Hughes up until now, refusing to give in to growing unrest among the supporters, yet this strayed into the territory of being a defeat too many, not least because of what had happened at Stamford Bridge two days earlier.\n\nBy in effect sacrificing that game against Chelsea, which Stoke lost 5-0, Hughes put himself under the spotlight and left himself open to the criticism that followed at the end of this defeat. He was unrepentant afterwards, insisting he would do the same thing all over again, yet deep down Hughes must have known that only a victory over Newcastle would have provided vindication for all those changes in west London.\n\nErik Pieters, Joe Allen, Xherdan Shaqiri, Maxim Choupo-Moting and Peter Crouch all came back into the team against Newcastle, along with Kurt Zouma, who was unable to play against his parent club, yet the outcome, if not the scoreline, was the same as Stoke slumped to a defeat that would have been hard to stomach at any time of the season.\n\nAlthough Karl Darlow made some excellent saves for Newcastle, in particular the two instinctive stops that denied Mame Diouf in the final 10 minutes, Stoke were flat for long periods and looked devoid of ideas. Newcastle had the better opportunities in the first half, when Christian Atsu was denied by Jack Butland, and Ciaran Clark filed a contender for miss of the season, and the visiting side looked more and more dangerous on the counterattack in the second half.\n\nDwight Gayle, who had started on the bench as Rafael Benítez made five changes to the side who were held to a goalless draw by Brighton on Saturday, had a penalty shout turned down shortly before Pérez’s goal, when the referee waved away Newcastle’s appeals after Zouma bundled into the striker.\n\nThree minutes later Newcastle took the lead with a goal that could not have been more simple. Jacob Murphy accepted the invitation to run into the space that opened up for him on the Stoke left, where Hughes had been forced to withdraw the injured Pieters, and delivered a low centre that Pérez, arriving just behind Geoff Cameron, tucked away from six yards out.\n\nRagnar Klavan’s injury-time goal clinches dramatic Liverpool victory Read more\n\nAs the Newcastle fans enjoyed some fun at Hughes’s expense by chanting that the Stoke manager would be “sacked in the morning”, the home team poured forward in search of an equaliser. Diouf saw his acrobatic left-foot volley superbly kept out by Darlow, who then made an even better save from the same player after Crouch had knocked down Charlie Adam’s deep cross, leaving Hughes holding his head in despair.\n\nBenítez, in contrast, headed back to the north-east with a spring in his step.

the neck after the game – but the same could not be said of Manchester United’s second-half display at Everton. Clinical, classy and confident; Mourinho’s men welcomed in the new year in a manner that seemed beyond them during their festive slump.\n\nSuperb finishes from Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard brought United a first win in five matches and a return to second place in the Premier League. A 12-point gap remains between themselves and Manchester City but, after a slow-burning start and despite missing several key performers, they imposed their quality and superiority over Sam Allardyce’s ambitionless team. It needs to be a benchmark for the remainder of the campaign or those kings of rock and roll – presumably the “Class of 92” – will be playing the record that so irks the United manager.\n\nEverton 0-2 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“From the first minute to the 70th we were improving, improving, improving,” said Mourinho. “We controlled the ball, we crossed a lot, the goals were phenomenal, Juan Mata’s shot hit the post and there was an amazing save by the kid [Everton’s Jordan Pickford]. We found a way to play without Romelu [Lukaku] and Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] and we played really well.”\n\nThe first half lived down to expectations, reflecting the dour recent form that both teams brought into a contest played on a wet and windy Merseyside evening, but United gradually took command with Paul Pogba to the fore. Mourinho’s new captain almost fashioned a breakthrough when he broke into the Everton area but his low cross eluded several team-mates who were waiting to convert. The midfielder also tested Pickford with a 30-yard drive that the Everton goalkeeper tipped round his post while Martial forced a fine low save from the £30m summer signing.\n\nAllardyce once again deployed his team purely to contain. The end result was a second consecutive defeat and a second home game in succession without an Everton shot on target. Goodison’s patience is wearing thin and Allardyce’s attempts to sign Cenk Tosun from Besiktas have stalled with the Turkish club now demanding more than the £25m agreed in principle last week.\n\n“I presume we will know in the next 24 hours if we are successful or not,” said the Everton manager of the Tosun deal. “We need a bigger goalscoring threat than we have at the moment. Our attacking powers are limited. I knew that before I arrived and that’s why I’ve worked so hard on keeping clean sheets. That’s our main objective, to make sure we pick up more results by not conceding goals and hoping we can score one to win a game. Our ratio of chances created is very limited.”\n\nMercifully from a United perspective there was improvement after the interval as they built momentum and forced the home side ever deeper. Better movement and distribution was key to their strong start to the second half and Mata twice went close to opening the scoring from distance. The Spain international’s first attempt from 25 yards was pushed over by Pickford. His second, a left-footed drive after cutting inside, flew beyond the goalkeeper but struck a post.\n\nEverton’s reprieve did not last long. The breakthrough had developed an air of inevitability, such was United’s dominance, and was executed with a touch of excellence. At the end of a sweeping counterattack Pogba picked out Martial in more space than he should have been allowed just outside the Everton penalty area. Central, and 20 yards out, the striker took aim for the top-left corner of Pickford’s goal and found his spot perfectly. Martial’s seventh goal of an inconsistent campaign was a fine way to end a barren run.\n\nJosé Mourinho turns on Paul Scholes after Paul Pogba shines at Everton Read more\n\nAllardyce responded to falling behind by introducing Aaron Lennon and James McCarthy for Yannick Bolasie and Rooney respectively, the latter switch attracting audible derision from the Gwladys Street end. United responded by remaining on the front foot and Pogba twice almost doubled their lead, forcing another good stop from Pickford at close range and just failing to connect cleanly with Martial’s inviting cross moments later. Pogba was a persistent threat roaming in from the left and teed up Lingard for a low shot that Everton’s keeper, yet again, foiled.\n\nIn fairness to the Everton manager his double substitution sparked a much-needed reaction from the hosts. Oumar Niasse headed wide when Mason Holgate’s cross found the striker unmarked in front of goal and Everton belatedly exerted pressure on the United defence, but the game was put out of their reach by another supreme finish. Pogba, inevitably, was involved, playing Lingard into space on the left before wheeling away in celebration as the winger cut across a weak challenge by Michael Keane and curled an unstoppable finish into the top corner.\n\n“Boys jump or they don’t jump,” said Mourinho when asked of Lingard’s increasing influence. “It is one thing to be a talent and another to be a very good player. Some players are not capable of that jump, they go from great potential to normal player, but I think Jesse is making that jump.”"}, {"date": "31/12/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance":

rhythm of the last few months that a goalless draw away from home against Crystal Palace will be hailed as a minor triumph for the Premier League title race, such as it is.\n\nAbove all, this was a fine afternoon for Palace and for Roy Hodgson, whose team produced a performance of real energy and ambition, more than playing their part in a thrilling afternoon. Palace even managed to miss a penalty, Ederson saving Luka Milivojevic’s poor kick with two minutes left. Victory would perhaps have been an injustice given the ease with which Wilfried Zaha tumbled like broken reed under Raheem Sterling’s gentle challenge.\n\nPep Guardiola calls for action to protect players from dangerous play Read more\n\nMore concerning for City fans was the sight of Kevin De Bruyne being carried off towards the end in real pain having been scythed down by a horrible challenge from Jason Puncheon, although he was said to be up and walking after the game. Earlier Gabriel Jesus had also limped off in obvious distress having pulled up holding his knee under no pressure. Guardiola suggested he could be out for “a month or more”. City have a wonderful depth of attacking riches but De Bruyne, in particular, is irreplaceable in his current form.\n\nThis was a significant occasion in other ways as Manchester City came to Selhurst Park on the verge of eclipsing Pep Guardiola’s personal best winning streak of 19 league games with Bayern Munich. It will perhaps be a point of pride for the Premier League that Palace were able to resist the outstanding domestic club team of the last few years with such verve. Perhaps others will learn from the boldness and energy of their approach.\n\nNew Year’s Eve is, of course, a time to remember old acquaintances, outlines dimmed by the mist of memory. For Manchester City this includes those billed until quite recently as their closest rivals. A draw here still leaves them 14 points clear of last year’s champions and 15 points clear of José Mourinho’s Manchester United. A moment, ladies and gentlemen, to remember absent friends.\n\nRoy Hodgson wields the Croydon Way to halt Manchester City juggernaut | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nThe last day of the year did at least bring something new as Palace showed there is a way to play this beautifully grooved City team that does not involve simply sitting back waiting for the blow to fall. Selhurst Park had a raucous, clattery carnival air at kick-off. And in the first half Palace pushed upfield with a contained fury that put the passivity of Newcastle United on Wednesday to shame.\n\nHodgson had set out his team with a back four and two holding midfielders, but this was far from a pure defensive operation.\n\nThe plan was clear enough as Palace funnelled early passes to Zaha in the hope of getting the Thornton Heath flyer in a foot race with Nicolás Otamendi. Otamendi may be many things – imposing obstacle, Class A man-to-man wrestler – but dainty on his feet is not one of them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luka Milivojevic has his penalty saved by Ederson. Photograph: Catherine Ivill/Getty Images\n\nFor the first time in a while City looked pressed in the areas where they like to shift the play and wear an opponent down. David Silva’s ability to yawn his way through any press, no matter how well-mustered, is not to be underestimated.\n\nWith eight minutes gone Palace had the first chance of the game. Wayne Hennessey punted the ball downfield. Eliaquim Mangala stumbled, haring back towards Ederson. Christian Benteke scuffed his shot on the move and Mangala was able to get back to clear.\n\nIf City were being hurried they still looked like they might rip down the other end and score at any moment. With 16 minutes gone Scott Dann injured himself fouling De Bruyne as he surged past and was carried off, to be replaced by Martin Kelly. It looked a horrible twist of the knee.\n\nMoments later Jesus collapsed by the touchline, to be replaced by Sergio Agüero. It was bruising stuff but also a thrilling game, the action condensed into small, intricate spaces, with every player on the pitch involved, from Zaha tracking back to his own goalline to Patrick van Aanholt overlapping Bernardo Silva at the other end.\n\nCrystal Palace 0-0 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAgüero found a tiny pocket of space and struck the post with a deflected shot. Zaha attacked Kyle Walker with real verve on the left wing, staying a little wider than he has at times, presumably to press City back in a favoured area.\n\nAnd as Palace continued to press and ferret in Hodge-of-war fashion Guardiola could be seen for the first time on his touchline just before half-time, jewelled epaulettes of his bomber jacket winkling as he whirled his arms, demanding more movement, more passing, more of that familiar stuff.\n\nCity’s ability to keep the ball began to tell after the break as Palace defended heroically at times, Kelly and James Tomkins producing some full body blocks. On 77 minutes Andros Townsend missed a gift of a chance, blasting wildly over from Zaha’s cross. At the death Zaha tumbled to win the penalty, drawing a huge roar. Milivojevic’s kick was scuffed.

The Arsenal manager ended up face-to-face with Mike Dean on the touchline, angry with the referee’s decision to award West Bromwich Albion a late penalty, and signed off 2017 with a furious attack on the standard of officiating in the Premier League and the manic festive fixture schedule. Happy New Year, Arsène.\n\nIt was that sort of evening for Wenger, who was in no mood to celebrate the fact that he had just clocked up his 811th Premier League game as manager to surpass Sir Alex Ferguson’s record. The Arsenal manager looked and sounded totally exasperated, his patience stretched to breaking point by the sight of Dean pointing to the spot in the 88th minute.\n\nArsenal had taken the lead only five minutes earlier, via a poorly taken free-kick from Alexis Sánchez that took a huge deflection off James McClean, and Wenger must have thought at that stage that his team were going to collect three points from a game where they had gone through the motions at times, never really playing with any conviction.\n\nDean, however, intervened with the sort of decision that leaves managers apoplectic. Kieran Gibbs – a former Arsenal player, to rub salt into Wenger’s wounds – broke into the area and tried to lift the ball over Calum Chambers. It struck the central defender on the arm and although there was hardly any space between Chambers and Gibbs and the ball – in other words, the Arsenal player could barely get out of the way – Dean gave a penalty.\n\nWenger was up in arms in his technical area and the Arsenal protests continued long after Jay Rodriguez had dispatched his kick to give Albion a precious point that lifts them off the bottom of the league, above Swansea on goal difference. Although Alan Pardew said that Albion deserved to come away from the game with something to show for their efforts, he admitted that he would have been “upset” if the penalty decision had been given against his team and he understood why Wenger was so angry.\n\nA spotlight will shine on Dean’s performance – not for the first time – while Wenger’s scathing comments about England’s referees showing no improvement since they turned professional are sure to ignite a fresh debate about the level of officiating in the Premier League. Yet there is no escaping the fact that Arsenal were their own worst enemies at The Hawthorns.\n\nThey looked disjointed for long periods, there was no real tempo to their game and far too many passes went astray. Arsenal’s buildup play was slow, prosaic and predictable, and it was hard to see where a goal was coming from until Sánchez benefited from a slice of good fortune with his free-kick.\n\nWenger suggested that his players’ lack of rest had contributed to a flat performance – Albion had an extra 48 hours to recover from their last fixture than Arsenal did – yet the travelling supporters were still entitled to expect their team to attack with much more pace and belief. The game had reached the hour mark when Arsenal finally put together one of their trademark slick one-touch moves, which culminated in Alexandre Lacazette seeing his left-foot shot repelled by Ben Foster’s outstretched boot.\n\nAt the other end Albion threatened only sporadically, with Matty Phillips their most dangerous player by a distance. Phillips had the beating of Sead Kolasinac, who departed with a knee injury after 37 minutes, and the Albion winger delivered several dangerous crosses from the right that were crying out for a centre-forward to throw himself at the ball.\n\nPardew appeared to be settling for a stalemate the longer the game went on but then came Sánchez’s free-kick. It was a desperately poor goal for Albion to concede and McClean, who had come off the bench minutes earlier, hardly covered himself in glory. Stationed on the end of the Albion wall, McClean turned his back as Sánchez ran up to take the free-kick and the ball deflected off the substitute, leaving Foster stranded.\n\nJust about every Arsenal player joined Sánchez to celebrate, in contrast to their muted response to the Chilean’s goals at Crystal Palace three days earlier, yet the visitors’ joy proved to be short-lived when Rodriguez converted that contentious penalty.\n\nAlthough Albion’s wait for a first win since August goes on – it is now 19 Premier League matches since they last picked up three points – in many respects this felt like a victory for Pardew and his players. “We deserved that,” Pardew said. “There was a lot of pressure on us today, we had to get something, so fair play to the players.”\n\nArsène Wenger attacks referees after controversial penalty award Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mike Dean tries to explain to Calum Chambers why he gave a penalty for handball.

Jordan Pickford had spent the afternoon showing why he has every chance of going to next year’s World Cup as England’s No1 goalkeeper when a wicked deflection off Michael Keane’s heel in the penultimate minute of the match sent Ryan Fraser’s shot spinning out of his reach and into the net.\n\nIn one stroke, that ended Bournemouth’s nine-match run without a win and lifted Eddie Howe’s side out of the relegation zone, while also condemning Sam Allardyce to his first defeat as Everton manager. Having dominated from the moment Idrissa Gueye equalised Fraser’s first-half volley, it was probably no more than the home side deserved but the result still felt harsh on Pickford and the £30m spent on him in the summer is already looking like a bargain.\n\nAnthony Knockaert the only spark in Newcastle and Brighton’s gloomy draw Read more\n\nEverton are hoping to complete the signing of Cenk Tosun for £25m in the coming days, with the Turkey striker expected to arrive on Merseyside this weekend after agreeing terms on a four-and-a-half-year contract. On this evidence, his arrival cannot come soon enough after a lacklustre display that showed Allardyce still has plenty of work to do despite his encouraging start.\n\n“It’s a frustrating way for the unbeaten run to end because we should have avoided both goals. That’s the bottom line,” he admitted. “I was pleased with the recovery from 1-0 down but in the end it’s a very disappointing defeat for us.”\n\nOn Pickford, Allardyce added: “He’s a top-drawer goalkeeper. The players should be disappointed that they have let him down a bit because we should have got a point after some of the saves he made.”\n\nBournemouth had begun the day in the bottom three, having accumulated only nine points at home all season. Howe selected an unchanged side from the draw against West Ham on Boxing Day, with Joshua King passing a late fitness test to start in a withdrawn role behind Callum Wilson in attack. Allardyce made four alterations to the team that drew against West Brom – their seventh match unbeaten since he replaced Ronald Koeman at the end of November – with Gueye back from injury and James McCarthy starting his first game for more than two months.\n\nJeff Hendrick denied penalty for Burnley in Huddersfield stalemate Read more\n\nGiven their perilous state, the onus was on Bournemouth to take the game to their opponents and, after a slow start, they gradually began to pick holes in Everton’s defence. Wilson should have opened the scoring in the 18th minute but found Pickford in superb form, before the goalkeeper denied Jordon Ibe’s smart turn and shot from the edge of the penalty area.\n\nBy contrast, the visitors appeared reluctant to commit numbers forward and that lack of ambition proved to be their undoing. But the manner in which Bournemouth ruthlessly exploited McCarthy’s sloppiness in midfield, with Fraser adjusting the timing of his run to finish off King’s precise cross, showed that they are more than capable of scoring enough goals to survive. To Howe’s obvious disappointment, however, the impressive King’s afternoon ended soon after when he limped off with a hamstring injury.\n\nAllardyce had clearly seen enough and introduced Wayne Rooney to the action after he had missed two matches with flu, swiftly followed by Oumar Niasse in place of the ineffective Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The result was a far more threatening approach that paid dividends immediately, although once again the goal came as a result of the opposition giving the ball away. Steve Cook’s pass was seized upon by Gylfi Sigurdsson, who fed Niasse on the edge of the area and he teed up his Senegalese compatriot Gueye with an excellent piece of skill.\n\nEverton had Pickford to thank again for not falling behind immediately as he denied Wilson once more with a brilliant save down to his left. Ibe also came close to finding a way through but saw his effort from distance skim the crossbar after again testing Pickford. Apart from one lightning quick break from the substitute Yannick Bolasie that almost set up Sigurdsson, Everton seemed content to hang on for a point. They were punished as the clock ticked towards the 90-minute mark, with Fraser given too much time to take aim but grateful to see the ball loop away from Pickford’s despairing dive.\n\n“It would have been harsh on us not to win. The players showed they can dig deep and it was a great feeling when the winner went in,” admitted Howe. “We make it difficult for ourselves but that was where the true character comes through. I’m so pleased for Ryan, who is beginning to show just how good a player he is.”"}, {"date": "30/12/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41433, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [9], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tiemoué Bakayoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Edwards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Tymon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Ramadan Sobhi Ahmed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxim Choupo-Moting", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Julien Ngoy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Souttar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "With this simple victory Chelsea ambled a little closer to Manchester City at the top of the table and ridiculed the weakness of Stoke City’s squad. At no point did this match seem an authentic contest, Mark Hughes’s improvised side appearing like ragtag underlings even before Antonio Rüdiger opened the scoring in the third minute. Danny Drinkwater, Pedro, Willian and Davide Zappacosta amused themselves by adding their names to score sheet.\n\nChelsea omitted key players such as Eden Hazard and Cesc Fàbregas in advance of Wednesday’s showdown with Arsenal but that was an unnecessary precaution, since the hosts did not have to exert themselves to trounce these woeful visitors.\n\nHughes was deprived of his first-choice defenders and also chose to leave out other regular starters – thus increasing the pressure on him for Monday’s low-brow encounter with Newcastle – but the shabbiness of the side sent out against the champions spoke badly about the state of Stoke. It also alluded to the widening gap between the Premier League’s mega-rich and the merely very rich but, that notwithstanding, Stoke should be better than they are.\n\nMark Hughes defends decision to field weakened Stoke team in rout by Chelsea Read more\n\nEven when at full-strength Stoke have the most porous defence in the Premier League so they were never likely to avoid a spanking here with a hotchpotch lineup. Tom Edwards and Josh Tymon, 18-year-old full-backs, might have thought that they would benefit from sound help from senior team-mates during their early days in the Premier League but instead they were surrounded by experienced players who made no impact.\n\nCharlie Adam and Ibrahim Afellay had not started in the league this season and proved unable to keep up with proceedings while it mattered. The same could be said of Saido Berahino, making his first start since September, and a few others, including Darren Fletcher and Kevin Wimmer. Stoke’s second string looks third-rate.\n\nTwo years ago Adam scored a famous goal here from inside his own half and it rapidly became clear that he would probably have to do the same again if the visitors were to have any chance of finding the net this time – because it certainly did not look like they were going to be able to piece together a move that would carry them that far forward.\n\nGeoff Cameron shanked the ball out of play to concede a corner after 17 seconds, establishing the tone for what followed. Stoke fell behind two minutes later, Rüdiger jumping between three static opponents to nod a free-kick by Willian into the net from six yards.\n\nIn the ninth minute Drinkwater treated himself to his first goal since his transfer from Leicester City and what a beauty it was. After a deft piece of control with his thigh, the midfielder swept the ball into the top corner of the net from 25 yards. Jack Butland did not even make a token effort to save it. But the goalkeeper soon got busy to thwart Álvaro Morata after the striker was sent clear by Willian.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jack Butland dives but cannot keep Pedro’s shot out for Chelsea’s third goal. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nMostly, Stoke looked servile and it seemed only a matter of time before Chelsea would help themselves to more goals. The third came in the 23rd minute following nifty interplay between Pedro and Willian. The Spaniard crowned the piece by jinking past Edwards and placing a shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the area.\n\nWith all semblance of a contest put to bed, Chelsea effectively donned their dressing gown and slippers midway through the first period. Lowering the intensity allowed Stoke to drift into the game and the visitors even went so far as to put the ball in the net before the break, but the referee spotted a handball by Mame Birame Diouf before the Senegalese striker shot past Thibaut Courtois.\n\nSwansea beat Watford with two late goals from Ayew and Narsingh Read more\n\nThe only source of frustration for Chelsea, meanwhile, was Morata’s strange lack of sharpness before he was replaced in the 71st minute. It was if the striker was contaminated by the ineptitude of a defence that never looked able to contain him. Butland’s resistance was honourable, in fairness, and the goalkeeper deserved praise for getting the better of the Chelsea striker in another one-on-one duel midway through the second half.\n\nThe irrepressible Willian brought another decent stop from Butland two minutes later with a shot from 20 yards. Fast-forward another minute and Willian presented Pedro with an opportunity to beat the Stoke goalkeeper from close range but Pedro sidefooted over the bar.\n\nWillian deserved to be among the goalscorers and was invited to do so when Cameron clunked into him to concede a penalty.

Burnley gradually pushed their hosts back, however, and had so many men forward in support of a break from Johann Berg Gudmundsson that an out-of-position Mathias Jorgensen was obliged to flatten the Iceland winger at the expense of a booking.\n\nBy the end of the first half Huddersfield had seen shots from Gudmundsson and Steven Defour roll narrowly wide of their goal and were having trouble playing the ball out from the back due to Burnley’s pressing. All Burnley needed to make their superiority count was a goal but Barnes’s effort on the stroke of the interval was blocked by Florent Hadergjonaj.\n\nChelsea’s Davide Zappacosta completes crushing of dire Stoke Read more\n\nScott Arfield had a great chance to open the scoring at the start of the second half, only to put his shot too close to Lossl having done the hard work with a burst into the area to collect Jack Cork’s pass. A similar move on the hour saw Arfield and Hendrick break into the area together, and though the latter would have been faced with a shot from a narrow angle after rounding Lossl on the goalline there was no question that the goalkeeper’s trailing leg brought him down. Huddersfield are on a roll with penalty decisions: Mark Hughes was incensed with one that failed to go Stoke’s way on Boxing Day, and if anything this was even clearer. Hendrick was tripped yet Paul Tierney remained unmoved – although interestingly he did not produce a card for simulation either.\n\nLossl was called into action again before the end, saving at close range from Nahki Wells after Sam Vokes’s headed flick had found his fellow substitute in front of goal. Wells was on the field for only 10 minutes, and scoring the winner against his old club would have been quite a story on only his second appearance since joining Burnley in the summer, but it was not to be. He ended his afternoon being pulled up for a blatant push in Danny Williams’s back, which was more in keeping with a low-key occasion."}, {"date": "30/12/2017", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53226, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Robertson", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [8], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [52, 76], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Musa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksander Dragovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Islam Slimani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew James", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "George Thomas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "By Jürgen Klopp’s admission the £75m that Liverpool are paying for Virgil van Dijk is unpleasant but Mohamed Salah represents “a catch” at £36.9m. His valuation of the Egypt international appeared sensible, even understated in the perverse world of football economics, after Salah inspired an outstanding Liverpool recovery against Leicester City.\n\n“The best reaction since I’ve been here,” said the Liverpool manager, who celebrated with characteristic abandon on the final whistle and with good reason. Salah struck two more superb goals to overturn Jamie Vardy’s opener at Anfield and take his season’s tally to 23 in all competitions. No Liverpool player has ever scored more before new year, the former Roma winger equalling Roger Hunt’s record from 1961-62 before departing with a limp that makes him a doubt for the New Year’s Day trip to Burnley. Salah encapsulated Liverpool’s quality throughout.\n\nKlopp’s team showed why Van Dijk has been bought at such expense when conceding cheaply and early but their comeback was hugely impressive in terms of performance and character. The result bodes well for a Liverpool team that can only improve with the defender on board and Claude Puel had no complaints over his first defeat in seven meetings with the Anfield club. “Liverpool played their best today,” said the Leicester manager.\n\nHis Liverpool counterpart commented: “You don’t want to go 1-0 down but if you do you want to see a reaction and it was fantastic. Not one player reacted in a negative way. We kept on going, created, created, created, and played brilliant football. Everyone in the stadium thought ‘Wow, what a game’ and 100 per cent it was one of the best since I’ve been here so far.”\n\nSwansea beat Watford with two late goals from Ayew and Narsingh Read more\n\nThe world’s most expensive defender had only just taken an executive seat in the main stand when Leicester took the lead thanks to another lapse in the rearguard that he has been bought to improve. Dejan Lovren may be the man with most to lose following the Holland international’s acquisition but it was Joël Matip’s mistake that demonstrated every Liverpool centre-half is threatened by the enhanced competition. Leicester punished the error superbly, in fairness.\n\nMatip was under no pressure when he took the ball from Loris Karius, back in the team as Klopp rotated his goalkeepers, and sold Emre Can short with a careless pass. Vicente Iborra won the midfield challenge and swept an exquisite ball behind Andrew Robertson into Riyad Mahrez. The winger squared first time and there was Vardy, so often Liverpool’s nemesis, arriving ahead of Matip to score from close range.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Vardy celebrates after opening the scoring for Leicester in the third minute. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nIt was Vardy’s seventh goal in eight appearances against Liverpool – becoming the first Leicester player to score in five successive meetings between the clubs in the process – and only the fourth league goal that Klopp’s team have conceded at Anfield this season. It was also the cue for Liverpool to deliver a rampant response, albeit one that was littered with missed chances and good saves from Kasper Schmeichel until Salah levelled in style. It was an achievement by Leicester to hold their advantage until the interval.\n\nThe pressure was unrelenting from Liverpool and a refusal to be disheartened by wasted opportunities was as impressive as their performance. Merited reward finally came from the devastating feet of Salah with his 22nd and 23rd goals of a remarkable debut season in red.\n\nAnthony Knockaert the only spark in Newcastle and Brighton’s gloomy draw Read more\n\nLiverpool’s equaliser reflected the confidence running through Klopp’s players. Roberto Firmino and Can were involved before Sadio Mané sent Salah darting into the area with a delightful back-heel. The summer signing evaded challenges from Christian Fuchs and Daniel Amartey and, with Schmeichel advancing, fired a low left-foot shot through the goalkeeper’s legs.\n\nSimilarly to Liverpool, Leicester responded well to conceding and almost regained the lead when Wilfred Ndidi curled a shot a fraction wide of Karius’s goal. But with Philippe Coutinho causing mayhem with a series of impudent touchesover the visiting defence it was the hosts who continued to pose the greater threat. The winner also stemmed from a first-time flick into Salah, this time from James Milner, but there appeared no immediate danger with Harry Maguire towering at his back. In an instant, however, Salah was gone, rolling the big defender brilliantly before placing his latest precise finish into Schmeichel’s bottom corner.\n\n“I think Mo can keep this standard but I also think all the boys can keep this standard,” said Klopp. Anfield could be in for a treat when Manchester City arrive in a fortnight."}, {"date": "30/12/2017", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle",

battle going into the new year. Brighton are far from safe themselves, but Chris Hughton looked somewhat happier than Rafael Benítez when both teams could have been forgiven for wanting to turn back the clock and return to their former lives dominating last season’s Championship.\n\nChelsea’s Davide Zappacosta completes crushing of dire Stoke Read more\n\n“It was a game we were expecting to win and it was important to win,” said Benítez, whose side have registered one victory in their past 12 fixtures and have a crucial game against Stoke City on New Year’s Day. “But Brighton were well-organised. We have to improve.”\n\nHe asked the Gallowgate-Enders who, unusually, vented their frustrations, for a little more patience. “The supporters have been really good for a while,” said Benítez, who could do with Amanda Staveley’s long-mooted takeover actually happening. “But they have to understand we need them behind the team. If we want to stay in the Premier League we have to all stay together. With the support of the fans it’s easier.”\n\nAs one of his predecessors here, Hughton appreciates the difficulty of managing under Mike Ashley’s idiosyncratic ownership but has too many preoccupations of his own to spare much sympathy right now. Not that he departed downcast. “There weren’t many clear chances but we were the better side over 90 minutes,” he said. “It could have been three points for us.”\n\nPrivately, at least, few Newcastle fans would disagree, particularly after a first half almost as messy as the remnants of Friday’s snow, which had left Tyneside’s pavements covered in a treacherous, half-frozen sludge. Things might have been even worse for the locals if Anthony Knockaert was two-footed.\n\nBrighton’s French winger, who was deployed down the right here, proved the best attacking player on view, but a heavy dependence on his left foot slowed their game down at vital moments, frequently permitting Paul Dummett, Knockaert’s marker, to reassert himself.\n\nEven so, Brighton shaded things when an amorphous Newcastle all too often seemed unsure as to whether they should be attacking or defending, and Dwight Gayle, Benítez’s most dangerous striker, was repeatedly second-guessed by the impressive Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy.\n\nMohamed Salah double inspires Liverpool fightback after Vardy opener Read more\n\nWith Newcastle struggling to set the tempo, Brighton had reason for cautious optimism. As half-time beckoned that very nearly turned to celebration when Duffy headed Pascal Gross’s corner narrowly wide. It was a significant reprieve for Newcastle, who seemed affected by their run of five straight home defeats. Admittedly, Mat Ryan made one important save early in the second half, but even that was down to Isaac Hayden’s routine shot deflecting off Dunk.\n\nRyan subsequently performed wonders to dive to his left and repel Gayle’s header after the striker bisected two defenders and connected with Christian Atsu’s cross from the left wing. At the other end, Karl Darlow also did well to dive to his right and keep Dunk’s header out after Duffy had flicked on a corner.\n\nWith Matt Ritchie, Newcastle’s once catalytic right-winger, having apparently morphed from talisman to passenger, Brighton rarely looked like conceding and were allowed to get away with some overly deep late defending.\n\nAfter the chorus of boos that greeted the final whistle had faded away, Benítez was asked how hard it is for a newly promoted team to survive in the Premier League. “Difficult,” he replied. “It’s difficult.”"}, {"date": "30/12/2017", "arena":

We tried everything to win, but if the players don’t play with commitment, with heart, you don’t win.\n\n“In two training sessions it’s not easy to give a new formation to the players but the main ideas were there. If the beginning of this is what we did today then I believe we will be better in future. We will improve the dynamic, play better.

Our opponents shot once at our goal in the opening minutes and after they didn’t create one chance until they scored. We had enough chances to kill the match and we controlled it.\n\n“We are playing three games in a short time, we have a lot of injuries and it’s not easy to make rotation every time. These three games, when you play more or less same 11 it is not easy for our players to be fresh in the second half. But it was the same for our opponent.”\n\nTherein lay the rub. The early chance Silva spoke of saw Ayew crash a shot off Gomes’s bar from 25 yards in the third minute. Seven minutes later and the goalkeeper’s long kick found Stefano Okaka. The big striker controlled the ball, turned and slipped Richarlison past Kyle Naughton.\n\nThe Brazilian in turn got off a shot that Lukasz Fabianski parried horribly to the Peruvian Carrillo for his first goal for Watford. But after that, the home side’s chances dribbled away, while Swansea found more confidence and ultimately more assertiveness.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lukasz Fabianski and manager Carlos Carvalhal celebrate Swansea’s late win.

Dyer was added to the mix as well, adding pace on the left flank. And finally emerging from his shell was Renato Sanches, liberated in the middle of the park and able to run at the Watford back line.\n\nAt 1-0 Watford created the one chance that really should have killed the game but Okaka’s replacement Andre Gray was denied by Fabianski after being put clean through. Then the moment Swansea had been waiting for finally arrived. Narsingh got the ball on the right and floated a cross to the back post where McBurnie won his duel and headed down to Ayew six yards out from goal.

The contest ended in a third consecutive draw for Mourinho’s side, meaning they have dropped six points out of the last nine.\n\nManchester United 0-0 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nYet the manager also pointed to further penalty claims in the 2-2 results with Leicester City and Burnley as reasons why they did not win those matches. The bottom line is, though, that United have slumped to third position and will be 17 points behind Manchester City should their rivals defeat Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nThe Portuguese’s problems are further deepened by the prospect of losing his top scorer, Romelu Lukaku, for two matches because of a ninth-minute clash of heads with Wesley Hoedt. If the striker is concussed, Premier League return-to-play guidelines stipulate he cannot return until a minimum of six days have elapsed.\n\nOf the penalty claim, Mourinho said: “I watched on the touchline and it looked for me very clear but there was 50m distance so I [at first] give the referee the benefit of the doubt. I know my players so when I see people like [Juan] Mata almost in hysterics I know, no doubt, and then at half-time I watch it.\n\n“It is a penalty like [Marcus] Rashford against Leicester, [Ander] Herrera against City. [Jonathan] Moss, [Michael] Oliver and Craig tonight are good referees. So the referees’ performances in these matches were good – these were unlucky decisions that punished us.”\n\nUnited are at Everton on New Year’s Day and then host Derby County on Friday in the FA Cup. The manager fears he will have to prepare for both games without Lukaku.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Romelu Lukaku is stretchered off in the first half after a clash of heads with Wesley Hoedt. Photograph: Super/SilverHub/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n“I don’t know [how serious it is],” he said. “I know that normally bad news arrives immediately and bad news didn’t arrive but to leave the pitch the way he did, we don’t think twice to make that decision immediately, because there is a problem not just for today but the next two matches I would say for sure.”\n\nThere was further bad news for Mourinho with Zlatan Ibrahimovic ruled out for a month after suffering a setback in his recovery from a serious knee injury. “Zlatan is out for a month. It’s the same knee,” he said.\n\n“It’s an incredible problem, a 37-year-old man, a lion like he says, a real lion, but it’s not easy. Now he had a little recurrence and one month out.”\n\nAshley Young could also face a retrospective ban after seemingly elbowing Dusan Tadic just after the hour. As Pawson did not see the incident the Football Association could rule on it as early as New Year’s Eve – in time for Young to miss the Everton trip if he is found guilty.\n\nMohamed Salah double inspires Liverpool fightback after Vardy opener Read more\n\nSouthampton’s manager, Mauricio Pellegrino, said he did not see the incident. “I haven’t seen the replay but it is difficult for the referee to see in one second what happened in all different places … I have to respect the decision.” United’s onfield issue is that their early-season spark has gone and they now seem worryingly sedated. Here again they could not break Saints down – Mourinho’s side won countless corners and hogged possession but lacked creativity in the final third.\n\nYet the manager said: “I think we played [well] enough to win with all the difficulties. We started the game and we lose the striker [Lukaku]. We lose one of the only two changes I have on the bench to change in attacking areas, leaving just one for the rest of the 90 minutes – I have to bring on Rashford to play all 90 minutes when he clearly needs a bit of rest.\n\n“Then a very good referee, one of the most promising young referees in Europe, had a very bad decision that punished us and then the game was about us trying and missing some important chances and always trying to create and play. And them trying to create a chance in isolated counterattacks. They had one very good chance that David [de Gea] saved and we kept trying with what we have.”\n\nThat opportunity came just before Lukaku’s injury. Sofiane Boufal made the right byline and pulled the ball back. A Luke Shaw mistake teed it up for James Ward-Prowse and, after De Gea made a fine stop, the lingering Boufal was adjudged offside.\n\nUnited could have done without a likely goal of their own being chalked off because of a needless offside but the otherwise anonymous Paul Pogba added just that as the contest neared its end. Nemanja Matic’s shot appeared to have beaten Alex McCarthy, who was making his Premier League debut for Saints after Fraser Forster was dropped. Pogba stretched and helped it home, however, and the goal was chalked off.\n\nAsked if McCarthy is now his No1, Pellegrino said: “In football nothing is fixed. Everything is changing all the time. The reality today will change tomorrow. I try to use the moment of the player and the player I think is better I try to give the opportunity. After they have to show on the pitch.”\n\nThis is what United have to start doing – upping their performance on each and every game day."}, {"date": "28/12/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park",

sensing another late rally might be rewarded, flung themselves into desperate pursuit of an unlikely equaliser, but Arsenal are back to counting this corner of south London as a home from home. They had retreated battered and bruised by a chastening defeat at this venue in April, yet they had not benefited from a fit Jack Wilshere in their ranks on that occasion. Times have changed.\n\nThe England midfielder was at the heart of everything impressive they tried here, spiky in the tackle and mature with his positioning, and a creator of his team’s decisive third goal with a carefully lofted pass over Palace’s back-line for Alexis Sánchez to collect on his thigh and poke into the corner on the gallop. The Chilean’s form, perhaps predictably, is flickering back into life with the transfer window so close and his contract ticking down. Wilshere’s deal, too, expires in the summer, though arguably the visiting fans’ best news of an encouraging night was the midfielder’s post-match assertion that he was sure a new contract “will get done”.\n\nOn this evidence, he is rightly restored as the side’s fulcrum, his metronomic presence a source of reassurance for a team who have been prone to panic at times. “Jack is coming back in competitive shape and gives something to the team at the moment,” said Wenger. “People who don’t have long contracts are questioned, always. But as long as you are somewhere, you give your best. The best way to show they are committed is to give that kind of performance. I felt Sánchez was very good from the first minute. This kind of Sánchez is a great football player, as we know. That’s the kind of performance we want from him.”\n\nPossibly more disconcerting was the sight of the forward looking nonplussed – perhaps more bemused than infuriated – to discover only a handful of team-mates had joined him in front of the away support to celebrate Arsenal’s second goal. Sánchez, all short back-lift and frightening power, had ripped his shot through James Tomkins’ legs and inside Julián Speroni’s near post, but plenty of his colleagues preferred to celebrate together nearer the halfway line. It had Thierry Henry chuntering up in the Sky studio, though, in truth, it is easy to read too much into apparent splits when, in reality, raw emotion at a lead restored had probably taken over. The problem is observers will continue to scrutinise the body language until Sánchez’s time at the club is either extended or ends in divorce.\n\nThe thought of losing a player of his calibre feels all the more troubling in the aftermath of a performance this scintillating, even if all of Arsenal’s attackers had purred through the opening period. Comfortable with a back three and far more sprightly than tentative opponents, with Palace so nervous as runners infiltrated their lines, the visitors should have ended the contest by the interval. Nothing illustrated their superiority better than Sánchez’s delicious diagonal slide-rule pass beyond Tomkins for the on-rushing Mesut Özil to flick goalwards, only for Speroni to thrust out a left hand instinctively and paw the attempt away. The German would waltz through the centre again before the half was out, this time undoing his work with a heavy touch, but by then Arsenal were ahead.\n\nAfter Palace failed to clear their lines Alexandre Lacazette was permitted to turn inside and curl a left-footed shot which was only pushed out by the diving Speroni. Shkodran Mustafi, alone beyond Martin Kelly at the far post, calmly side-footed into the net. Sánchez, standing with one foot beyond the back-line, had made a vague attempt to reach Lacazette’s effort, but the offside appeals were half-hearted. So had been much of the hosts’ play with frustration eventually overcoming Wilfried Zaha who was booked for dissent as the teams departed for the interval. At least he spent half-time channelling that exasperation into a positive response. He, and Palace, were unrecognisable as an attacking force thereafter.\n\nAndros Townsend, after Zaha’s dart beyond Calum Chambers and pull-back from the byline, side-footed the hosts level and they might have led had Chambers not blocked Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s attempt. Even Arsenal’s flurry of goals around the hour-mark did not knock the stuffing from the home side’s approach and Zaha, mistiming a header in front of goal, and Bakary Sako might have scored before Tomkins nodded home as full time approached. That was Palace’s first goal from a set piece this season – so much for such routines being their forte – and provoked late anxiety, but Wenger’s side maintained their composure to survive.\n\nThis defeat ended Palace’s eight-match unbeaten run and left them a point above the relegation zone. To make matters considerably worse, Manchester City are their opponents at Selhurst Park on Sunday to confront a patched up side. Yet, while Hodgson juggles his options, Arsenal are buoyed. Sunday’s trip to the Hawthorns, another venue where they had sunk without trace last season, suddenly feels like an opportunity.\n\nResurgent Jack Wilshere’s discipline and craft gives Arsenal new

the Premier League but much as Newcastle United were frequently bewildered by Pep Guardiola’s players, they refused to bow to the visitors’ bewitching beauty.\n\nOn an Arctic night, Rafael Benítez initially showcased a defensive blueprint capable of making Tony Pulis and Sam Allardyce blush. Then, 15 minutes from the end, he abruptly switched tactics and very nearly undid his compatriot on the counterattack.\n\nNewcastle’s stifling tactics no match for Manchester City’s attacking intent | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\n“The trouble with 1-0 is it’s always dangerous,” said City’s manager Guardiola. “We did well except for the last 10 minutes, when they wanted to punish us on the counterattack. But otherwise we controlled it. Over 90 minutes we were much, much better.”\n\nIt was the Spaniard’s first visit to Newcastle and he was greeted by a slightly strange looking home side. Indeed there cannot have been many in the 52,000-plus crowd who correctly guessed Benítez’s starting XI on the way to the ground.\n\nFeaturing five changes from Saturday’s win at West Ham United, the team was arranged in 5-4-1 guise and involved rare starts for Rolando Aarons, Chancel Mbemba and Paul Dummett. It seemed a selection designed to rest some of Benítez’s key personnel before impending relegation six-pointers against Brighton here on Saturday and at Stoke on New Year’s Day.\n\nThe presence of three centre halves suggested that there was a bit of – well, actually, an awful lot – of damage-limitation thrown in too. After all, City arrived seeking an 18th successive Premier League win while also hoping to extend their lead at the top of the table to 15 points.\n\nGuardiola’s side began in suitably superior mode, dominating possession to an embarrassing extent and should have been ahead when Sergio Agüero connected with Fernandinho’s pass and shot from six yards. Agüero, though, lacked his customary ruthless incisiveness and hit a post.\n\nWhen Kevin De Bruyne subsequently curved a typically superlative ball in the Argentina striker’s direction and Agüero flicked out a boot a goal, again, seemed almost inevitable but Rob Elliot reacted brilliantly to the challenge, throwing out an arm to make a fabulous reaction save.\n\nLater the same striker – who on a better, sharper night might have scored four – directed a 20-yard shot against a post. No matter. With the visitors barely missing the absent David Silva and Ilkay Gundogan controlling the midfield pace, Newcastle were being stretched to the absolute limit and could barely escape their own half.\n\nNot that Benítez’s players had much apparent desire for adventure. They had clearly been briefed to foil and frustrate at every turn and duly set about redefining the term “packed defence”. At times their half became so congested that City’s passing and movement effectively ran aground. There were frequently so many bodies in the area that De Bruyne and company evidently struggled to see the wood for the trees.\n\n“As a manager I have to adapt,” said Guardiola. “It’s not easy to concentrate during 18 wins but during this run we’ve beaten teams who’ve done low-pressing, high-pressing, counterattacks, just set pieces and all-out attacking. The magnificent thing about football is managers can play any way they want but, so far, we’ve beaten them all.”\n\nIf Vincent Kompany’s latest injury offered Benítez a glimmer of hope it was misplaced. Guardiola daringly replaced his wounded centre half with Gabriel Jesus in the first half. This left Fernandinho to drop back into defence, where he had an outstanding evening.\n\nDe Bruyne did not do too badly either. When he was permitted space and time to loft an imperious ball into the area it was met to scoring effect by a stretching, straining Sterling who flicked out a leg and, courtesy of a low side-foot, diverted the ball beyond Elliot for his 13th goal of the season.\n\nFinally forced to attack, Newcastle quickly received a reminder that, sometimes, fortune really does favour the brave. When Kyle Walker slipped, Aarons chipped Ederson before Nicolás Otamendi headed clear off the line. It was an isolated cameo but as second-half temperatures plunged below zero, City’s passing radar went slightly awry.\n\nVincent Kompany says record’s ‘special feeling’ lifts Manchester City Read more\n\nBenítez had cause for faint optimism that Guardiola’s gameplan might possibly be freezing up a little.\n\nAccordingly he introduced the counterattacking pace of Dwight Gayle and Christian Atsu, and despite Agüero rightly seeing a goal disallowed for offside after De Bruyne’s curler struck a post, the balance shifted. Suddenly City looked vaguely mortal but rather than shoot, Gayle collapsed in the face of Danilo’s penalty area challenge and was rightly booked for diving. An unmarked Gayle might also have equalised at the death but instead headed Atsu’s cross fractionally wide.\n\n“We had to do what we did,” said a sanguine Benítez. “I’m really pleased with the performance, the only pity was we didn’t get a point against a very good side.”"}, {"date": "26/12/2017", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 57297, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur",

Another day, another hat-trick. It was the Tottenham Hotspur striker’s eighth of 2017 but the headline details were even more eye-catching.\n\nKane had Alan Shearer’s Premier League mark for a calendar year in his sights and he duly overhauled it. Shearer scored 36 times for Blackburn Rovers in 1995; Kane has finished the year with 39 and he did it from 36 matches. Shearer took 42.\n\nEven better for Kane is that he now stands as Europe’s leading scorer from 2017 – ahead of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, the player that he one day hopes to supplant as the best in the world. Messi has 54 goals from 63 appearances in all competitions. For Kane, it is 56 from 52.\n\nHarry Kane among the world’s finest forwards, says Mauricio Pochettino Read more\n\nIt was an occasion when the atmosphere was slightly subdued, despite the excellence on display, and it was easy to imagine the bloated insides and fuzzy heads in the stands. Kane’s clarity of purpose shone brightly. He opened up with a header before dispatching two left-footed efforts and he is now the top scorer in this season’s Premier League with 18. Nobody would bet against him adding a third consecutive Golden Boot.\n\nIt was a miserable 90 minutes for Southampton and their manager, Mauricio Pellegrino, who heard chants from the travelling support about him being sacked in the morning. Once again he started without Virgil van Dijk in his squad – it seems inevitable the defender will get the move he has pushed for in January – and it is now seven games without a win for the club.\n\nPellegrino’s team were dreadful in the first half but at least they kept fighting when the game was over at 4-0. Sofiane Boufal got their first consolation goal when he beat Hugo Lloris for power at his near post, while Dusan Tadic scored the second after further uncertainty from the Tottenham goalkeeper. Pellegrino said the bad period would show him “how people really are – who are the players that want to fight 100% for the club”.\n\nDele Alli was impressive for Spurs, scoring one, setting up two and having a prominent role in another, while Son Heung-min also got himself on the scoresheet. But this was a game that was all about one man.\n\nKane could and should have had more. He touched wide from Christian Eriksen’s low cross on six minutes but he did not have to wait long for the goal that took him past Shearer and level with Messi. The opportunity might have come from the penalty spot but Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s foul on Danny Rose was just outside the area on the left-hand side. When Eriksen stood over the free-kick the alarm bells continued to sound for Southampton.\n\nThe delivery was superb, bent into the corridor between goalkeeper and backline, although it was still easy to wince at the marking. Kane was more than a yard in behind Wesley Hoedt and Oriol Romeu was hopelessly on the wrong side. Kane’s header flashed home.\n\nSouthampton offered next to nothing in the first half but they almost found a way back into it via an unlikely source. Lloris flapped at Boufal’s shot, pushing it up and out and what happened next seemed to unfold in slow motion. Rose put too much on his attempted back header and it looked set to loop over Lloris for an own goal. The keeper, though, got something on to it, raced back and patted the ball on to his post before clutching it gratefully.\n\nJesse Lingard’s double rescues point for Manchester United against Burnley Read more\n\nBack to Kane. He banged a free-kick into the wall and popped another shot high from 25 yards. The striker terrified Southampton every time he picked up possession and there was a lovely crossfield pass from him on 42 minutes that released Son. Jack Stephens did just enough to force the South Korean off balance without conceding a penalty.\n\nBy then Kane had scored his second and it was a beautiful team goal, embossed by the flair and vision of Alli. The midfielder collected Eriksen’s pass and took two defenders out with a spin and then a third with a slide-rule pass for Son. He crossed low. You-know-who swept home.\n\nKane might have completed his hat-trick in first-half stoppage time. After Eriksen’s flick, the chip from distance was on for him and it said everything that you half-expected him to execute it. He could not.\n\nSouthampton flickered at the beginning of the second half. Shane Long almost got in after Eric Dier’s mistake while Mario Lemina rattled the crossbar from the edge of the area. But no team can defend as badly as Southampton did and expect to emerge without heavy damage.\n\nAlli got the goal that his performance deserved after he picked up possession on the left-hand edge of the area. With no challenge forthcoming, he sauntered inside and shaped a low right-footed curler into Fraser Forster’s far corner. Son’s goal followed shortly afterwards and it owed much to Alli’s pace on the counter-attack, not to mention the timing of his pass. Son’s finish was clinical.\n\nKane grazed the outside of the far post with a volley from Rose’s crossfield pass on 57 minutes and the hat-trick finally came after another quick break and Alli assist.

This was a topsy-turvy tale in which West Ham United came back from behind to lead with only six minutes of injury time to play only for the referee, Bobby Madley, after a seemingly interminable conversation, to overrule Simon Long, his assistant who had flagged for offside, and award Bournemouth a 93rd-minute equaliser to cap a chaotic climax.\n\nFor Moyes the offside was immaterial given that the final touch on the ball’s descent beyond Adrián, the West Ham goalkeeper, came via Callum Wilson’s upper arm as the striker attempted to steer Nathan Aké’s goal-bound header home. The decision ensured both teams went home with a point – one which in truth does little for either side.\n\nJesse Lingard’s double rescues point for Manchester United against Burnley Read more\n\nIt was a decision that left the West Ham manager in a spin, with only Bournemouth, in 18th, keeping his team out of the relegation zone. “I think you could question the offside, I think you could question whether that was right or wrong because it looks pretty level,” Moyes said. “But what you can’t do is question whether the Bournemouth player put it in with his arm, so the goal should be ruled out one way or the other. We didn’t defend it well, but when the linesman’s flag goes up I think: ‘Oh good, we have got out of jail there a little bit.’ But to lose a goal like that is a killer.”\n\nAsked if it was handball, Wilson said: “I’m not sure where it touched me but I think it was. I’ve tried to head it and missed it. I have had to be a little bit smart about the situation, tell the referee I didn’t touch the ball and obviously once its given, you know it goes down as yours. It shouldn’t have got to that point in the game anyway.”\n\nMaybe not, but the enigmatic Marko Arnautovic looked to have sealed victory when he poked home the rebound from Javier Hernández’s saved close-range effort, shortly after he had seized on Asmir Begovic’s costly slip to equalise nine minutes from time.\n\nAfter falling behind to James Collins’s header after seven minutes, Bournemouth rallied with the impressive midfielder Dan Gosling and then Aké crashing home to put Eddie Howe’s side in front. Lewis Cook, Gosling’s midfield partner, had a hand in both goals and it was no surprise Howe paid tribute to his team’s commanding engine room. “There were some big performances and I haven’t said that as much as I would have liked this season,” he said.\n\nHarry Kane breaks record in style as Tottenham brush aside Southampton Read more\n\nThey peppered Adrián’s goal in search of a third but Begovic handed West Ham a route back in, slipping over inside the box as he went to kick the ball upfield. After flattering to deceive, Arnautovic – who started in a shirt bearing the name “Arnoutovic” before changing at the interval – hammered in his fourth and then fifth goals in five starts.\n\n“I think after just telling him that if he wasn’t going to run he wasn’t going to play, I think he sort of took that on,” Moyes reflected.\n\nHowe recognised his side had “got away with one” with Wilson’s leveller but they were fortunate to head down the tunnel at half-time with 10 men too: the referee had been lenient when he only showed a yellow to Simon Francis, the Bournemouth captain, for a high boot on Cheikhou Kouyaté. The West Ham midfielder was down for three minutes, during which time an incensed assistant, Stuart Pearce, was among those from the away dugout to make his voice heard by the fourth official, Mike Jones.\n\n“I think if one of my players had done that everybody would have been screaming for him to be banned for six or seven games,” Moyes added. “In any other country in the world that would have been a sending off, not because it is deliberate – I don’t think he meant it – but because of raising a high boot. I just think if you get caught in that situation you’re liable to be sent off.”"}, {"date": "26/12/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41568, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Tiemoué Bakayoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [46], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}], "subs": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ethan Ampadu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ezequiel Schelotto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Suttner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomer Hemed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Baldock", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Goldson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "There were periods here when Antonio Conte must have feared recent history was repeating itself. His Chelsea side had huffed and puffed their way through the opening period, their shot tally mounting without success (for all that their efforts were occasionally rather wild), with Brighton & Hove Albion holding firm until concentration lapsed in the opening 40 seconds after the break.\n\nThe champions would eventually win in comfort to paper over some of the cracks but a half century of shots in the fixtures either side of Christmas have yielded only two goals.\n\nThe Italian was rather stating the obvious with his post-match assessment that “if we learn to be more clinical, and to try to exploit the many chances we have during games, it will be better for us”. Álvaro Morata now has 10 goals, six assisted by César Azpilicueta, to show for his first Premier League campaign, and yet it is still tempting to wonder whether Diego Costa’s brute strength or ability to unnerve his markers, whether legitimately or not, is still being missed.\n\nCertainly while this contest drifted Chelsea were far too reliant upon Eden Hazard for inspiration, with the Belgian retreating ever deeper to collect the ball. He was only properly liberated once the hosts were ahead.\n\nConte will use his team’s initial toils here, as well as at Goodison Park on Saturday, as evidence that reinforcements are required next month: another forward to ease the burden on both Morata and Hazard, a forward-thinking wing-back to challenge Marcos Alonso down the left and, if the budgets stretch far enough, maybe a central creator.\n\nAlonso, plucked from Fiorentina in the summer of 2016, has been excellent since returning to the English game and forced Mat Ryan into fine blocks from a free‑kick and a header before flicking another Cesc Fàbregas corner into the far corner on the hour. That was his fifth goal this term and broke Brighton’s resistance for good on a day the hosts leant upon their Spanish contingent – Alonso, Fàbregas, Morata and Azpilicueta – to see them home. No club across Europe’s elite five leagues boasts more goals scored by Spanish players.\n\nEverton frustrate Chelsea after Ashley Williams enjoys lucky escape Read more\n\nIt was still Hazard who illuminated the occasion. His own standards rarely dip these days, even while team-mates labour in possession or in the pass. The 26-year-old has the speed of thought to unsettle even the most stubborn of rivals, with his scuttling presence alone enough to distract a resolute back line.\n\nChelsea’s problems tend to stem from opponents swarming around the playmaker’s every touch, which forces the collective ever deeper in their buildup play. At least they boasted an aerial threat here which eventually yielded a lead, Azpilicueta whipping in a centre beyond Lewis Dunk for Morata, in between centre-halves, to guide home via Ryan’s outstretched left hand.\n\nConte could bask in the onfield relationship which has been struck between ball-playing centre-half and No9. “Morata owes Azpi not one dinner, but many,” he joked. “And I want them to invite me, also.” He could afford to smile at the end, raising a glass of Champagne to wish the room a merry Christmas before departing with the gap to Manchester United in second place trimmed to a single point. One defeat in 11 league games would normally be cause for celebration, but Manchester City have warped accepted levels of excellence this term. The summit still feels distant.\n\nBrighton had reason to curse their lapse of concentration and subsequent concession at a set play, and have their own problems in front of goal, having registered a solitary penalty in their meetings with the top six over the first half of the season. They had sacrificed some invention here, with Anthony Knockaert and Pascal Gross starting on the bench, but, for all their defensive discipline, were still rather too blunt for comfort and never came closer than Shane Duffy’s header which drifted wide of the far post.\n\nTheir more pivotal occasions will be against Newcastle and Bournemouth over the remainder of the festive period. January will see the pursuit renewed of a striker to supplement the ranks, though any move for Moussa Dembélé – Chris Hughton denied any contact with Celtic, rather than any interest – will surely be challenged by rivals. Chelsea, amongst others, have monitored the Frenchman’s progress since his switch north of the border from Fulham. If the Scottish champions will indeed listen favourably to offers in excess of £25m, plenty will consider the forward’s credentials.\n\n“Particularly in January, what you’d like to do and what you can do can be different things,” said Hughton, whose moves for Vincent Janssen and Florin Andone had floundered on deadline day in August. “It’s a tough time to bring players in. Clubs don’t like losing players and their demands are high. But, if we can strengthen, we will.”\n\nBrighton are 12th beyond the campaign’s halfway point and can be proud of their efforts so far, but their manager is well aware of the potential pitfalls ahead."}, {"date": "26/12/2017", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24047, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

complaints from the crowd about the points being shared in a game that offered traditionally lively Boxing Day fare, both managers came up with one or two. David Wagner felt his side’s indifferent finishing cost them a win their superiority deserved. Mark Hughes, not for the first time, was unhappy about a couple of decisions that did not go Stoke’s way, a disallowed goal in the first half and a penalty that was not awarded in the second.\n\n“We are still waiting for our luck to change,” Hughes said. “But we’ve picked ourselves up and gone again and I’m really pleased with where we are at the moment.” Wagner described Huddersfield’s point as a success, though clearly felt it could have been improved upon. “We were the better team in open play but we still need to improve,” the Town manager said. “We created a lot of chances and Stoke didn’t.”\n\nHarry Kane breaks record in style as Tottenham brush aside Southampton Read more\n\nFor the neutral, though, the entertainment was first-rate. A win against West Bromwich Albion earned some breathing space but if Stoke are to pull decisively away from the relegation zone they need to stop giving away goals. The only Premier League side to concede 40 in the first half of the season they were a goal down after 10 minutes here, with Tom Ince finally getting off the mark for the Terriers. After a run down the right by Tommy Smith and determination shown by Collin Quaner in holding off Geoff Cameron to cut the ball back from the goal-line, Ince could hardly miss from near the penalty spot.\n\nThat was just the start Huddersfield needed, and Aaron Mooy spent the next few minutes threading passes into space behind an uneasy Stoke back-line. Quaner should perhaps have made more of one breakaway but his cross was too strong for the unmarked Steve Mounié, before Huddersfield but they had to survived an incredible goal-line scramble following a corner.\n\nJonas Lössl made a diving save from Ryan Shawcross’s header and when the ball was returned to the goalmouth the goalkeeper had to make an unsighted stop when Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting attempted an overhead kick from a couple of yards out. Lössl just about managed it, with the aid of a benign rebound from his right upright, and though the handily placed Peter Crouch claimed the ball had crossed the line the referee’s wristwear indicated otherwise. Replays showed Stoke had been unlucky. The decision was correct though extremely marginal, with only 10% of the ball failing to cross the line.\n\nMore bad news for Stoke came when Shawcross pulled up injured after half an hour and Cameron moved back to take his place in central defence. Though Rajiv van La Parra twice went close before the interval, Stoke were unlucky again at the other end when Choupo-Moting put the ball into the net from Xherdan Shaqiri’s pass, only to be recalled for the narrowest of offsides. Again the decision was probably correct, yet the margin must have been almost as tight as the one that required goal-line technology.\n\nContentious Callum Wilson goal rescues Bournemouth a point against West Ham Read more\n\nBy the second half the game had become as even as it was enjoyable. Steve Mounié was just too high with an overhead kick that had Jack Butland scrambling, then Shaqiri went just as close with one of his curling shots from the angle of the area. The powerful Quaner made a couple of surging runs towards goal, scattering Stoke defenders as he did so, without managing the necessary end product once he got within shooting range. When Mounié missed from close range from a Smith cross it began to look as if Huddersfield might rue their failure to add a second goal during a period when they were on top.\n\nSure enough the tireless Joe Allen found space on the left for a low cross that Ramadan Sobhi tucked away for an equaliser against the run of play. Stoke should have had a penalty when Christopher Schindler brought down Mame Biram Diouf as the game entered its final quarter, but the referee waved appeals away, just as he had when Allen wrestled Mooy to the ground a few minutes earlier. While the first incident had been debatable, there was no doubt Schindler’s trailing leg was what caused Diouf to lose his footing.\n\n“It was a clear penalty, the referee needs to give that,” Hughes said.

This draw with Burnley, following the identical result at Leicester City on Saturday, means Manchester United will trail Manchester City by 15 points should Pep Guardiola’s men beat Newcastle United on Wednesday night.\n\nIf it is not already, the deficit to United’s great rivals will soon be embarrassing. Given Mourinho’s personal history with Guardiola these are uncomfortable times for the Portuguese and the delirious visiting support signalled so, at one point comparing him unflatteringly with the Catalan.\n\nJosé Mourinho says ‘£300m not enough’ for Manchester United to compete Read more\n\nAs United spent virtually all of the second period camped in Burnley’s half, Mourinho could not fault the effort. The problem is more fundamental: a lack of quality where it counts most, in front of goal. Still, having trailed 2-0 at the break, the comeback to share the points showed spirit, an element their manager hailed.\n\n“At half-time I need my players to believe in me and accept the risk, not to be afraid to lose three or four, not to be afraid of a possible negative reaction from the supporters,” Mourinho said. “And I’m very happy with their character. Apart from that, also the way they played, they tried to break a very organised wall, I keep saying that to defend well is a quality and they defended very well, so also credit for them to concede only two goals.”\n\nAfter the “childish decisions” bewailed by Mourinho for allowing Leicester to sneak a late equaliser, he made four changes. Victor Lindelof and Jesse Lingard dropped to the bench and Anthony Martial and the injured Chris Smalling were not in the 18. Marcus Rashford, Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were drafted in, with the Swede making a first Premier League start this season.\n\nSean Dyche’s only change from the 3-0 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur was Ashley Barnes for Chris Wood, who has a knee problem. Burnley started in excellent fashion. Jeff Hendrick forced Rojo into conceding a free-kick down the left and when Johann Berg Gudmundsson swung the ball in a poor defensive header from Romelu Lukaku allowed Barnes to fire Burnley ahead after three minutes.\n\nÁlvaro Morata sets Chelsea on course for victory against stubborn Brighton Read more\n\nAfter Mourinho’s latest moan about the schedule in the programme his mood will have darkened further. United’s profligacy cost them at Leicester and they were culpable again in their next attack here. Ibrahimovic’s cross fell precisely for Juan Mata to head but he connected only lightly as Nick Pope’s goal gaped.\n\nBurnley were proving sharper. When the ball was moved to Gudmundsson down his right corridor the Iceland international was allowed copious time to send in a ball that fell straight on to Scott Arfield’s boot and, though he beat David de Gea, the ball struck the bar.\n\nAt the other end, Shaw warmed Pope’s fingers with a 25-yard effort and this followed an Ashley Young cross from which Lukaku went close with a header. Then a slick move involving Shaw, Rashford, Ibrahimovic and Mata took United swiftly into the area before Burnley snuffed out the danger by conceding a corner. A second followed quickly but Shaw’s delivery was cleared with ease. Back came United via a strong Young run along the right. He fed Lukaku yet when the centre-forward beat two defenders and stood the cross up, Ibrahimovic’s attempted bicycle kick put off an in-rushing Rashford.\n\nWhen Burnley next pushed forward they showed United how to finish. Arfield was clattered by Young and from the resulting free-kick 25 yards out in a central position Steven Defour curled the ball beyond De Gea into the top-right corner to double Burnley’s lead.\n\nBen Mee remained focused enough to prevent United pulling one back moments later. Rashford stole half a yard but his shot was cleared from the goalline by the visiting captain. As the half petered out a quiet Paul Pogba fired an attempt wide, epitomising United’s afternoon.\n\nRoberto Firmino double leads Liverpool’s rout of sorry Swansea Read more\n\nMourinho made a double substitution for the second half, with Ibrahimovic and Rojo taken off for Lingard and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Nemanja Matic dropped into Rojo’s centre-back berth, with Lingard and Mkhitaryan operating in midfield in a 4‑1‑4‑1 formation. There was nearly an instant dividend. Young fired in a low cross from the right and Lingard made contact but the effort was deflected on to the bar by a Pope hand. Soon, though, Old Trafford did roar as United found the net. In a near identical move, Young zipped in a cross and this time Lingard scored with a back-heel to the crowd’s delight.\n\nUnited’s tempo quickened but their hopes of scoring twice more to win the game looked slim against a parsimonious Burnley defence. Mourinho’s men kept possession without really posing a threat to Pope’s goal. A Rashford free-kick from the left that cleared everyone and went straight out was symptomatic. But, with defeat looming, Lingard struck in the first minute of stoppage time to secure a point.\n\nIt left Dyche content, though. “To come here and get a point is very pleasing,” he said. “It was tough. That was why they have only lost once here this season. You have to remind yourself of them facts. You have to look at the people they brought off the bench.”\n\nBurnley finished with seven yellow cards, which means a Football Association charge.

The Leicester City goalkeeper turned a cross by Abdoulaye Doucouré into his own net in the 65th minute to complete Watford’s comeback after Molla Wagué had negated Riyad Mahrez’s opening goal for the visitors.\n\nSilva was under pressure to find a solution to his team’s rotten form, which took root when the manager was courted by Everton last month. The Portuguese triggered the turnaround here, changing things when he made a first-half substitution that altered the course of the match.\n\nJesse Lingard’s double rescues point for Manchester United against Burnley Read more\n\nWatford came into the game with a record of eight defeats from their previous 11 matches and initially it did not look as if Leicester would grant them any respite. The visitors were the sharper side for most of the first half and could have taken the lead through Jamie Vardy even before Mahrez scored. It was a splendid finish by the Algerian, who headed the ball beyond the reach of Heurelho Gomes from eight yards after a typically fine cross by Marc Albrighton. The fact that Mahrez was free in the box, as he had been on several previous occasions, highlighted the extent to which the hotchpotch home team were malfunctioning.\n\nSilva, faced with a spate of injuries and suspensions on top of that dreadful run of results, had opted for a surprising formation in which Richarlison was deployed in an unfamiliar lone striker role. The home side struggled to find fluency, even though the Brazilian should have equalised within two minutes of Mahrez’s goal. André Carrillo, Watford’s most threatening player throughout, created the chance with a jagged run in from the left and a cute pass. The Brazilian dodged past Schmeichel but fired into the side-netting from a tight angle.\n\nThat chance did not fool Silva into thinking his original plan was working so he changed it, introducing Stefano Okaka when the ineffective Roberto Pereyra complained of a slight injury. Richarlison moved to the left and Watford immediately looked more comfortable. But it is unlikely that even Silva anticipated their breakthrough coming moments later through Wagué. The Mali international made a single start for Leicester while on loan last season, suffering a season-ending injury in February’s FA Cup defeat at Millwall.\n\nThat was one more than he had made before this match for Watford, whom he joined on loan from Udinese in the summer. He marked the occasion in unexpected style just before half-time, stabbing the ball into the net from close range after Richarlison’s shot from a corner was blocked by Wilfried Ndidi.\n\n“He gave me everything I asked,” Silva said of Wagué, explaining he picked the Malian mainly because his speed would enable him to keep pace with Vardy. “He has been improving in the last weeks in training so now I gave him the chance and he answered well. It is a sign for everyone in the club that you always have to be ready.”\n\nWatford underlined their transformation by almost scoring a second before the interval, but Richarlison blasted against a post after a flowing move.\n\nTheir vibrancy carried over into the second half but the adventure left them exposed to Leicester’s counterattacks. Gomes saved from Mahrez early in the second half and he should have been required to make another on the hour, but Albrighton attempted a pass rather than a shot after being sent clear. The pass was cut out. That misjudgment was soon compounded by Leicester’s defence.\n\nA free-kick by Tom Cleverley was allowed to travel beyond the far post, where Doucouré hooked the ball back from the touchline. Schmeichel tried to block it at the near post but instead helped it over the line. Doucouré celebrated like a midfielder who had scored his seventh goal of his impressive campaign but the goalkeeper’s touch was decisive. Leicester have conceded more goals from set pieces than any other team in the Premier League this season.\n\n“We need to correct this,” said Claude Puel, their manager. “We need good attention and have to focus on second balls and mark well. When you lose a game like this, it’s a big frustration.”\n\nLeicester attempted to rescue a point but were thwarted by Gomes, who made two marvellous saves following Leicester corners, first from Wes Morgan and then from Leonardo Ulloa. “The way we reacted after going behind showed the personality and team spirit we have, and that must always stay,” Silva added."}, {"date": "26/12/2017", "arena":

threat of relegation deepens in these parts. Albion did just about everything but score on an afternoon that was a story of missed chances as the Midlands club’s winless run extended to 18 Premier League matches, leaving Alan Pardew still searching for his first victory since taking over and only Swansea City below them in the table.\n\nSalomón Rondón was as guilty as anyone for failing to punish a disappointing Everton side, with the Venezuelan passing up presentable opportunities to score at the start of each half, and Craig Dawson will also wonder how on earth he headed Matty Phillips’s cross over from three yards out and with the goal at his mercy.\n\nContentious Callum Wilson goal rescues Bournemouth a point against West Ham Read more\n\nThat sort of profligacy cost Albion dearly and enabled Sam Allardyce to leave the Hawthorns still unbeaten since becoming Everton manager. His side may even have pilfered three points at the end but Oumar Niasse, a second-half substitute, was denied by Ben Foster’s outstretched boot in the 89th minute. It was about the only meaningful effort on goal that Everton mustered on a day when it was tempting to think that Wayne Rooney had the right idea when he returned home on the morning of the match feeling unwell.\n\nThis game, in truth, was not much of a spectacle and desperately needed a goal to bring it to life. Albion, to their credit, kept probing and were by far the most likely team to score, yet there is a glaring lack of conviction in front of goal that badly needs to be addressed when the window reopens next week if they are to have any chance of climbing clear. Albion have scored only 14 goals in 20 league games this season and three of Pardew’s six matches in charge have ended in goalless draws.\n\nAsked whether he was frustrated with the latest stalemate, Pardew said: “Yeah, a little bit. It’s not often you see a game where the ball is flashed across the box as many times as that without any contact. We put quality balls in from both sides and nine times out of 10 you win that game, but unfortunately we just couldn’t find that moment today. We missed a couple of chances early, whether that affected our strikers, I’m not sure.”\n\nPardew was talking specifically about the moment when Jay Rodriguez crossed from the left and Rondón, stood inside the six-yard box, somehow failed to get a touch to an inviting delivery. “If that had gone in it might have been a very different game,” the Albion manager said. “He [Rondón] might think Ashley [Williams] was going to head it perhaps and it just put him off momentarily. It was a chance you would expect him to score normally.”\n\nAllardyce, who has become the first Everton manager to go undefeated in their first seven matches, was delighted to travel home with something to show for his side’s defensive resilience. He acknowledged that Everton need to improve with the ball but flagged up the number of youngsters in their starting XI, as well as the absence of a proven centre‑forward to lead the line, as mitigating factors.\n\nKasper Schmeichel’s error hands three points to Watford against Leicester City Read more\n\n“It’s a great point for us under the pressure we’ve come under today from West Brom,” Allardyce said. “I think that our defensive qualities yet again were a major part of our afternoon.\n\n“I think with our troubles at the moment with players missing, I suppose it’s only to be expected that we’re not delivering anything like the performance in possession you would expect. But in terms of what we’re doing defensively, only conceding two in eight is a remarkable turnaround from a team that conceded 28 in eight.”\n\nThe sight of Yannick Bolasie making his first appearance in over 12 months was a positive sign for Everton, although Allardyce admitted that the winger, who was withdrawn just after the hour, was “a long way off his best” and will need time to get up to speed. A striker remains the Everton manager’s priority, although he ruled out any prospect of the club making a fresh move for Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud.\n\nAlbion’s need for an upgrade in that department is every bit as great. Rondón works tirelessly up front but he has scored only three times in the Premier League this season and the left-footed shot that he sliced horribly wide, two minutes before limping off with a hamstring problem, rather summed up his day."}, {"date": "26/12/2017", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 52850, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [],

I have to be honest, I didn’t see that from all the players.”\n\nLiverpool appeared set for a comfortable home win as soon as Coutinho gave them the lead with six minutes gone. Several Liverpool goals stemmed from errors by the visitors and the breakthrough set the tone, with Ayew tumbling too easily under pressure from Firmino to concede possession cheaply inside the Swansea half. His team paid a swift and heavy price.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Roberto Firmino, right, celebrates his first and Liverpool’s second with Philippe Coutinho, who scored the opener. Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images\n\nFirmino sprayed the ball out wide to Salah, who switched the play immediately with a first-time pass to Coutinho on the left. Liverpool’s captain for the day had several Swansea defenders for company but a player of his talent requires just the fraction of space to make a difference. From 20 yards he curled an exquisite finish around his marker and just inside Lukasz Fabianski’s left‑hand post. The Swansea goalkeeper barely moved, such was the power and precision of Coutinho’s 12th goal of the season.\n\nThe expected procession towards victory did not materialise until after the interval. Klopp claimed: “Our timing was not good and our formation not good in the first half so we were always a bit too late and that allowed Swansea to play. But even then we had enough chances to have scored two or three goals.”\n\nOnce Liverpool emerged for the second half with greater urgency and aggression, however, Swansea simply wilted and the contest was quickly over. Coutinho supplied the second with a free-kick that caused a collective seizure in the Swansea rearguard. Firmino pulled away from Federico Fernández as the ball sailed towards the back post. Ayew stood and watched the danger unfold, not for the only time in the game, and Liverpool’s No9 guided a simple volley home from close range.\n\nContentious Callum Wilson goal rescues Bournemouth a point against West Ham Read more\n\nAnother Coutinho free-kick, cleverly cut square behind a crowded penalty area, almost presented Salah with the third but Liverpool did not have to wait long to extend their lead. The Brazilian was again involved, releasing Andrew Robertson on the left after an intricate show of skill, and one full-back assisted the other as the Scot’s cross was headed out to Trent Alexander-Arnold by Alfie Mawson. The header could have been won by Ayew but Alexander-Arnold wanted it more and beat the dawdling midfielder before driving an unstoppable finish in off the underside of Fabianski’s bar.\n\nThe fourth goal arrived within two minutes following an appalling mistake by the dreadful Fer. Mawson attempted to break out of his own half and found Fer, who responded with a pass backwards and straight to Salah. The Egypt international sprinted clear after that invitation and squared for Firmino to tap into an unguarded Swansea goal.\n\nThe rout was completed by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after Ayew, predictably by now, failed to react to the threat inside his own penalty area. Oxlade‑Chamberlain beat the winger once to play the ball out to Alexander-Arnold, and for a second time when the defender’s cross rebounded off Martin Olsson. The former Arsenal midfielder controlled the loose ball expertly before lofting a lovely finish over Fabianski and into the far corner of a battered Swansea goal."}, {"date": "23/12/2017", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39191, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cuco Martina", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [51]}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [10], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro Ramírez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beni Baningime", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [51], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tiemoué Bakayoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Callum Hudson-Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Antonio Conte shared a joke with Lisa, the dedicated host of the media room, as he politely asked for some sweets. That moment of brevity apart, the Chelsea manager was a model of frustration as he digested two points dropped and a performance that highlighted the champions’ over-reliance on the magic of Eden Hazard.\n\nAnother sign of progress for Everton under Sam Allardyce was another afternoon of torment for the Chelsea manager. His team dominated at Goodison but were stifled by a well-drilled Everton defensive display with their two £30m summer signings, Jordan Pickford and Michael Keane, excelling.\n\nWhen the visitors did find a way through, a finishing touch and fortune deserted them. Hazard was a mesmerising presence but Álvaro Morata’s one-match suspension proved costly against a rearguard whose resilience and confidence has been restored under their new, unbeaten manager.\n\n“When you dominate possession, shoot 26 times, but only eight on target, hit the crossbar and a defender clears twice off the line, for sure you must be disappointed,” said Conte. “We deserved to win.\n\n“I consider Everton to be the best team in this league after the top six and we played with great personality and intensity, and with great concentration because they defended very deep. But if you want to win this game you must score and you must be more clinical.”\n\nHis assessment brooked no argument and he departed with a request for a few more sweets.\n\nThere were echoes of the recent Merseyside derby draw as Allardyce’s team were encamped deep in their own half against a fluent attacking unit and reliant on Dominic Calvert-Lewin turning water into wine up front. As at Anfield, they managed to frustrate the team dominant in possession. Conte’s body language also betrayed an annoyance with the movement and final ball his team. Hazard excepted.\n\nThe Belgium international took the game to Everton, shouldering responsibility to lead the Chelsea line, but the supporting cast of Pedro and Willian struggled to exert the same influence and were withdrawn. Credit was due to a changed Everton defence and improved performances from Morgan Schneiderlin and Keane, the latter producing his best game for the club.\n\nEverton v Chelsea: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nIllness swept through the home squad before the game and sidelined Wayne Rooney. Ashley Williams and Mason Holgate dropped to the bench as Allardyce rotated with the festive schedule in mind. The two defenders have epitomised Everton’s recent recovery but their absence was not felt thanks to the contributions of Keane and Phil Jagielka, who made two goalline clearances in quick succession to deny Tiémoué Bakayoko and Willian from Chelsea’s first clear opening.\n\nThe visitors’ best chance of the first half fell to Pedro when released by Bakayoko but Pickford tipped his rising drive over the crossbar.\n\nEverton’s hopes of alleviating the pressure centred on long balls up to Calvert-Lewin and a requirement on the young centre-forward to hold up play against three Chelsea defenders. It was a tall order. Change was necessary and Allardyce made a double substitution at the interval to match Chelsea’s 3-4-3 formation. Williams and Sandro Ramírez replaced Tom Davies and Aaron Lennon respectively. However, five minutes into the new system, Everton lost Idrissa Gueye to a hamstring injury that could sideline him for a fortnight. Gueye had impressed in the battle of the midfield shields with N’Golo Kanté and his departure was a blow to Everton’s resistance. Yet resist they did.\n\nPickford enjoyed another impressive afternoon. The keeper saved well from Pedro, Hazard and Antonio Rüdiger as the visitors pressed for a breakthrough. When he was finally beaten it was by his own player, Williams, who met Victor Moses’s cross with a header that Morata would have been proud of. Fortunately for the Wales captain, his effort cannoned against the bar and clear.\n\nEverton almost stole victory in the 90th minute when Keane rose highest to meet Gylfi Sigurdsson’s corner but his header was a yard over.\n\n“We scrapped it out, there is no doubt about that,” Allardyce said. “The changes I made to try and get up the pitch more didn’t work as I would have liked but defensively I can’t knock the team in terms of the effort and commitment and organisation. Our defending is outstanding compared to when I arrived.”"}, {"date": "23/12/2017", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30473, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Goldson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Suttner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Tomer Hemed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Uwe Hünemeier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Baldock", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ezequiel Schelotto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "André Carrillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Molla Wagué", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefano Okaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Bachmann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Folivi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Sleigh bells were jingling and nerves were jangling but Brighton clung on to earn three precious points. Their first win in eight games means they are now in mid-table, five points clear of the drop. It is a position that could quickly change and, once again, the narrow margin of victory did not allow for a sense of comfort to spread over the home supporters. But there were more than enough positives for fans and club alike to believe things are moving in the right direction.\n\nPascal Gross scored the crucial goal, his fourth in the Premier League this season. The German has been invaluable to the side since arriving from Ingolstadt in the summer and he deserved the luck when his effort from the edge of the box eluded Heurelho Gomes at his right-hand post.\n\n“There a little bit of fortune with the goal, but what you’ve got to do is get the strike on target,” Hughton said. “Pascal strikes a strong, hard ball with both feet and arguably could score more goals. We’re always telling him to get more shots on target. If you don’t take those opportunities, then you don’t put yourself in the position to score.”\n\nThose remarks are typical of Hughton’s pragmatic approach, but there were signs that Brighton are starting to build a better attacking platform on their sturdy defensive foundation. Anthony Knockaert was the talismanic figure of last season and interacted well with the intelligent Gross.\n\nThe home side should really have been out of sight by the half-hour with Tomer Hemed, Davy Pröpper and Connor Goldson spurning decent opportunities. For the defender Goldson it was a special day, the 25-year-old making his Premier League debut nine months after he underwent heart surgery.\n\n“We got the ball in the offensive third a lot for a top-class match,” Hughton said. “The only frustration was with the final ball or the end product.”\n\nHughton defended his striker Hemed but the Israeli should have had a hat-trick, missing from six yards out when presented with a chance to wrap the game up in the 73rd minute. A new striker surely remains a priority for Brighton in January, but Hughton would only say that the winter window is “very difficult”.\n\nFor Watford, this was a fifth defeat in six games. It was also a lacklustre performance and their best scoring opportunity came in a last-minute scramble; Stefano Okaka, brought on as a substitute for Andre Gray, only able to poke wide after the Brighton goalkeeper, Mat Ryan, dropped a cross at his feet.\n\nThe Watford manager, Marco Silva, seemed in no mood to panic however, finding consolation in the same fine margins that had frustrated Hughton. He also denied that his team’s downturn in form had anything to do with the aborted attempts by Everton last month to make him their manager.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense this comparison,” he said. “Nothing has changed in the work in the club. I stay to find solutions. We had this one game to play with three players banned, five or six injured.\n\n“We have big problems with the starting XI and a lot of games in a row. But it’s not an excuse. Our obligation as a team is to keep together, only when you are all together can you achieve good results.”"}, {"date": "23/12/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54270, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [53], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27, 79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [12]}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [12], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emerson Hyndman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Mahoney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It is not a stretch to say Manchester City barely moved out of second gear and were still a class above Bournemouth.

Ever the arch-perfectionist, the 46-year-old believes City can improve.\n\n“Attack more fluently, more chances, it is not easy when the opponents stay back,” Guardiola said of Bournemouth, who defended with five. “We have to learn to improve and attack this kind of defence and I think that is going to happen – our target is what we do to find a solution.”\n\nThe hunt to extend the victorious sequence began with an XI showing two changes, Vincent Kompany and David Silva coming in for Eliaquim Mangala and Ilkay Gündogan.

Yet while the first part proved true, the second did not occur for a while due to a surprising lack of quality in the final pass.\n\nIn a flash, though, this changed. Nicolás Otamendi strode upfield, flipped the ball beyond Bournemouth , and in a single movement Agüero controlled and hit a shot over the advancing Asmir Begovic – it was too high but a sure sign City were livening up.\n\nNext, Leroy Sané claimed a corner along the left. David Silva delivered and Fernandinho headed over. Later, came a collector’s item: a long-distance shot from a City player – Otamendi striking the ball truly and causing Begovic to fling himself to his right.\n\nNow, finally, City scored. Against this Guardiola team the last thing needed is an unforced error. Yet this is what occurred when Begovic fluffed a regulation clearance. Fernandinho beat a dawdling Jordon Ibe to the loose ball and clipped possession to David Silva.\n\nBack came the ball and the Brazilian’s superb left-footed cross found Agüero, who half-kneeled to head past the hapless goalkeeper. It was his 14th goal in 20 games and the 100th of a glittering City career at this venue.\n\nFor the rest of the first half City coasted. But at the break Guardiola’s instruction to his players may have sounded terse: be more ruthless.\n\nIf a listless start did not augur well then what happened on 52 minutes reversed that notion. This was a classic Guardiola move as David Silva used De Bruyne’s run as a decoy, rolling the ball instead to Agüero. The No10’s instant sand-wedge of a chip found Raheem Sterling and he smashed in for his 16th goal of a standout campaign.\n\nFrom here the contest flatlined for a time. Guardiola took off Sané and De Bruyne for Bernardo Silva and Gündogan and now City doubled the scoreline. First came Agüero’s header, then came Danilo’s debut goal, the substitute hammering home from Sterling’s pass.\n\nEddie Howe’s side will spend Christmas Day in the relegation zone. “We’ve had an incredibly difficult run but we are through it and have to focus on the games coming up,” he said. “Every game is important, but the next three take on huge importance for us. We have so many injuries and it’s not ideal at this time of year. We try to approach every game looking to win. But they are a difficult team to play against, if you get it wrong here they have the players to expose it.\n\n“We came with a game plan to stay in the game then maybe have a go. For long periods we were good, the [opening] goal came from our mistake which was disappointing but the rest of the half was OK.”\n\nDespite City’s aura of invincibility Howe believes they can be downed. “Anyone is beatable, you can’t tell what will happen. We had moments when we could have scored and it could have been different.”\n\nYet this Guardiola team is making the sport seem so simple."}, {"date": "23/12/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium",

and never in them altogether, but Mauricio Pellegrino’s side continue to teeter above the relegation zone after being roundly booed off following this frustrating draw. With trips to Tottenham Hotspur and then Manchester United on the horizon, it looks set to be a bleak winter as far as Saints, three points above the bottom three, are concerned.\n\nAs for Huddersfield, they remain out of the top half only on goal difference after Laurent Depoitre cancelled out Charlie Austin’s opener on a day when Virgil van Dijk’s omission from Southampton’s 18-man squad dominated much of the discourse.\n\nAsked if supporters had seen the last of Van Dijk in a Saints shirt, with eight days until the start of the January transfer window, Pellegrino said: “I don’t know, we have to wait. Around him will be a lot of speculation and we have to wait to see what happens.”\n\nAs for Austin, who limped off with a hamstring injury, he will probably wake up to news of a three-match ban for violent conduct should the Football Association take retrospective action over a first-half kick out at Jonas Lossl, the Huddersfield goalkeeper, who required four minutes of treatment to a bloodied nose. “This should never happen where an opponent hurts an opponent on purpose,” David Wagner, the Huddersfield manager said. “I was a striker as well – not as good as those in the Premier League – but I know what you can and cannot do. This was nasty and nothing I like to see. His wife will not be happy with how he looks.”\n\nFor Southampton, it is now one win in 10 matches under Pellegrino and there are few signs of progress at the halfway stage of the season, with sections of Saints supporters growing increasingly disenchanted. Their match at home to Crystal Palace two days into 2018 already looks must-win. It was no surprise, then, that St Mary’s was decidedly tetchy at kick-off, while Pellegrino bore the body language of a manager badly in need of victory, slapping his thighs throughout a worrying first 23 minutes.\n\nHuddersfield would have taken the lead through their captain, Christopher Schindler – who, unmarked, headed goalwards from Florent Hadergjonaj’s sweeping cross – but for Fraser Forster getting a steely left hand on his effort.\n\nIt looked as though the 1,581 travelling Huddersfield supporters were destined for another happy away day, after thumping Watford 4-1 last time out. There was an early Christmas gift awaiting those making the 460-mile round trip on arrival too, with Terriers fans given a drinks voucher as they made their way through the turnstiles on the south coast, courtesy of the defender Mathias Zanka – dubbed ‘Zanka Claus’ in west Yorkshire – as a small thank you for their support this term. “Our supporters were so loud, I think they had the beer during the game,” Wagner joked.\n\nBut, after an encouraging start, Huddersfield came unstuck when some charitable defending allowed Austin, restored to the starting lineup, to slam home Wesley Hoedt’s flick-on from James Ward-Prowse’s corner. For a poacher with the killer instincts of Austin, this was as easy as it gets. He wheeled away to celebrate his fifth goal in his last five league starts, but soon afterwards he was fortunate to stay on the field. After failing to latch on to Jack Stephens’s overcooked through ball, Austin struck Lossl with a stray right boot, kicking the Huddersfield goalkeeper in the face. Austin came away unscathed, somehow avoiding even a booking from the referee, Lee Probert.\n\nAustin’s goal had given Southampton a much-needed boost. He kickstarted a superb team move inside his own half, before Mario Lemina – after nutmegging Aaron Mooy on the halfway line – slid in Nathan Redmond to tee up Dusan Tadic. Lossl, though, stood tall.\n\nAfter the interval, Redmond unselfishly played in Austin with just the goalkeeper to beat, but he dragged the ball wide. At that moment, Pellegrino surely feared that chance would come back to bite them – and so it did, when Depoitre rose between Stephens and Maya Yoshida to head home his third goal in as many games. Southampton sank into their shells as Huddersfield upped the ante, with Depoitre’s flailing feet within inches of converting Collin Quaner’s low cross. As Keith Stroud, the fourth official, announced four minutes of injury time, Yoshida headed against the post – but, for struggling Saints, it was to be yet another disappointing day at the office."},

pre-Christmas gift he wanted as his team ended a run of three straight defeats by eking out a nervy but deserved win. First-half goals by Joe Allen and Eric Choupo-Moting, and a late third by Ramadan Sobhi, banished, temporarily at least, the prospect of the sack for a manager who hopes this timely result is the start of a revival.\n\nHughes thanked his chairman, Peter Coates, after the victory for not bowing to pressure to fire him following a poor run of form. Coates instead visited the club’s training ground to encourage the manager and staff before this critical showdown.\n\n“I didn’t really have any doubts about it but I’m even more confident after this week,” said Hughes. “I’m really proud of everybody connected to Stoke: the players, the staff within the club and the ownership.\n\n“The chairman has been absolutely fantastic. He’s been in reassuring everybody, saying it’s business as usual. If they think they have the right people, then they back you. That’s what they’ve done this week and it’s been really important for everybody.\n\n“I like to think we’ve repaid them to some extent but it’s about the end of the season and making sure we give them what they want and deserve as owners because they’re top drawer.”\n\nGoodness knows, meanwhile, what the owners of West Brom have made of Alan Pardew’s first five matches in charge. Albion were just above the relegation zone when they sacked Tony Pulis last month but have since sunk deeper into trouble, second from bottom of the league and winless since August.\n\nHughes had aired slightly dubious grievances about recent results not being an accurate reflection of his team’s performances but here the final score was a fair indication of the play. The first half was one of Stoke’s most coherent displays of the season and vindication for some bold decisions by the manager after a spate of injuries, especially the deployment of 18-year-old Tom Edwards at right-back, which allowed Geoff Cameron to serve as a midfield sentinel protecting a defence that featured Kevin Wimmer at left-back.\n\nAllen was assigned an advanced midfield role and justified that decision by opening the scoring in the 19th minute. The goal came courtesy of a smidgin of luck as a shot by Choupo-Moting took a deflection off Ahmed Hegazi and fell into the path of Peter Crouch, who smashed the ball across the face of goal. Allen darted in front of Allan Nyom to claim his first Premier League goal for 10 months.\n\nThere was renewed pep to Stoke’s play but they needed Jack Butland to make a superb save in the 21st minute, the goalkeeper flinging himself low to his left to tip away a shot by Salomón Rondón. That chance was created by James McClean, who had a poor game otherwise, subdued by Edwards before being replaced at half time by Nacer Chadli.\n\nWest Brom were two goals in arrears by then with Allen playing a key role in Stoke’s second. The Welshman outmuscled Gareth Barry with an ease that embarrassed the veteran and then nudged the ball on to Choupo-Moting, who sidestepped Ben Foster and fired between Hegazi and Nyom and into the net.\n\nStoke’s play was not free of scruffiness – Darren Fletcher’s touch was clunky, for instance – but things looked rosy for them at the interval, nonetheless. That changed within six minutes as they suffered a relapse into the form that has led to them conceding more goals than any other top-flight team this season.\n\nWest Brom halved the lead in a damningly straightforward manner. Chris Brunt clipped a pass over the top from midfield and Rondón, having escaped the attentions of Ryan Shawcross, ran on to it and finished smartly. That remainder of their fragility and, in fairness, West Brom’s improvement, introduced edginess into the hosts’ play.\n\nStoke spent much of the second half on the back foot but regained a measure of defensive fortitude. West Brom were not especially sharp opponents but Shawcross and Kurt Zouma did well to repel several dangerous set-pieces and Butland made a fine save from Jay Rodriguez.\n\nEdwards produced a last-gasp tackle to prevent Rodriguez from plundering an equaliser in stoppage time but Sobhi scored on the break to ensure the home fans, and Hughes, left with festive cheer, unlike West Brom.\n\n“We have half a season left and, realistically, we’ve got to find seven or eight games where we’re going to find a win,” said Pardew. “It needs to start soon for us. Everton [on Boxing Day] will be a key game.”"}, {"date": "23/12/2017", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20354, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz

It was no more than Swansea deserved on the balance of play but nothing like as much as they had hoped for from a game that needed to be won to give their survival prospects a genuine lift.\n\nCrystal Palace, who extended their unbeaten run in the league to eight matches, took the lead through Luka Milivojevic’s second-half penalty and at that point, given Swansea’s fragile confidence, Roy Hodgson’s side could have been forgiven for thinking they would go on to win the game.\n\nSwansea, after all, had come into this fixture having failed to pick up a point from any match in which they had conceded a goal this season.\n\nThat damning statistic was put to bed, however, when Ayew scored 11 minutes after coming off the bench to replace Luciano Narsingh. It was the first substitution that Britton has ever made and it could not have turned out much better for him, as Ayew sat Milivojevic on his backside with a lovely dummy before beating Julián Speroni with a superb shot from 22 yards out that flashed past the Palace keeper and just inside the post. “It worked out OK, didn’t it?” said Britton, smiling, as he reflected on that substitution.\n\nBritton, who has been given the job in a temporary capacity in the wake of the decision to sack Paul Clement on Wednesday night, admitted he enjoyed being on the touchline but insisted that the experience had not altered his view that he has no interest in becoming manager on a permanent basis at this stage of his career.\n\nThe 35-year-old said he is none the wiser when it comes to the club’s longer-term managerial plans but everything points to him remaining in charge for the Boxing Day match at Liverpool at the very least. Swansea are believed to be finalising a shortlist with a view to interviewing candidates – a process that Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, their majority shareholders, will oversee – after the match at Anfield and before the trip to Vicarage Road on 30 December.\n\nPalace have already been through the hiring and firing process this season, with Hodgson’s appointment, allied to Wilfried Zaha’s return from injury, helping to turn around the club’s fortunes. They remain only two places above the relegation zone but Hodgson declared himself satisfied with four points from back-to-back away games at Leicester and Swansea, as well as the bigger picture.\n\n“We’re trying to chip away at that first seven games when we had zero points,” the Palace manager said. “It’s an enormous handicap to give yourself. We needed big performances to get on an even keel and that’s what we’ve done in the last two or three months.\n\n“We’ve brought ourselves into a pack of teams who have to look over their shoulders and be worried that the spectre of relegation is not leaving them. I expected it to take a lot longer to get ourselves into contention.”\n\nWith Christian Benteke suspended, Hodgson pushed Zaha and Andros Townsend further forward and those two always looked dangerous on the counterattack for Palace. Lukasz Fabianski made an excellent save to turn Townsend’s curling shot behind early in the first half and Zaha gave Federico Fernández the runaround for much of the game.\n\nIt was Ruben Loftus-Cheek, however, who won Palace their penalty after he was clumsily brought down by Fernández. Milivojevic – with Benteke not around to try to take the ball off of him – confidently scored from the spot.\n\nSwansea, in fairness, had played well in spells up until then and dominated possession for long periods, yet it was the same old problem that afflicted them whenever they attacked, as promising positions turned to nothing.\n\nIndeed, it was not until midway through the second half that Swansea registered an effort on target, when Speroni saved at the near post from Tammy Abraham.\n\nSwansea, however, kept probing and got their reward when Ayew beat Speroni with a splendid shot. “A wonderful strike,” Hodgson conceded."}, {"date": "23/12/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56955, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [],

Benítez’s pragmatism, it is unlikely that this chaotic game fitted into his vision of how football should be played. Sometimes, though, getting the job done matters more than questions of philosophy and even Benítez could put his obsession with control to one side after Newcastle clambered out of the relegation zone thanks to their first victory in 10 matches.\n\nSergio Agüero on song as Manchester City stroll against Bournemouth Read more\n\nThe Spaniard could not allow the celebrations to last too long, though, even after seeing his players ensure that the team in the famous black and white stripes would not spend Christmas Day in the bottom three for the first time in Premier League history. Ever the perfectionist – or, perhaps, ever the politician – Benítez made a point of stressing that Mike Ashley still needs to reach for his wallet when the transfer window opens, saying that Newcastle’s survival hopes remain dependent on bringing in additional quality next month.\n\nThis gutsy performance was not enough to convince Benítez that the worst is over. Newcastle are only two points above the bottom three and they had to ride their luck at times, with Rob Elliot’s save from André Ayew’s tame penalty preventing West Ham from making it 2-2 moments after Mohamed Diamé had put visitors in front. Better opponents might have punished their sloppy defending.\n\nOn the balance of play, however, it was difficult to argue that Newcastle were undeserving winners over West Ham, whose revival under David Moyes came to a messy end on a manic afternoon. Marko Arnautovic’s early opener counted for nothing in the end as the home side tumbled to 17th after Henri Saivet and Christian Atsu scored either side of Diamé’s strike. “Totally error‑strewn game,” Moyes said. “We should have capitalised. We didn’t perform well enough.”\n\nThe madness began when Saivet, making his first Premier League start of the season, inexplicably sent a simple pass straight to Arnautovic in the sixth minute. Arnautovic burst forward from the halfway line, with Ciaran Clark exposed, and the Austrian displayed his new found confidence by swerving to the centre-back’s left before clipping a fine shot past Elliot.\n\nYet West Ham were unable to build on Arnautovic’s third goal in his past four games. Saivet, who was having an eventful start, equalised four minutes later. Winston Reid caught Atsu and the Senegalese took advantage of a questionable wall by whipping a low free-kick beyond the cumbersome Adrián.\n\nThe chances kept coming. Michail Antonio spurned two free headers, yet West Ham stuttered in midfield without Manuel Lanzini, who was serving the last match of his retrospective ban for diving, and Newcastle were aggrieved not to be ahead at the interval.\n\nDeAndre Yedlin’s combinations with Matt Ritchie caused plenty of problems down Newcastle’s right. Ritchie curling shot from 20 yards struck a post and the winger created two excellent opportunities for Dwight Gayle, who crashed one against the bar before wastefully scooping the other over.\n\nArnautovic came close to restoring West Ham’s lead shortly after half-time, whipping a shot inches wide from 18 yards. Yet Newcastle were playing with impressive belief and the second goal they had been threatening arrived in the 53rd minute. Atsu skipped past Pablo Zabaleta, nutmegging the defender for good measure, and his cutback found Diamé, whose finish against his former side was emphatic.\n\nThen came a moment of controversy, Antonio latched on to a loose ball and Clark lunged to bring the forward down. Lee Mason, the referee, initially awarded a free-kick, only to point to the spot on the advice of his assistant. “I was watching the replay and I think it is outside,” Benítez said. “The referee was pointing for a foul more than a penalty.”\n\nHowever, Ayew stepped up in the absence of the injured Mark Noble and Elliot made a straightforward save from his casual effort. “We’ve missed one at Everton and here,” Moyes said. “It’s hard enough to get the chances.”\n\nThat was the turning point. Newcastle broke from a West Ham corner, slicing through the home team’s wheezing back three at will, Joselu teeing up Atsu to beat Adrián from close range.\n\nWest Ham refused to lie down and Ayew made up for his earlier profligacy when he pounced after a corner caused confusion in the Newcastle area in the 69th minute. The visitors would not be denied, however, and the noisy travelling supporters finally had something of substance to celebrate."}, {"date": "23/12/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21650, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [35]}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [35], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nahki Wells", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [4], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [7, 69, 79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Foyth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Dele Alli is not going to win any popularity awards this Christmas but Harry Kane just might. A hat-trick here saw Tottenham’s leading scorer equal Alan Shearer’s record of 36 Premier League goals in a calendar year, and he still has Southampton to come on Boxing Day. Yet Alli is becoming the pantomime villain to his team-mate’s Prince Charming. Fresh from his ugly challenge on Kevin De Bruyne last Saturday, he was booked after just four minutes of this game for going in studs up on Charlie Taylor, and was arguably lucky still to be on the pitch when he won the penalty that put his side in front two minutes later.\n\nThe Burnley fans felt so anyway, though as Alli went to ground rather easily to win the spot-kick it was hard to know which incident they were most incensed over. The tackle on Taylor was probably not deserving of a straight red card, while the penalty question, as seems to be the case so often at the moment, was infinitely more debatable.\n\nBurnley v Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nYet though Burnley will bear a sense of grievance the bottom line is that Spurs were the better side, created more chances, and thoroughly deserved to climb above their hosts in the table. But for some extremely poor finishing they might have accomplished their task earlier or more emphatically; as it was goals number 13, 14 and 15 in the league for Kane this season were enough to secure the points. If Kane had been on the end of some of the openings Spurs had passed up earlier, Shearer’s record might have been demolished before Christmas.\n\nKane’s first was from the spot after Alli had made the most of slight contact from Kevin Long in the area. The former referee Graham Poll was on television this past week arguing that players needed to go down for officials to award a penalty, so who is to say he was wrong? The Burnley crowd needed a little more persuading, however, and Alli was heartily booed right up to the moment he was substituted five minutes from the end. “Both decisions were tough for the referee, but I don’t think we should dwell on them,” Sean Dyche said. “Spurs were the better side and Kane was by far the best player on the pitch.”\n\nKane almost had a quick second goal when he rolled a shot narrowly wide from an opening created by Son Heung-min, but Moussa Sissoko was guilty of squandering a glorious chance to put Spurs further ahead midway through the first half. Breaking quickly from defending a Burnley corner, Christian Eriksen picked out Alli near halfway and his pass to put Sissoko into free space behind the Burnley backline was inspired. Unfortunately finishing is not the Frenchman’s forte and, despite having plenty of time and only Nick Pope to beat, all he could manage was a shot against the goalkeeper’s legs. Even when the ball came back to him he could not beat Pope with a second attempt. Burnley’s stand-in goalkeeper deserves credit for a notable double save, though almost any other member of the visitors’ front six would have buried one or other of the opportunities.\n\nStatistics show Burnley are not the best at coming back from behind, and to take anything from this game they needed to create something more promising before Spurs’ superior strike power took its toll. Eriksen almost found Kane at the near post right at the start of the second half, then the Dane himself was presented with a chance on the six-yard line by Son, only to shoot tamely straight at Pope.\n\nSpurs’ superior penetration was in evidence just before the hour when Kane and Serge Aurier engineered a marvellous opening for Son, yet with the goal at his mercy and no more than a well-directed tap-in appearing necessary the Korean blasted the ball high over the bar.\n\nBy the time Kane overhit a pass to an unmarked Eriksen in the area Spurs’ finishing prowess was actually in some doubt and Burnley had had so many let‑offs they could scarcely carry on complaining about the penalty affecting the result. It could not continue and when the normally reliable Ben Mee coughed up the ball to Sissoko in his own half the result was inevitable as soon as the midfielder knocked it into Kane’s path. Composure in front of goal is what Kane does, and he duly slotted a low shot past Pope.\n\nThe hat-trick came 10 minutes later, with another bottom corner finish from Alli’s flick after the Icelander Johann Berg Gudmundsson had lost possession in a dangerous area.\n\nAll that remained was for the home fans to get incensed all over again when Sam Vokes was penalised for barging into Hugo Lloris before heading into the net.

Having seen his Manchester United side come back from conceding the opening goal to lead 2-1 through two strikes from Juan Mata, a last minute lapse of concentration in defence allowed Harry Maguire to snatch a point with the final kick of the match.\n\nUnited had appeared to be coasting when the Leicester substitute Daniel Amartey was sent off for a second booking 16 minutes from time, with Jesse Lingard wasting a golden opportunity to seal the points when he struck a post. But just as it seemed Mourinho’s side would at least keep pace with Manchester City after their record-breaking 17th win in a row, Maguire’s volley at the back post ensured they now face a 13-point gap with half of the campaign completed.\n\nJosé Mourinho rails against players’ ‘childish decisions’ after Leicester draw Read more\n\nThis ground has bad memories for the Portuguese after the 2-1 defeat to Claudio Ranieri’s title-chasers two years ago proved to be the last act in his second spell as Chelsea manager. There have been shades of the manager who lost control so quickly at Stamford Bridge about Mourinho’s demeanour this season and his reaction to the dropping of two vital points was an indication that the pressure being applied by Pep Guardiola’s side is taking its toll.\n\nIt was unclear exactly who he was singling out for the “childish decisions” that he said cost his side so dear but the finger could probably be pointed at Chris Smalling, who was left bamboozled by Riyad Mahrez’s quick feet for Jamie Vardy’s opening goal and was then at fault for allowing Maguire to pounce at the death. Yet the evening could have ended so differently had United been more clinical in front of goal, with Anthony Martial also spurning a great chance just after the break.\n\nIn a week in which they had also crashed out of the League Cup to the Championship side Bristol City, the return of Paul Pogba to Premier League action after his suspension at least gave Mourinho a reason to be cheerful, with the Frenchman captaining the side in the absence of Antonio Valencia – one of only three players to keep his place from the defeat at Ashton Gate.\n\nAfter four straight victories under Claude Puel, Leicester’s bubble had been burst by the surprise home defeat to Crystal Palace last Saturday and the penalty shootout loss to City. Their manager was criticised for starting that game with Vardy and Mahrez on the bench when the competition perhaps represented their best chance of silverware, and Puel reverted to his first choice side for this match.\n\nBut it was United who took the game to their opponents in the opening exchanges. Smalling should have done better with a headed chance from Juan Mata’s centre in the third minute, while Lingard and Pogba tested Kasper Schmeichel with early efforts. But after the initial burst, the visitors began to look laboured going forward, with Romelu Lukaku again struggling to make an impact.\n\nHaving created virtually nothing beforehand, however, it was a classic piece of counterattacking that helped Leicester go ahead. Lingering around the edge of his own penalty area, the England forward pounced on a clearance and laid the ball into the path of Wilfred Ndidi, whose first-time pass sailed over the United defence and into the path of the onrushing Mahrez. The Algerian was forced to check his run slightly but showed great awareness to pause briefly before laying the ball to Vardy on a plate.\n\nTheir joy was short-lived, though, as a canny left-footed finish from just inside the area from Mata after a clever layoff from Lingard meant United headed into the break on level terms. Despite that setback, Leicester persisted with the tactic of sitting deep and attempting to strike out on the break.\n\nLeicester City v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThe strategy almost paid dividends seven minutes into the second half when more brilliance from Mahrez saw him reach the byline, only for Demarai Gray to miss the ball completely when it was played across the face of goal, with David de Gea saving the follow-up from Christian Fuchs.\n\nMartial partially redeemed himself for the miss when he won a free-kick just outside the penalty area and Mata stepped up to curl home his second goal, although Schmeichel will feel he could have done more to prevent the ball finding the net having presented his opponent with a yawning gap to aim at.\n\nAmartey’s second booking, for a reckless bodycheck on Marcus Rashford less than 20 minutes after he had replaced Danny Simpson, seemed to have ended the game as a contest.\n\nBut in the final seconds of injury time, everything fell apart for United. Marc Albrighton’s excellent deep cross picked out the unmarked Maguire at the back post and, having fluffed a great chance earlier, this time the England defender made no mistake, to send United into the Christmas period knowing their hopes of a 21st title are virtually over already."}, {"date": "22/12/2017", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59409, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal",

Arsenal had been abject in the first half. They trailed to Philippe Coutinho’s header and the damage ought to have been heavier. The boos at half-time were loud and angry. Liverpool had been excellent.\n\nTo say that the game was turned upside down inside five second-half minutes would be the understatement of the season. Out of nowhere Arsenal scored three times. Simon Mignolet was horribly culpable on Granit Xhaka’s equaliser but he was merely the lead character in the latest defensive horror show from Liverpool against a leading club.\n\nThe mood inside the Emirates Stadium went from poisonous to party time. Mesut Özil’s third for Arsenal was a cracker. How had this happened? Jürgen Klopp stared into space. It would have been a crime if his Liverpool team had left empty-handed and, mercifully for them, they did not. Emre Can played in Roberto Firmino and, amid more shoddy marking, his shot looped up off Petr Cech’s fingertips before dropping down and in.\n\nArsenal 3-3 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nKlopp lost it. The Liverpool manager hurled his water bottle down and, eyes bulging, yelled in the direction of the Arsenal supporters in his vicinity. It drew a furious response from them and somebody threw a water bottle towards the manager. Klopp would walk over to those fans moments later to hold his hands up in apology. He need not have done. It was an occasion when everybody was dragged through the wringer.\n\nArsène Wenger said he was disappointed not to have won and he managed to keep a straight face while doing so. The flaws in his team were there for all to see until Alexis Sánchez scored to drag them back into it, and he could be thankful to a higher power for those crazy five minutes. Without them it would have been easy to imagine the latest outbreak of mutiny.\n\nThis Wenger team is prone to crashes. Think of the 4-0 defeat at Anfield in August. But they are equally famed for their recoveries. They managed to cram both of the traits into a single 90 minutes.\n\nThat said, this is a time for celebration and it would be churlish not to acknowledge the attacking brio on display – particularly from Liverpool. Firmino set the tone with his energy at the tip of Klopp’s formation but he was ably supported by Mohamed Salah. Coutinho, as usual, was a joy to watch. From an Arsenal point of view Özil’s clipped finish rounded off a lovely team move, which was ignited by Alexandre Lacazette’s beautiful back-heel, and they would doubtless argue they forced the errors from Joe Gomez and Mignolet for their first two goals.\n\nFab Four sparkle but bend Liverpool out of shape in collapse at Arsenal | Jonathan Wilson Read more\n\nLiverpool had arrived on the back of four straight Premier League wins – in which they had scored 16 times – and it seemed as though Arsenal showed them too much respect in the first half. Playing this Liverpool team can resemble a walk in the park with a lion on the loose – generally fine and then, suddenly, not fine at all. They have regularly mauled their opponents on the counterattack and they did so again.\n\nFirmino had twice gone close before James Milner, who had come on for the injured Jordan Henderson, started the move for the opening goal with a ball up the right for Salah. Rather abruptly Liverpool had two on two. Salah’s cross deflected up off Laurent Koscielny and Coutinho, who had burst forward to make the extra man, looped his header over Cech.\n\nThe mood among the home supporters darkened and the remainder of the first half was an ordeal for them. Liverpool could have made the points safe. Firmino curled inches over; Dejan Lovren should have found a team-mate following Coutinho’s chipped free-kick and Cech denied Salah one-on-one after a slip from Koscielny. Sadio Mané scissor-kicked the rebound just over, with Cech grounded.\n\nThe Arsenal fans jeered Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who would come on as a late substitute, on his first return to the club but they turned on their own players when the half-time whistle went. They had not threatened Mignolet’s goal up to that point. It was all too tangled and easy to telegraph from them.\n\nIt would get worse for Arsenal before it got better. Salah had worked Cech on the break before he set off on a run from deep inside his own half, swapped passes with Firmino and curled a trademark finish from outside the area into the bottom corner.\n\nGame over? It certainly looked that way. Instead Arsenal launched their fightback. It was aided and abetted by some dreadful individual errors, the first from Gomez. He did not see Sánchez stealing in behind him to meet Héctor Bellerín’s cross and, when he froze, the Chilean headed home.\n\nWorse was to come. Xhaka’s shot from distance packed a punch but it did not seem to swerve too sharply. Mignolet stuck out a weak hand and he succeeded only in tipping the ball into the corner of his net. The home crowd lost their senses when Özil scored but the last word would go to Firmino."}, {"date": "18/12/2017", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 37580, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cuco Martina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [45], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro Ramírez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikola Vlasic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [35], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roque Mesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [5]}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [37], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Mike van der Hoorn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tammy Abraham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [5], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Renato Sanches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Paul Clement described the penalties that started and completed Everton’s comeback as “clumsy” but it was a touch of class that kept Swansea City rooted to the foot of the Premier League.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin equalised Leroy Fer’s opening goal after Wayne Rooney’s spot-kick had been saved on the stroke of half-time.\n\nThereafter, and without truly impressing, Everton eased to victory.

Now he has got to the level of match fitness we are seeing the best of Gylfi. His own professionalism and his own responsibility is part of that too. The Iceland lads are very proud of where they come from and of playing in the Premier League, I’ve managed a few, and he wants to prove he is worth every penny we paid for him.”\n\nSwansea may have been backed into a corner over Sigurdsson’s transfer and recouped a tidy sum but they are paying the price for his absence. Clement’s side arrived on foggy Merseyside having scored nine league goals all season, the lowest return in England’s top four divisions and as many as Rooney alone had plundered for their opponents.\n\nTheir prospects of reaching double figures appeared even more remote when Wilfried Bony hobbled off after only five minutes and one touch of the ball. Bony’s absence with a hamstring injury was keenly felt earlier in the campaign and they can ill afford a repeat, yet their initial response was encouraging for Clement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wayne Rooney scores with a second-half penalty after missing from the spot in the first half. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images\n\nLuciano Narsingh and Bony’s replacement, Tammy Abraham, had the pace and alertness to punish a languid Everton performance in the first half. Allardyce’s pre-match warning about complacency proved prescient and the home side were extremely fortunate to go in level at half-time.\n\nSwansea deservedly took their Premier League goals tally into double figures when Fer converted Tom Carroll’s corner beyond an exposed Jordan Pickford. Carroll’s delivery from the right eluded a mass of red and blue shirts at the near post. Fer, arriving unmarked behind the bunch, scored with ease from close range.\n\nThe visitors were in control only to give it away when Lennon raced on to Rooney’s flick in first-half stoppage time and was sent tumbling by Mesa’s needless challenge. Clement had no complaints over Jon Moss’s decision. Rooney’s spot-kick was superbly tipped on to a post by Fabianski but the rebound fell perfectly for Calvert-Lewin, who swept the ball past the unfortunate Swansea goalkeeper.\n\nEverton v Swansea City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nEverton’s continued slow tempo in the second half prompted the introduction of Tom Davies for Morgan Schneiderlin and their performance improved almost immediately. Within moments of his introduction the young midfielder picked out Rooney in space and he swept the ball out to Sigurdsson on the left.\n\nThe former Swansea favourite cut inside Kyle Naughton before bending an unstoppable shot around Fabianski and inside the far post. Sigurdsson’s celebrations were restrained while his team-mates revelled in a moment that illuminated an otherwise subdued night.\n\nFrom toiling and trailing, Everton ended the contest comfortably in the ascendency. Swansea’s display, in stark contrast, never regained the spark or threat of the first half. Their meek acceptance of defeat will be a grave concern for Clement. The game was put beyond them by a second penalty, this time awarded for a clip by Martin Olsson on Jonjoe Kenny’s heel as the right-back raced into the box. Replays were inconclusive as to whether the offence occurred outside the area or on the line.\n\nThere was no disputing Rooney’s finish. He went the opposite way to the first spot-kick, so did Fabianski, but the keeper was powerless to prevent the former England captain converting Everton’s seventh penalty award of the season."},

must be even more dispiriting for Manchester United when they play the day after their neighbours have turned in yet another stirring performance, but José Mourinho and his players can at least take some satisfaction from the fact they managed to trim the deficit at the top back to 11 points.\n\nThey made much harder work of it than they should have done, with Gareth Barry’s goal 13 minutes from time forcing United to endure a slightly anxious finale after they had appeared to be coasting at 2-0, but a third successive Premier League away win was eventually chalked off courtesy of the first-half goals that Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard scored.\n\nWhether their win keeps the title race alive is open to debate – and maybe not a very long one given the way that Manchester City are playing at the moment – but Mourinho certainly has no plans to raise a white flag at Old Trafford anytime soon. “We don’t want to go on holidays, we want to play until the last match,” the United manager said.\n\nAll that can be said for now is that United have no margin for error, which is why it was so important that they managed to weather Albion’s late storm. Jay Rodriguez had a chance to snatch an equaliser in those closing minutes, and Mourinho would no doubt have been much more animated had that header from Chris Brunt’s superb cross landed inside David de Gea’s near post.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 1-2 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nMourinho preferred to give credit to Albion for the way the game finished rather than raising any questions about his own players, with the United manager highlighting the home team’s set-piece threat that led to Barry turning the ball over the line after Brunt’s corner had ricocheted off Marcos Rojo. Remarkably, it was Barry’s first goal as a substitute in the Premier League since 1999.\n\nThe introduction of the 36-year-old at the interval was a key factor in a much-improved second-half performance from Albion, with Alan Pardew later admitting that he was guilty of picking the wrong team. Brunt’s arrival from the bench also made a difference and Albion will take some encouragement from the way they finished a match that delivered their first goal since Pardew took over as manager. “That was psychologically important,” Pardew said.\n\nThe harsh reality, though, is that Albion remain second from bottom – they will be propping up the table if Swansea win at Everton on Monday – and their club-record run of matches without a win in all competitions has now been stretched to 17. Next is a trip to Stoke, who are two points and two places above them, and Albion desperately need to come away with something from that fixture.\n\nIt was one of their former players who inflicted the early damage here. Lukaku, who spent the 2012-13 season on loan at Albion, towered above Kieran Gibbs – a mismatch if ever there was one – to nod Marcus Rashford’s inswinging cross beyond Ben Foster and emphatically into the top corner. It was a fine header, although Lukaku chose not to celebrate scoring for the second game running.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gareth Barry scores after a goalmouth scramble for West Brom’s first goal under Alan Pardew. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/West Bromwich Albion FC via Gett\n\n“I think there are two reasons for that,” Mourinho said. “He was a happy kid here and it was here that he exploded in the Premier League. And probably the second thing is, he looks at me and I don’t celebrate, too.”\n\nMourinho put his own subdued reaction down to “experience” and the fact that he has “changed” before promising that he would be charging down the touchline again if his team score a last‑minute winner. In truth, a much bigger concern for him at the Hawthorns was the sight of Antonio Valencia, who is such a reliable performer at right-back, pulling up with a hamstring problem. “It’s what I call a December injury – the accumulation of fatigue,” said Mourinho, who has no idea how long Valencia will spend on the sidelines.\n\nLukaku’s header was actually the first effort on target that either team had produced in a flat opening period, but United quickly followed up that 28th-minute goal with a second. There was an element of good fortune about it as Ahmed Hegazi, the Albion central defender, stuck out his left boot to try to block Lingard’s low shot from the edge of the area, deflecting the ball past Foster, who was left wrong-footed.\n\nRashford and Lingard both had chances to add to United’s lead early in the second half, although Pardew felt the home team should have been awarded a penalty prior to Barry’s goal, when Ashley Young barged James McClean out of the way so that De Gea could gather the ball. Pardew may well have had a point, yet he also accepted that Albion failed to help themselves at times. “You can’t win games unless you have ambition,” he said. “And it was only really when Gareth Barry and Brunty came on that we looked to me like we had the ambition to go and get something.”"}, {"date": "17/12/2017", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10780, "home_team": {"name":

contemplate the reality they are a team only marginally closer to the top of the table than they are the bottom three.\n\nThis was a performance to showcase all that is thrilling about Jürgen Klopp’s side, from Philippe Coutinho’s invention to Mohamed Salah’s bite, from rare poise at pace in midfield to the relentless press which left Bournemouth gasping for breath. The scoreline may have given the impression of a stroll on the south coast, but everything about the victors was blisteringly energetic.\n\nIt was the kind of display to which Klopp will cling in charting a route forward, a standard his team must aspire to reach consistently even if the Premier League title is as good as Manchester City’s already. There are other ways, after all, to make this season a success.\n\nIn Coutinho, Liverpool possessed the game’s most compelling performer, the Brazilian operating nominally from the left of a front three and demonstrating all the jaw-dropping attributes which so attracted Barcelona last summer.\n\nDeflecting interest from the hierarchy at the Camp Nou may become the Merseyside club’s principal objective next month, so dazzling was his performance here: there was a free-kick thumped against the woodwork, a whipped assist for the fourth, and an opening goal of such beauty as to set an upbeat tone.\n\nThe game was approaching the midway point of the first half, with Bournemouth’s spells in possession only ever fleeting, when Coutinho collected from Ragnar Klavan and exchanged passes with the excellent Andrew Robertson on the flank. The forward used the left-back as a decoy at his side as he drove at the home team’s back-tracking defence, the 25-year-old darting inside Simon Francis, bamboozling Lewis Cook, then finishing sharply inside Asmir Begovic’s near post.\n\nThe entire move was played out at breakneck pace. It was his 10th goal of a season that was supposed to have been wrecked by that unfulfilled summer move to La Liga, but there would be regular reminders of his quality on the ball, and the joy he injects into so much of Liverpool’s play.\n\n“It was a nice goal,” Coutinho said through a rather sheepish post-match grin. “Everyone enjoys to play. The manager sometimes changes it, but everyone gives their best and that’s good for Liverpool.”\n\nIt was Sadio Mané’s turn to sit out this rout, the Senegalese unused on the bench while Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Salah had their fun. Opponents are increasingly clued up to the Egyptian’s prowess these days, so impressive has his return to the Premier League proved to date, but few seem capable of nullifying him.\n\nKlopp described Salah’s reward here, with his team’s third just before the interval, as “world class”, as Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain slid a pass down the right for Salah to collect, cut inside Charlie Daniels and Nathan Aké, and find the far corner with a shot. The skill involved was almost implausible, yet made to look matter-of-fact. That, in itself, is an indication of proper pedigree. The fact Salah already has 20 goals from 26 appearances merely emphasises the point.\n\nIn between, the oft-maligned Dejan Lovren had dived in bravely to nod home Firmino’s hook back, Coutinho’s corner having looped up off Georginio Wijnaldum to arc beyond the far post. Daniels might have done better but was frazzled by then, driven to distraction by Salah’s scuttling charges down the flank.\n\nThe left-back would soon succumb to a groin strain, joining the hamstrung Josh King in the treatment room, as Eddie Howe surveyed the wreckage of his team’s performance. There is no great disgrace in losing to such livewire opponents, but the meek manner of the surrender alarmed the management.\n\n“We were well off it, flat, and never got going,” Howe said. “We gifted them possession, made unforced errors, and that left us exposed. That was difficult. There have not been many times since I’ve been Bournemouth manager that I’ve felt quite like this after a match.”\n\nJust as telling, perhaps, was his admission the so-called elite teams “are getting better and stronger, quicker than we are”, leaving the likes of Bournemouth, without a win in six games and with trips to Chelsea and Manchester City in the Carabao Cup and league respectively this week, contemplating a difficult winter spent struggling against relegation.\n\nJermain Defoe did drive against a post from Junior Stanislas’s pass, but it was Liverpool who always carried the threat. Oxlade-Chamberlain, revived in the midfield three, also struck the woodwork before Coutinho’s cross was guided in by Firmino to complete the scoring, allowing Klopp to replace his front three and welcome Adam Lallana’s second cameo of the season.\n\nLiverpool are now 12 games unbeaten in all competitions, which would feel mighty impressive if City were not a speck on the horizon some 18 points away. Regardless, few can live with them when they click. Klopp’s team remain one of the delights of the division.\n\nRomelu Lukaku sets Manchester United on victory path at West Brom Read more"}, {"date": "16/12/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium",

Read more\n\nHe could have scored more than that, as he fluffed a chance in the opening minutes and missed a couple of other efforts later on. But that did not matter because he had already done enough.\n\nBenteke crowned a bright start by heading his side in front in the 19th minute, aided by a wonderful cross by Andros Townsend and dire defending by the hosts. The striker was allowed to amble between Wes Morgan and Ben Chilwell to meet Townsend’s delivery from the right and guide a downward header into the centre of the goal as Kasper Schmeichel was caught out.\n\nIt was the Belgian’s first club goal since May and, by way of celebration, he plugged a finger in each ear, as if to show he was not interested in hearing praise from people who had ridiculed him during his long barren streak.\n\nHe almost gave critics a chance to jab back soon afterwards by coming close to scoring an own goal. Happily for him, his defensive header from a free-kick by Marc Abrighton flew just wide.\n\nHe was quickly back causing problems at the other end. After Riyad Mahrez coughed up possession in midfield, Benteke shrugged off Ndidi and threaded a pass through to Zaha, who feinted his way past Chilwell and fired into the net from 10 yards.\n\nLeicester were booed off at half-time by fans who could not grasp how a team that had been full of energy and ideas in recent weeks could suddenly look so hollow. But Claude Puel left Shinji Okazaki on the bench until the last quarter of an hour despite Leicester’s lack of intensity.\n\nThe hosts created their best chance in the 49th minute but Julián Speroni foiled Mahrez with an excellent save. Then things got worse for Leicester. They had only themselves to blame although they pointed the finger disingenuously at the referee, Martin Atkinson.\n\nVicente Iborra had a goal correctly ruled out for a push on James Tomkins. Then Ndidi was booked for collapsing in the box without being touched by a defender. Coming only nine minutes after he had seen yellow for a foul on Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Ndidi had to go. Not the sort of cards the midfielder had hoped to receive on his 21st birthday but he deserved them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wilfried Zaha lashes home Palace’s second.

His replacement, Sako, rounded off the scoring, finishing nicely from the edge of the area after a pass by Loftus-Cheek.\n\nBenteke’s fortunes were not completely transformed. A booking in the second half will deprive him of the opportunity to build on this performance at Swansea next Saturday. All the same, Hodgson, earning a redemption of his own as he guides Palace away from the bottom, is counting on Benteke making a big contribution to the rest of the season. “His record at Aston Villa was a goal every two games and I wouldn’t be surprised if he matched that here.

But that was the most positive thing you could say about this 1-0 win over a floundering Newcastle side who finished the day in the bottom three. At the final whistle, the most positive emotion you could sense around the ground was relief.\n\nMany of those present had shuffled out to do something rather better with their evening before the end: the PA announcer’s suggestion as the teams trooped off that the highlights of the game would shortly be available on the big screen was not met with any great enthusiasm.\n\nNewcastle’s struggles are to be expected, says Rafael Benítez after loss at Arsenal Read more\n\nA moment of brilliance decided the game, Mesut Özil’s superb first-half volley being wholly unrepresentative of the fare on offer during the other 89 minutes. Beyond that, Arsenal displayed what has broadly been their problem for much of the season, namely not taking any of the chances they create. By the end they were almost clinging on, not the sort of thing you expect with such a gulf in quality.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Özil fires home the only goal. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“We had plenty of chances we didn’t take,” said Arsène Wenger. “We wanted sometimes to force it and maybe it played a little bit on our minds that we hadn’t taken our chances recently. I would have liked it to be a bit more comfortable, but we have played three games in six days.”\n\nAs for Newcastle, their players decided amongst themselves this week that, in deference to their terrible recent results, they would cancel their Christmas party. On this evidence, they look like they could do with a drink.\n\nIt is not that they were dreadful, but this defeat was their eighth in the past nine matches and they are heading in one direction. They desperately need Amanda Staveley’s proposed takeover, and the January additions that it might bring, to happen without further delay.\n\nMarcos Alonso scorcher secures Chelsea nervy victory over Southampton Read more\n\nBenítez emphasised this point after the game, pointing to his side’s youth. But the repetition of his dissatisfaction over the state his squad was left in after the summer does start to wear a little thin when you compare his team with the other promoted sides. Huddersfield and Brighton did not spend excessively but unlike Newcastle neither of them are on a run of one point from the past possible 27.\n\nPerhaps a little surprisingly, the first exchanges were pretty open. Newcastle sat deep and defended tightly, but with enough attacking intent on the counter to suggest that they were not just there to dig in. But it was Arsenal who took the lead, brilliantly, after 23 minutes.\n\nA Florian Lejeune header went only as far as an off-balance Özil just inside the area: a controlling touch seemed like the most sensible, safe option but players such as Özil have the ability to make the safe look foolish. He swivelled on his right leg, languidly swept his left to around thigh-height and sent an exquisite volley into the top-corner. It was as perfect an exhibition of technique as you are likely to see.\n\n“It’s important that he takes the risk to do that,” said Wenger. “Ninety-nine per cent of the time in this position he would control and give the ball to someone else.” When asked if he was confident that Özil would sign a new contract, Wenger offered the verbal equivalent of a slightly tired shrug. “I’m confident, yes: what that means I don’t know,” he said.\n\nArsenal dominated the rest of the half in the sort of laidback way a team in their position tends to, with the expectation that more goals were just around the corner. But none came, despite Héctor Bellerín, Granit Xhaka and Özil all going close.\n\nAaron Mooy strikes twice as ruthless Huddersfield shock Watford Read more\n\nNewcastle were given a little injection of hope after the break. The Arsenal defence, perhaps joining their forwards in the presumption that the three points were in the bag, allowed Jacob Murphy to pick his spot from the edge of the area, but luckily for them Petr Cech had continued to pay attention and saved well to his left.\n\nAs time ticked on and Arsenal failed to find a second, it began to feel as if they were holding on. Newcastle had not offered a huge amount by way of attacking threat but when they did venture forward Arsenal’s failure to kill things off meant nerves spread around the stadium.\n\nNever more so than when Mikel Merino was offered far too much time on the edge of the area, his shot took a deflection, and everyone froze as it skipped just wide of a post. Ayoze Pérez then went close with a header and from what should have been a routine, comfortable win, Arsenal looked as if they were going to, well, be Arsenal about things.

Albion are one of the lowest scorers in the division having found the back of the net just 14 times in 18 matches this season, including only once in their last five fixtures.\n\nThey had numerous opportunities to make a breakthrough against high-flying Burnley with Glenn Murray squandering a first-half penalty, Anthony Knockaert striking a post and Lewis Dunk seeing a header cleared off the line. The out-of-form Seagulls remain without a victory since the first weekend in November and Hughton knows his side must become more clinical in front of goal.\n\nMesut Özil’s moment of brilliance carries lethargic Arsenal past Newcastle Read more\n\n“Particularly when you’re going through your better period in the game, where we certainly did in that first half, in that stage there was only one team likely to score,” he said. “Of course, what happens when you don’t score in that period, it gives the opposition a little bit of a lift. When you miss chances – when you miss a penalty – it gives them a lift.\n\n“They’re a very good side at the moment and you can see why they’re in the form they’re in. We’ve just got to find this formula to get the goals that we need to win matches. [I’m] disappointed because it’s a game we should have won.”\n\nIt was the first top-flight meeting between the two clubs and Hughton made four changes after Wednesday’s defeat by Tottenham. Murray was one of the men recalled and he headed an early opportunity straight at Nick Pope after being picked out by Bruno’s right-wing centre. The striker then blazed over from the penalty spot in the 36th minute after he was adjudged to have been bundled over by the Burnley defender James Tarkowski. Despite the miss costing the home side two valuable points, Hughton refused to blame his top scorer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Under the lights at the Amex Stadium.

The stalemate means the fifth-placed club have taken seven points from their three games during the last eight days without conceding.\n\n“They set about us early in the game and I thought we withstood that pressure well, tactically from the team,” Dyche said. “In the second half, we grew into the game and got stronger.

wondering whether Chelsea have disappointed in defending their title this season, Antonio Conte has some information for them. “In the last 10 games we have won eight, drew only one and lost one game, against West Ham‚” he said. “If someone asks me if I’m ready to sign for these results in the next 10 matches, I’m ready. There is a team winning every game right now, but at the same time you have to concede that other teams are trying their best and in the last 10 games we have done a good job.”\n\nWith Manchester City apparently already over the horizon in the Premier League, Chelsea will at some point have to surrender their title of champions. But there has been no crisis at Stamford Bridge in Conte’s second season and this was a highly professional victory over a Southampton side who delivered a performance that belied their own challenging form.\n\nMarcos Alonso decided the match with a free-kick in first-half injury time. His left-foot strike was delivered with typical precision, bending first outside then inside Fraser Forster’s right post, bouncing at the last moment and arcing over the keeper’s outstretched arm into the net. Conte described Alonso as “a specialist in that situation” before bemoaning a lack of sharpness elsewhere in his side. Chelsea created numerous chances throughout and should have won by more.\n\nSouthampton played with belief and determination despite their slim total of four league wins. They could argue their defensive efforts were just as significant in keeping the scoreline tight and could even have snatched a point had Charlie Austin converted a one-on-one within a minute of coming on.\n\nAnother name on the bench provoked a talking point: Virgil van Dijk was not selected by Mauricio Pellegrino with two weeks until the January transfer window opens.\n\n“It was a difficult game and we were a little bit unlucky in the way that we conceded, during injury time‚” Pellegrino said. “Chelsea created clear chances but the idea was to be in the game till the end and we were there.”\n\nOn Van Dijk, he added: “We had played three games in six days. It’s really difficult to keep the same condition when it’s Wednesday night to Saturday afternoon, with less than three days to recover. I changed a lot of players and Virgil was just one of them.”\n\nSo far, so boilerplate, but when pressed on the issue the Argentinian was unable to confirm the club will reject offers for the Dutch defender, something they did repeatedly during the summer.\n\nVan Dijk is still a target for Liverpool, and Manchester City as well, and Pellegrino said “I cannot control the market and I am not the owner of the player. All I can do is relay my opinion, after that the board can decide what is best for the team. I would recommend to try to keep our best players at the club. The club was quite clear on this at the beginning of the season and I have the same opinion now.”\n\nConte was asked about Van Dijk but did the graceful thing, refusing to comment on another club’s player. He was happier when allowed to air the bee stuck in his bonnet: time-wasting on the part of his opponents. The Chelsea manager was particularly frustrated about the time taken by Forster at his goal-kicks.\n\n“Every time the ball went out it was maybe one minute before the game restarted‚” he said. “It’s important to pay great attention to wasting time. This happened and I hope something can change.” He went on to make a suggestion as to future practice. “To book the goalkeeper early is very important because then the game is faster‚” he said\n\nPerhaps Conte’s time and motion studies came in useful, given that Alonso’s free kick came in the third minute of first-half added time. A late booking for the wing-back means he will miss the midweek Carabao Cup quarter-final with Bournemouth, which also became the object of Conte’s fastidious grumbling.\n\n“For sure I prefer to have all players available and for sure there is a problem because [Davide] Zappacosta is recovering from bad flu,” he said. “But it can happen and we must be ready to overcome this difficulty.”\n\nThe title may be all but gone, but Conte’s footballing obsession endures.\n\nMesut Özil’s moment of brilliance carries lethargic Arsenal past Newcastle Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fraser Forster blocks an effort from Cesc Fàbregas.

Arnautovic had just inflicted a mortal blow – one that provoked apoplexy among the public he used to delight and perplex – upon their hope of blustering something from this game and he took his time to let it all seep in upon being substituted. That earned him a flea in the ear from his former manager, Mark Hughes; it also brought the bonus of a Stoke-coloured garment, perhaps a jumper or an undershirt, thrown in anger from the stand. He collected the gift, walked forward a pace or two and then, unseasonably, threw it casually behind him.\n\nThe home support, who had serenaded him with chants of “One greedy bastard” from the start, consider he treated their club with comparable lack of regard in departing in the summer. Far more pressing now, surely, is the risk Hughes runs of being discarded in the same vein. He had been defended by his chairman, Peter Coates, before this game but even the most kindly of proprietors would be excused some disquiet at what unfolded here.\n\nMark Hughes defiant as fans vent fury at Stoke’s loss to West Ham Read more\n\nStoke can fairly contest the penalty – awarded by Graham Scott for Erik Pieters’ first-half challenge on Manuel Lanzini – that set West Ham on their way but nothing after that was up to standard. With 70 minutes to chase a game, a modicum of discipline should be second nature; instead Stoke lost all cohesion, leaving swathes of space whenever their opponents counterattacked, and should have been far from contention even before the pantomime villain provided his final act.\n\nThat they were not owed mainly to profligate finishing from Arnautovic himself. Beforehand it was reasonable to assume his return could go in one of several different directions, some involving a rush of blood or abdication of discipline. Here he played like a man obsessed with getting on the scoresheet but happy to work for the privilege, feeding from the unremitting venom to tear into Stoke at every opportunity. He worked Jack Butland from an angle before, as half-time approached, blazing over from a better position after perplexing Kevin Wimmer. After the interval he clipped the bar twice, with a looping header and a thudding left-foot shot, and missed the best chance of all after doing the hardest part in cutting inside from the left.\n\nWhen he speared a vicious, angled volley into the side-netting the natural thought was that Stoke, despite the lack of clear chances their spells of pressure had yielded, might make him pay. That almost came to pass when Ryan Shawcross headed a glorious opportunity over the crossbar but the next meaningful action produced the clinching goal. “I told him if he kept going he’d score in the second half,” David Moyes said of Arnautovic afterwards. The Austrian’s one-two with Lanzini bore a resemblance to the combination that broke Chelsea a week previously; Stoke’s defending was even worse than the champions’, though, four players taken out by the chipped return pass and watching their former team-mate jab under Butland.\n\nChristian Benteke sinks Leicester to end Crystal Palace’s away drought Read more\n\nIt was Lanzini whose action, Hughes argued, had turned the game. He had a point. Almost 19 minutes had passed when Shawcross, rising to meet a free-kick, struck Adrián’s left upright with a bouncing header; within seconds West Ham had burst upfield and Lanzini, ferrying the ball down the inside-left tramline, found himself confronted by Pieters. It is possible to see how, at full speed, Scott perceived Pieters had taken Lanzini’s legs away; the forward had angled his body between opponent and ball, and the sliding tackle had made no impact on the latter. But replays suggested Lanzini had dived into Pieters’ challenge and, if the Football Association agrees, then a two-match ban is possible.\n\nMark Noble scored the spot-kick, setting the tone for everything that followed. By the time Diafra Sakho, outfoxing the hapless Wimmer, completed the latest satisfying day’s work for Moyes the atmosphere had turned mutinous; “Hughes out” was the loudest of the chants, and probably the politest.\n\nIt brought to mind the rest of those metaphors. Back at the start of the afternoon, kick-off had been delayed by an hour because of a power cut in the stadium. “Lights out for Hughes?” was the obvious question; “It shows Stoke need a Sparky,” the witty response.

They had gone 738 minutes without a goal in all competitions on the road, but they are no longer weighed down by that unfortunate statistic.\n\nDavid Wagner’s side followed a drought with a deluge, never looking back after Elias Kachunga’s early strike allowed them to feast on Watford’s vulnerabilities on an afternoon of chaos and controversy.\n\nHuddersfield, who scored four in a top-flight game for the first time since 1956, have not had this much fun on their travels since ruthlessly taking Crystal Palace apart on the opening day of the season. Kachunga’s first goal in the Premier League was followed by two for Aaron Mooy and one for the excellent Laurent Depoitre.\n\nThe harsh reality for Watford is that they were fortunate to lose only by three. Marco Silva’s team were appalling, their fate sealed by Troy Deeney’s brainless red card in the first half, and are without a win in five matches.\n\nMarcos Alonso scorcher secures Chelsea nervy victory over Southampton Read more\n\nSilva refused to talk about refereeing decisions once the game had finished, even though Deeney was insistent that he touched the ball when he fouled Collin Quaner in the 33rd minute, and Watford’s manager also chose not to focus on Kachunga and Quaner both appearing to be offside when the former put Huddersfield in front after just six minutes.\n\n“I don’t want people to say: ‘Marco Silva talks about the referee,’” the Portuguese said. “We made mistakes at this level that you cannot make.”\n\nHuddersfield, who are six points above the bottom three, capitalised on those errors. Watford have the worst defensive record in the top half, with 33 goals conceded, and the visitors were bold. Indeed, it spoke volumes for Huddersfield’s dominance when Silva was forced into a tactical alteration in the 29th minute, replacing Adrian Mariappa with Roberto Pereyra and switching from a 3-4-3 system to 4-2-3-1.\n\n“We pressed them very high and were on the front foot and went in their faces,” Wagner said. “We were a threat and it was a deserved result.”\n\nWatford, who struggled in midfield without the suspended Tom Cleverley, were dozing when Kachunga won an early corner. Huddersfield pinned them back, Mooy stabbed a deep ball to the far post from the left and Quaner muscled himself into a shooting position. Heurelho Gomes diverted the forward’s shot into Kachunga’s path and he was a yard out when he ended his team’s long wait for an away goal. The two attackers both looked offside, but the flag stayed down despite Watford’s appeals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watford’s Troy Deeney is shown a red card by referee Michael Oliver. Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images via Reuters\n\nHuddersfield continued to impress after Kachunga went off with a potentially serious knee injury. They defended well, allowing Watford few clear opportunities, and doubled their lead in the 23rd minute. Nobody in yellow tracked Quaner and his cross from the right found Mooy, who bundled the ball past Gomes from close range.\n\nSilva responded by introducing Pereyra, but the Argentinian had been on the pitch for only a couple of minutes when Deeney ended his team’s hopes of a revival with a reckless tackle from behind on Quaner. Michael Oliver sprinted across to show red to Watford’s undisciplined captain, who has already served one suspension this season, and Depoitre scored a third early in the second half, lashing an angled drive past Gomes as José Holebas lay on the turf with a facial injury.\n\nThe mood changed when Jonathan Hogg caught Richarlison and received a second yellow, with Abdoulaye Doucouré belatedly making a game of it when he left Huddersfield’s goalkeeper, Jonas Lossl, rooted to the spot with a magnificent shot from 25 yards.\n\nHowever, Huddersfield made it clear that they are a team with designs on making their stay in the top division a long one when Mooy scored his fourth goal of the season, converting a penalty to make it 4-1 to the visitors after Doucouré fouled Depoitre inside the box. “That we had such a difficult away run, this was extraordinary,” Wagner said."}, {"date": "16/12/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54214, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester

Kane was shown only a yellow for going over the top on Sterling and Alli, who was substituted after another listless performance, was even luckier to get away with a potential leg-breaker on De Bruyne.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kevin De Bruyne feels the force of a studs up challenge from Dele Alli for which he was lucky not to be sent off. Photograph: Manchester City FC/Man City via Getty Images\n\nAlli’s challenge smacked of frustration but De Bruyne chose the best form of retaliation, running away in the next City attack to lash a left-foot strike past Hugo Lloris for the second goal. The same player could later be seen chipping the ball over Danny Rose then running round the other side of his opponent to retrieve it. Guardiola eulogised about the Belgian in the way he used to talk about Messi, Xavi, Iniesta et al and, on this evidence, none of the superlatives felt out of place. It was a joy to watch. De Bruyne is establishing himself as an authentic superstar and perhaps the scariest part for City’s opponents is that, aged 26, he still appears to be improving.\n\nManchester City 4-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFor Spurs, it was a galling reminder of how far they have fallen behind, now an astonishing 21 points off the top, and Christian Eriksen’s left-foot finish in stoppage time was largely an irrelevance. Mauricio Pochettino’s team had a 20-minute spell after half-time when they tested the theory that City’s vulnerability is in the centre of their defence. That apart, however, it was difficult to keep count of the number of times Lloris saved the visitors or Sterling, such an erratic finisher, let them off with his wastefulness.\n\nNo matter. Sterling might have missed a couple of open goals but he still scored twice on a day when City were without David Silva but quickly asserted their authority through Ilkay Gündogan’s 14th-minute goal and can now add Spurs to Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea as teams they have outplayed this season. They have won every league game since 21 August and their next three opponents – Bournemouth, Newcastle and Crystal Palace – are all in the bottom seven.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kevin De Bruyne rifles in Manchester City’s second goal to cap a sublime individual display. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nSilva was missing because of “personal reasons” and there is a reasonable argument that City are never quite as stylish in possession without the man who knits it altogether. Not here, though. Leroy Sané, in particular, seemed intent on making it a challenging afternoon for Kieran Trippier, the Spurs right-back. Gündogan fitted in seamlessly. De Bruyne advanced an already solid case that he ought to be recognised as the outstanding performer in the league and perhaps one day Fernandinho, a player who gets only a sliver of the credit he deserves, might start getting some more acclaim. Agüero was clearly upset to be substituted before the hour-mark, throwing down his gloves, but who can argue with Guardiola’s decision-making right now?\n\nAt one point early on, De Bruyne could be seen misplacing a relatively straightforward pass and it was such a rarity it felt necessary to check with the next person that it had really happened. He did it only once, mind.\n\nMesut Özil’s moment of brilliance carries lethargic Arsenal past Newcastle Read more\n\nDe Bruyne scolded himself for his carelessness and soon afterwards there was a lovely moment when he was running with the ball and Alli came in to challenge him. De Bruyne dragged his studs on the ball to slow it down, then glided away – all in one movement. Once again, City broke forward, as they did so many times after Gündogan’s stooping header had given them a 14th-minute lead from Sané’s corner.\n\nGuardiola’s players were so dominant for the rest of the opening 45 minutes they must have felt aggrieved not to have inflicted any more damage before half-time. There was an improvement from Spurs but their hopes were all but extinguished after De Bruyne made it 2-0 at the end of brilliant counterattacking move from the edge of their own penalty area. Sané set up Sterling at the far post to turn in the third goal and Spurs were in disarray by the time Eric Dier’s mistake let the same player in again. Sterling, who never seems to allow his misses to affect his confidence, pushed the ball through Lloris’s legs and practically walked it into the net.

Rooney’s first-half goal, Rafael Benítez’s suddenly unsteady side were heading for a seventh defeat in eight games. This latest reverse featured some improved performances but Newcastle have now taken only one point from a possible 24 and Benítez clearly did not relish the smile which adorned Sam Allardyce’s face at the final whistle.\n\nBy way of exacerbating the Spaniard’s problems, the recalled Jonjo Shelvey once again failed to merit his manager’s trust. Shelvey’s enduring lack of judgment seemed highlighted when he was sent off for a bad tackle on Idrissa Gueye in the 94th minute which resulted in his second yellow card of the night.\n\nDavid Silva leads latest Manchester City masterclass in win at Swansea Read more\n\nBenítez was suitably disappointed. “We had the game under control but we made a mistake and then the way Everton were wasting time at the end made things really difficult,” he said. “We worked so hard and it’s upsetting but we all, including me, have to take responsibility.”\n\nIn contrast Allardyce presided over Everton’s first away win in the league since January. “A defensive performance which kept Newcastle pretty quiet pleases me very much,” said Ronald Koeman’s successor, whose presence seems to have instantly improved fortunes at Goodison Park. “We move onwards and upwards.”\n\nIronically, Newcastle’s day had begun on a rare high. The pre-match news that Mike Ashley and Amanda Staveley are close to agreeing a price for the sale of the club ahead of a potential takeover being completed at some point in January or February certainly created an air of buoyancy in the stands.\n\nFlattering to deceive, Benítez’s players began in similarly upbeat mode. As Everton struggled to assume possession, let alone string a few passes together, and Newcastle parked their tanks in Allardyce’s penalty area, home fears of a looming relegation battle temporarily appeared overblown.\n\nGiven his long-standing personal rivalry with Benítez – not to mention the small matter of an unhappy eight months in charge here during 2007 and 2008 – this was one fixture Everton’s manager was particularly keen to win, though.\n\nIf Allardyce’s increasingly intense technical area gum chewing suggested a degree of early concern, he was not about to panic. For all Newcastle’s huffing and puffing, the excellent Jordan Pickford was rarely troubled and, almost imperceptibly, Everton began both seeing more of the ball and using it fairly sensibly.\n\nThey weathered an odd scare – most notably when a counterattacking, thoroughly rejuvenated Matt Ritchie hit a post with a blistering left-foot shot – but took the lead after Rooney capitalised on Karl Darlow’s goalkeeping error.\n\nMinutes earlier an unmarked Dominic Calvert-Lewin had been unable to quite connect with Gylfi Sigurdsson’s inviting cross but the striker redeemed himself by crossing for Aaron Lennon to test Darlow’s reflexes with a header.\n\nThe goalkeeper touched the ball and should have held it but instead saw it slip tantalisingly from his grasp, permitting Rooney to slide in, stretch out his right foot and stab home from point-blank range. It was Rooney’s 15th Premier League goal against his favourite opponents.\n\nNewcastle should have equalised when Mikel Merino unleashed a fabulous left-foot shot which rebounded off the inside of a post but, generally, Everton’s off-ball positioning restricted Benítez’s side to half chances.\n\nJürgen Klopp brings back Liverpool top brass but West Brom result stays same Read more\n\nThe Tynesiders were playing considerably better than in recent weeks but although Mason Holgate was forced to scoop Merino’s goal-bound shot to safety they could not sustain a ferocious early second half tempo.\n\nAfter reverting to a single striker system at kick off, Benítez replaced Mo Diame with Joselu but Everton subsequently came closer to scoring when Darlow did well to turn Ashley Williams’s header round a post following Sigurdsson’s fine delivery.\n\nWith Everton’s impressive left-back Cuco Martina largely nullifying Christian Atsu’s pacy right-sided threat and the substitute Nikola Vlasic proving highly effective at knitting visiting counterattacks together, Newcastle started to run out of ideas as their guests increasingly killed time. Then Shelvey got his marching orders. “I’m pretty pleased,” said Allardyce. “We’re rolling forward.”"}, {"date": "13/12/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 27714, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [38], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32, 69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksander Dragovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This time Southampton should be grateful for Claude Puel’s restraint. The Frenchman could have cackled heartily after this win but decided not to take leave of his manners. His team had already made his point in thoroughly satisfying fashion anyway, staging a masterclass in sharp attacking at the expense of the club who sacked him six months ago partly on the grounds that his style was boring. The boos at the final whistle could be translated as English for “touché”.\n\nPuel, determined not to rub his revenge in those faces, said: “Of course it was a strange feeling to come back here but it was nice to see familiar faces. My feeling was always to keep positive with Southampton. I kept a good relationship with a lot of people here. I tried to give my best when I was here and we had some fantastic games and developed some players. For me it was a great introduction to the Premier League and all this work perhaps allowed me to become a better manager.”\n\nDavid Silva leads latest Manchester City masterclass in win at Swansea Read more\n\nThe boos were also a denunciation of Southampton’s ineptitude and they spell trouble for Mauricio Pellegrino. Rather than deliver more thrills, the Argentinian has served up inferior results to the ones Puel produced during his season on the south coast and a lower goals-per-game average. Leicester are eighth in the table which, funnily enough, is the position to which Puel led Southampton last season in addition to guiding them to their first major final for 14 years. Southampton are eight points below Puel’s side and fretting about the possibility of sinking lower.\n\n“I have to say sorry to our fans because you can lose games but not in this way,” said Pellegrino, who said his side’s haplessness came as a shock after the weekend’s encouraging draw with Arsenal. “This performance surprised everybody. It was not about tactics or a technical problem, we were really bad from beginning to end.”\n\nThat was slightly harsh. Because Southampton started as if intent on proving their attacking capability and they made a convincing case for about two minutes. A couple of corners put the visitors in early difficulty, with Maya Yoshida nearly forcing the ball over the line from one. But then Leicester took over.\n\nRiyad Mahrez opened the scoring in the 10th minute, firing a low shot into the net from 25 yards. It was his fourth goal since the appointment of Puel and his gleaming play here was not confined to goal-scoring, as he teased his opponents with beguiling runs and cunning passes. Soon after the Algerian’s goal Shinji Okazaki attempted a cover version but Southampton’s goalkeeper, Fraser Forster, was back on song. When Okazaki beat the goalkeeper in the 22nd minute, Mario Lemina whacked the ball off the line.\n\nJürgen Klopp brings back Liverpool top brass but West Brom result stays same Read more\n\nNot until the half-hour did Southampton’s lone striker, Charlie Austin, get a sniff but Kasper Schmeichel batted his shot from the edge of the area. Leicester raced down the other end and almost scored, Forster denying Jamie Vardy. Mahrez pulled the ensuing corner to the edge of the box where Christian Fuchs met it with a thumping volley. Forster parried the shot but Okazaki poked in the rebound. “Boring, boring Leicester,” chanted the away fans, followed by the mocking inquiry: “Are you glad you sacked Puel?”\n\nMoments later those fans were celebrating again as the home defence folded in the face of a routine free-kick lofted into the box by Mahrez. Harry Maguire took it down on his chest and teed up Andy King, who was free to tap in from close range.\n\nPellegrino, knowing he had to do something to save face and perhaps also his job, switched to a two-pronged attack for the second half, replacing Oriol Romeu with Manolo Gabbiadini. But Leicester continued to tear through their hosts.\n\nEventually Southampton stammered a retort when Yoshida headed in from a corner by Ryan Bertrand.

If Pep Guardiola’s side do indeed, as he believes, have so much more to give, it is going to be a joy to witness. For Swansea, who remain rock bottom, this was the harshest of reality checks after defeating West Bromwich Albion here five days ago.\n\nManchester City’s 15-win record illustrates team’s desire, says Guardiola Read more\n\nPaul Clement had warned his players there was no margin for error against free-scoring opponents such as these and they did not help themselves, repeatedly gifting the ball to a Manchester City side so slick in possession. When the visitors had it, Swansea simply could not get it off them. “It wasn’t nice to see that, but if you’re a Manchester City supporter it must be a pleasure,” Clement said. “To be on the receiving end of that was very difficult. I would say they are one of the best sides I have ever come across.”\n\nGuardiola made four changes from the side that won the derby against Manchester United on Sunday but this was same old swashbuckling City, with Bernardo Silva, in particular, excelling on his return. He easily wriggled free of Jordan Ayew before teeing up Agüero to nod on to the roof of Lukasz Fabianski’s goal before another superb left-foot delivery supplied David Silva, captain in the absence of Vincent Kompany, for City’s inevitable opener in the 27th minute. The Swansea defence, though, allowed David Silva far too much time and space inside the six-yard box to prod home.\n\nSeven minutes later it was 2-0, when De Bruyne fired a free-kick low beyond Fabianski, who was deceived by the ball’s thudding bounce en route to goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kevin De Bruyne’s free-kick beats the Swansea defence and Lukasz Fabianski to put Manchester City 2-0 up. Photograph: Kieran McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThere was a warm embrace between Guardiola and his assistants Domènec Torrent and Mikel Arteta, wearing a woolly hat fresh from his brush-up in the Old Trafford tunnel, but these celebrations were decidedly low-key. “There are no problems this time,” Guardiola said with a wry smile in his post-match press conference.\n\nSwansea were desperately short of quality although Wilfried Bony, at least, relished the physical battle with Eliaquim Mangala, a one-time City team-mate. But the hosts looked and played like a team bottom of the table, bereft of confidence despite that win here last weekend, typified by Martin Olsson and Tom Carroll running the ball straight out of play. The latter was unsurprisingly taken off at half-time, and replaced by Tammy Abraham.\n\nRomelu Lukaku strikes as Manchester United beat Bournemouth Read more\n\nAbraham barely had time to take off his tracksuit bottoms when David Silva fired narrowly past Fabianski’s post in pursuit of a third just after the interval. Swansea puffed out their chests for a moment but it was soon again one-way traffic. Bernardo Silva, who ran rings around Olsson all night, played in Agüero who forced Fabianski into a smart right-handed stop.\n\nFor City, a third goal was only a matter of time, and when Sterling sped into the box, jinking inside Kyle Naughton, there was David Silva to take on the baton, holding off Roque Mesa – too frightened to fell his countryman – before dinking the ball in for his fourth goal of the season.\n\n“He [Silva] is a real leader – he never hides on the pitch,” Guardiola said. “I am so happy, we have always spoken about him scoring more goals but he has absolutely everything – sometimes he was thinking more the pass. He scored the winning goal at Old Trafford and now two more goals. We cannot just depend on just Gabriel [Jesus] or Sergio. We are scoring goals from set pieces again, and we have many options to score goals and that is so important for us.”\n\nJürgen Klopp brings back Liverpool top brass but West Brom result stays same Read more\n\nThis was cruise control for City, with Guardiola happy to withdraw Fernandinho on the hour. Kyle Walker was rested altogether, with the towering Danilo ably filling the void at right-back. Jesus, too, was kept fresh for Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. An episode of City keep-ball shortly afterwards was equally galling for Swansea, though they would have scored but for some Ederson heroics, with the wrongfooted City goalkeeper getting two hands to Roque Mesa’s fierce deflected effort from the edge of the area.\n\nBut City were largely untroubled, basking in victory by then. Guardiola introduced Oleksandr Zinchenko, handing the 20-year-old Ukraine international his league debut. Then came Ilkay Gündogan, replacing the again imperious De Bruyne.

Frustration was chief among them on the night Albion set an unwanted club record of 16 games without a win while climbing out of the relegation zone.\n\nFor the second time in four days Liverpool were held at home by a well-drilled defensive unit and Klopp confronted a referee on the final whistle. His team had been on the wrong end of a crucial call once again, with Dominic Solanke having a late goal disallowed for handball, although the Liverpool manager confirmed he approached the referee, Paul Tierney, to complain about the amount of injury time as well as to discuss the substitute’s 82nd-minute effort. Dejan Lovren penalty outrage it was not.\n\nSolanke thought he had scored his first Liverpool goal when Joe Gomez’s low cross deflected off Ahmed Hegazi, struck him on the chest and then a raised arm en route to Ben Foster’s goal. Tierney and his assistant decreed otherwise, and rightly so. Alan Pardew’s side rode their luck on occasion but worked tirelessly and defended expertly for a point on the night they set the longest winless streak in the club’s 139-year history.\n\n“I looked along the line and the assistant didn’t move, which usually says something is amiss,” the Baggies new manager said. “After it has hit Ahmed, Solanke has swung an arm, it’s hit him and gone in. It is a brave call for an assistant referee to make that in front of the Kop; the right decision but still a brave decision. Maybe it was the slice of luck we deserved.”\n\nKlopp claimed the ball had struck Solanke’s chest but was unsure about the arm. The Liverpool manager said: “I’ve seen a few replays, there’s an arm, but I’m not sure he touches the ball. I’m not sure. I’m sure it’s not on purpose. It must be a really good assistant that made the decision. He will be happy if there was a hand involved. That’s another moment where we had no luck.”\n\nA Solanke shot that was cleared off the line by Hegazi moments later was another although, to use Klopp’s words, this was a “stiff” and “static” Liverpool performance. Their “rotated four” – Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino, Emre Can and Georginio Wijnaldum – were back in the starting line-up after being benched against Everton. The rest did not inspire an urgent or incisive display and Klopp spent much of the first half imploring his front two, Firmino and Mohamed Salah, to switch places more frequently to break an Albion defence marshalled superbly by Jonny Evans. Alongside him Hegazi was also commanding.\n\nSalah pierced Pardew’s back-line with an exquisite diagonal ball across the Albion penalty area towards Firmino. Allan Nyom’s failure to intercept offered the Brazilian a clear sight of goal but his first-time shot sailed beyond both Foster and the far post. That was as close as Liverpool came to breaking the deadlock before half-time. Salah was a foot away from connecting with an inviting cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold that sailed behind Hegazi, his international team-mate, and Coutinho shot straight at Foster from distance.\n\nOtherwise Liverpool’s attacking play lacked its usual urgency and rhythm with Sadio Mané struggling to get involved. Albion, though reverting to a back six at times, did not sit deep for the entirety of the contest and struck the bar when Hal Robson-Kanu curled a 25-yard effort over Loris Karius, deputising for Simon Mignolet, who suffered a swollen ankle against Everton.\n\nThe visitors were also a threat from Grzegorz Krychowiak’s set-pieces. Claudio Yacob forced Karius to save well with a glancing header from a corner by the impressive Poland midfielder – “he showed his international class,” said Pardew – and Hegazi should have done better with another delivery to the back post.\n\nRomelu Lukaku strikes as Manchester United beat Bournemouth Read more\n\nThereafter it was back to absorbing Liverpool pressure for Albion.

They claimed victory but José Mourinho’s side are misfiring as their cross-town rivals continue to coast, winning a record 15th consecutive match at Swansea City.\n\nThe anomaly about this performance and the virtual no-show on Sunday is how Arsenal were taken apart at their own ground by United in the preceding match. But the requisite quality is lacking for them to consistently dominate.\n\nUnited are 11 points behind City. Of the title race, Mourinho said: “If it is over now I go on holiday to Brazil or Los Angeles.”\n\nMourinho also has concerns over Eric Bailly. The centre-back has not played since 5 November, having injured an ankle on duty with Ivory Coast. The manager is hopeful he will not be ruled out for the rest of the season. “I don’t want to be pessimistic, I want to leave it with the doctor,” the Portuguese said.\n\n“I think it’s serious. We are trying a conservative treatment but if the conservative treatment does not work he might have a surgical procedure. Probably the doctor can inform, it is not a problem for me [for the doctor to clarify] – I don’t want to speak about it. But today we played with [Chris] Smalling and [Phil] Jones, [Victor] Lindelof on the bench, Marcos Rojo is injured but nothing really big. During the season we have problems with central defenders, but Chris Smalling is playing amazingly well, so we are fine.”\n\nDavid Silva leads latest Manchester City masterclass in win at Swansea Read more\n\nMourinho also faced questions over the continued absence of Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who was a left out of the squad for a seventh time in the past eight matches. Asked to explain the forward’s omission, the manager said: “I can only have six players on the bench and I try to have some balance. I have Ashley Young to cover the wing and full-back position, [Ander] Herrera is a midfield player, Zlatan [Ibrahimovic] is a striker, [Marcus] Rashford is a second striker and a winger. To have Mkhi means I don’t have one of them and I believe the others deserve to be there.”\n\nBoth Mourinho and Eddie Howe made four changes. For United out went Rojo, Young, Herrera and Rashford and in came Luke Shaw, Phil Jones, Scott McTominay and Juan Mata. For Bournemouth, Dan Gosling, Harry Arter, Adam Smith and Callum Wilson replaced Steve Cook, Lewis Cook, Andrew Surman and Jermain Defoe.\n\nThe visitors were bright in a high‑tempo start. United had a fluid look, with Lingard once more the No10 and with Mata flitting around from his right-hand berth.\n\nWilson’s pace appeared Bournemouth’s best hope of turning United and he forced a first corner by leaving Jones on his backside. The ensuing play led to another Bournemouth corner, then a prolonged passage of pressure from the visitors. This climaxed in Gosling selling Shaw a dummy and firing at David de Gea, who beat the ball away.\n\nOn 25 minutes United struck via Romelu Lukaku. Anthony Martial moved along the left and fed Mata. The Spaniard lifted the ball into the area and United’s No9 rose to head past a leaden-footed Asmir Begovic. Puzzlingly, there was next to nothing of a celebration from Lukaku for what was only his third goal in 15 games, and his first in five in the Premier League.\n\nLater, Lukaku went on a run that was halted, and United were twice caught offside when in threatening positions, as the half fizzled out.

Still, a sprightly run and cross down the right from Lukaku was encouraging, and Martial made a similar move along the left flank. The Frenchman next pinged a ball in to Lukaku whose touch teed up Mata for a first-time effort which was blocked.\n\nUnited’s problem was a lack of conviction where it matters: in front of goal.

this should have been a red card, claiming an 18th‑minute challenge on Nathan Ake also deserved a booking. “He should have been off the pitch,” Bournemouth’s manager said.\n\nUnited managed to cling

Brighton & Hove Albion. The visitors gave their all and were in turn given full respect by their hosts, but a wonderful fluke from Serge Aurier and a Son Heung-min header late in the second half ultimately left them coming up short.\n\nChris Hughton’s best-laid plans went awry thanks to a cross that went under the bar; Aurier’s looping ball from the touchline evading the fingertips of Matt Ryan in the 40th minute. It was the game’s decisive moment. Up until that point Brighton had largely kept Spurs at arm’s length. But they had expended a lot of energy trying and, in the end, a 2-0 scoreline felt about right.\n\nDavid Silva leads latest Manchester City masterclass in win at Swansea Read more\n\n“Yes of course, a bit of luck helps a lot,” Pochettino said after the match. “You know that when the opposition is so close and so deep and want to play only to defend it is not easy. I think the team created a lot of chances and deserved to score before, but that is football. I am so happy, very pleased for the victory and then the performance.”\n\nPochettino insisted he was not criticising his opponents. “I am not going to complain about how another team plays,” he said. “I need to think about how to help my players, how to help them to make the right space.”\n\nIt appeared, however, that he had altered his approach to try to crack the Brighton nut. In the first half set-pieces were rarely taken directly, and were instead pushed to the edge of the box for shots or shorter, faster crosses. In possession, too, there were more crosses and more shots, an apparently determined attempt to force deflections which might knock the Brighton defence momentarily out of shape.\n\nWhen it came to the opening goal, nothing could be done because it was not deliberate. It sprang out of a moment of wonderful skill, Aurier fooling José Izquierdo with a feint before driving his cross up over Ryan and into the far post. Son’s second came in the closing moments of the match, a stooping header at the near post from Christian Eriksen’s free-kick. Harry Kane hit the post with his own dead ball just minutes before that but had Tomer Hemed done better with a close‑range effort in the 70th minute, itself the result of a deflection, the game might have panned out very differently.\n\nChris Hughton’s team now have just two points from the past six matches but they still find themselves in 13th position with home games against Burnley and Watford next.\n\nRomelu Lukaku strikes as Manchester United beat Bournemouth Read more\n\n“We’re a newly promoted team and we went through a really good period,” Hughton said. “Now, results-wise, we’re in a difficult period.\n\n“What we have to accept is that this is going to happen in a season and what defines you is how you come through it. Hopefully we’ve seen enough positives tonight to take forward.”\n\nFor Spurs, the positives were the energy of Erik Lamela, who lasted 74 minutes on his first start since last year, and the physical determination with which they went about their task.\n\nThey will need all that and more on Saturday when they travel to the Etihad Stadium to face the record-breaking Manchester City, but Pochettino was in typically blithe mood when asked about the challenge (although notably less so when asked how Dele Alli had felt about being left on the bench for this match).\n\n“Look, I am so positive,” the Tottenham manager said of the Manchester City game. “I am a positive person, I am so happy because we won and the three points are so important for us.\n\n“What is going to happen on Saturday?

heartbeat.\n\nIt was shocking to see how Arsène Wenger’s team lost not only the ball but their structure and when Mark Noble produced a rare moment of quality with a slide-rule pass for Javier Hernández, the scene was set for the West Ham United substitute to steal all three points. Hernández’s shot hit the underside of the crossbar before bouncing down and away. Petr Cech appeared to have got his fingertips to it.\n\nWhat a steal it would have been. West Ham had offered next to nothing as an attacking force and it is difficult to see the club’s support grinning and bearing this sort of fare on a regular basis.\n\nBut it was a night when the result mattered more than the performance and, for the second time in five days, David Moyes departed the London Stadium with something to cherish. After the victory against Chelsea, this hard-fought point hinted at momentum under the new manager.\n\nHad Hernández’s shot been slightly lower, Moyes’s game-plan would have been vindicated and Wenger would have been pressed to the depths of despair. All the frustration belonged to the Arsenal manager. Against the ranks that West Ham massed behind the ball, his team pressed on to the front foot but they could not find a way through.\n\nThey had plenty of possession on the fringes of the West Ham area but they were frequently too narrow and they struggled to pick the killer pass. It seemed quintessentially Arsenal.\n\nDavid Silva leads latest Manchester City masterclass in win at Swansea Read more\n\nWenger lamented the lack of ruthlessness, which he suggested was a hangover from the Manchester United defeat on the Saturday before last. On that occasion his team had 33 shots but they could only score once. Here, they had 22 but only three of them were on target. The harsh truth was that Arsenal ran out of ideas in the final third while the Koscielny-driven implosion at the end hinted at their fragility.\n\nArsenal’s away-day woes go on and it is now three Premier League matches without a win for them. They lag seventh in the table – a point and a place below Burnley.\n\n“I felt that the chances we missed against Man United have had an impact on us,” Wenger said. “I don’t deny we showed a lack of sharpness. It was 10 against 10 in the final third and we could not find an opening. West Ham are in a highly focused defensive phase and it works for them at the moment. We must continue to focus on the quality on our game and not on being ruthless. It will come back for us if we don’t make too much of a problem of it.”\n\nWenger had started with a back four for the first time since the Crystal Palace disaster last April and with three central midfielders, his team dominated the ball. Jack Wilshere had a decent enough game on his first league start in Arsenal colours for 577 days.\n\nWest Ham were happy to allow Arsenal to come on to them because they believed that they could land punches on the counterattack and Moyes’s 3-5-2 often became 5-3-2. But the performance was marked by discipline and organisation.\n\nThe first half drifted by with little in the way of penalty box action. The West Ham forward, Marko Arnautovic, had an early header correctly ruled out for offside while the closest to a breakthrough was Alex Iwobi’s touch and quick unload on 29 minutes. The Arsenal winger’s low shot hit the outside of the near post.\n\nWest Ham United 0-0 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nArsenal pushed in the second half and the game seemed to distil into a single issue. Would Wenger’s team summon a moment of ruthlessness in front of goal? They did not. Mesut Özil prodded wide, Wilshere lifted over when well-placed and Alexis Sánchez was denied by Adrián from a free-kick. Had Hernández finished after Koscielny’s aberration, it would have been even for the visitors.\n\n“We are trying to change the mood and the results have given us a good platform,” Moyes said. “I would have taken four points against Chelsea and Arsenal, and we were unlucky in the game before at Manchester City. There have been good signs, although performances will have to change because we will be playing different opposition. We now need to take it on to the next level.”"}, {"date": "12/12/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19909, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [],

“It’s just slightly less than 43 years,” he said. “I’m proud of it. The proudest man in Proudsville. I’m proud of all of it. It’s about the next game. Football is about realities but also about dreams. It’s a tough task for us winning games at this level but Leicester blew the roof off dreams in football [by becoming champions in 2016] – there’s no bold statement from me on that. We’re having a real go at what we can achieve this season.”\n\nThe defeat for Stoke, who remain in 15th place, piles more pressure on Mark Hughes, who was booed by his owns fans near the end after taking off Xherdan Shaqiri for Eric Choupo-Mouting.\n\nThe manager acknowledged the unrest. “There’s a little bit of dissent, we understand it,” he said. “It’s been there a number of months, you only keep it down if you win football matches. That’s the only way to keep the noise down. The message to the players is: ‘Give me that every time we play and we’ll be fine.’”\n\nLooking ahead to Saturday’s home match against West Ham, the manager added: “We have to stick our chests out and get some points. I’m looking forward to the weekend already because I think you’ll see more of the same.”\n\nFor this game Dyche picked an unchanged side from the 1-0 win over Watford. Hughes, though, reacted to the 5-1 defeat by Tottenham by making three changes, with Ramadan Sobhi, Peter Crouch and Geoff Cameron coming in for Thomas Edwards, Kevin Wimmer, and Choupo-Mouting.\n\nInside three minutes Crouch might have given Stoke the lead. Sobhi drifted in from the left and crossed, James Tarkowski flapped, and Nick Pope had to beat the danger away via his left-hand post with Crouch ready to pounce.\n\nThis was sloppy from the Clarets, who were soon caught out again. Shaqiri swung in a corner from the left and as Burnley ball-watched Kurt Zouma had time to volley but his effort was straight at Pope, who gathered the ball.\n\nGradually, Dyche’s men settled and started to enjoy more possession and just before the half hour won their first corner.

How could they not when after spluttering in arrears for almost the entire match, blunted and diminished by an imposing Watford team, they still plucked an improbable win from the jaws of defeat?\n\nThe din which erupted in the second minute of injury time was a roar to greet the first gasp of air this team have enjoyed above the relegation zone all season. Conviction is flooding back.\n\nThere were inevitable parallels to be drawn with the post-match mood after Saturday’s fluffed late penalty and Roy Hodgson was rightly still preaching caution as he considered what is to come following a six-match unbeaten run.\n\nAshley Barnes’ late strike against Stoke sends Burnley soaring into top four Read more\n\nBut, as the manager put it, “it’s gone from sadness to euphoria” within a few tense days. A team who had started the season by granting all-comers a seven-match start, and are still to register a goal on their travels since April, are fourth from bottom for now at least.\n\nThe outpouring of emotion at the end owed much to the unlikely nature of this latest comeback. Watford had been superb throughout a one-sided first half. Every second ball was theirs, every set piece viciously delivered. Richarlison ran riot, spreading panic across Palace’s backline whenever he marauded forward. He set up the opener, nodded home by an unmarked Daryl Janmaat, and squared for Troy Deeney to score a second only for the captain to skew the simplest of chances wide, distracted by Scott Dann’s faint touch. Yet it hardly seemed to matter. While Watford’s discipline remained, markers swarming all over Wilfried Zaha whenever he collected his possession, their grip on the game was like a vice.\n\nTom Cleverley’s dismissal six minutes from time for two fouls loosened the stranglehold and would transform the match. Zaha had cut an enraged figure up to then, distracted in a constant whinge at the officials as Adrian Mariappa or Christian Kabasele snapped at his heels. The referee had taken Dann to one side to warn the Palace captain his team’s talisman was talking his way into the book.\n\nYet as the second half ran its course, the striker hoisted himself out of his sulk and became a man possessed. Thrust back into his favoured role on the flank, it was Zaha who cut inside to forced Heurelho Gomes to push out a fizzed low shot. The goalkeeper recovered to block the follow-up from Bakary Sako but was unable to keep out the substitute’s second attempt. Three of Palace’s four shots on target came in that one incident.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bakary Sako makes it 1-1 in the 89th minute. Photograph: Dan Weir/PPAUK/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe fourth was reserved for stoppage time. Zaha, suddenly liberated from his markers with Watford unnerved, tore at Janmaat, dizzying the Dutchman before reaching the by-line. The cut-back was accurate and converted emphatically by another replacement, James McArthur. The celebrations betrayed a team who had barely believed this was possible, despite the late recent salvation of points against West Ham and Stoke City.\n\nChelsea bounce back with comfortable win over Huddersfield Town Read more\n\nHodgson, who has organised and eked points from a team who had appeared forlorn when he arrived, could not have scripted this more outlandishly, other than to have Christian Benteke, the scoreless striker who had missed that late penalty against Bournemouth, come up with the winner. “But he still did something quite incredible in the last minute, chasing a ball down back to Gomes and forcing him into a poor kick out of play, which effectively killed the game for us,” said the manager. “When you’re a coach, those little moments mean a lot. It gives you a bit of pleasure.”\n\nFor his opposite number, there was no such consolation. Marco Silva, relegated with Hull on his last visit here, had been mugged this time round and was left to curse the profligacy that undermined Watford’s dominance. Julian Speroni had marked his 400th Palace appearance with a smart save with his legs to deny Richarlison. At the time, it did not seem an overly significant a moment, only for a familiar late capitulation to cost Silva’s side. No team have as many red cards since the start of last season. Just as at Everton, where they had led by two, they were overrun at the last.\n\n“But it’s not because of Tom we lost this game,” Silva said. “At this level you have to kill the game off when you can.”\n\nThe ludicrous nature of the finale had left him numbed.

west Yorkshire after hearing their manager admit Manchester City might be uncatchable, yet in the event Chelsea played like champions.\n\nHuddersfield were outclassed, indeed a little fortunate not to be embarrassed, once Chelsea got into their smooth, attacking stride. “The best team we’ve seem here all season” was one opinion expressed over the PA at half-time, which is quite a compliment considering City have already been to these parts and won.\n\nHuddersfield Town 1-3 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nEden Hazard and Willian were the men Huddersfield found most difficult to pin down, though it was the visitors’ width and intelligent use of space that left the home side chasing shadows. The range and direction of Chelsea’s passing was almost unanswerable at times.\n\n“To win like that will improve our confidence, I think my players enjoyed it,” Conte said. “Don’t forget that Huddersfield won against United and made City struggle. We are in a good patch, we have only lost one game in nine, but one team is going to be very difficult to stop. When a competitor wins 15 of 16 games it is not easy to keep thinking positive. It doesn’t mean we are going to stop trying, it just means I prefer being realistic.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Willian heads in Chelsea’s second on a night when he also created his side’s other two goals. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nIt took a while for Chelsea to adjust to the injured Álavro Morata’s absence. Hazard was only notionally operating as the central forward in the front three and after a cagey opening period it was a series of unforced errors in the Huddersfield defence that led to the first goal. First Mathias Zanka put his goalkeeper under slight pressure with an awkward back-pass, then Jonas Lössl slipped in the act of clearing the ball and only sent it 40 yards upfield to Victor Moses. The wing-back instinctively headed it back and the neatest of touches from Hazard supplied Willian.\n\nFrom then on it was the slickness with which Chelsea exploited the tiniest amount of uncertainty in the Huddersfield defence that was impressive. Willian waited as Tiémoué Bakayoko set off on a curving run into space behind Zanka, then picked him out perfectly for the midfielder to complete an incisive move with a composed finish from a narrow angle. “A sloppy goal to concede when we were trying to frustrate Chelsea,” David Wagner, the Huddersfield manager, said. “We had to overperform and we didn’t.”\n\nThe knowledge that Chelsea could rip through them from virtually a standing start seemed to daunt the home side a little and they spent the rest of the first half in defensive mode. Hazard might have created something when he cut in from the left but there was no one in the middle to meet his inviting low cross, then when N’Golo Kanté had a shooting opportunity just before the interval his attempt from the edge of the area flew miles too high.\n\nAshley Barnes’ late strike against Stoke sends Burnley soaring into top four Read more\n\nBakayko also had a chance to increase Chelsea’s lead when he put a header narrowly wide from Willian’s free kick – Hazard’s trickery on the ball had exasperated Jon Hogg and Zanka to such an extent that the latter brought him down.\n\nHuddersfield badly needed to reach the dressing room without conceding again, if only to regroup and regain their composure, and they fell short by a couple of minutes. César Azpilicueta hit a marvellous crossfield pass to find Marcos Alonso in space on the left wing, in so much space that looking up and picking out Willian for a free header in front of goal was almost a formality. While it was the type of goal that looked as if it ought to have been defended better, the sheer accuracy of Chelsea’s passing was giving Huddersfield little time to react.\n\nThe home side could even have turned round three goals in arrears but for Lössl doing well to save from Pedro after Hazard had given his fellow forward a clear sight of goal. In the circumstances the pitchside announcer’s joke about Chelsea having earned their half-time hot-water bottles fell more than a little flat. “What should we do now?” the former manager Peter Jackson was asked on the pitch during the break. “Panic,” he replied. “We’ve got to try and make the Chelsea goalkeeper make a save.”\n\nCrystal Palace’s Bakary Sako and James McArthur strike late to stun Watford Read more\n\nThat sentiment was still true five minutes into the second half, when Pedro atoned for his earlier profligacy by extending the lead to three. Once again Alonso had found space to cross from the left, Chris Schindler failed to gain anything like enough distance with his clearance and Pedro rifled the loose ball high into the net.\n\nTom Ince did bring a save from Thibaut Courtois after an hour, before Hazard’s last act of the evening was a backheel that should have resulted in another goal for Pedro, but he could not keep his effort on target.\n\nThat was about the extent of Chelsea’s generosity until the substitute Laurent Depoitre headed Florent Hadergjonaj’s cross past a furious Courtois in the final seconds of stoppage time, but

Pellegrino caught Wenger cold with his approach, with Southampton using a back four when they had the ball and switching to a wing-back system when they had to defend. James Ward-Prowse made the extra man at the back on the right. Arsenal’s shocking looseness also contributed.\n\n“I felt that the Manchester United game played a bit of a part in the heads of our defenders,” Wenger said. “They were again a bit apprehensive to start well. That’s why sometimes it’s not too good to talk about a problem because you create an even a bigger one.”\n\nDusan Tadic found space early on and it was the attacking midfielder who ushered in Austin for the breakthrough. Per Mertesacker, who had come into the Arsenal back three for the injured Shkodran Mustafi, was guilty of a stray pass and Austin sent it forward first time for Tadic. He had worked himself goalside of Mertesacker and, when Austin continued his run, Tadic found him. Austin took a touch to set himself before finishing with the outside of his right boot.\n\nSouthampton 1-1 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAustin had scored goals against Arsenal during his time at Queens Park Rangers and he was in the mood here. Tadic played him through in the fifth minute but, from a slight angle, he watched Petr Cech plunge to his right to make a save while Austin rattled the upright shortly afterwards from Nathan Redmond’s cross only to be pulled back for offside. Moments earlier, after Héctor Bellerín had given the ball away, Austin was fractionally offside as he burst through.\n\nArsenal stabilised. Lacazette came into the game as the first half wore on and he was at the heart of a counterattack that followed an overhit Southampton corner. Bellerín made the final pass for him but Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg stretched to make the saving challenge and prevent what would have been an ugly inquest.\n\nCech had to be alert to punch clear a Ward-Prowse free-kick that swirled on the breeze but Arsenal might have equalised on 33 minutes when Sánchez cut the ball back for Aaron Ramsey. The midfielder’s right-footed first-time connection was sweet and the ball flew towards the near corner. Fraser Forster got down sharply to save. Lacazette also shot high before the interval from Bellerín’s cutback.\n\nThe feeling nagged that Southampton could live to regret their failure to capitalise more fully on their early purple patch, although they threatened on the counterattack in the second half. Oriol Romeu hit the crossbar with a thunderous 25-yarder while Tadic played in Ryan Bertrand on 66 minutes after more terrible Arsenal defending – this time by Laurent Koscielny – but he could not finish. Pellegrino was entitled to point out that his team had created more clear-cut chances. “We didn’t control the ball but we controlled the game,” he said.\n\nWenger switched to 4-2-3-1 when he changed Mertesacker for Danny Welbeck while he gave the travelling fans the substitution they had been chanting for when he introduced Jack Wilshere. Then came Giroud for Lacazette; the boos were loud.\n\nArsenal pressed hard in the second half, with Southampton camped in their own half, but they struggled to break down their hosts’ defensive structure. Sánchez worked Forster with an 85th-minute free-kick but that was pretty much it until Giroud got in between Virgil van Dijk and Maya Yoshida to fashion the sting in the tail."}, {"date":

assistants, the media and even a member of Everton’s press team over the penalty that cost Liverpool victory in the 229th Merseyside derby. Everyone appeared in the firing line for the Liverpool manager except those ultimately responsible for Sam Allardyce’s pre-Christmas miracle: himself and his team.\n\nPut simply, Liverpool gave victory away. The home side dominated at Anfield but departed with only a point against an Everton team that came with only containment and a draw in mind. Klopp’s team missed gilt-edged chances, gifted Wayne Rooney an opportunity to equalise Mohamed Salah’s 20th goal of the season from the penalty spot and their manager made life easier for the local rivals by resting Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino on the bench until the second half.\n\nRotation resembles flawless management when it works, needless caution when it does not. Needless caution offered Everton hope of a reprieve that their performance did not deserve. Rooney seized it, emphatically converting only Everton’s second penalty at Anfield in 80 years, to the obvious fury of Klopp.\n\n“The guy in the Everton jacket, are you happy about your game?” asked the Liverpool manager as he disputed Craig Pawson’s decision to penalise Dejan Lovren for a slight push on Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The guy in the Everton jacket said he was happy with the point. Klopp, bizarrely, replied: “That’s what my mother said when I came from school.”\n\nNot even Allardyce could claim he was happy with Everton’s performance. The visitors’ lack of quality in possession “really did worry me”, he admitted, but he had no complaints about the gift-wrapped point or a defensive display that restricted Liverpool to three shots on target.\n\nUntil Salah illuminated a chilly Merseyside afternoon with his latest touch of class, the derby had been a relative non-event. Just how Allardyce wanted it. His team were set up with two banks of four purely to contain Liverpool and hit Calvert-Lewin and Oumar Niasse with first-time long balls. But even the long ball proved beyond Everton, who had all week to prepare while a makeshift team played Apollon Limassol in the Europa League and Liverpool routed Spartak Moscow in the Champions League.\n\nAllardyce knew his team would have minimal possession – they managed only 20% in the first half – but was understandably alarmed by how careless Everton were when they had it. From the kick-off Mason Holgate swept an aimless ball out of play. By the sixth minute Jonjoe Kenny, with a free-kick, and the goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, with three clearances from his area, had also kicked straight into touch. Calvert-Lewin had a thankless task with such a pitiful supply, and Niasse struggled simply to hold up play in the 45 minutes he was involved.\n\nLiverpool dominated, but for all their efforts and occasional success in getting behind the visiting full-backs, they rarely troubled Pickford before Salah struck. Allardyce’s stifling tactics were succeeding. Anfield was growing restless. Then their outstanding Egypt international changed the mood entirely.\n\nSalah’s 13th Premier League goal of the campaign originated from a Liverpool free-kick deep in the Everton half, conceding by Idrissa Gana Gueye with a foul from behind on Sadio Mané for which he was booked. The ball was worked out to the impressive Joe Gomez, who found Salah on the edge of the penalty area. Spinning away from a weak challenge by Cuco Martina, the summer signing advanced into the box, cut inside Gueye and lofted a superb finish around Ashley Williams into the far, top corner. Pickford was left grasping at snow.\n\nLate Olivier Giroud equaliser spares Arsenal against Southampton Read more\n\nHaving created little, Liverpool should have put the contest beyond their rivals by half-time. Klopp’s careful rotation policy has worked well throughout a hectic recent schedule but it was not hard to imagine the havoc his team could have wreaked with Firmino and Coutinho on from the start. Liverpool’s territorial dominance and Everton’s meekness would have suited them perfectly.\n\nIn fairness Dominic Solanke and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain worked tirelessly in their absence. They were left as bewildered as the Liverpool bench when Mané sprinted clear of Ashley Williams in first-half stoppage time and elected to shoot with the pair, and Salah, unmarked to his right. Mané dragged his effort wide and the second half followed the same pattern with Liverpool in control yet unable to find the comfort of a second goal. The misses lent an air of inevitability to Everton’s equaliser, although they had not altered their negative approach after falling behind.\n\nRooney, on a rare foray forward, swept a long ball into the path of Calvert-Lewin. The young striker brought it under control and was running away from goal when Lovren pushed him in the back with two raised hands. It was a soft but needless shove, and Pawson had a clear view of the incident before pointing to the spot. Everton’s captain for the day steadied himself and fired the spot-kick down the centre of Simon Mignolet’s goal as the Liverpool keeper dived left. Not scoring in a Merseyside derby had always been one of Rooney’s great regrets in football. No longer. In the 229th encounter, regret belonged firmly to Liverpool and Klopp."}, {"date": "10/12/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74847, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [36], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [4], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [43], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "For Manchester City, this was not just the day they declared themselves the best team in town. It counts for more than that, surely, when there is now an 11-point gap at the top of the Premier League and the team in second place have just learned the hard way why Pep Guardiola’s side are disappearing into the distance.\n\nGuardiola and his players certainly give the impression they are in a hurry to finish this season’s title race. Their goal difference – which is more, almost ludicrously, than any other team’s goals-scored column – has the effect of another point and though it still seems ridiculously early, with snow on the pavements and advent calendars two-thirds unopened, who can possibly see a way back now for Manchester United? Far more likely, the gap will just continue to grow. It would be nice, for the sake of competition, if there might yet be another twist – but that seems unrealistic in the extreme. As far as the title goes, that surely is that.\n\nManchester United v Manchester City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nAnything else would be extraordinary after City’s 14th successive league win and a game was that was so one-sided there were first-half statistics that showed José Mourinho’s men had seen just 22% of the ball. The more important detail came in the form of the goals from David Silva and Nicolás Otamendi that won this derby, with Marcus Rashford scoring for United in between, but when was the last time, on their own ground, United had so little possession? That alone must have been galling for their supporters.\n\nThe irony is that Mourinho’s players might still have rescued themselves. United’s manager complained afterwards that Ander Herrera should have had a penalty from Otamendi’s challenge, rather than a yellow card for diving, and there was a remarkable moment when Romelu Lukaku smashed a close-range shot into Ederson’s face and the substitute Juan Mata also aimed straight at the goalkeeper with the follow-up effort. Yet the days have passed since Sir Alex Ferguson used to boast no other team scored more late goals. In fact a lot has changed at Old Trafford judging by the narrative of this game and the difference in approach between the two sides.\n\nThe crowd here might still like to sing about “football taught by Matt Busby” but, as City’s players worked their elaborate passing patterns, there was a different soundtrack.\n\nThe first rendition of “Park the bus, Man United” could be heard from the away end on the 15-minute mark. The next song, expletive removed, queried whether the home team might be “scared”. Soon afterwards there were olés from the away end. OK, possession statistics do not mean bonus points but it was startling, nonetheless, to see how one team took care of the ball and the other did not. By half-time, City had played more than four times the number passes, 334 to 78, than the home side. Overall, City had 65% of possession against a team who had previously conceded only one league goal at home.\n\nGuardiola finished the match with Silva operating as City’s most advanced player. The league leaders lost their captain, Vincent Kompany, to injury at half-time and had a spell with Fernandinho experimenting as a centre-half. Sergio Agüero, one of the best strikers of the Premier League era, was not required for a single minute. And yet the away side still found a way to outplay, outpass and outscore their opponents. Guardiola summed it up succinctly: “Last season was the same. We won because we were better. We were better in all departments.”\n\nThe only possible criticism, if we were nitpicking, was that Gabriel Jesus gave Mourinho the opportunity to refer back to his pre-match assertion that City’s players (not that his ever would, of course) dive too often. Jesus, chosen ahead of Agüero, should also have been booked for one of those tactical fouls that Mourinho had flagged up. Ultimately, however, the truth is that City did not have to resort to underhand tactics to signal their superiority.\n\nThey could certainly feel aggrieved that they were only drawing at half-time. Silva’s goal had arrived in the 42nd minute but it was a poor misjudgment from Fabian Delph that allowed Rashford his chance to equalise. Delph was caught out when Otamendi was unable to meet Marcos Rojo’s cross. Rashford was on the loose ball in a flash and fired a diagonal shot past Ederson.\n\nTwo minutes into first-half stoppage-time, that goal set up a second half in which United did at least seem to remember they were supposed to be the home side. City had an experimental back four, always slightly vulnerable to crosses from wide areas, but the same could also be said of the home team and the problem, perhaps, when so many attackers are asked to help out in defence, is that mistakes invariably occur.\n\nIn the 54th minute, Silva clipped a free-kick into the penalty area and Lukaku swung out his boot to hook the ball away. The attempted clearance ricocheted off his team-mate Chris Smalling and the ball fell invitingly for Otamendi to volley past David de Gea from inside the six-yard area.\n\nFor all of City’s quick, fluid, pass-them-to-death football, it was a scruffy, fortuitous way to score and the same applied when Silva opened the scoring earlier in the match.

This felt like the first major step in an unlikely rehabilitation for both: if the recruitment of Moyes last month felt repulsive to supporters of a sepia-tinted persuasion then surely even the most begrudging of souls would acknowledge the improvements he has wrought in only a month. Chelsea were deservedly beaten by opponents who were simply more organised, more determined, more athletic and who found a sting when on top. Nobody in West Ham’s current position can ask for much more and their first league win since September was achieved with an added touch of old-fashioned style.\n\nThe flourish in question was provided by Marko Arnautovic, whose very selection came to feel like a piece of sound management from Moyes. West Ham had set a template for their relegation battle in digging deep for a narrow defeat at Manchester City last weekend. Arnautovic had been consigned to the bench for that one and it seemed a clear message that the £20m signing from Stoke needed to up his game. Greater forward thrust was always going to be needed for a home fixture and Moyes recalled him here, the manager seeing himself rewarded by 69 minutes of unstinting energy and the kind of outstanding strike such a fee demands.\n\nIf Antonio Conte chooses to be critical – and that is not really a question – then he might look at how easily Arnautovic rolled Andreas Christensen after receiving possession from Michail Antonio, as well as the smooth passage he was then granted into the penalty area. But the Austrian’s sixth-minute give-and-go with Manuel Lanzini was the action of two players perfectly in tune; the finish, curled left-footed into the far corner, was his first goal for the club and West Ham had reward for a fast start that caught Chelsea flat-footed.\n\nConte had spoken beforehand of the “sacred fire” required of players in the very top bracket. Few have ever detected that in Arnautovic but he set the required tone here and West Ham followed, throwing themselves into every duel and barely losing a challenge in the opening 20 minutes. In the meantime they began to enjoy themselves; the sight of Arthur Masuaku bamboozling Davide Zappacosta with a slick pirouette on the ball may have prompted double-takes but was entirely reflective of the devilment with which they emerged.\n\nArnautovic later had Christensen on toast again near the right corner flag but, after wriggling free, allowed the centre-back to recover. In the second half he had a reasonable claim for handball, and a possible penalty, against the same player turned down by Anthony Taylor but by that point any attacking situations West Ham created were essentially crumbs. Moyes thought his players could have done better on the counter as Chelsea pressed but the diligence with which they held their lead excused any inattention further forward. There were spells, particularly midway through the first half and at the start of the second, when the pattern threatened to degenerate into the same kind of siege that eventually broke them at the Etihad. In the event, it never quite turned out that way and West Ham rarely found themselves struggling for oxygen even when under intense pressure.\n\nWhen they did flounder, Adrián saved in quick succession from N’Golo Kanté and Zappacosta, keeping them ahead at the break and justifying his selection ahead of Joe Hart. In fact Adrián was hardly extended in the second 45 minutes, Winston Reid marshalling an impeccably drilled back line that was rarely turned around and spent much of its time repelling speculative deliveries from out wide.\n\nHow disappointing this was for Chelsea and Conte, who suggested afterwards that a title race is barely worth discussing. His concern is now the five-into-three equation that all the Champions League contenders bar Manchester City must trouble themselves with; his mood might have brightened if Álvaro Morata, played onside by Masuaku after Kanté produced a rare moment of ingenuity, had not blasted their best chance wide six minutes from time but a draw would have papered over the cracks.\n\nMorata, who had been a late fitness doubt for this game, did not look sharp and Conte would presumably love to lighten the load on a player who is shouldering a heavy burden with no alternative of comparable quality. “I can give my opinion but the last decision is of the club,” Conte said of any January arrivals. Greater attacking variation would do little harm, the half-time introduction of Pedro for Tiémoué Bakayoko doing nothing to add subtlety.\n\nFor Moyes, whose after-match grin perhaps betrayed the circumspection of his words, it was a return to the top. Almost three years have passed since he led Real Sociedad to a similarly stirring 1-0 win over Barcelona; there have not been many highs since then but now the big names keep on coming. “I came off there, took my jacket off and then thought: ‘No, I’ve got Arsenal in midweek’,” he said. That test will take place on Wednesday. More where this came from and the impression will solidify that, for West Ham, he is the right man at exactly the right time.\n\nAntonio Conte concedes title after Chelsea’s bubble burst by West Ham Read more\n\nWest Ham United 1-0 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Moyes celebrates after Marko Arnautovic’s goal.

Sean Dyche began a managerial career of underappreciated overachievement in charge of Watford against Burnley. Dismissed after taking Watford to 11th in the Championship, victory for his current employers against his former club means that Burnley are one point off a Champions League place. It is a league table to savour in this corner of Lancashire.\n\n“From a fan point of view, it is fantastic to see that,” said Dyche. He is a figure who continues to defy football gravity but it was the beaten manager, the more fashionable Marco Silva, who Everton coveted while showing little interest in the Englishman.\n\nChristian Benteke misses penalty as Crystal Palace and Bournemouth draw Read more\n\nYet the underrated Dyche delivered Burnley’s fifth win in seven games, albeit one facilitated by Watford’s indiscipline. “Until the red card, the game is balanced,” said Silva. “It has a big, big influence.” But six minutes after Marvin Zeegelaar was sent off, Scott Arfield gave Burnley a lead they never relinquished.\n\nSilva argued result and red card alike were “not fair”, his air of petulance contrasting with Dyche’s business-like openness. “It is clear it is harsh, harsh, harsh,” repeated the Portuguese after Zeegelaar’s fifth Watford appearance came to an abrupt end. A lunge at Steven Defour was more reckless than malicious but it was two-footed. “A definite sending off,” said Dyche. Referee Lee Probert applied the mandatory punishment and, Silva said, refused to debate the decision with him. His irritation ought to have been directed at his defender: a challenge some 70 yards from his own goal was utterly unnecessary.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watford’s Marvin Zeegelaar fouls Steven Defour, and is promptly sent off by Lee Probert. Photograph: Conor Molloy/Action Plus via Getty Images\n\nBurnley were swift to capitalise on Zeegelaar’s departure. Johann Berg Gudmundsson provided a low cross. The other winger, Arfield, met it, skipped past Daryl Janmaat and angled his shot beyond Heurelho Gomes. It was an illustration of Burnley’s enduring ability to turn misfortune, both theirs and that of others, to their advantage. Arfield started only because of Robbie Brady’s season-ending knee injury. In a sign of the Irishman’s importance and Burnley’s collectivism, his duties were shared around. His stand-in scored, while the influential Gudmundsson took over set-piece responsibilities and almost joined Arfield on the scoresheet with a curling free-kick. “Their keeper has made three top-class saves, two from Johann,” said Dyche.\n\nHarry Kane strikes twice as Tottenham brush aside hapless Stoke City Read more\n\nArfield was not the only understudy to impress. “The marvel of our squad is that we have players who can come into the team out of the blue and deliver great performances,” Dyche said. A defence stripped of the sold Michael Keane and then the stricken Tom Heaton, Ben Mee and Matthew Lowton recorded a seventh clean sheet – only Richarlison, who skied an early shot, and Abdoulaye Doucouré, who tested Pope with a drive, really threatened to score – meaning the Manchester clubs are alone in conceding fewer goals than Burnley.\n\nTurf Moor has seen fewer goals than any other top-flight ground but Burnley’s second-half dominance ought to have yielded more. They had two goals chalked off for offside and, if disallowing Chris Wood’s tap-in was correct, Probert’s decision-making was under the microscope again when Ashley Barnes was denied. The substitute had finished smoothly after Arfield’s reverse pass, aimed for Wood, was deflected into his path by two Watford defenders. “A confusing moment,” said Dyche. “Pick the bones out of that one.” And five years on, pick the bones out of Watford’s decision to sack Dyche."}, {"date": "09/12/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24823, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace",

The game was deep into stoppage time at the end when Charlie Daniels was penalised for tripping Wilfried Zaha, the referee awarding his second spot-kick of the game, with Christian Benteke wresting the ball from his team-mates and placing it on the spot while Bournemouth players protested the original decision. The striker, Palace’s record signing, was without a goal since May. He clearly sensed his time had come.\n\nAntonio Conte concedes title after Chelsea’s bubble burst by West Ham Read more\n\nPlenty of his team-mates seemed unsure. Luka Milivojevic, the team’s regular penalty-taker, had initially grabbed the ball but Benteke was having none of it. Scott Dann and James Tomkins both appeared to query why the side would swap spot-kick duties mid-match, even if the former later insisted he had been oblivious to the switch. Zaha, never one to hide his emotions, seemed perplexed. Given the buildup, and the Belgian’s fragile form, there was a certain inevitability as to what ensued. The shot was scuffed and pushed away by Asmir Begovic. The final whistle, slicing through the locals’ disappointment moments later, confirmed Palace had slipped back to the foot of the division.\n\nIt was the kind of harebrained thinking, and horribly weak attempt, that can see teams relegated. Benteke has now missed three of his five penalties for the club and departed with boos from the home support ringing in his ears. Roy Hodgson ended up speaking, amicably enough, to a fan at the front of the main stand. “It wasn’t an altercation, the guy was only asking why Benteke had been told to take the penalty,” he explained. “I was telling him he hadn’t. Benteke got hold of the ball. It was a unilateral decision. No one on our team was able to wrest the ball from him. We, the management, don’t expect players to change those decisions. We tried to shout out our instructions. They obviously didn’t reach the penalty spot.\n\n“The reason he was booed off was because the fans, having seen us swarm around their penalty area, thought we’d won it when the referee pointed to the spot. When the guy misses it, he has to accept he’ll be booed off the field. He’s been told already [that he won’t be taking the next penalty]. After missing the one which has deprived us of two valuable points, I can’t imagine him rushing to pick up the ball next time. He’s stunned, shocked, disappointed.” It should be noted that Bournemouth vehemently disputed the penalty award, insisting Daniels had played the ball. They felt justice had been done.\n\nThe irony is that, up to that point, this had been Benteke’s most effective performance of the campaign, though quite how he recovers some poise in time for Tuesday’s visit of Watford remains to be seen. Palace had missed him for seven weeks, their team denied a focal point while he recovered from knee ligament damage sustained in September. Now he is back but diminished, his confidence fractured. Belief must be rebuilt amid a cluttered schedule.\n\nHe could do well to look at his opposite number, Jermain Defoe, and the emphatic manner in which he emerged from his own relatively wretched sequence of one goal in 13 games to plunder twice. This was actually a tale of two strikers, not least because Defoe’s second goal, thumped home in first-half stoppage time, almost defied belief in its accuracy and execution. A hopeful punt forward by Lewis Cook liberated Defoe beyond Dann, though there still seemed little danger with the angle unkind on the right of the box. Yet the striker’s volleyed finish arced gloriously over Julián Speroni and nestled in the far corner, his matter-of-fact celebration betraying the confidence of a player whose belief is omnipresent.\n\nThat was his 201st league goal, and ninth in 10 appearances against Palace, with his double century having been brought up early on courtesy of a corner routine perfected on the training ground. Andrew Surman rolled the ball in to Junior Stanislas, darting forward almost unnoticed from the near-post, with the midfielder able to collect again and square a pass to the penalty spot. There loitered Defoe, unmarked with Josh King having slyly pulled back the striker’s marker, Jeffrey Schlupp, to side‑foot accurately into the corner.\n\nFor a while, Palace had quivered in arrears, but at least there is fight in their ranks these days. Their rally just before the break had briefly earned them a lead. First Milivojevic slammed home his penalty after Begovic’s trip on Zaha – the forward dragged his leg and was clipped by the on-rushing goalkeeper – before Dann prodded into an empty net from Yohan Cabaye’s fine centre. Both goals had owed much to Benteke’s contribution though, in the end, that had been forgotten.\n\n“If you miss penalties at home,” added Hodgson, “then you’ve only got yourself to blame.”\n\nHarry

touchline with relief as his late winner sealed a vital 1-0 victory over West Brom.\n\nIn the final stages of what had been a woeful encounter lacking in real Premier League quality, Bony, the captain, lashed the ball home after Albion failed to clear Ki Sung-yueng’s corner. The goal sent the Liberty Stadium wild and sealed what could yet be a huge three points for the hosts, who moved off the bottom of the table.\n\n“It’s a nice feeling to get the win and it was one we really needed,” said Clement. “It was a scrappy game, but we just about deserved to come out on top. We deserved it and I was really pleased with the impact of the substitutions. They made a real difference.\n\n“We got over the line in a narrow, scrappy game and it’s a great feeling. My celebrations were a mixture of frustration with some of our previous results and a feeling of delight that we’d got the win. The players stood up in a big game and really put the effort in.”\n\nFor West Brom, this was a poor result and means Alan Pardew’s men stay firmly in relegation trouble. Clement, rightly, did not care one jot as his team emerged victorious.\n\n“I felt we had to go for it and we got all three points. I thought we struggled to get Wilfried into the game in the first half, but his winner was a big moment for everybody,” he said.\n\n“The most important thing was a positive result and we move on to Manchester City on Wednesday now with a bit of momentum behind us.”\n\nClement had insisted in the run-up to this game that any pressure on him was from external sources. Denying any claims he was one game from the sack, the former Bayern Munich assistant was not helped by fellow strugglers West Ham picking up a surprise 1-0 win at home to Chelsea in the day’s early kick-off.\n\nClement certainly rolled the dice with his selection, making four changes to his side and giving shock starts to Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge either side of Bony in attack. Renato Sanches was dropped from the squad altogether.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest West Brom manager Alan Pardew has picked up one point, with no goals scored, in his first two games in charge. Photograph: McManus/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nAlfie Mawson headed an early Ki corner over for Swansea but it was the visitors who dominated the early possession. Salomón Rondón had their first chance and, given their poor league position, it was no surprise to see Clement’s men lacking confidence.\n\nIn truth, it was a poor-quality affair. Just before the break, Tom Carroll’s set piece was headed against his own post by Jake Livermore as he attempted to clear. The result was the first period ending scoreless.\n\nWest Brom introduced James McClean for Sam Field in an attacking half-time change but the second period followed a similar theme to the first. Bony shot wide after a neat turn and in Swansea’s first substitution Clement replaced Routledge with Jordan Ayew.\n\nAlmost immediately Ayew curled an effort over the bar as the game turned into a tense affair. Carroll put a free-kick into the wall when he should have done better and then Robson-Kanu wasted a glorious opportunity when he crossed wildly out of play on a West Brom counterattack.\n\nScott Arfield gives Burnley win over Watford after Marvin Zeegelaar red card Read more\n\nThere was still time for more one more attacking change from Clement and he went for broke, Tammy Abraham joining Bony in attack. The gamble paid off. Ki’s second corner in quick succession found its way to Bony and he made no mistake, lashing the ball past Foster.\n\nAlbion pushed for an equaliser but it failed to arrive as Swansea edged home despite Abraham missing a sitter to make it 2-0 late on when clean through on goal.\n\nPardew said: “I wasn’t disappointed with the effort and endeavour we showed. It was a close game, you could always sense that, and there wasn’t much between the two sides.\n\n“There were defensive errors and we lacked a little bit of conviction in the final moment. We didn’t really create enough either, but having said that, midway through the second half we had some crucial chances and we let those moments pass us by.\n\n“Robson-Kanu had the best moment in the game. It would have been a tap-in for either Jake or Rondón, but he overcooked it.\n\n“As a new manager you want to win your first couple of games, but looking at the group, they are suffering from this poor run.

What was worse, his players didn’t see it as it happened. Tottenham raced away to turn a first-half advantage into a full-time supremacy here and, in the process, cast further doubt on Hughes’s tenure as Stoke manager.\n\nThe statistics from Saturday’s game were as follows: Ryan Shawcross’s own goal gave Spurs a first-half lead for only the second time in the Premier League at Wembley; Harry Kane scored twice, taking his total for England and Spurs in 2017 to 50, and leaving him just three short of Alan Shearer’s Premier League record of 36 in a calendar year (with four more matches to play); Son Heung-min scored once and claimed two assists in a man-of-the-match performance; the South Korean also gave a chasing to poor Tom Edwards, Stoke’s 18-year-old wing-back who was withdrawn before the end.\n\nSpurs, for a moment at least, close the gap on the top four to one point. They also steady any nerves after a run of two points from four matches. “The collective performance was very good,” said the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino. “Maybe it was no better than other days that we play here, against West Bromwich Albion, or [away] at Watford and Arsenal but we were clinical in front of goal. We had a good mentality and most importantly, good focus from the beginning.”\n\nPochettino had called a team meeting before this match to emphasise the importance of a good start. Spurs had scored twice in the first half against Apoel Nicosia in the Champions League in midweek and the Argentinian was determined that his side finally brought something similar to bear on their league form. The opening 20 minutes failed to oblige and the elements were all too familiar; a massed Stoke defence, not much movement, frustrating touches from Dele Alli and crosses cleared before they could reach Kane.\n\nThen in the 21st minute, Son made the breakthrough. The liveliest of Spurs’ attackers (unlike Kane and Christian Eriksen, he had played against Apoel), the Korean was facing up against Edwards on the left wing. He shuffled the ball from one foot to the other to gain a yard on the teenager but that was enough. Son got his cross off, it took a deflection off Kurt Zouma and Shawcross put the ball into his own net.\n\nHughes bemoaned his luck with the goal. “It was an unfortunate deflection to take the lead,” he said. “You don’t want to concede first against Spurs away from home. But we had a number of good moments.” This was a bit of an exaggeration, though they had a couple of moments that might have come to something had the bounce fallen their way. When the whistle blew for half-time, however, Stoke were seriously under the cosh.\n\nHughes said his half-time teamtalk focussed on staying in the match. “The plan was to keep a foothold in the game, not to go gung-ho,” he said, “that would have been ridiculous.” But either his players did not understand the instructions or they ignored them.\n\nStoke pressed forward from the first whistle in the second half , committing more numbers in attack. In the 53rd minute they had the ball in the Tottenham half, but when possession was turned over they were in trouble. A blocked through ball bobbled up to Harry Winks. The youth-team graduate, so calm wherever he finds possession, flicked a pass over his shoulder and casually pulled the entire Stoke defence apart. Alli received the ball, span, slipped a pass through the advanced centre-backs and Son ran on to finish clinically for a deserved goal.\n\nHuddersfield leapfrog Brighton thanks to Steve Mounié’s return to form Read more\n\nAt that point the floodgates opened. Just a minute later Kane, who had missed a glorious first-half chance when one on one with Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland, scored from an Eriksen cross with a powerful header. With 65 minutes gone he sealed the game with the kind of calm, composed finish that has made his name, leaving Butland no chance at his left-hand post.\n\nAlli, still struggling for his best form but having contributed where it mattered, was withdrawn for Érik Lamela, the Argentinian continuing his rehabilitation from injury. In a bizarre move, Hughes responded by going on the offensive, bringing off the young and shaken Edwards, and replacing him with Peter Crouch.\n\n“I wouldn’t have put him in if didn’t think he could handle it,” Hughes said of Edwards, whose only other league start came in the 7-2 defeat at Manchester City in October. “He’s been unfortunate in the games I’ve chosen for him.”\n\nCrouch’s 74th-minute header was cleared by Kieran Trippier to Son who ran the length of the pitch before threading in Eriksen for Spurs’s fifth. Stoke did get on the scoresheet, Shawcross heading in after Hugo Lloris missed a corner in the 80th minute. But the Stoke captain could not bring himself to celebrate.\n\nNow three points off the drop zone and unable to keep a clean sheet, Stoke are being dragged into a relegation battle. You wonder what Tony Pulis might be making of it all?\n\nScott Arfield gives Burnley win over Watford after Marvin Zeegelaar red card Read more"}, {"date": "09/12/2017", "arena": "St James' Park,

when Newcastle United showcased commendable resilience and resolve but Ayoze Pérez’s agonising late own goal means they have now collected only one point from their last seven games.\n\nAs Claude Puel’s quietly effective “velvet” Leicester revolution continued with a third straight win and the home side’s 125th birthday party was ruined, Rafa Benítez had every right to look worried. Newcastle’s manager knows that simply holding their own requires his players to perform at maximum capacity.\n\nAt times his team resembled the driver of a modest city run-about pressing their foot flat to the floor as they struggle to overtake lorries on a motorway. Togetherness and tenacity can only take a squad now hovering just above the relegation zone so far.\n\nAntonio Conte concedes title after Chelsea’s bubble burst by West Ham Read more\n\n“I’m really disappointed,” said Benítez. “The players, they put in an effort, but still we have to improve if we want to get points in these kind of games. We’ve paid for easy mistakes. We have to learn quickly.”\n\nAfter a highly evocative preamble, which saw the 125th anniversary of Newcastle’s formation marked by home supporters waving a multitude of flags, raising numerous banners and generally turning the stands into a sea of black and white, Joselu opened the scoring.\n\nNewcastle’s fifth-minute goal began with Dwight Gayle pulling wide, dodging Danny Simpson and haring down the left. He then cut the ball back for the onrushing, and unmarked, Joselu to beat Kasper Schmeichel with a first-time, right-foot shot.\n\nWhen Gayle subsequently fired fractionally wide, Benítez’s tactical gamble in fielding two strikers in a 4-4-2 formation seemed vindicated. The downside was that it left Leicester with an extra man in midfield, along with additional counterattacking scope.\n\nNewcastle United 2-3 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nSure enough Puel was soon celebrating a stunning, crowd-silencing equaliser from Riyad Mahrez. It originated in central midfield where Mikel Merino, once again preferred to Jonjo Shelvey, forfeited possession to the influential Wilfred Ndidi.\n\nThat slapdash loss of concentration liberated Mahrez to run at the heart of Newcastle’s defence before eluding Karl Darlow’s grasp courtesy of a left-footed, 25-yard shot which the goalkeeper touched but could not hold as it arrowed into the top corner.\n\nIt was an eye-catching finish from a rejuvenated playmaker but Darlow, preferred to Rob Elliot, looked disappointed not to have held it. Tellingly, Benítez was left deeply frustrated when Newcastle’s owner, Mike Ashley, thwarted his attempts to sign an experienced keeper last summer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joselu celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Newcastle with just four minutes gone. Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle Utd via Getty Images\n\nMerino’s recruitment was sanctioned and, overall, he looks a very good buy but, unusually, the Basque midfielder struggled here, looking ruffled whenever the thoroughly menacing Demarai Gray entered his sphere. By half-time the increasingly elusive Gray had, tantalisingly, curled a couple of shots inches wide.\n\nWith Matt Ritchie’s own travails suggesting Newcastle’s right winger has hit a bit of a wall and needs a rest, Benítez could do with making a couple of signings next month with a Gray-esque capacity for making things happen. Unfortunately, with negotiations progressing slowly as Ashley and Amanda Staveley haggle over the terms of the latter’s mooted takeover, he remains unsure if he will be equipped with the funds needed to avert a relegation skirmish.\n\nAlthough Schmeichel saved smartly from Jacob Murphy, the trio of Gray, Mahrez and Ndidi were all in such impressive form that Leicester – who had a penalty appeal rejected when Jamie Vardy crumpled under DeAndre Yedlin’s challenge – appeared comfortably in control.\n\nAn intensifying Arctic chill ensured spectators lost feeling in their fingers and toes, and early evening Geordie optimism ebbed away.\n\nScott Arfield gives Burnley win over Watford after Marvin Zeegelaar red card Read more\n\nSuch fears were realised in the 60th minute. Granted, Gray deserved a goal but after meeting Marc Albrighton’s adroit pass, a little luck entered the equation when his shot swerved past a wrong-footed Darlow after deflecting off Florian Lejeune. That said, Mahrez’s glorious crossfield pass which prefaced Albrighton’s assist merited proper reward.\n\nHearteningly for Benítez, Newcastle refused to fold and, in the fallout from Merino’s panic-provoking header following a corner, Gayle’s left-footed shot deflected off Harry Maguire before whizzing past Schmeichel.\n\nWith the game thrillingly open, Gayle shot marginally wide but Leicester’s counterattacking skill won it. Their decisive break concluded with Vardy riding Lejeune’s tackle before crossing, Shinji Okazaki shaping to shoot and Pérez’s desperate attempt to clear diverting the ball into his own net.\n\nThe Japan striker was duly rewarded for playing on despite a head wound leaving him swathed in bandages. “Shinji’s kamikaze,” said the often inscrutable Puel. “He’s fantastic, he gives his body for the team.”"}, {"date": "03/12/2017", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10764, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

Austin’s name sung with gusto at full-time by the pocket of away supporters was always Eddie Howe’s worst fear. The Bournemouth manager repeatedly tried and failed to buy the striker owing to a transfer embargo while he was on trial at the club from Poole Town in 2009, but made Austin his first signing at Burnley two years later. And here it was the Southampton man who cancelled out Ryan Fraser’s opener to earn a share of the spoils in this entertaining clash between two south coast neighbours.\n\nThis was a splendid advert for the Premier League but, in truth, it is a point that does little for either team, both of whom could have taken victory on another day. Mauricio Pellegrino had cited the “bigger picture” pre-match, owing to the gruelling December schedule – this was the first of seven matches for his side this month, and the first of eight for Bournemouth – so it was no surprise he made six changes from the team that came unstuck in the sixth minute of injury time against Manchester City in midweek. Two of which were enforced with Cédric Soares and Shane Long missing with hamstring and calf injuries respectively, so Jérémy Pied made his first league start since May at right-back while Austin ably filled the void up front.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos Read more\n\nAsked if there was an air of inevitably that Austin would score, Howe said: “I hoped not, he was bright. It was a nice cutback and a good finish by Charlie. If you put balls in the box and he comes alive ... we are disappointed we didn’t stop him.”\n\nIf there was a good chance of Austin scoring, then Nathan Redmond’s starring role – albeit off the bench – was perhaps just as predictable following his bizarre exchange with Pep Guardiola on Wednesday. Pellegrino, however, refuted the idea that the Southampton winger was affected by the pep talk. “I don’t think so,” he said. “One comment will not change the performance of one player or a team.\n\n“I think he played well and our reaction in the second half was good, especially in wide areas. We could have scored a second, but we were really close.”\n\nHowe, too, rang the changes here with all three second-half substitutes from the disappointing home defeat by Burnley – Adam Smith, Lewis Cook and Jermain Defoe – all handed starts here. Callum Wilson dropped to the bench and Harry Arter was left out of the matchday squad altogether, but not through injury. “He’s fit and available, but not selected,” Howe said.\n\nFew, though, could have envisaged that it would be Smith, the marauding Bournemouth right-back, who would dominate the post-match agenda after he picked up his fifth booking of the season, for an alleged first-half dive according to the referee Jon Moss. Smith maximised contact but was tripped by Sofiane Boufal. “I spoke to the ref after and he apologised and said it was a penalty, but it’s frustrating,” said Smith, who will miss Bournemouth’s trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ryan Fraser, right, is congratulated after scoring. Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nAt that point, Bournemouth badly needed a break after another sluggish start. Virgil van Dijk sent a free header from James Ward-Prowse’s outswinging corner sailing past of Asmir Begovic’s goal before Pied thrashed an effort wide from 30 yards. It took Bournemouth 20 minutes to stir. But when they did, Fraser Forster certainly knew it, with the Southampton goalkeeper called into action twice in quick succession. First, unknowingly, his left shoulder denied Defoe after the striker diverted Smith’s lashed effort goalwards before he then pushed clear Nathan Aké’s diving header. Then came Moss’s contentious decision.\n\nBournemouth were irked but continued to apply the pressure, with Charlie Daniels fizzing a rasping effort wide from 35 yards, one reminiscent to his rocket against Manchester City in August. The next Bournemouth attack, three minutes before the interval, finally found the Southampton net. When Wesley Hoedt dallied on the ball, Joshua King, pressing high up the field, stole possession and spread the ball across to Andrew Surman, who then shifted the ball over again for Fraser to emphatically sweep home. It had been coming, with Southampton too often complacent in defence. Saints, though, should have had an instant leveller, but Boufal blazed high and wide from Ryan Bertrand’s low cross.\n\nBournemouth 1-1 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nPellegrino summoned Redmond, who leapt to the defence of Guardiola after his peculiar pep talk, in place of Ward-Prowse at half-time. Fresh from Guardiola’s gushing praise, Redmond made an impressive instant impact. He then fed Austin for the equalising goal on the hour, with the striker smashing home his drilled cross at the front post for his third in as many matches. “The confidence of a striker is very difficult to train, or buy,” Pellegrino said. “You need experience of scoring goals, and when you have a player in this form it is good news.”\n\nBoth teams could have snatched a winner – the Bournemouth substitute Wilson could not react quickly enough to seize upon the rebound from King’s late strike, while Austin, lurking at the back post, failed to reach an overcooked Bertrand cross

Dropped were André Ayew and Marko Arnautovic, with Adrián, Declan Rice, Edimilson Fernandes and Michail Antonio all named.\n\nMoyes fielded a five-man defence and the early sense was that attacks would consist of a lump-it approach that hoped to capitalise on Antonio’s directness. It was via this route that West Ham claimed their first corner, along the right, after Antonio drove forward into the channel. Aaron Cresswell took it, found Cheikhou Kouyaté’s head, and City panicked for a moment as Antonio was free to connect but could not direct the finish.\n\nFabian Delph said of West Ham’s approach: “Our intensity was there but when there were 11 men behind the ball who aren’t interested in attacking and just parking the bus – it was difficult.”\n\nYet when West Ham played the quick stuff City love, they, too, posed a problem. Manuel Lanzini and Arthur Masuaku combined down the left, the latter sent over a low cross, and a brief mix-up between Ederson and Mangala almost allowed Antonio to capitalise before the goalkeeper grabbed possession.\n\nMoyes’s hopes of trying to stymie City worked as the first half progressed and the home side struggled for tempo and rhythm. Having decided to surrender the initiative, both territorially and via the manager’s selection, West Ham gradually edged into the contest. Lanzini warmed Ederson’s fingers and won a corner. While nothing came of this, any fear the strugglers might concede early were unfounded, the match remaining at deadlock as the 40-minute mark came and went.\n\nSixty seconds before the break, proceedings became far better for West Ham as they took the lead. When Cresswell took a short corner from the right City slumbered and Lanzini had an age to return the ball. The left-back’s delivery found the head of Angelo Ogbonna and though Nicolás Otamendi might have got closer, the finish allowed Ederson no chance as the Italian claimed a first Premier League goal.\n\nWest Ham’s lead was deserved but to turn things around Guardiola brought on Jesus for Danilo and now Sergio Agüero had a central attacking partner.\n\nYet the Argentinian, who has 11 goals in 15 appearances but has been less prolific since being in a taxi crash in the Netherlands in late September, would prove muted throughout. Guardiola said: “It is not easy for him with 10 players there, almost no space. Sooner or later, he is going to come back. His part in the season was top before the accident in Amsterdam.”\n\nWest Ham’s show of attacking gusto serves up hope for David Moyes | Nick Ames Read more\n\nWhile the aim of introducing Jesus was to pin the visitors back, instead City were forced to defend an early second-half corner. They did so and now the home crowd found their voice and the sky-blue shirts came close to an equaliser. Delph, Sané, Jesus and Silva swapped passes along the left before Raheem Sterling’s shot was repelled.\n\nNow, though, City made the breakthrough, created by the effervescent Jesus. The Brazilian did admirably to squeeze in a low pass from the right and Otamendi, positioned where you would expect to find a centre-forward, beat Adrián with a poacher’s finish. This was the Argentinian’s fourth goal in his last 14 games, a fine return for a centre-back.\n\nAdrián was performing impressively in Hart’s absence. Next, he ensured his team stayed level by flinging himself to the left to keep out a Sané rocket. West Ham’s previous solidity had evaporated and they were engaged in an increasingly desperate rearguard action.\n\nThe contest had quickened, to City’s benefit only, but just as David de Gea sparkled in United’s win at Arsenal on Saturday, so too did Adrián. After stopping a De Bruyne effort he then denied Jesus, as West Ham continued to cling on.\n\nUltimately, though, they failed to do so courtesy of the Silva finish, though Diafro Sakho missed a golden chance right at the end to snatch a draw, Antonio had also missed one moments before the Spaniard’s game-winning intervention.\n\nGuardiola can now prepare for the trip to Kharkiv for Wednesday night’s final Champions League group game against Shakhtar Donetsk. “After the international break, we had four games and we were able to win all four games against physical teams,” he said. “Tomorrow is recovery and regeneration and then we go to Ukraine.”"}, {"date": "02/12/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41538, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut

"The only problem for Antonio Conte after seeing the irrepressible Eden Hazard provide the latest demonstration of his outstanding ability to win a game with almost no help at all was the knowledge that the Belgian’s brilliance still might not be enough for the champions to retain their title. Not with Manchester City setting new standards at the top of the Premier League. Chelsea played with controlled aggression to stamp out Newcastle United’s attempts at insurrection here, but Conte struck a slightly defeatist tone, lamenting how the team peering down at the rest of the league is doing “extraordinary things” and wondering when that will cease to be the case.\n\nUnless that happens, Chelsea can forget about the Premier League trophy staying in west London. They did cut City’s lead to eight points, fighting back from a goal down to ruin Rafael Benítez’s return to one of his old clubs, but there seems little prospect of Pep Guardiola’s freewheeling side slipping up when they host West Ham United on Sunday , and such levels of excellence can be draining for those in pursuit of them.\n\nIn that context, however, it was still a pleasing afternoon for Conte. “A good performance overall,” he said. “I am very happy for this. It is not simple to go 1-0 down and have the right will and desire.”\n\nChelsea 3-1 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFor Conte, who is likely to be punished by the Football Association for being sent from the touchline in last Wednesday’s tight 1-0 win over Swansea City, it was a chance to stand back and appreciate Hazard’s special talent and, despite falling behind to Dwight Gayle’s early goal, Chelsea were never in any meaningful danger of losing.\n\nHazard scored twice, either side of Álvaro Morata’s 10th goal of the season in all competitions, and the home fans could revel in mocking Benítez long before the final whistle.\n\nThere was a bit of snarl in the air. Benítez has plenty of history with Chelsea, from those infamous Champions League semi-finals against his Liverpool team to that interim spell here four years ago, and the diehards in the Matthew Harding Stand greeted him with a loud chorus of boos.\n\nHowever, the bigger concern for the Spaniard was his team extending their winless run to six matches. “Every game is so difficult,” he said, disappointed at Newcastle’s failure to build on Gayle’s opener in the 12th minute.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dwight Gayle (left) followed up his opening goal at Old Trafford with the first of the game at Stamford Bridge. Photograph: Shaun Brooks/Action Plus via Getty Images\n\nThe visitors made an ambitious start and the indecision in the Chelsea defence that led to Gayle stroking the ball into an unguarded net could be attributed to Newcastle’s initial exuberance.\n\nThe striker started the move by flicking on a long punt and Conte must have been alarmed by his side’s failure to react, with N’Golo Kanté too meek in his attempt to mop up and Marcos Alonso making everything worse with an ill-advised backpass. Thibaut Courtois charged out to deny Jacob Murphy but the goalkeeper’s intervention presented Gayle with an easy chance.\n\nGayle had put Newcastle in a similarly commanding position at Old Trafford two weeks ago, only for Manchester United to respond with four unanswered goals, and the hosts made sure that his enterprise went to waste again.\n\n“We can change our system,” Conte said. “We can play Hazard as a second striker. We can play him as a No10 when we play 3-4-3. Today, Eden and Álvaro showed a good link.”\n\nPaul Pogba sent off but Jesse Lingard helps Manchester United floor Arsenal Read more\n\nConte opted for the 3-5-1-1 system that is designed to coax the best out of Hazard, granting him the freedom to roam from a central position, and it was an arduous task for a Newcastle side that strained to track the forward’s slippery movement.\n\nNewcastle’s defending had become worryingly ragged by the time Hazard equalised in the 21st minute. Andreas Christensen sent a looping header against the left post and the team in black and white stripes had not fallen back into shape when César Azpilicueta whipped in another menacing cross. Florian Lejeune stretched to divert the ball away from Morata and Hazard followed up, driving a bouncing shot past Karl Darlow.\n\nChelsea went in front 12 minutes later. Victor Moses, making his first start since suffering a hamstring injury two months ago, laced a cross into the six-yard box from the right and Morata headed home from close range.\n\nIt was a fine way for Chelsea to respond to adversity and Moses was instrumental in their third goal, earning a penalty thanks to Matt Ritchie’s desperate late tackle. Hazard dinked it down the middle to give his team a precious cushion.\n\nNow Chelsea could do with an unlikely favour from West Ham."}, {"date": "02/12/2017", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance":

attacking brio on the Sussex coast and where Brighton have never had it so bad – at least at the Amex Stadium. They moved in six years ago and their current manager, Chris Hughton, declared Liverpool to be the best team they have faced this season – which is high praise considering that the only other visitors to win here were Manchester City.\n\nThe endorsement seemed justified because Liverpool were scintillating going forward, with Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho exceptional as Jürgen Klopp’s team brought their goal tally to 15 from their last four away matches.\n\nYet Klopp was not quite as impressed as Hughton. “Results-wise it looks like we’re flying but we’re not,” said the German, who bemoaned a 10-minute spell in the second half during which his team conceded a goal and risked losing control of the match.\n\nSam Allardyce has desired effect as Everton ease home against Huddersfield Read more\n\nThe frequency of such periods is, perhaps, the chief difference between them and Manchester City. This time, at least, there were mitigating factors.\n\nJoël Matip’s injury and Ragnar Klavan’s illness forced Klopp into a newlook formation in which Emre Can and Georgino Wijnaldum flanked Dejan Lovren in a three-man defence.\n\nWith Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson playing as wing-backs, Liverpool’s backline had an avant-garde look. But the shape was mostly anecdotal as Liverpool were fluid and devastating when in possession, which was most of the time.\n\nBrighton found it quite the brain-teaser. They were stumped by the visitors’ speed and movement, especially in the first half.\n\nSalah fired off the first shot after less than 30 seconds, signalling the fusillade that was to come.\n\nSalah and Firmino both went close again before Brighton exposed any uncertainty in Liverpool’s rejigged defence. That was in the 17th minute, but Glenn Murray miscued after Can and Lovren failed to cut out a cross by Izzy Brown. It was the last glimpse that the home side would get of Liverpool’s net before the match was put beyond them by two goals in 79 seconds.\n\nOn the half-hour, Can sent a powerful header into the net from a corner by Coutinho. Then Liverpool doubled their lead with a breakneck counterattack, Salah leading the charge before flipping the ball wide to Coutinho, whose low pass from the left was turned in by Firmino.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Emre Can heads Liverpool in front with half an hour played. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nWith Sadio Mané resting on the bench in advance of Wednesday’s decisive Champions League tie at home to Spartak Moscow, Coutinho was Liverpool’s ringmaster, tormenting Brighton with the sort of flourishes that prompted Barcelona try to sign him in the summer. Yet Liverpool’s habit of frittering away leads means opponents can always hope for a comeback.\n\nBrighton evidently still believed it was possible when they emerged after half-time, and their faith would have been rewarded within two minutes if not for a brilliant save by Simon Mignolet. Brown created the chance by sneaking into the space behind Alexander-Arnold, but Mignolet saved Murray’s close-range volley with his feet.\n\nBefore Brighton knew it, they were three goals down, Liverpool racing up the other end of the pitch for Firmino to finish emphatically after being served by Salah.\n\nThree minutes later, however, Brighton narrowed the gap. This time it was Liverpool who did not grasp what was happening. The referee, Graham Scott, awarded the home team a penalty for an offence he saw as the ball was floated in from a corner. Liverpool’s defenders looked bemused, but Murray asked no questions and converted from the penalty spot.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri and Mame Diouf lead fightback as Stoke sink Swansea Read more\n\nLiverpool did not disintegrate. They blew Brighton to pieces. Coutinho crowned his regal performance with a goal of craft and slyness.\n\nAnticipating that Brighton’s players would jump, the Brazilian drilled a 20-yard free-kick under the wall and into the net.\n\n“Credit to the analysts,” said Klopp, explaining that Liverpool’s backroom staff had tipped off Coutinho about the behaviour of Brighton’s wall. “But you still have to have the skill to do it,” added the manager in praise of the Brazilian, who scored a similar goal against West Ham United last year.\n\nHughton described the dilemma facing opposing teams when Coutinho is standing over a free-kick. “If you don’t jump, he whips it into the top corner,” he said. “You have to give the credit to the player.”\n\nLewis Dunk would have liked Coutinho to be credited with Liverpool’s fifth goal, too, otherwise the record must identify the Brighton defender as the culprit, as he inadvertently diverted the Brazilian midfielder’s shot into his own goal in the 89th minute."}, {"date":

the reasons for his recruitment were confirmed at a stroke. The 63-year-old may be a one-man guarantee against relegation but his new team now reside in the top half of the table. Perhaps panic, rather than necessity, accounted for his arrival, but this debut win had the stamp of classic Allardyce.\n\n“The fans, players, staff and owners can breathe a little easier,” said the first man to manage seven Premier League clubs after offering a snapshot of why the previous six had deemed him eminently employable. There was Allardyce’s trademark clean sheet, already equalling the tallies his predecessors, Ronald Koeman and David Unsworth, managed in the league, even if Huddersfield’s drought on the road, which dates back to their opening-day win at Crystal Palace, helped account for it.\n\n“Defensively did Huddersfield have a chance today?” asked Allardyce, aware of the answer to his own question. “That gave us a platform to go on and win the game.”\n\nRecord-breaking Sam Allardyce is off to a flying start at Everton Read more\n\nHe has long shown a capacity to win the winnable games, and home matches against promoted clubs on losing runs belong firmly in that category. “It is not about four losses in a row,” insisted the Huddersfield manager David Wagner. “Every game has its own story.”\n\nBut this was a sequel in the Allardyce saga. Few have procured more points from forgettable fare. “It could have been better for entertainment, more passing and moving, but we can build on that as we go on,” he said. Allardyce’s reputation for ugly effectiveness precedes him. He is likely to keep Everton up and it probably will not be pretty. One high-class goal was out of keeping with a low-calibre game. The pragmatist in Allardyce was never going to reject another that contained an element of luck.\n\nEqually, the opener illustrated the latent talent in Everton’s ranks. Cuco Martina recorded their first shot on target under the new manager. It was also the only one before the interval. Then came Allardyce’s first decisive intervention; Aaron Lennon and Gylfi Sigurdsson were ordered to stay further upfield. The Icelander, who had looked anything but a £45m player before then, duly delivered his most meaningful goal since his club-record transfer from Swansea. Wayne Rooney instigated the move, picking out Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who pierced the offside trap with a backheel flick for Sigurdsson to convert.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wayne Rooney impressed as Sam Allardyce’s on-field lieutenant for Everton. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nEverton soon acquired a taste for backheel flicks. Lennon released Calvert-Lewin with another, Jonas Lössl parrying the striker’s shot. With Huddersfield now committing more men forward, they were caught on the counterattack. Rooney sent Calvert-Lewin running clear and the 20-year-old’s shot was deflected over Lössl by the unwitting Mathias Jorgensen.\n\nIt meant the stand-in captain and youthful centre-forward were involved in both goals. While a less garlanded figure in the No10 shirt, Huddersfield’s Aaron Mooy, was the game’s outstanding individual in the first half, Rooney grew in influence. He was Allardyce’s on-field lieutenant, enforcing positional discipline as he barked orders. Everton were at pains to ensure they were not caught with too many men ahead of the ball. Indeed, Allardyce suggested they were initially too cautious, too scarred by past defeats.\n\nThe newcomer retained the personnel that Unsworth, now happily ensconced in the directors box, selected for the 4-0 win over against West Ham, but a 4-3-3 formation that became 4-5-1 out of possession was familiar to long-time Allardyce-watchers. Less typical, given his emphasis on dead-ball situations, were some wretched set-pieces from Sigurdsson.\n\nAlan Pardew frustrated as West Brom draw a blank against Crystal Palace Read more\n\nIt is easy to imagine where Allardyce’s attention may be concentrated. He and Everton have the feel of a marriage of convenience. Their circumstances produce strange bedfellows. There was the incongruous sight of Bill Kenwright, the committed Evertonian, hugging the Liverpool loyalist Sammy Lee, who has joined Allardyce’s backroom staff. Both had the sense not to embrace the nearby Duncan Ferguson.\n\nThere were no choruses of Allardyce’s name, except when the Huddersfield fans chanted first that Wagner was better and then thinner than his Everton counterpart. Allardyce nonetheless described his reception as “brilliant” and he got a louder welcome before kick-off than Speedo Mick, a fundraising Everton fan who appeared on the pitch in the swimming trunks that account for his nickname.\n\nIf Everton were sinking, Allardyce was appointed precisely because he can get imperilled teams buoyant again.

"report": "Talk of Burnley qualifying for Europe was dealt a sobering blow with defeat at improving Leicester, thanks to an early goal from Demarai Gray.\n\nIt has mainly been those outside of Turf Moor who have contemplated the possibility of a first European campaign for the club since 1960-61 but some fans have begun to dream following Sean Dyche’s side’s surprise start to the campaign, with the owners of one pub in the Lancashire town promising to rename their establishment the Royal Dyche should the team qualify for either the Europa League or Champions League.\n\nBurnley’s opponents were a reminder of what can be achieved against the odds and the 2015-16 Premier League champions continued their own upward trajectory with a 1-0 success on Saturday courtesy of Gray.But Leicester have impressed under Claude Puel, too, and this was a third win in his six matches in charge, while the loss saw Burnley slip to seventh in the table.\n\nDavinson Sánchez sent off but 10-man Tottenham earn a point at Watford Read more\n\nAfter victory against Tottenham in midweek Puel had warned his team not to underestimate Burnley and they heeded his advice by taking the lead after six minutes. Riyad Mahrez’s inswinging cross from the left looked to be creeping in at the far post, forcing Nick Pope to dive to his right and push the ball away. But he could only parry it into the path of the oncoming Gray, who hurt himself on the frame of the goal as he slid in to finish from point-blank range.\n\nLike Gray, Burnley recovered well and Chris Wood, a former Leicester player, quickly had a good chance to equalise. Phil Bardsley’s low cross was deflected into the path of Wood but the striker’s first touch with his chest was heavy and it allowed Kasper Schmeichel to smother the danger.\n\nJames Tarkowski headed wide from a corner and Johann Berg Gudmundsson worked Schmeichel again as the midway point of the first half approached. Burnley looked menacing once more after half an hour as Robbie Brady worked a shooting opportunity but Harry Maguire nicked the ball away as he pulled the trigger, resulting in a nasty-looking collision of shins. Both players laid on the ground in pain and after receiving some treatment Brady was carried from the field on a stretcher and replaced by Scott Arfield. The injury appeared to upset Burnley’s rhythm and Leicester assumed control. Mahrez worked Pope following a mazy run and Wes Morgan had an effort cleared off the line by Phil Bardsley.\n\nBurnley remained a threat, though, and Schmeichel had to be alert to deny Steven Defour and then Gudmundsson, who was put through on goal by Jeff Hendrick’s pass. Back at the other end, Gray came close to a second goal midway through the second half when he steered a shot goalwards which clipped the outside of a post, before Pope saved well from Marc Albrighton and Vardy.\n\nAlan Pardew frustrated as West Brom draw a blank against Crystal Palace Read more\n\nThere were chances at both ends in injury time, as Leicester survived a heart-stopping moment when Gudmundsson’s low cross deflected straight into the arms of Schmeichel, while Pope made a good save to deny Mahrez.\n\n“Overall it was tight,” said Dyche, who also confirmed that Brady had been taken to hospital for treatment. “It was a really soft goal to concede.

A ninth defeat in 12 Premier League matches, on a day when Stoke City appeared to be there for the taking, leaves Swansea City bottom of the table and prompted their manager to deliver a scathing assessment.\n\nIt is a wretched run of results at any level and raises serious questions about how much longer Swansea’s owners are willing to tolerate the sight of the club sliding inexorably towards the Championship. Clement expressed his hope that he would be given more time, yet he also gave the impression that he is as fed up as anyone.\n\nStoke were obliging opponents in many ways although Swansea never had enough about them to score again after conceding twice in the space of four chaotic first-half minutes. Xherdan Shaqiri and Mame Diouf scored those goals, punishing some abject defending after Wilfried Bony had netted against his former club.\n\nSam Allardyce has desired effect as Everton ease home against Huddersfield Read more\n\n“I believe we’ve gone bottom of the table and I can’t say that we’re unlucky,” Clement said. “We’ve lost 10 games now. It’s not been through misfortune. We deserve to be bottom because we’re not consistent enough through a 90-minute period.”\n\nLeroy Fer was at fault for Stoke’s first goal, with the midfielder carelessly losing possession 30 yards out, and Clement made the point that the defending was not much better prior to the home team’s second, when Swansea dropped far too deep as Peter Crouch flicked on for Diouf to hammer home. “Then, very characteristic of us at this point, mentally we’re not in a good state, you go down having led and we didn’t play well from that point,” he said.\n\nSwansea enjoyed plenty of possession in the second half, but as has been the case throughout the season, it was hard to see them scoring. Bony’s goal – a brilliantly taken first-time volley from Martin Olsson’s cross – was their first since October.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mame Biram Diouf scores Stoke’s second goal at the bet365 Stadium. Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nIt says it all that the closest the visitors came to equalising in the second period was when Jack Butland tipped over a header from Ryan Shawcross, the Stoke defender. “It’s the same thing,” Clement said. “We’re a toothless team. Offensively we’re nowhere near good enough, we don’t create enough, we don’t score enough. That’s our biggest issue.”\n\nWhen it was pointed out to Clement that he had been scathing of his own team, he said: “When I am scathing about my team I am scathing of myself. It is not me pointing the finger and saying: ‘It is his fault’. It is a collective effort. I cannot win without the players. So I am being more self-critical because I have to be better and get more out of this team.”\n\nThe key question is whether Clement, who had described this game as a Cup final beforehand, will get the opportunity. “Those kind of things are very much out of the hands of the manager or a coach,” he said.\n\nLeicester City’s Demarai Gray takes pains to sink Burnley Read more\n\n“That will always be down to the chairman and the ownership to make those decisions if the situation is going in a really bad direction and you can’t see any chance of changing it.\n\n“I believe I can [change it]. I showed last year I am capable of working at this level with 29 points over 19 games. It was a big effort. It is nowhere near as good this season.”\n\nFor Stoke, who were relieved to pick up their second victory in eight matches, the league table makes for much better reading now that they are up to 13th position. Shaqiri took his goal well following a lovely through ball from midfielder Joe Allen and the dangerous Diouf was close to adding a third when he headed the ball wide in the second half.\n\n“It would have been very easy to feel sorry for ourselves [after Bony’s goal],” Mark Hughes, Stoke’s manager, said. “But I didn’t see any evidence of that.”"}, {"date": "02/12/2017", "arena": "Vicarage Road",

give no quarter? Was it two points dropped for Spurs as their run without a Premier League win extended to four matches? Or was it a point earned, after being forced to play most of the second half with 10 men? For Watford, should they have taken greater advantage of the dismissal of Davinson Sánchez in the 52nd minute? Or had they proven they can go toe to toe with the big teams and compete?\n\nIn the end the managers were inclined to take a positive approach. Watford’s Marco Silva was proud of the performance and was aggrieved not have been awarded penalties in two contentious incidents. Meanwhile, his Tottenham counterpart, Mauricio Pochettino, was almost serene, singing the praises of his team for the way they kept attacking and insisting their current run is character forming.\n\nThe sending off of Sánchez was biggest moment, the defender dismissed for stopping a Richarlison counter-attack with an arm to the Brazilian’s face. Pochettino was disinclined to express much of an opinion, but suggested the contact was accidental. “I’m not going to complain, I’m not going to say anything,” he said. “Of course we are going to watch it back on video and I’ve had lots of messages on my phone, some are saying he should have been sent off, some say not. I think it was not his intention but maybe the arm touches the face of the player and that is the interpretation of the referee.”\n\nPaul Pogba sent off but Jesse Lingard helps Manchester United floor Arsenal Read more\n\nSánchez’s arm certainly did touch Richarlison face and Silva was in no doubt about the dismissal. His concern was more whether Watford should have had a spot-kick in the dying seconds after Richarlison’s cross rebounded off the arm of Eric Dier.\n\n“The defender stops Richarlison with an arm in his face, that is obvious,” the Watford manager said. “Maybe he wants to put it on another part of the body, but the arm goes into the face. Maybe also Dier didn’t want to put his hand on the ball, but we should have had one penalty.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Son Heung-min celebrates after scoring Tottenham’s equaliser but the visitors could not find a winner. Photograph: Hannah Mckay/Reuters\n\nWhen the teams were even in number, Spurs were dominant in possession while Watford menaced on the counter. It was Richarlison who was central to their approach, his pace and control an instant release whenever they were under pressure.\n\nHis breakaway run, hugging the chalk of the touchline, earned a corner from which the home side opened the scoring in the 13th minute. Tom Cleverley played Richarlison in and then delivered the corner that was headed home by Christian Kabasele, the Belgian defender eluding his marker, a sleeping Harry Kane.\n\nSpurs equalised 12 minutes later, seconds after Watford had had another loud penalty appeal. Ben Davies appeared to have barged Richarlison off the ball in a goalmouth scramble but as the Watford players threw their hands in the air, Kieran Trippier burst into the space left by the Brazilian. The full-back slipped a pass through to Christian Eriksen, the Dane darted to the touchline and then provided the perfect pull-back for Son Heung-min, who turned the ball home at the back post from six yards.\n\nSpurs might have scored just before the break with a Davies volley and came out in the second half with an assertiveness that looked set to pay dividends. The dismissal of Sánchez might have changed all that but Pochettino was pleased with the way his team dug in and continued to create opportunities. Trippier was at the heart of things and Moussa Sissoko blazing into the side-netting when put through.\n\nRoberto Firmino on target twice as Liverpool fire five past Brighton Read more\n\nAt the other end, Silva had to hold his breath along with the rest of the ground as Abdoulaye Doucouré’s imperious drive from a corner cannoned off the inside of the post and away from goal.\n\n“In the last few games all is against us, but this is a very good experience,” Pochettino said. “It’s important in football to sometimes feel frustration and in the future the team will be stronger.\n\n“We need to know that it’s not always easy. Sometimes a tough period is important because that’s when you build your character.”"}, {"date": "02/12/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 23531, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich

first clean sheet in 10 matches at least gave West Brom’s new manager something to build on.\n\nA frustrating afternoon that saw Albion thwarted on several occasions by the stand-in goalkeeper Julián Speroni ensured that Hodgson emerged the more satisfied, even as Crystal Palace set another unwanted record by becoming the first team to fail to score in 10 successive Premier League away games.\n\n“I’m disappointed we haven’t won,” said Pardew. “We tried to really unhinge them at the start but then we lost our way. I was really pleased with the second half. With a bit more belief around the box we could have won it.”\n\nHaving reached the FA Cup final only seven months earlier, the timing of Pardew’s departure from Selhurst Park three days before Christmas 2016 still rankles despite a record that saw them win just one of his final 11 league games to leave them in 17th place. That was exactly the position which West Brom found themselves in at kick off, having accrued fewer points than any other team in the division since the start of the year under Tony Pulis.\n\nEscape artist Tony Pulis runs out of time after West Brom fans lose patience | Barry Glendenning Read more\n\nPardew made just one change to the team that surrendered a 2-0 lead against Newcastle in midweek as Jay Rodriguez came in to an attacking 4-3-3 formation. West Brom’s supporters responded with a warm welcome for the manager who had promised to “free up” his new side at his unveiling this week, although apart from the opening 20 minutes and a spell at the start of the second half, the fans would have struggled to notice much difference.\n\nHal Robson-Kanu should have scored when Kieran Gibbs’ cross fell to him on the edge of the six-yard box, only for the Wales forward to scoop the ball over from close range. Palace, who were reduced to only five substitutes after Wayne Hennessey was injured in the warm-up, had secured their first away point of the season against Brighton on Tuesday but they looked shaky at the back, with Ahmed Hegazi heading wide from a corner.\n\nGiven that Palace’s last Premier League away goal came back in April against Liverpool, West Brom’s defenders were rarely troubled in the opening exchanges, although in Wilfried Zaha the visitors possess a match winner of real quality. Ben Foster was lucky to escape when his attempt to dribble around the forward failed and the goalkeeper used an illegal hand to get himself out of trouble. At the other end, Rodriguez breezed past Martin Kelly but could not evade Mamadou Sakho’s block when a goal seemed likely.\n\nAside from one Hegazi challenge on Zaha that could have resulted in a penalty, Palace had to wait until the dying moments of the first half to create a serious threat on goal, with Christian Benteke denied by Foster’s sharp save. The striker then headed the resulting corner straight at the goalkeeper.\n\nAs Pardew acknowledged, the loss of Gareth Barry after just half an hour seemed to have an unsettling effect on West Brom’s midfield but they came out for the second half in determined mood. A block from Joel Ward was required to keep out the impressive Sam Field, before Rodriguez was denied by Speroni after some delightful skill on the edge of the box.\n\nThe Argentinian had lost his place to Hennessey having started five league matches this season but showed he is still capable enough by turning away Salomón Rondón’s effort from a tight angle before thwarting Robson-Kanu’s drive. Palace are due to announce ambitious new plans to redevelop Selhurst Park’s main stand on Monday and survival in the top flight will be crucial to ensuring they can proceed. Theylacked ambition as West Brom attempted to find a winner, with Benteke guilty of failing to react quickly enough to decent crosses into the box on more than one occasion.\n\nRondón almost made them pay when his header went narrowly wide in the dying minutes after good work from substitute James McClean, as Palace held on to claim a point and move off the bottom of the table for the first time under Hodgson.\n\n“I’m not getting carried away but it was a good point,” said Hodgson, who revealed that Palace’s preparations for the game were disrupted when they had to be evacuated from their train to Birmingham on Friday after it broke down before being kept awake at their hotel by a noisy wedding. “It wasn’t the best way to prepare for a match but at least I’ll go home with a smile on my face.”"}, {"date": "02/12/2017", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59547, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

Manchester United demonstrated a remorseless edge in front of goal and yet could count the goalkeeper, David de Gea, as their most influential player. And it was one in which the joy of a first Premier League away win over a big six rival under José Mourinho was undercut by a senseless red card for Paul Pogba.\n\nWhat a mixed bag it was for the France midfielder. He had set up Antonio Valencia’s opening goal and strutted about the Emirates as though he owned the place. But on 74 minutes he lunged at Héctor Bellerín and planted his studs into the Arsenal defender’s leg. It drew the inevitable censure and the kicker is that Pogba will be suspended for next Sunday’s Manchester derby.\n\nArsenal 1-3 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nArsenal played a full part in a richly entertaining spectacle and they will wonder how they emerged with nothing. There were two principle reasons: the re-emergence of their defensive frailties, and De Gea. Arsenal rained 33 shots at the Spaniard’s goal, with 15 of them on target, but their only reward was Alexandre Lacazette’s close-range finish early in the second half to make it 2-1.\n\nAt that point, Arsenal looked set fair for the equaliser. But De Gea, who had made a string of excellent first-half saves, kept his best until last. His double stop to keep out Lacazette and Alexis Sánchez drew a sharp intake of breath. He finished with 14 saves, equalling a Premier League record. Is there even a question about his current pre-eminence in English football?\n\nJesse Lingard promptly added his second and United’s third on the counterattack and it was impossible to ignore the contrast in the attacking statistics. The visitors’ three goals came from four shots on target.\n\nArsenal had entered on a roll, their confidence pepped by the derby victory over Tottenham Hotspur and a feeling that they had located their groove – particularly on home turf. Theirs was a performance of vim and vigour but no team can offer such presents and expect to emerge unscathed.\n\nThe first was gift-wrapped by Laurent Koscielny. His floated cross-field pass for Sead Kolasinac was intercepted by Valencia and he moved it on to Pogba. Everyone in red was drawn to the midfielder – an illustration of the fear factor that has built around him – and, when he popped it back to Valencia, the defender had the time and space to shoot low through Petr Cech’s legs.\n\nUnited had scored only once in seven previous away games under Mourinho against big six clubs but here they were two up after 11 minutes. This time, Shkodran Mustafi was the Arsenal villain. Receiving possession as the last defender, he dawdled and was robbed by Lingard. The ball broke to Romelu Lukaku, who found Anthony Martial and his wonderful flick ushered in Lingard, who guided a first-time finish inside the far corner.\n\nTo add to their problem, Mustafi felt Lingard’s challenge and was forced off. “I don’t know what he has,” Arsène Wenger said waspishly when asked about Mustafi. “I don’t know what is wrong with him at all.”\n\nDavid de Gea brings greatness to bear for Manchester United amid Arsenal onslaught | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nWenger sent on Alex Iwobi, switched to 4-2-3-1 and almost immediately the flow of the game changed. It was a minor miracle how Arsenal did not score before the interval but De Gea refused to be beaten. Two of his first-half saves stood out. He managed to smuggle Lacazette’s close-range shot up and on to the crossbar – Granit Xhaka curled the rebound inches wide – while he pawed the ball away from the line after Sánchez’s free-kick had ricocheted off Lukaku.\n\nArsenal did not get the breaks but the crowd stayed with them and their belief did not drop. Eventually they got their reward when Aaron Ramsey touched back Mesut Özil’s cross and as United stopped and prayed for a flag, Lacazette shot past De Gea. Game on.\n\nThe outstanding Lingard hit a post on the break in the 52nd minute but it was Arsenal who looked the likelier scorer of the next goal. De Gea had other ideas. He had saved smartly from Iwobi before he threw out a hand to deny Lacazette and followed up by saving with his feet from Sánchez.\n\nUnited’s third was another horror show for Arsenal and, once again, Koscielny was implicated. He seemed to have Pogba under control only to be tricked and out-muscled by him on the touchline. Pogba crossed, Lingard tapped in.\n\nPogba would feel the red mist descend and there was still time for the referee, Andre Marriner, to wave away strong penalty appeals from the Arsenal substitute, Danny Welbeck, and Lacazette. Mourinho raged when Marriner chose only to caution Koscielny rather than dismiss him for a last-man foul on Lukaku. It was the game of the season, so far. When the dust settled, it was United who could smile."}, {"date": "29/11/2017", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59285, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech",

season, it was hard not to wonder if his delicious scooped finish over Jonas Lossl was merely part of the German’s protracted farewell in an Arsenal shirt. He had produced a breathtaking four-minute burst to break Huddersfield Town’s spirit when the game was in the balance and there must have been plenty of people here, not least Arsène Wenger, wincing at the thought of not getting to enjoy Özil’s many gifts next season.\n\nMan City v Southampton, Chelsea v Swansea, Stoke v Liverpool and more – as it happened Read more\n\nThe fact that there remains little sign of Özil choosing to extend his contract before it runs out next summer, with Barcelona and Manchester United reportedly keeping tabs on him, gave a highly productive evening for Arsenal a bittersweet tinge. Yes, there are days when the playmaker drifts through games, but few players are better to watch in this mood. Özil was superb, scoring once and creating goals for Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sánchez as Arsenal survived a brief wobble before continuing their recent resurgence with a ruthless destruction of Huddersfield.\n\nUltimately this was one of those wins that left Arsenal wondering why they are incapable of hitting these heights more consistently. Özil, brilliant but frustrating, is part of that. This team still has maddening tendencies and it feels slightly premature, with the cracks not fully repaired after a fraught start to the season, to declare that Arsenal will not suffer any more stumbles now that a corner has been turned.\n\nThey have, after all, given their critics generous amounts of ammunition and even Wenger, English football’s perennial optimist, was not entirely satisfied with his side after this 5-0 victory, noting that Huddersfield had chances to cancel out Alexandre Lacazette’s early strike before Özil took control. “We started well but we lost a bit of edge in our game,” Wenger said. “At the start of the second half we gave them one or two chances.” Petr Cech denied Collin Quaner and Steve Mounié, scrambling to his feet to push the latter’s deflected shot on to the crossbar.\n\nArsenal have done well to respond after being outplayed by Manchester City at the start of the month. Wenger’s side are fourth, with a four-point lead over Tottenham Hotspur after three consecutive wins and clean sheets, and in a good place before hosting Manchester United on Saturday. Arsenal have not lost a league game at home since the end of January, although Lacazette will be missed against José Mourinho’s side after suffering a groin injury that forced him off at half-time.\n\nThe striker had put Arsenal ahead by that point, sweeping a low shot past Lossl after being released by the excellent Aaron Ramsey in the third minute, and he almost added a second with a clever improvised lob later on. Wenger will have to be careful about how he tweaks his attack against United. Although Giroud scored twice after replacing Lacazette, he does not offer the same kind of speedy threat.\n\nSanti Cazorla’s Arsenal agony goes on after ninth operation on injury Read more\n\nBut Wenger will be confident. Some of Arsenal’s early invention was a joy to behold, all dainty one-touch passing and sharp movement off the ball to leave the home fans cooing at their side’s silkiness and Huddersfield wheezing. The visitors made six changes and lined up in a 5-4-1 system after almost holding City at the weekend, but they allowed Arsenal too much space and ended the night five points above the bottom three.\n\n“I think we are still in a position that is absolutely acceptable for us,” the Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, said. “There is nothing that worries me about losing to Arsenal away and to Manchester City.” Wagner could argue that Huddersfield were swept away by a unique talent. Illness kept Özil out of Arsenal’s win over Burnley, but he looked full of vim as he set about quelling Huddersfield’s attempts at insurrection.\n\nThe natives had grown restless when Giroud struck the woodwork after rounding Lossl. The tension was rising, yet Özil was inspired, teeing up Giroud for a simple finish after a sublime interchange with Sánchez. Soon Özil was crossing for Sánchez to clip past Lossl and then the German added a fourth, moving on to Ramsey’s pass and finishing with his instep.\n\nHuddersfield’s agony was complete when Giroud smashed in a fifth near the end. Arsenal, as has so often been the case in the latter part of Wenger’s reign, have a grip on fourth."}, {"date": "29/11/2017", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10302, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [37], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It is rousing displays of this nature, to earn a fourth win in five games, that have won Sean Dyche so many admirers. This was almost the absolute away performance as Burnley defeated Bournemouth at their own game to leapfrog Tottenham and swagger into sixth place in the Premier League, three points off fourth.\n\nIt is no wonder the landlord at the Princess Royal pub in Burnley has mooted the idea of renaming the hostelry after Dyche if they end up in the Champions League spots come the end of this rollercoaster ride in May. These are heady days in Lancashire.\n\n‘All you need in a leader’: Sean Dyche’s stock keeps rising at Burnley Read more\n\n“It’s absolutely amazing times for our fans, they definitely should enjoy all of this,” the Burnley manager said. “We’re not trying to be Barcelona but we are trying to mix our football and be effective in as many ways as possible. I am super pleased. The pride I have in the players and their professionalism is off the scale.”\n\nFor Burnley, a team so comfortable in their own skin, this was the perfect response after a cruel defeat by Arsenal on Sunday. Dyche said as much, admitting his team had answered any questions of their resolve to bounce back here. For Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe there was to be no 40th birthday party, after goals by Chris Wood and Robbie Brady halted their three-match unbeaten run, with Joshua King’s late strike merely a consolation. “I joked with him before about ruining his birthday but I didn’t actually mean it,” Dyche said with a smile.\n\nFor Howe, who stood in Dyche’s shoes before him at Turf Moor between January 2011 and October 2012, Bournemouth’s sluggish start – in particular – made uneasy viewing, with a spell of concerted Burnley pressure resulting in the visitors going close. Brady fired an effort into the side-netting before Wood headed against the crossbar. Then Asmir Begovic made a fingertip save to keep out Wood’s downward header from Phil Bardsley’s centre.\n\nBurnley were in the groove, slick and savvy. Bournemouth, meanwhile, were off-colour and all at sea in defence. The next Burnley attack was of Bournemouth’s own doing. When Steve Cook surrendered possession, Wood strode forward before unselfishly poking the ball across goal in search of an onrushing Jeff Hendrick but Cook flew in to block his shot with his legs.\n\nThe Bournemouth defender was not so fortunate the next time. After a one-two with Jack Cork, Brady’s cross cannoned off Cook’s right leg and Wood reacted quickest to slot home and punish a lackadaisical backline. It was the first goal Bournemouth had conceded for 346 minutes.\n\nThey struggled to frighten the Burnley defence and Howe waited until 58 minutes to tweak his personnel, introducing the 20-year-old midfielder Lewis Cook in place of Harry Arter. Bournemouth badly needed a spark and it was one of the old guard as such, though, who almost delivered it with the captain, Simon Francis – back in the starting lineup after serving a one-match ban – rising highest to head wide from Jordon Ibe’s inswinging corner.\n\nJermain Defoe replaced winger Marc Pugh but the striker had barely been on the field a couple of minutes when Burnley doubled their advantage. They poured forward from inside their own half at pace, with Hendrick supplying Brady, who drifted inside before blasting a right-footed effort beyond Begovic. Burnley were rampant and Cork, twice on loan at Bournemouth from Chelsea as a teenager, fizzed an effort wide from 25 yards.\n\nBournemouth eventually stirred 12 minutes from time. Francis’s cross found Callum Wilson, who chested the ball to Defoe before the England striker hooked the ball towards the far post, where King was lurking to prod home his second league goal of the season. “The disappointing thing for me is the manner of the performance,” said Howe. “We never truly got going at any stage of the game.”\n\nDyche nibbled away at his fingers through five added minutes, barking Brady towards the corner flag, but his team held on to claim a deserved victory."}, {"date": "29/11/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41365, "home_team": {"name":

In a week during which two of Swansea City’s relegation rivals will appoint new managers, a narrow away defeat against the reigning champions, courtesy of Antonio Rüdiger’s second-half header, does not sound like the worst result.\n\nYet the manner of this performance – Swansea barely mustered a shot in anger – and with the Welsh club now the only team in the bottom five not to have parted company with their manager this season, it is clear that Clement’s time is running out fast.\n\nThe sending off of his counterpart Antonio Conte just before half-time for a bizarre tantrum at the fourth official had perhaps given Clement a glimmer of hope that this could be his night on his return to Stamford Bridge. Those hopes were dashed when Chelsea finally took the lead and never looked like surrendering it as they maintained their faint chances of retaining the title they won with such style last season.\n\nRaheem Sterling earns Manchester City dramatic late win over Saints Read more\n\n“The most disappointing thing was the nature of the goal – there were players that had their backs turned, they weren’t in the right position,” Clement said. “What I was pleased about was that we didn’t fold and in the last 10 minutes we started to come back into the game and the players had the belief that they could create something. It was disappointing because we are desperate for points and on another night we could have got something.”\n\nClement selected the same team that drew with Bournemouth on Saturday, with a third consecutive start in midfield for Renato Sanches, the Portugal international on loan from Bayern Munich, with Jordan Ayew also tasked with providing Wilfried Bony with support in attack.\n\nFor the first time in a Premier League match since he arrived at the club, Conte opted to leave César Azpilicueta on the bench. Rüdiger took his place, with Eden Hazard also surprisingly left on the bench – after his master class at Liverpool – in favour of Willian and a recall for Cesc Fàbregas in place of Danny Drinkwater.\n\nThis was Clement’s second return with Swansea to the club where he spent more than a decade working as a youth coach. Before the match, tributes were paid to his former colleague Dermot Drummy, with whom Clement worked for Chelsea’s Under-18s side. He admitted afterwards that the had been “devastated” by the news of Drummy’s death on Tuesday, with fate dictating that he would be back in southwest London the following day.\n\nSwansea’s owners are rumoured to have sounded out Tony Pulis over his potential availability should they decide to dispense with Clement, although on this evidence, even the Welshman would have his work cut out solving Swansea’s defensive issues as Chelsea repeatedly created chances throughout the first period. Álvaro Morata came closest to breading the deadlock with a header in the 22nd minute that was turned over by Lukas Fabianski. The Swansea goalkeeper produced an even better save after Morata connected on the volley with Fàbregas’s pinpoint cross, while Marcos Alonso wasted another great opportunity from a corner.\n\nSam Allardyce watches on as Wayne Rooney hat-trick seals rare Everton win Read more\n\nWhen Alfie Mawson’s touch diverted a cross and the referee Neil Swarbrick awarded a goal-kick, Conte’s frustrations boiled over. He was sent to the stands after shouting directly in the face of the fourth official Lee Mason as Swansea somehow made it to the break with parity.\n\n“After the game it’s right to apologise for what happened,” said Conte, who watched the rest of the game from the dressing room. “I saw that Swansea were wasting time and I said this a few times to the fourth official but I didn’t see that something had changed. I was frustrated about this situation and tried to tell him again and the referee took this decision. For sure I made a mistake but during the game I suffered with my players. It’s a pity.”\n\nIt was no surprise to see Leroy Fer replace Sanches at half time given the number of times the 20-year-old had given the ball away in a hapless opening 45 minutes, with Clement later admitting Sanches is struggling with confidence. But within 10 minutes of the restart, Chelsea were in front thanks a slice of good fortune as N’Golo Kanté’s shot from just outside the box deflected off Bony and straight into the path of Rüdiger to head home.\n\nThe return of Victor Moses after six weeks out with a hamstring injury – swiftly followed by the introduction of Hazard and Drinkwater – was Chelsea’s attempt to kill off the game. The change almost had the desired effect as Swansea were once again forced to scramble the ball away from under their own crossbar after good work from the Belgian.\n\nAt the other end, the substitute Wayne Routledge had a golden opportunity to rescue something from the game but his cross was, like Swansea, severely lacking in quality."}, {"date": "29/11/2017", "arena": "Goodison Park",

Wayne Rooney popped up with his first ever hat-trick for Everton, proving that timing, like class, is probably permanent. The 32-year-old even managed to score the third of his goals from his own half with one of the cleanest first-time strikes you will ever see, which must have convinced the watching Sam Allardyce there is life in the old dog yet.\n\nSomewhat belatedly it also appears David Unsworth might be getting the hang of this caretaking business. When Allardyce takes over his seventh Premier League club he will do so with Everton five points clear of the relegation positions, Unsworth’s parting gift having been the second win of his eight matches in charge and perhaps even more remarkably the first clean sheet. Everton may not be quite as bad as a week of relentlessly bad publicity has suggested, though of course it is possible that West Ham are in even bigger trouble than anyone imagined.\n\nWayne Rooney admits Everton wonder goal ‘might be my best ever’ Read more\n\nRooney helped himself to a couple of first-half goals as a much-improved Everton took hold of the game, all the more impressive since the captain’s present interpretation of the No10 role involves spending much of the game in his own half. He doesn’t normally expect to score from there, but when the ball found him in the centre circle after Joe Hart had left his area to clear from Dominic Calvert-Lewin, his immediate and correct instinct was to send it back strong and true, high enough to elude two West Ham defenders but firm and low enough to stay on target.\n\nBy the time Ashley Williams had headed in a late corner Allardyce must have been wondering which particular fires he is supposed to be fighting. His first two league games are against Huddersfield at home and Liverpool away, which should give a clearer picture. West Ham at the moment, much to the chagrin of David Moyes returning to Goodison almost unnoticed, look as if anyone could beat them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wayne Rooney scores from inside his own half. Photograph: BT Sport\n\nMoyes is on the sort of six-month contract at West Ham that Allardyce successfully resisted when Everton first approached him. He wanted a permanent situation, Everton were initially reluctant, until a few more woeful results persuaded them they were in no position to argue.\n\nSam Allardyce to take charge as Everton manager in next 48 hours Read more\n\nAs a result Allardyce has won an 18-month deal, a sort of halfway house, which is not bad going for a 63-year-old who has been at more Premier League clubs than Harry Redknapp (five). It means Allardyce will have thrashed out more lucrative terms too, which must have been some small consolation as he sat in the stand surveying the minimal difference in quality between one of his former sides and his new one.\n\nJordan Pickford made the first save of the game after 15 minutes, though in truth it was probably more of a cross from Pablo Zabaleta. The full-back should never have been allowed so much space on the right, but after Cuco Martina needlessly conceded a throw when the ball was running dead anyway, Everton missed a succession of chances to clear and would have been embarrassed had Zabaleta’s cross found someone in the middle. It didn’t, there was no one in the middle, which is probably the reason why West Ham came to Goodison two points below the home side in the league.\n\nThe visitors’ problems deepened midway through the first half when Pedro Obiang whisked the ball off Gylfi Sigurdsson’s toe but only succeeded in sending Calvert-Lewin bearing down on Hart. The goalkeeper dived at the forward’s feet a fraction after Calvert-Lewin had poked the ball around him, inevitably conceding a penalty. Hart was equal to Rooney’s initial spot-kick, diving to his right to beat the shot away, but the ball ran loose and it was a simple matter for Rooney to follow up and head in the rebound into the open net.\n\nIf there was an element of luck about the way the home side took the lead there was absolutely nothing wrong with the way they fashioned a second, a well-constructed team goal that might come to represent a much-needed high point of Unsworth’s caretakership. Beginning on halfway near the right touchline, Aaron Lennon did well to both keep the ball in play and send Jonjoe Kenny up the inside channel with a neat flick.\n\nSadio Mané and Mohamed Salah see Liverpool past limited Stoke Read more\n\nKenny found Tom Davies making a diagonal run into space to continue the attack, and though West Ham had men in position to cut out his low cross, the ball found its way through to Rooney for a firm finish and a second goal of the night. Everton survived a scare on the stroke of the interval when Manuel Lanzini’s corner ran across the face of goal, but once again there was no one on hand from West Ham to take advantage.\n\nThe visitors looked a little livelier in the second half, Aaron Cresswell skimming a shot against Pickford’s bar and the disappointing Marko Arnautovic shooting tamely at the goalkeeper from a better position than he probably realised. They were rewarded with a penalty on the hour, after Williams’s sprawling challenge was adjudged to have brought down Diafra Sakho, but though the decision was debatable Pickford rendered discussion irrelevant with a fine diving save from Lanzini’s shot. Goodison erupted with relief, little aware that in terms of vintage Rooney, the best was still to come."}, {"date": "29/11/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53407, "home_team": {"name":

seismic day Sergio Agüero pulled back his right foot to score the goal against QPR that won Manchester City the league in 2012. Raheem Sterling was at the front of the chase and it was difficult to keep count of the number of team-mates, substitutes and coaches trying to keep up. Even Benjamin Mendy, currently rehabilitating after major knee surgery, was in pursuit, wearing a pink hat and trying to get a selfie.\n\nSterling ran the whole length of the pitch after the dramatic curled finish, five minutes into stoppage time, to maintain City’s long winning sequence and Pep Guardiola looked close to the point of spontaneous combustion as he hared on to the playing surface, pumping his fists, after the final whistle sounded moments later. Guardiola was so fired up the referee Paul Tierney had to tell him to calm down. Still breathless, City’s manager apologised in the post-match press conference and insisted he had merely been telling Nathan Redmond he was a great player as they came off together. Arms flapping, bellowing in the player’s face, it was a strange form of congratulations.\n\nThose moments will be replayed on television but when everything was done the real story here was that City had saved themselves with one of those moments of late, exhilarating drama that teams tend to look back on at the end of a championship season. It was the third game in a row that Sterling has scored a late winner and his latest intervention made it 19 successive victories in all competitions for Guardiola’s side, including a club-record 12 in the Premier League.\n\nIt was difficult not to sympathise with Southampton, who had equalised via Oriol Romeu in the 75th minute, but City should know from all those years of Manchester United dominance that champions have a knack of scoring late winners. It is becoming a habit for City and it means an eight-point lead at the top of the table, with a vastly superior goal difference to add to the equation.\n\nThey also showed here that they know how to grind out wins when they are below their best, another useful trait for any team with aspirations to win the league, and if this was a test of their resolve they demonstrated again, as the City fans like to sing, they will “fight to the end”. Can they play more stylishly? Very much so, but that felt like a minor detail after the jubilant scenes at the end. “Mendy’s crazy,” Guardiola volunteered. “He has a six-month injury and he is running like that … disaster!” Yet the manager was smiling, at last, adding that he was too unfit at the age of 46 to join in the chase himself.\n\nUltimately it will not hugely matter to Guardiola that this was one of his team’s least fluent performances, that Vincent Kompany had a particularly difficult night or that Southampton also had two golden chances to score in the first half, both originating from corners. Wesley Hoedt headed against the crossbar from the first one and Maya Yoshida, inside the six-yard area again, volleyed over when City were caught out again. Mauricio Pellegrino described the manner of Southampton’s defeat as “painful” and the lesson for his players was they cannot be so generous with their finishing at the highest level.\n\nGuardiola had begun the match with David Silva given a rare break, Ilkay Gündogan starting his first league fixture in almost a year and Leroy Sané missing because of a virus. Agüero and Gabriel Jesus found it difficult to link up together and City were fortunate, after their least impressive 45-minute period of the season, to take the lead early in the second half when Virgil van Dijk turned Kevin De Bruyne’s free-kick past Fraser Forster. It was a clear own-goal despite some strange attempts to credit it to De Bruyne.\n\nSam Allardyce watches on as Wayne Rooney hat-trick seals rare Everton win Read more\n\nSouthampton certainly made it a more awkward night than many people might have anticipated, with Mario Lemina catching the eye in midfield and Ryan Bertrand also impressive on the left flank. On this evidence, Forster appears to have recovered from his recent bad spell. Romeu had a splendid game and it was a brilliant touch from the substitute Sofiane Boufal to set up the equaliser. There have not been too many occasions when Fabian Delph has been caught out since he took up his new role as an experimental left-back but this was one. Boufal killed the ball dead, turned away from his opponent and picked out Romeu to fire in a rising shot from 10 yards.\n\nWhen the electronic board went up at the end of normal time it showed there would be a minimum five minutes of stoppages. And then the ball was at Sterling’s feet with roughly 20 seconds to go and, from a tight space, his shot was curling away from Forster’s dive with just the right amount of bend. Mendy got his selfie and was wearing a daft grin as he limped back to an ecstatic dugout."}, {"date": "29/11/2017", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 29423, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lee Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Martins Indi", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxim Choupo-Moting", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jakob Haugaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramadan Sobhi Ahmed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77, 83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This will not rank alongside Liverpool’s most memorable wins of the season. Some of their victories have been devastating displays of attacking football, the sort that make you glad to be a fan. This 3-0 victory against a desperate Stoke City side was not much more than efficient, earned by goals from Sadio Mané and a brace from the substitute Mohamed Salah, but it might end up being among their most satisfying three points.\n\n“It was well deserved, but it was hard work,” said Jürgen Klopp after the game, which might be a little charitable to their opponents, who hardly presented the most fearsome and doughty foes. But it will nonetheless be encouraging for Liverpool that they looked pretty comfortable throughout against a team that set out to frustrate them.\n\nMesut Özil provides the inspiration as Arsenal hammer Huddersfield Read more\n\nIt could have been different had the referee Martin Atkinson sent off Simon Mignolet in the first half, though. Mignolet rushed out of his goal and hacked down Mame Biram Diouf as the forward tried to round the keeper just outside the area but, as the whole stadium prepared themselves for the sight of a red card, only a yellow emerged.\n\nThe rules around sendings-off in those circumstances were relaxed last year, meaning not all such fouls should be automatically considered as red cards. But even though Diouf’s run was angled slightly away from goal and there were defenders roughly in the same postcode, had Mignolet’s boot not intervened he would have had an open goal.\n\nPredictably enough, Klopp had few complaints, but Mark Hughes did. “That’s the key moment in the game,” the Stoke manager said. “I just don’t understand why the officials didn’t see it for what it was. At that point it would’ve been 1-1 and game on. Usually in those situations the home team gets the benefit of the doubt, but we didn’t get that many times this evening.”\n\nHughes’s complaints might have carried a little more weight if his team had not been so poor, and he should probably have been more irked about their defending than the officials, but Stoke undoubtedly had the rough end of things.\n\nLiverpool’s opening goal was not without controversy, either. The Stoke fans were already unhappy that Alberto Moreno had not been penalised for a challenge on Xherdan Shaqiri, but their ire was raised further when the referee’s assistant ruled that Joe Gomez had kept the ball in on the right byline. Replays suggested at least 9/10ths of the ball had crossed the line, so they may have had a point, but they should be more angry with the way their defence stood still when Solanke neatly laid off the cross to Mané, who delicately lifted it over Lee Grant and into the net. “The one thing you want is for the referee to get the key decisions right, and in my opinion he didn’t,” Hughes said.\n\nUltimately any refereeing controversy was rendered moot by Stoke’s profligacy and Liverpool’s ruthlessness. Joe Allen missed two fine chances in the second half, one perhaps unluckily deflected wide but the second hoofed way over the bar from around 10 yards out.\n\nChris Wood has Burnley galloping to victory at all-at-sea Bournemouth Read more\n\nAside from those chances Liverpool were broadly in control, not necessarily because of their own brilliance (afterwards Klopp said they should have done more with the ball and been tighter at the back), but more due to Stoke’s inadequacies.\n\nWith 13 minutes remaining, Liverpool scored again. Mané made Ryan Shawcross look foolish on the right side of the area, zipping around him like a speedboat circling an oil tanker, before clipping a cross to the substitute Salah, who set himself perfectly and hammered an unstoppable volley into the roof of the net.\n\nIt was 3-0 a few minutes later. More deeply questionable defending saw Erik Pieters woefully misjudge a header back to Grant, then Salah leapt on the ball and tucked it home with the confidence of a man in the form of his life. Which, as it happens, he is.\n\nAll that was left to do was for Hughes to bring on Charlie Adam, as if to remind Liverpool that their team have not always been about lightning fast, dynamic young colts. The away fans spent the remainder of the game merrily singing Christmas songs and suggesting that relegation is on the cards for Stoke.

accused a minority of Crystal Palace supporters of seeking to attend the clubs’ derby “intent on causing disorder” after two stewards were taken to hospital following clashes outside the Amex stadium just after the match had kicked off.\n\nJamie Vardy sparks Leicester victory as Tottenham Hotspur slip up again Read more\n\nA number of visiting Palace fans were denied entry to the ground despite having legitimate tickets with their hand-written names for the clubs’ first top-flight collision since 1981, after trouble broke out at around 7.48pm. A statement issued by Brighton suggested “a number of Crystal Palace fans had travelled to the stadium without tickets, arriving after kick-off, some with the aim of forcing entry into the away end”. The away section, with its allocation of 2,000 seats, was not full.\n\nThe decision was made to close the turnstiles at 7.51pm, six minutes into the game, in conjunction with Sussex Police with no further fans permitted entry into the ground in the interest of public safety. That left a group of around 150 fans, some with tickets, being escorted back to Falmer station and on to Brighton, with “several stewards” suffering minor injuries. “We hope the two stewards hospitalised in the disorder have not suffered serious injuries,” said the Albion chief executive, Paul Barber. “The disorder was caused by a minority of individuals who attempted to gain entry to the stadium without tickets.\n\n“Thanks to the swift action of the club’s stewarding team, supported by Sussex police, we avoided further, major disorder and, while some genuine fans were left extremely disappointed and unable to get into the stadium, the correct decisions were made.” The club will be sharing CCTV images with Sussex police, the Metropolitan police and Palace, who are expected to issue their own statement on Wednesday, in order to identify the individuals involved in the disorder. The Football Association will also seek to clarify how smoke bombs and flares were smuggled into the away section despite the usual security checks before kick-off.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anthony Knockaert, left, and Wilfried Zaha battle for the ball. Photograph: Mark Kerton/Action Plus via Getty Images\n\nIn truth there were more booms from the pyrotechnics than credible shots at goal, with this a messy scrap of a derby, littered with basic and angst-ridden errors, a blur of committed blocks which denied the occasion any real rhythm or attacking quality. Brighton will sense an opportunity missed against the division’s bottom side. Palace could celebrate a first clean sheet in a Premier League game since the penultimate match of last season – and their first outside Selhurst Park since March – though Roy Hodgson’s satisfaction at that achievement should be tempered by the reality his side will go into December without an away goal to their name. That is a mystifying statistic, given the attacking players in their ranks, and yet another unwanted record.\n\n“We did defend well and, with the firepower we think we have, we could have done more,” said the visitors’ manager. “The opportunities were there. We got in positions but didn’t capitalise.” The best had been eked out just before the quarter-hour mark. Wayne Hennessey’s punt downfield was flicked on by Christian Benteke – on his first start since damaging knee ligaments in September – for Wilfried Zaha to collect. Lewis Dunk choked the forward’s touch only for the ball to break loose and invitingly for Benteke. Mathew Ryan conjured a fine save to deny the Belgian and his response from the rebound, turning Zaha’s shot behind with the forward anticipating easy plunder, was more impressive still.\n\nNewcastle United handed a point by West Bromwich Albion’s unlucky Evans Read more\n\nRyan is making a habit of such excellence having mustered a similarly impressive double save at Old Trafford on Saturday. “We haven’t allowed opposition a lot of chances but, when the chances do come, you need a goalkeeper to get you out of jail,” said Chris Hughton. His own frustration was born of sloppiness with the ball, though Hennessey ended the busier of the two goalkeepers. Dunk, Pascal Gross and José Izquierdo all tested the Welshman. When he was beaten by Glenn Murray’s header from an Anthony Knockaert corner, Andros Townsend loitered on a post to batter the ball away.\n\nWhile Brighton bask in mid-table, Palace will cling to a three-match unbeaten run – a sign of progress in the context of a miserable season – as evidence of improvement, even if their game of catch-up still feels daunting. A collision with West Bromwich Albion awaits on Saturday when their former manager, Alan Pardew, should be in situ at The Hawthorns.

It is hard to reach any other conclusion after Mauricio Pochettino’s side suffered a third successive away defeat in the league for the first time since 2014 when Tim Sherwood was in charge, leaving Spurs facing the prospect of being 16 points behind Manchester City by the time they run out at Vicarage Road on Saturday.\n\nMauricio Pochettino slams Tottenham’s lack of fight after loss at Leicester City Read more\n\nTottenham, quite simply, have lost their way domestically. They have collected only four points from their last five league fixtures and are unrecognisable from the team that comprehensively outplayed Real Madrid at Wembley. Pochettino was clearly bitterly upset with this latest setback and did not hold back afterwards as he accused his players of lacking fight during a “sloppy” first-half performance that featured two wonderful Leicester City goals.\n\nJamie Vardy scored the first, registering the 100th league goal of his career to silence the chants of the Tottenham supporters who had taunted him relentlessly in the first 10 minutes about his wife’s presence “in the jungle”, and Riyad Mahrez added an exquisite second on the stroke of half-time to put Leicester on their way to a first home league win over Tottenham since 2002, when they were playing at Filbert Street.\n\nPlay Video 0:55 Mauricio Pochettino reflects on 'very poor' Spurs – video\n\nAlthough Spurs were poor in that first half, Moussa Sissoko and Dele Alli squandered excellent chances to score in between Leicester’s goals and in many ways that profligacy was the story of their night. Christian Eriksen was guilty of a bad miss just before Harry Kane pulled a goal back with 11 minutes remaining and then Fernando Llorente, who is still looking for his first Tottenham goal, should have made it 2-2. Instead the Spaniard lifted his shot over the bar from only four yards out and the expressions in the Spurs dugout said it all.\n\nThere was still time for one last bit of drama deep into injury-time. Danny Rose, making only his second Premier League appearance of the season, went to ground in the area following a challenge from Wilfred Ndidi. At first glance it looked like a penalty but Anthony Taylor, the referee, waved away the Spurs appeals and a few seconds later Leicester were celebrating three valuable points.\n\nClaude Puel, Leicester’s manager, described it as their best performance since he took over and hailed the “two fantastic goals” that lit up the first half. Vardy’s was a beauty and arrived following a superb lofted pass from Marc Albrighton. Running in behind Davinson Sánchez, Vardy stretched out his right leg to steer a controlled volley over the head of Hugo Lloris, who was caught in no man’s land as the ball sailed over his head, and it was no surprise that the striker set off in the direction of the Spurs fans, cupping a hand to his ear.\n\nWith the elegant Vicente Iborra imperious in the centre of midfield, Pochettino scrapped his three-man central defence and pushed Eric Dier further forward as Spurs tried to gain a foothold. Kasper Schmeichel then saved impressively from Sissoko and Alli before Mahrez, with a moment of brilliance, gave Leicester some breathing space. With Rose caught upfield, Mahrez cut inside Jan Vertonghen and glided across the edge of the area before curling a left-footed shot from 20 yards that arced into the far corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jamie Vardy celebrates the opening goal with a message to Tottenham’s travelling fans. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters\n\nSpurs were up against it and Pochettino went for broke in the second half. At one stage Tottenham were virtually playing with five attackers as Son Heung-min, Érik Lamela and Llorente all came off the bench to join Alli and Kane.\n\nLamela, who was making his first appearance in 13 months after injury, had an instant impact, setting up Kane’s goal with a clever pass that the England international thumped past Schmeichel. It was his 16th goal of the season but not enough to prevent Spurs from losing again on the road."}, {"date": "28/11/2017", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20552, "home_team": {"name":

Vicarage Road on a night when they might, Mourinho suggested, have had seven or eight. Poetic licence perhaps but then the idea this United team are built to strangle the life out of their opponents has always been a little awry given the depth of attacking talent, and the brilliance of Paul Pogba when he plays as he did here.\n\nJamie Vardy sparks Leicester victory as Tottenham Hotspur slip up again Read more\n\nUnited had looked like running away from Watford as Ashley Young enjoyed an early festive return to Vicarage Road, scoring two lovely goals. The home team never gave up though, dragging it back to 3-2 before Jesse Lingard took the game away with a sublime late fourth goal, weaving his way from his own half to finish in front of a delirious away end.\n\nThis match had been billed as a meeting of young, hopeful Portuguese tyro and old, toxic Portuguese grandmaster. In the event it was a messy, fun affair in front of a boisterous crowd. Vicarage Road has been steadily wrestled into gleaming Premier League shape, with the new stand looming along one side, the groovy looking fishbowl-style boxes in each corner and that close, crackly atmosphere you only get in an urban ground packed in between houses.\n\nUnited have a tricky run ahead and this felt like a vital game from the start such is the pressure of Manchester City’s white heat at the top of the table and the clinch already for the remaining Champions League spots.\n\nPlay Video 1:46 Mourinho: 'No complaints with Lukaku' – video\n\nMourinho gave Marcus Rashford a rest after four games in 14 days. United also made the expected shift to three at the back, a common ploy against opponents who tend to set up that way.\n\nThere may have been more illustrious backlines in United’s history than a depleted Rojo-Smalling-Lindelof and Watford set out to press high early on. At times Richarlison likes to man-mark one of the centre-halves and he ran at Victor Lindelof early on, all eager, bounding menace.\n\nRicharlison narrowly failed to get a toe on Kiko Femenía’s low cross from the right as Watford started with energy and enterprise. Abdoulaye Doucouré and Will Hughes had an early grip of midfield. Marvin Zeegelaar, wearing his special I’ve-met-Andy Carroll white face mask, was a threat on the right.\n\nAt which point United killed the game. It was brutal, high-class, and helped by some surprisingly scruffy defending. The first goal arrived after 19 minutes via a brilliant piece of opportunism from Young. Lingard made a nice run through the centre-forward position. The ball broke to Femenía, who failed to control it. Young swung his right foot, connected sweetly and pinged a low, hard, daisy-cutter past Heurelho Gomes into the corner.\n\nIt was Young’s first goal away from Old Trafford since March 2015. Six minutes later he had his second. Pogba set off on a driving run through the heart of the midfield. Doucouré dragged him back. And from 25 yards Young sidled up and curled a wonderful free-kick into the top corner, a perfect execution from a player who scored a few of those for Watford a decade ago.\n\nYoung was recently offered a new contract that could keep him at United until the age of 34. Not a bad Indian summer for a player who was famously rejected by the Watford academy for being too small.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jesse Lingard, left, twists through the Watford defence before scoring Manchester United’s fourth goal.

He nudged an instant pass to Anthony Martial, who ran on and finished expertly.\n\nThe away end gurgled with delight, Watford’s heads dropped and for a while Pogba seemed to have complete control of midfield, always ready to find the right pass.\n\nJosé Mourinho delighted by Manchester United’s firepower at Watford Read more\n\nLingard should have scored but saw Gomes make a brilliant, sprawling save. Richarlison hit the top of the bar with a header but at half-time Watford trooped off looking utterly drained, picked off by United’s razor edge.\n\nThe home side threw themselves gamely into the second half, although they might have been picked off on the break, too, as Pogba continued to link the play with real elan. Nemanja Matic limped off, as did a disconsolate Hughes, followed by Martial, rested for the trip to Arsenal on Saturday.

With Alan Pardew poised to become the club’s new manager, goals by Hal Robson-Kanu and Sam Field put West Bromwich Albion on course for their first win since August. But instead Megson’s caretaker stint closed with a draw, as a two-goal lead was whittled away by a Newcastle United side also craving a change of form.\n\nCiaran Clark cut the deficit by heading into the net in the 59th minute and then, seven minutes from time, Jonny Evans deflected a free-kick by Matt Ritchie into his own goal. Newcastle avoided a fifth straight defeat and Albion’s quest for a victory goes on even if their search for a manager has ended. “It’s a right kick in the whatsits,” said Megson of the lost lead.\n\nIn the first match here since Tony Pulis was put out of Albion’s misery, Megson initially presented a good case for being kept on. He had said that Saturday’s encouraging 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur reawakened his passion for management eight years after he last performed a No1 role and in the first half here he endeared himself to the home crowd, who sang his praises as the players trooped off at the interval.\n\nAlbion, more enterprising than under Pulis, took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Robson-Kanu, the only alteration that Megson had made to the lineup that started at Wembley. The Welshman headed powerfully into the net from close range after a dainty cross from the left by Kieran Gibbs, who, in turn, had run on to a raking crossfield ball by Evans.\n\nCrystal Palace hold Brighton but flares in crowd may prompt FA sanction Read more\n\nComing just before the break the goal was well-timed and, what is more, it was deserved, as Albion were the brighter side after a drab start. Rafael Benítez, eager to stimulate an upturn from his side, had made five changes to the lineup that lost 3-0 at home to Watford on Saturday, including in goal, where Karl Darlow was drafted in for his first league appearance of the campaign.\n\nDarlow was motionless in the 19th minute when a curling shot from 25 yards by Salomón Rondón left him helpless. The goalkeeper was grateful to see it skim the top of the bar.\n\nOther than that, the main moments of quality in the first half came from Field, the elegant 19-year-old midfielder whom Megson again included instead of Grzegorz Krychowiak, the expensive loanee from Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sam Field celebrates after putting West Brom 2-0 up early in the second half.

Foster did not waste time getting down to save it. Five minutes later the home crowd jumped to their feet to cheer a volley that did find the net. The scorer could not have been more popular, Field finding acres of space beyond the back post to guide the ball calmly into the net after a cross by Phillips.\n\n“He’s one of our own,” crowed the home fans but they were struck dumb three minutes later when Newcastle halved their lead. Clark gave the visitors new hope by heading a cross by Ritchie into the net from close range. Newcastle then pushed Albion back and eventually gained their reward when Ritchie’s wicked delivery from the right was diverted into the net.\n\nAshley Young’s double has Manchester United buzzing and Watford befuddled Read more\n\n“With this bad run, to react the way we did at 2-0 down is very positive for the future,” said Benítez. “We can improve and we have to improve but you could see character, commitment and some good play.”\n\nMegson will meet Albion’s chairman, John Williams, at 10am on Wednesday to find out about his future at the club. He made it clear he would be interested to hear from other clubs, too. “I’ve had two promotions to the Premier League,” said the 58-year-old. “I kept Bolton up after they had only four points from 10 games. I took them further than they had ever gone in Europe. I’ve never been one to blow my own trumpet but maybe I should start.

The travelling supporters could have been forgiven for thinking it could not get any worse but this inept display, lacking resolve or fight, was damning evidence that Everton really are a sorry mess. Their lofty ambitions this season have long since evaporated and David Unsworth must be in a minority in thinking they are not in a relegation battle.\n\nEverton, without a clean sheet since the opening day, were again a defensive shambles and after shipping another four goals here have conceded nine in two outings. They were pulled apart, with Steven Davis completing the rout after Dusan Tadic’s opener and a Charlie Austin double. By the end Gylfi Sigurdsson’s spectacular first-half equaliser was a distant memory and the prospect of relegation an ever-increasing reality, with the club two points above the bottom three.\n\nThe manager who inherits this from the caretaker Unsworth will have quite a job on his hands; this is a fifth defeat in seven matches since Ronald Koeman’s sacking. Asked whether Everton were in a relegation battle, Unsworth replied: “I wouldn’t go that far so early. I think we are in a tough moment, and I think we have a massive week ahead of us. Our confidence is very, very low and we are conceding far too easily. The players know that and, if they didn’t know they were in a tough situation, then they must do now. It’s a massive week for the club.”\n\nArsenal stun Burnley with injury-time Alexis Sánchez penalty winner Read more\n\nThe upcoming seven days comprise what look like must-win matches against West Ham United and Huddersfield Town at Goodison Park. “It is not good enough and it has to change,” Unsworth said. “Something has to change because this group of players is underperforming. Whether it’s Ronald in charge or myself in charge, it’s not working.”\n\nEverton were slapdash in possession and shirked challenges, with most passes aimless and too many players seemingly uninterested. This was the meekest attempt to put right the wrongs of Thursday’s 5-1 capitulation at the hands of Atalanta and left Unsworth, a staunch club servant, grimacing. For Mauricio Pellegrino, who has compared managing Southampton to going to the gym because hard work has not provided instant results, this domineering and confident showing was evidence of significant progress.\n\n“The first half we played really well but after they equalised the team was patient and we continued playing in the same way,” Pellegrino said. “After we scored the third one it was easy for us because we had the space and we created a lot of chances.”\n\nIt was a breeze for Southampton, who badly needed some light relief after an indifferent start to the season. Pellegrino tweaked personnel, handing Austin his first league start, as Southampton sought a third home win. Unsworth, meanwhile, made eight changes from the team thumped by Atalanta, including dropping Wayne Rooney who remained on the bench. But 72 hours on it was the same old story with this Everton display equally torturous viewing.\n\nThe only surprise when Everton fell behind after 18 minutes was that it had taken so long. Austin had stabbed wide and struck the woodwork before Tadic rounded off a superb sweeping team move. His deft finish trickled through the legs of Jordan Pickford, the Everton goalkeeper, who was horribly exposed time and again, after racing on to Ryan Bertrand’s slide-rule pass. Pickford erupted, angered at the gaping hole between Michael Keane and Leighton Baines, who was then replaced by Ashley Williams owing to a calf injury. As another chance flew past Pickford’s post, a smattering of boos rang out from a pocket of fans in the away end.\n\nIn fairness few could have foreseen Everton’s next move. With the interval fast approaching, Sigurdsson picked up the ball 25 yards from goal, with seemingly no danger to Southampton until he jinked inside on to his right foot, fooling Davis and Virgil van Dijk. He then wrapped his boot round the ball and sent a crashing effort goalwards, which pinballed between the bar, post and bar again before falling into the cushion of the side netting.\n\nFortunately for Southampton, Everton quickly returned to their bad habits after half-time. More slack defending allowed Bertrand to ghost in down the left and again turn supplier, this time to feed Austin at the near post, with the striker comfortably beating Keane and Williams in the challenge to thunder his header in off the bar.\n\nFive minutes later it was déjà vu; with Everton’s defence again at sea, an unmarked Austin powered home beyond a hapless Pickford from Tadic’s cross. Southampton almost added another through the substitute Shane Long but Pickford saved after the striker wriggled free of Phil Jagielka. Saints did, though, find a fourth when Davis fired in low two minutes from time. Unsworth’s tired shake of the head at full time said it all."}, {"date": "26/11/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 21722, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [15], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This riveting spectacle ended in Burnley heartbreak when James Tarkowski came together with Aaron Ramsey in the area and Lee Mason awarded a penalty.

You lay your hands on someone, he goes down, they are tough calls; you have to be 100%, which I assume the referee is.\n\n“It’s a tough job for referees, it’s not going to change. There were some frustrations with some of the moments – I’ve not spoken to him. Ramsey, that was a smash in the back compared to what most people go down with.”\n\nThis was the third consecutive time Burnley have lost to Arsenal in controversial circumstances. In last season’s corresponding fixture Laurent Koscielny’s handball was missed in a finish that proved to be the winner. Burnley claimed the defender was also offside. In the reverse game at the Emirates, Sánchez claimed the points with a disputed 98th-minute spot-kick.\n\nDyche may have had all this in mind when talking about Sunday’s penalty decision. “We’ve had a lot not given,” he said. “I don’t know why. The bigger clubs seem to get the decisions; I’m not sure it’s that fact [this afternoon]. You have to be clear only because it’s unlikely he’s ever going to get there [to the ball], so when is a foul a foul?”\n\nPlay Video 1:06 Burnley's Sean Dyche: 'It was a big decision, but we've had a few of them go against us' – video\n\nArsène Wenger had a different view, having talked to Ramsey. “When you speak to him, he didn’t throw himself on the ground,” Arsenal’s manager said. “He wanted to go back and flick the ball, he was pushed in the back, had a problem in the neck from the push – it was a very strong push.”\n\nGiven Burnley’s impressive first-half display Wenger could not have complained if Arsenal had been beaten. Arsenal, though, did display steely character to come back into the contest after the interval.\n\nAfter Arsenal arrived at Turf Moor only 52 minutes before kick-off, Wenger sent out a different XI to the losing one at Cologne on Thursday. The chief exclusion was Mesut Özil, though this was because of illness. “How bad is he, will he be available for Wednesday [the match against Huddersfield Town]?” Wenger said. “We’ll have to see what it is.”\n\nDyche made no changes from the 2-0 win against Swansea City and could be pleased with the scintillating opening 45 minutes his team produced. First, Johann Berg Gudmundsson forced Ramsey to concede a free-kick. When Robbie Brady’s delivery to Petr Cech’s left-post area was repelled, moments later the Icelander intervened again. This time some Gudmundsson trickery bought a yard and he crossed towards the lurking Ashley Barnes. Arsenal once more cleared but it seemed obvious Dyche had instructed his men to get at the visitors via the long ball.\n\nIn a flash, though, Burnley came close to going behind. The previously muted Alexandre Lacazette broke and flipped the ball in to Ramsey, who should have beaten Pope. This was now a spectacle to make the senses tingle. What impressed about Dyche’s men was the speed of pass and movement. Yet Arsenal – and Sánchez, in particular – pinned Burnley back when the second period started. After the Chilean put in Sead Kolasinac deep in Burnley’s area it was their turn to scramble clear.\n\nIt pointed to how Arsenal were edging the half but had to stay alert. Following the introduction of Jack Wilshere for Alex Iwobi on 66 minutes, Brady crashed a shot back off Koscielny and the sense was that the game could go either way.\n\nArsenal triumphed and they re-enter the top four, a point above Tottenham Hotspur. Wenger said: “For us after the win against Tottenham [last week] it was important to go away and win it and that’s what we did – for the benefit of the team it’s very important. They [Burnley] defended very well, they were well organised, clever, intelligent and direct. When you play them you understand why they have 22 points.”\n\nDyche said: “There’s a lot of me inside that’s raging a lot. I’ve told them [his players] that we continue to develop, we continue to move forward.\n\n“I’ve also told them this is the reality. Football’s a harsh game and sometimes it hurts you.”"}, {"date": "26/11/2017", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24121, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name":

1995, when Brian Horton was in the dugout and Paul Walsh supplied the decisive goal in a 3-2 win at Blackburn Rovers, they had won a Premier League match after trailing at half-time. They will be glad, 11 managers on, to get rid of that little piece of club trivia. It is another measure, perhaps, of how the modern City now have stoutness and resilience to go with their many other gifts.\n\nPep Guardiola says it’s important for Manchester City to suffer … and still win Read more\n\nThey had to work tremendously hard to save themselves and Huddersfield certainly deserved the ovation they received at the end, even if Rajiv van La Parra’s red card soured the mood after the final whistle. David Wagner’s men had given everything and when Nicolas Otamendi’s own-goal put them in front just before half-time their supporters could have been forgiven for daring to dream of a remarkable double, having already beaten Manchester United here last month.\n\nUltimately, though, City have now accumulated 37 points from their opening 13 fixtures, a record of excellence that has never been seen before in the Premier League era. Pep Guardiola’s side are unbeaten in 26 matches, a run stretching back seven months, and Raheem Sterling’s 84th-minute winner maintained their immaculate record on the road this season – they have won every single away fixture. When United went a goal down here they conceded a second five minutes later and lost 2-1, leaving José Mourinho to complain that the players, not the manager, should appear in front of the media to explain it. In stark contrast, Guardiola described City’s response as one of the more satisfying results of his time in charge. His team have freewheeled past many of their opponents this season but their latest victory was a demonstration of other qualities – guts, to put it one way.\n\nSterling was also involved when City were awarded the penalty, scored by Sergio Agüero, that changed the complexion of the match early in the second half, and the game was so one-sided at 1-1 that Guardiola ended up replacing a centre-half, Vincent Kompany, with another striker, Gabriel Jesus, to operate with something resembling a 3-2-5 system. It was an onslaught facing a packed defence with the added complication that the Huddersfield striker, Laurent Depoitre, had been deployed to a man-marking job on Fernandinho. Huddersfield’s backs-to-the-wall operation very nearly paid off but, finally, the pressure told, resulting in a lucky ricochet off Sterling for the decisive moment.\n\nIt was difficult not to sympathise with the home side and, on this evidence, Huddersfield can certainly think confidently about their first season of top-division football since 1972 not being a brief interlude. Their goal had a sizeable amount of good fortune attached to it, with Otamendi inadvertently turning the ball past Ederson inside the six-yard area. Yet the ball would never have reached that position had it not been for Christopher Schindler’s determination to elude two markers and apply the first touch to Tom Ince’s corner.\n\nSchindler had a fine game and if there was one moment to sum up the home team’s efforts it was his perfectly executed tackle, at 0-0, to deny Agüero the near-certainty of a goal and, brilliantly, the little scene that followed it as the Huddersfield centre-half punched the air in celebration. Huddersfield are not the first side to defend in numbers and try to hit Guardiola’s team on the break. They might be the first, however, whose tactic was to defend so deeply, often with their entire team no more than 30 yards from goal. The onus was on City’s creative players to find a way through the congestion and that, plainly, was not a straightforward assignment even with David Silva on form, plus Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sané adding their own refined touches.\n\nPep Guardiola’s players prove their rugged side to tame Huddersfield | Paul Doyle Read more\n\nGuardiola’s hands were pressed deep into his trouser pockets when the half-time whistle went but it was still asking a lot of Huddersfield to expect them to keep out a side that had scored 40 goals in their previous 12 league fixtures and the lead was wiped out within a couple of minutes of the restart. Sterling might actually have won a penalty even earlier in the second half, going down under a challenge from the goalkeeper Jonas Lossl, and in the next attack it was a tangle with Scott Malone that ended with him on the floor.\n\nThe home supporters were outraged but, as Wagner accepted afterwards, the referee, Craig Pawson, probably made the right decision. Malone had his arms around his opponent as Sterling tried to break free and when Agüero took advantage with a precise finish from 12 yards there was still over three quarters of an hour to play with stoppage-time factored in.\n\nAll the same, the winning goal was a cruel blow for Huddersfield, culminating in a shot from Jesus that came back off Lossl, struck Sterling on the knee and looped in.\n\nSterling had not planned the decisive touch but he had started the attack and, after a subdued opening half, he was a constant menace to his opponents in the second period. Huddersfield’s resistance was broken and it was just a pity that a spiky second half ended with Van La Parra’s dismissal, the Dutchman clashing with Sané close to the corner flag and pushing him in the face."}, {"date": "25/11/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 23723, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

"Mamadou Sakho, appointed captain of Crystal Palace for the first time, scrambled home a last-minute winner to give Selhurst Park renewed hope of beating the drop. If it sounds like a moment that was destined to happen, it certainly did not feel that way.\n\nRoy Hodgson admitted his side had not played well and that Stoke had looked well set to claim a point from this exciting game. Mark Hughes, not surprisingly, agreed, disappointed that his team’s good work and an exceptional opening goal from Xherdan Shaqiri had been allowed to go to waste. But, thanks to the Frenchman, three points did end up in south London and for Hodgson it continues an upward trend.\n\nLiverpool denied victory over Chelsea after Willian’s late equaliser Read more\n\n“I don’t particularly want to say this is a catalyst. We’ve given performances better than today but not always had victories,” Hodgson said. “The first seven games I draw a line over because it was seven games, no points, no goals and not a lot of encouragement. The last six games, though, we’ve turned things round enormously.\n\n“What today’s result means is that we now know what we have to keep doing for the next 25 games.\n\n“If we do survive people might say this was a turning point but there’s no need for me to talk about it, just don’t slip from that level.”\n\nA first half characterised by hesitancy and a lack of composure was also full of half chances, with Shaqiri twice coming close to opening the scoring and, at the other end, James McArthur seeing his close-range effort saved at point-blank range by Lee Grant.\n\nHodgson’s half-time decision to replace the Scotsman with Christian Benteke changed the dynamic of the match, allowing Palace to play longer and with greater impact on crossed balls. Ultimately both Palace’s goals were made possible by this shift.\n\nShaqiri opened up the match with another sparkling strike to add to his collection. The Messi of the Alps looked particularly suited to his nickname on this occasion, collecting the ball at halfway in the 53rd minute and driving straight at goal. His close control denied Palace any chance of a challenge, his left foot struck the ball unerringly from the edge of the box and inside Wayne Hennessey’s near post.\n\nSwansea stop the rot but rue Leroy Fer’s miss against Bournemouth Read more\n\nIt was a goal that sucked the air out of the stadium but within 60 seconds the home side were level. Benteke won the long ball and it bobbled out to Andros Townsend on the left-hand side. The winger cut inside on to his right and dipped a ball across the box. It eluded a clutch of Stoke defenders but not Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who scored his first goal for the club at the back post.\n\n“People thought he was a lad who can do things in fits and starts,” said Hodgson of the England youngster. “He’s not, he’s a very talented player who can make an impact throughout the game.”\n\nThe match looked like it was fizzling out until Shaqiri, with seconds remaining of normal time, hit another cross that Ryan Shawcross – inches from the line – contrived to steer away from goal. Into added time and the ball went up the other end, this time Wilfried Zaha contrived the cross and, after a knockback from Yohan Cabaye, Sakho poked it home. “Yes, it’s fair to say I’m wondering how we lost that,” Hughes said. “We needed to deal with balls coming in but we didn’t do well enough. I bet Roy is pleased.”"}, {"date": "25/11/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75018, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [66], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [59], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomer Hemed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Goldson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ezequiel Schelotto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Izzy Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Manchester United did what was required by closing the gap to Manchester City to five points, until Sunday afternoon at least. The uneven form of José Mourinho’s side was again evident, yet all that matters as they play catch up with City is to apply as much pressure as possible on the Premier League leaders.\n\nCity are at Huddersfield Town in the 4pm kick-off and though they are firm favourites to claim victory, United’s deflected winner off Lewis Dunk gives them something to ponder.\n\nOf this ninth league victory of the campaign, Mourinho said: “You can say it was a bad performance. But it was bad because Brighton were very good from minute one to the last minute.”\n\nManchester City are giving more than just United the blues | Daniel Taylor Read more\n\nMourinho made seven changes, as only Chris Smalling, Paul Pogba, Anthony Martial and Romelu Lukaku survived from Wednesday’s 1-0 defeat at Basel, while Chris Hughton retained 10 of the Brighton XI that drew 2-2 with Stoke City on Monday, Solly March coming in for José Izquierdo.\n\nUnited’s frontline featured Marcus Rashford and Martial, only the second time Mourinho has started them together in the league this term, following the 4-1 win over Newcastle United.\n\nThis prompted the rare occurrence of the manager admitting a mistake. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the pundits said we played with too many attackers. But if they say that I would say they were right. Sometimes you play with too many and you lose control of the game,” he said.\n\n“We had a few problems because Pogba and [Nemanja] Matic were isolated in the midfield. It is a good risk and against Newcastle it was good because [while] we were not very solid defensively we were strong in creating. But today our creation was poor. They were not successful one against one. Marcus did not have a happy match at all.”\n\nAfter the 2-1 defeat at Huddersfield last month Mourinho complained of his players’ attitude. On Saturday there was a similar issue, certainly before the interval. Bruno Saltor, the Brighton captain, was able to cut through United’s rearguard along the right too easy before finding Pascal Gross. His shot was saved by David de Gea but the home side continued to slumber.\n\nThe opening half was akin to the Basel defeat: United dominated but were unable to score. Antonio Valencia did manage to stand a cross up for Lukaku but his header missed the target. They ended the first 45 minutes with a point-blank effort from the No9 being blocked near the line.\n\nThe second half began with Smalling being sold a dummy that left him in a differing postcode but Gross’s ball in was off target. Moments later, when Rashford attempted a similar trick on Gaëtan Bong, he ran into the left-back and fell to the floor.\n\nFor United to prosper Pogba needed to become more of the influence he was in the victory against Newcastle. Instead, it was the maligned Victor Lindelöf who fired them and the home crowd up with a sliding tackle on Gross. It left Gross prone and the Brighton support booing as those in red shirts played on but suddenly the Old Trafford crowd found its voice and atmosphere.\n\nThis ratcheted up further when Mourinho took off the anonymous Juan Mata for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Yet while it remained goalless United remained in danger of a similar late defeat to the one suffered in Switzerland.\n\nPlay Video 1:21 José Mourinho: 'We had too many attackers' – video\n\nNow, though, came Ashley Young’s intervention. A Rashford corner came to the left-back, he shimmied, then let fly and the ball went in off the unfortunate Dunk.\n\nHughton said: “It is not a corner but we did have an opportunity to clear the ball before that.”\n\nWhether Lukaku got the final touch for the corner did not concern United, though. What they had to do now was protect the lead and three precious points. While a Brighton breakaway featuring Dunk need a last-gasp intervention from the home defence, the first top-flight meeting between the teams in 34 years ended as United wished.\n\nBut there may, privately, be concern for Mourinho that the early season fluidity and barrage of goals has tapered off. The sole strike here took their tally to seven in the past six league outings, a paltry return following a prolific start of 21 in the opening seven. Asked if he knew why, he replied: “I don’t know.”\n\nCarrick can count on coaching role\n\nMichael Carrick has been offered a coaching role with Manchester United when he retires. On Friday the 36-year-old revealed he had undergone a minor heart procedure, after being ruled out since September owing to an irregular heart rhythm. The midfielder is back in training. José Mourinho said: “Michael as a person is more important than Michael as a player. We gave him the time to relax, to recover, to feel confident to make the decision, wants to play, wants to stop. He knows that my coaching staff has a chair for him, if he wants, when he wants. The chair is in the office for him. I want that, the board want that, the owners want that. Michael is in a comfortable position but he wants to play until the end of the season and now he feels confident to be back. He is one more option for us.”"}, {"date": "25/11/2017", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52188, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot",

"report": "Will Hughes leads the way as Watford ease to victory over Newcastle\n\nMarco Silva is turning into such a hot managerial property he should probably be handled with oven gloves.\n\nThe worry for Watford is that he knows it and is doing nothing to kill rumours that he could yet fall into Everton’s clutches. “I don’t want to talk about speculation,” said Silva when invited to commit himself to at least a medium-term future at Vicarage Road.\n\nBy then his extraordinary ability to gel and improve players had inflicted a fourth successive league defeat on Newcastle. As the minutes passed and the impressive Marvin Zeegelaar repeatedly deconstructed Rafael Benítez’s defence, it became apparent that the success of Amanda Staveley’s mooted St James’ Park takeover is now imperative for Newcastle. It is no exaggeration to say that Tyneside survival hopes could hinge on the ability to access at least a few of her Middle East-sourced millions in January.\n\nMamadou Sakho’s injury-time goal gives Crystal Palace victory over Stoke Read more\n\nWell before the end Benítez’s calculated gamble in fielding a 4-4-2 formation against a visiting manager sometimes prone to defensive risk-tasking had failed spectacularly. Not that the Spaniard should be blamed for this latest reverse at the feet of Watford’s slickly sophisticated counterattacking pace. He did, after all, warn Newcastle’s owner. Mike Ashley, that a limited squad was in desperate need ofclose season reinforcement.\n\n“We had to realise this could happen to us in the Premier League,” said Benítez, who for all his very real talents cannot quite turn water into wine. “We’re a team that has to work very, very hard to get good results. It’s tough.”\n\nThe positional interchanging within Silva’s fluid 3-4-3 configuration certainly proved tricky for Newcastle to second guess. It was no surprise when, courtesy of a swipe of his left boot, Will Hughes directed a textbook shot low into the bottom corner after meeting Zeegelaar’s precise cut-back.\n\nHarry Kane to the rescue as Tottenham Hotspur held at home by West Brom Read more\n\nAndre Yedlin, Benítez’s right-back, is one of the quicker players in a slightly one-paced Newcastle team but he misjudged Zeegelaar’s advance and it was to become a recurring theme.\n\nBy then Tyneside frustrations had already been manifested in Jonjo Shelvey’s bizarre scissor lunge at Miguel Britos from behind, for which he was rightly booked, while Rob Elliot had done well to repel Richarlison’s curling shot.\n\nAlready Newcastle were being stretched to the limit with Silva’s tactics targeting the right of their defence. Sure enough it was the point where, with the interval beckoning, they snapped for a second time. This time an alarmingly fazed Yedlin’s misreading of Zeegelaar’s cross resulted in his diverting the ball past a wrong-footed Elliot.\n\nBenítez wanted to sign Andre Gray during the summer but Ashley deemed the then Burnley striker too expensive and he joined Watford for £18.5m instead. Perhaps predictably, Gray scored the third, darting into gaping space and stretching to turn Richarlison’s cross beyond Elliot.\n\n“We could have scored seven but it was a pleasure to see things we had prepared happen,” said Silva. “I’m really happy.”\n\nIf only Benítez could say the same."}, {"date": "25/11/2017", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20228, "home_team": {"name":

squandered a wonderful late chance to give their season the lift it so badly needs and to ease the pressure on Paul Clement.\n\nWilfried Bony also had a goal disallowed in first-half injury-time and those two moments feel symptomatic of the way things are going for Swansea, even if this was a much-improved performance.\n\nClement took plenty of encouragement from the way his team played against a Bournemouth side who never really got going and threatened only sporadically, yet the Swansea manager was bitterly upset with Stuart Attwell’s decision to rule out Bony’s goal and critical of the referee’s performance in general. “I thought he had a really poor game and wasn’t up to speed,” Clement said.\n\nMamadou Sakho’s injury-time goal gives Crystal Palace victory over Stoke Read more\n\nHe highlighted the moment in the second half when Joshua King’s flailing arm caught Roque Mesa, leaving the Spaniard with a gash across his forehead, but his main bone of contention was the goal Bony had ruled out. Jordan Ayew was the player penalised for a foul on Nathan Aké just before Bony swept the ball into the roof of the net. Swansea’s players were furious and surrounded Attwell when he blew the half-time whistle seconds later.\n\n“I thought at the time it was a soft foul to give,” Clement said. “I think if that was between the two boxes, the game would have carried on. That’s what I saw in real time and I made that point to the referee at half-time, that it was a soft decision. I looked at it on the video and I stand by my first opinion. I think you’ve got a situation where Jordan Ayew and Nathan Aké are fighting for the position as the ball comes in, and I saw Jordan and Aké come together and Aké fall over. I don’t think he’s dived, though – Jordan was too strong for him, he’s outmuscled him. The ball’s come down to Bony, good finish, we should be 1-0 up.”\n\nIt was an incident that divided opinion and Eddie Howe was adamant Attwell made the right call. “You’re not going to be surprised I had the opposite view on the disallowed goal,” Bournemouth’s manager said. “I had a good view of it and I thought Nathan was pushed before the goal was scored. The referee blew before the lad struck the ball, which is a good sign he had made a clear decision. It was a foul.”\n\nIf there was a reprieve for Bournemouth, it was when Fer inexplicably sliced wide with eight minutes remaining. Cutting in from the left and leaving a trail of defenders in his wake, Fer saw his first shot repelled by Asmir Begovic and then, with the goal yawning invitingly , he somehow failed to convert.\n\nWill Hughes leads the way as Watford ease to victory over Newcastle Read more\n\nClement, however, was keen to see the positives from a display in which Swansea played with much more intensity and belief. Bony held up the ball well and Mesa, making only his second Premier League start of the season, justified his inclusion in the centre of midfield.\n\n“That is our best home performance. We’ve not won, but I think there will be other games where we don’t play as well and win,” he said. “If we continue to build on that level, we are going to get out of the trouble we are in, no question about that.”\n\nHowe, in contrast, was “very disappointed” with Bournemouth’s performance and admitted his team “never showed a true representation of our ability”.\n\nMarc Pugh and King had a couple of half-chances before the interval and Charlie Daniels screwed a low shot across the far post in the dying seconds, but otherwise Bournemouth, who should have been full of confidence on the

To the outsider, West Brom’s caretaker manager works from a similarly dogged playbook to Tony Pulis, the man whose misfortune has been his temporary gain; where they differ is that Megson is revered at the Hawthorns and a draw that could have been so much more did nothing to alter his standing.\n\nHad Salomón Rondón, whose early goal was cancelled out 16 minutes from time by an otherwise quiet Harry Kane, not diverted a glorious chance wide in stoppage time, Megson’s return to front-line duty would have been crowned with three points against a torpid Tottenham. Megson took Albion up from the Championship twice in the early 2000s and they did not play like a team in much danger of returning there now, their speed and alertness perhaps feeding from the positivity of a coach who had assumed days liked this were behind him.\n\nLewis Dunk own goal eases Manchester United’s nerves to see off Brighton Read more\n\n“I decided two and a half, three years ago that if I’m not getting jobs I’ll go travelling, golfing, whatever,” Megson said. “This has whetted my appetite again. I enjoyed being on the touchline, I think I’m good at it.”\n\nHis enthusiasm could be forgiven: Megson’s last match as a No1 had been a Sheffield derby on 29 February 2012. He had seemingly been bracketed among yesterday’s men but there was nothing stodgy about West Brom at Wembley. They raced out of the blocks and the difference in sharpness between the teams was emphasised by the opening goal. Dele Alli was too casual in seeking to turn into space and was mugged by Jake Livermore; Davinson Sánchez was similarly lax in allowing Rondón, via a perfectly fair nudge, to reach the through ball first and the Venezuelan striker slotted his finish past a static Hugo Lloris.\n\nThat was in the fourth minute and it put the onus on a Tottenham side whose struggles at home against lesser opponents are a concern. Mauricio Pochettino leaned upon the stats afterwards: Spurs conceded just two shots on target and not a single corner, he remarked, while themselves carving out “a lot of chances, situations“. It was one of those occasions where the eyes tell a more accurate tale. Tottenham huffed and puffed throughout, even after Kane squeezed in Alli’s deflected cross to give them what should have been a platform to push for victory. They dominated possession but West Brom, who saw the 19-year-old midfielder Sam Field reward Megson’s faith with a mature performance, were rarely carved open and looked brighter in every department than during the unhappy latter days under Pulis.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Salomon Rondon scores West Brom’s opener against Tottenham Photograph: Ian Kington/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBy the hour Pochettino had seen enough sloppy thinking, bringing on Fernando Llorente and Mousa Dembélé for Harry Winks and, notably, the defender Jan Vertonghen. The idea was to bludgeon their way back in but the reward was not enough and, with Manchester City in line to move 13 points ahead of Spurs if they win at Huddersfield on Sunday, a struggle to remain in the top four now seems far more likely than a title challenge.\n\nWill Hughes leads the way as Watford ease to victory over Newcastle Read more\n\n“It is massive in the Premier League,” Pochettino said of the gap. “But now we need to be focused on trying to improve and be more consistent here at Wembley.”\n\nHis tone was spiky; it was Megson, clearly enjoying himself in rarefied surroundings, who held court more willingly afterwards in the knowledge that he may not be doing so again. West Brom do not expect their hunt for a new manager to drag on and Alan Pardew has been heavily linked with the position. Megson will probably have to look elsewhere.\n\n“I’m not going to traipse around the country for two dead frogs and a conker each week,” he said; it was, though, an afternoon to give a club, and one

"report": "Antonio Conte may be one of the more humble Chelsea managers but he happily took credit for their merited draw. Willian, his third substitute, equalised with a slice of good fortune while Jürgen Klopp anxiously waited to make two of his own in the 85th minute. “I moved Pedro to wing-back and put Willian with the two strikers,” the visiting coach explained. “I think it was a good idea.”\n\nA good idea and a good point for the champions in the circumstances. They had the edge over Liverpool in the first half but trailed to Mohamed Salah’s 10th league goal of the season after the hosts turned the tide in the second period. A fourth league defeat of the season beckoned, only one fewer than in their entire title-winning campaign, until the Brazilian playmaker Willian’s intended cross sailed over the stranded Simon Mignolet and rescued a point.\n\nLiverpool 1-1 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe league leaders, Manchester City, may be the happiest team with this result between two potential contenders but the impact of Conte’s substitutions and the refusal to accept defeat bodes well for Chelsea. Another reminder of what they lost, or failed to nurture, in the Stamford Bridge old boy Salah’s latest influential performance provided the sting. Klopp claimed he could live with a point against champions who made life “difficult” for Liverpool although seeing another victory vanish late on, so soon after Sevilla completed a comeback to 3-3 in stoppage time in Tuesday’s Champions League game, was punishing. “Most parts of our game were good but it doesn’t feel like it at the moment,” the German reflected.\n\nThe long flight back from Qarabag in the early hours of Thursday showed no after-effects on Eden Hazard. He must have been in first class. Chelsea’s immaculate playmaker was at the heart of almost every threat in the first half, and there were plenty as Conte’s team created the better openings. They were content to sit deep and absorb Liverpool pressure but also possessed menace with Hazard finding pockets of space to orchestrate proceedings.\n\nPlay Video 1:28 Jürgen Klopp: 'You need three players to stop Eden Hazard' - video\n\n“The start of his season was full of trouble because of injury and needing the best time to recover [from injury],” said Conte. “But now I think Eden is in really good form. He likes to play as a striker. There is a good link with Álvaro [Morata] and for me it’s important that we can play two different systems – we played 3-4-2-1 against Qarabag and 3-5-2 today – and keep our identity.”\n\nBoth teams contributed to an absorbing, intriguing game. Both managers also freshened things up after midweek Champions League trips by making five changes to the teams who started in Azerbaijan and Seville. Even allowing for the second-half collapse in Andalusia and an intensive schedule of 13 matches in 44 days, it was a surprise that Liverpool started without Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané against such a well-drilled defence. Klopp shifted two-thirds of his first-choice attack to the bench as Daniel Sturridge made his fifth league start of the campaign and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain only a second. The pair worked hard for meagre reward.\n\nEden Hazard sparks recovery as Chelsea hit back to draw at Liverpool | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nLiverpool’s collective effort impressed, particularly when covering for each other defensively and regaining possession quickly, but they struggled to turn territorial advantage into a clear sight of Thibaut Courtois’s goal.\n\nTheir most potent outlet came from Salah. The former under-used Chelsea player was closest to a breakthrough for Liverpool in the first half when he spun Gary Cahill on the edge of the area and curled a left-foot shot just wide. Otherwise the home side rarely troubled the Belgium goalkeeper until the second half.\n\nChelsea had created the better openings before the break with Hazard constantly to the fore but Klopp’s team reappeared with greater aggression and intent. The previously anonymous Philippe Coutinho saw more of the ball while Klopp’s decision to swap Salah and Oxlade-Chamberlain to the left and right flanks, respectively, improved their contributions too.\n\nSalah’s influence grew throughout the game and he struck his 15th goal in 20 appearances for his new club after a Liverpool attack appeared to have been nullified outside the Chelsea penalty area. Coutinho’s pass rolled into the path of Tiémoué Bakayoko, who was unable to intercept at full stretch and the alert Oxlade-Chamberlain nudged the ball on to his Egyptian team-mate. Salah took one touch in his stride before beating Courtois with a clinical finish inside the near post. His celebrations were restrained. Klopp’s were not, though amid the emotion he was minded to replace Sturridge with Georginio Wijnaldum and attempt to protect Liverpool’s advantage.\n\nAntonio Conte: ’We dominated the game – Liverpool were lucky to draw’ Read more\n\nThe tactic was succeeding until Willian’s fortunate intervention. Chelsea, despite Conte’s claims to the contrary, were largely contained in the second half but their performance improved with each of the manager’s substitutions – Cesc Fàbregas, Pedro and finally Willian.\n\nThe Brazilian had few options when he collected Hazard’s pass and drifted beyond Ragnar Klavan to the corner of the penalty area with five minutes remaining. He aimed a cross towards the far post but instead it sailed over Mignolet, standing yards off his line and unable to save with his fingertips, and the ball dropped into the net."}, {"date": "24/11/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56897, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edimilson Fernandes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Domingos Quina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [8], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksander Dragovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Islam Slimani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "David Moyes could reflect on his first experience of the London Stadium with a measure of fondness. It was a night of frustration in one sense, bearing in mind that West Ham’s bluntness when they went in search of a late winning goal left them in the bottom three and without a victory since September, but it was a relief for the Scot to hear his new fans bellow his name throughout the second half.\n\n“David Moyes’s claret and blue army” was the chant and West Ham will need more of that unity if they are to save themselves from the unthinkable disaster of relegation in the coming months.\n\nMuch to the relief of this unhappy club’s unpopular board, the anticipated mutiny against their role in West Ham’s avoidable spiral into peril never quite materialised, even after Leicester City seized an early lead.\n\nDavid Moyes’ liking for running and shouting has stirring outcome | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThe home supporters resisted the temptation to voice their displeasure with the people sitting in the posh seats and instead chose to rally behind the manager who at times looked so lonely in his technical area at this strange, unloved ground. “You need a foghorn on the touchline to make yourself heard,” Moyes observed of the distance between the pitch and the dugouts, although he was also quick to point out “it was more like Upton Park” as West Ham tried in vain to break down Claude Puel’s side.\n\nIt was clear the crowd had decided to channel its anger into something more productive.\n\nThere were times when it felt like a fragile truce, particularly in the difficult moments following Marc Albrighton’s crisp goal in the eighth minute, but it was striking that Moyes’s men were applauded off at the final whistle as recognition for an improved effort after ruining their new manager’s debut with a collapse at Watford last weekend.\n\nThey summoned defiance to earn a point, Cheikhou Kouyaté equalising on the stroke of half-time, and can be confident of winning their fight against relegation if they can add some poise to go with the heart on display here.\n\nThe disappointing part, however, was that a second goal proved elusive. Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City lie in wait after Wednesday’s trip to Everton – an appointment Moyes has undoubtedly had marked in the diary ever since replacing Slaven Bilic – and that trio will not have seen too much here to scare them.\n\nThe Premier League’s worst defence conceded for the 25th time this season and it should be pointed out West Ham were slightly fortuitous to be level at the break, bearing in mind Martin Atkinson, the referee, could easily have awarded Leicester a penalty for Arthur Masuaku’s trip on Albrighton.\n\nLeicester were already ahead when Albrighton tumbled and Jamie Vardy also had a couple of chances to extend their lead, sending one curling shot just wide. The visitors had pace in abundance up front and Vardy was dangerous in the first half, creating Albrighton’s opener with clever movement on the left and bending one effort just wide.\n\nThe striker’s unselfish and wily movement allowed Albrighton to break the deadlock. West Ham failed to read the threat. There was not enough pressure on the ball as Leicester swiftly shuffled it around in the middle and Riyad Mahrez and Wilfried Ndidi combined to release Vardy.\n\nWinston Reid was pulled out of position and Angelo Ogbonna will wince when he sees a replay of the striker’s cutback sliding through his legs before reaching Albrighton, whose low finish deceived the flatfooted Joe Hart.\n\n“I thought we were a little bit unlucky to go a goal behind,” Moyes said. “It was a bit of character we showed. We could have easily gone under at that point.”\n\nThe first goal of the Moyes era certainly arrived at a good time for West Ham. Despite beginning with the knowledge they needed a cohesive performance to keep a lid on the growing angst and anger within their support after months of stagnation, they had toiled before Kouyaté’s intervention. Andy Carroll struggled again up front.\n\nWest Ham United v Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFor a while the mood was ugly as tension ate away at West Ham’s belief but they had enjoyed a couple of promising moments from set pieces before Kouyaté headed Manuel Lanzini’s corner off Danny Simpson’s shoulder and past Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nWest Ham dominated for long periods after that goal. Masuaku provided thrust on the left and Marko Arnautovic’s improved display was epitomised by a saving tackle on Vardy.\n\nYet the hosts lacked ideas in open play. Leicester, ultimately, were never under siege at any point and, while André Ayew was close with a late overhead kick, there was no need for any heroics from Schmeichel.\n\nFor Moyes, though, the first bricks have been laid.

It really was the definition of a penalty. “I was just waiting for the referee to give it,” Hughton said. Hughes, by comparison, felt the referee, who was roundly booed off at the final whistle, got it right. “I think there was minimal contact,” the Stoke manager said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Glenn Murray goes down under a challenge from Ryan Shawcross in the first half – Lee Mason awarded Stoke a goal kick. Photograph: Charb/ProSports/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nKevin Friend, the fourth official, calmed Hughton over the penalty appeal and played peacemaker moments later when Hughes erupted at Murray’s meaty lunge on Kevin Wimmer. Once Brighton had composed themselves they pulled level, however.\n\nAfter a relentless driving run past a sea of Stoke shirts Davy Propper crossed for Gross – so often the supplier this season – to smash in an equaliser But less than two minutes later Stoke regained the lead, when Zouma’s header from Choupo-Moting’s flick had the Brighton net rippling once more. Then came the protracted celebrations, with Choupo-Moting joining the Chelsea loanee for a rehearsed jive in front of the North stand. Erik Pieters, too, joined in the fun from halfway.\n\nIzquierdo, a £13.5m club-record signing from Club Brugge last summer, was lively but equally erratic in possession. He went close in the first half, dropping a curling effort wide of Lee Grant’s goal after being slid in superbly by Propper, another summer signing, but he eventually prospered on the hour mark. Murray played in Izquierdo, whose pass pinballed off Pieters and back into his path, allowing the Colombian to rattle it home. “I think he is improving with every week he is with us,” Hughton added. “He admits himself that he has come from a league that perhaps is not as physical and the demands are different.”\n\nSaido Berahino: the former golden boy who has gone 632 days without scoring | Barry Glendenning Read more\n\nMurray thrived throughout as Brighton’s go-to man while another striker in his mid-30s prepared to make Premier League history late on. Stoke summoned Crouch from the bench in place of Shaqiri for the striker to make his 143rd appearance as a Premier League substitute, surpassing the record he previously shared with Shola Ameobi. Another striker, Saido Berahino, did not get on and it is now 633 days since the Stoke forward last found the net.\n\nA gritty draw was not enough for Hughes to feel the benefits of what, on another night, would probably be regarded as a point gained, however. “Our reaction is tinged with disappointment,” he admitted. “Any away point is usually a good result but having got into a winning position on two occasions, that’s where the disappointment lies.”\n\nBrighton, too, tweaked personnel late on – Solly March, Izzy Brown and Ezequiel Schelotto all entered the action – as the Seagulls pushed and pushed for a winner. It never came, though, but despite an evening full of frustration the feelgood factor lives on at the club."}, {"date": "19/11/2017", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20018, "home_team":

the biggest challenges of his career, then the manner of this defeat must surely act as a major wake-up call.\n\nAside from a 10-minute spell either side of half-time in his 500th Premier League match as a manager Moyes saw his new side totally outplayed by a Watford team brimming with confidence and instilled with a clear game plan by their manager, Marco Silva.\n\nWith his former club Everton keen on luring the man who has taken only three months to transform the fortunes of a side that lacked identity last season under Walter Mazzarri, the Scot will know he needs to turn things round just as quickly to ensure his latest assignment does not go the way of his other three posts since leaving Goodison Park to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United in 2013. Well-taken goals from Will Hughes – his first in the Premier League on his full home debut – and Richarlison did the damage here, although in truth Watford had Heurelho Gomes to thank for keeping the scores level after two stunning saves from the goalkeeper just before the break.\n\n“I thought the better team won the game,” admitted Moyes. “We need things to go our way to build some confidence because it’s tough for the players, I can sense that. But I didn’t enjoy the performance today.”\n\nDavid Moyes pleads for unity at West Ham as fans turn on club hierarchy Read more\n\nThe Scot had promised to waste no time attempting to plug his new side’s leaky defence having already conceded 23 goals this season under Slaven Bilic, with Winston Reid retained despite returning to London only on Friday after New Zealand’s World Cup play-off defeat by Peru in Lima. Marko Arnautovic – a club record signing in the summer at £24m – was singled out by Moyes before the match as one of the players who under-performed for Bilic and intentions were immediately laid bare as the left-back Aaron Cresswell received the ball from the kick-off and hit a long ball in the general direction of the Austrian.\n\nBy contrast Watford have enjoyed an excellent start under Silva but three successive defeats since the victory over Arsenal here last month have dampened expectations slightly. The Portuguese steadfastly refused to discuss the prospect of joining Everton this week and handed the Dutchman Marvin Zeegelaar his debut at left wing-back, with Hughes making only his third Premier League appearance since joining from Derby for a cut-price £8m in the summer.\n\nThe attacking midfielder was impressive for England at the European Under-21 Championship in the summer but has had to bide his time under Silva so far since then. Yet the manner in which the 22-year-old swooped to convert Watford’s opener in the 11th minute after Andre Gray’s mis-hit effort fell straight to his feet suggested this is a player who can thrive at this level given an opportunity.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Moyes watches on as West Ham slipped to their seventh defeat in the first 12 Premier League games. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFloating inside from his starting position on the right, Hughes was at the heart of most of his team’s best movements during a first half in which West Ham appeared content just to stay in the match. A delightful flick on the half-hour mark almost set up Gray but the striker could not quite find his feet to apply the finish. After criticism arising from the statistic that West Ham’s players had covered less ground than any other team, his side were putting in the effort but found themselves second best in every department.\n\nYet Watford were grateful Gomes was still paying attention five minutes before half-time when a rare moment of enterprise on the edge of the box from Andy Carroll and Mark Noble played in Cheikhou Kouyaté, only for the Brazilian to pull off a brilliant one-on-one save. Gomes did even better to keep out two Arnautovic efforts from point-blank range in injury-time, leaving Moyes with his head in his hands in disbelief in the dugout.\n\nWatford v West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHad it not been for Kouyaté’s wastefulness, West Ham would have drawn level six minutes after the restart following great work from Arnautovic down the right, only for the Senegal midfielder to blaze his effort over. That was to be as close as they got to achieving parity. With the impressive Abdoulaye Doucouré running the game, Watford were also likely to create chances and a fantastic save from Joe Hart to claw away Adrian Mariappa’s header kept his side in it. But the England goalkeeper could do nothing to prevent Richarlison doubling Watford’s lead, with protestations that Hughes had handled the ball before supplying the pass falling on deaf ears.\n\nMoyes’s response was immediately to withdraw Carroll for Diafra Sakho – the outgoing striker met with a chorus of boos from the away end. “You’re not fit to wear the shirt,” they chanted. Even the announcement of eight minutes of injury time in which to salvage a point did not go down well with West Ham’s supporters, who seemed more concerned about venting their frustration at the situation they now find themselves in.\n\nMoyes’s appeal for unity could yet have the desired effect, although it is hard to escape the feeling that things may get worse for him before they get

in their place for now. By the time Harry Kane and Dele Alli trudged off the pitch in the dying stages, with the triumphant taunts from the home fans ringing in their ears, Tottenham Hotspur had long let go of the notion of offering swaggering proof of where the balance of power in north London lies these days. Instead, it was an afternoon of pure release for Arsène Wenger, who took great joy from a first derby win over Mauricio Pochettino and a performance that reminded Arsenal of better times.\n\nThere could be no dispute about Arsenal’s ownership of the local bragging rights, earned thanks to goals from Shkodran Mustafi and Alexis Sánchez in the first half, not to mention a blend of defensive resilience and midfield resilience not always associated with this team of late. The only frustration for Wenger was that his players do not produce this much class and poise more consistently.\n\nArsène Wenger praises Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez after Arsenal’s derby win Read more\n\nArsenal’s first victory over a fellow big six member this season was assured long before the final whistle and it took them to within a point of Tottenham, whose title hopes are fading after a strangely muted failure to rise to the occasion. For all that Pochettino preferred to focus on the officiating, from the award of the free-kick that led to Mustafi’s opener to the failure to spot that the German was marginally offside from Mesut Özil’s subsequent delivery, to Granit Xhaka escaping with a booking for a clumsy early foul on Alli, questions over his young team’s mentality will persist until they win this type of game. The disappointment was even more bitter than when they faltered at Old Trafford a month ago.\n\nIt was certainly unusual to be at this fixture and detect early foreboding in the home sections, where there was queasiness at the thought of Tottenham jabbing at the soft underbelly of late-era Wengerball. To appreciate the shifting dynamics in this corner of the capital, one only had to glance at the teams’ midweek assignments in Germany: while Arsenal, demoted to the Europa League, visit the Bundesliga stragglers Köln on Thursday, Tottenham can clinch top spot in their Champions League group at Borussia Dortmund two nights earlier.\n\nYet the idea that they could ever be underdogs against these opponents compelled Arsenal to tear up the narrative. The atmosphere was noisy and intimidating and the home side offered the impression that they had something to prove after an underwhelming start to the season. They pressed Tottenham urgently and Alexandre Lacazette had an early sighter after Eric Dier dithered in possession.\n\nLacazette, starting with Sánchez and Mesut Özil for the third time in the league, was a sprightly opponent for the Tottenham defence. The striker hurried Hugo Lloris into a panicked clearance, almost converted Héctor Bellerín’s low centre after a fine pass from the impressive Aaron Ramsey and sparked jubilant scenes when he set up Sánchez for Arsenal’s second goal.\n\nIt was an uneven offering from Tottenham. Toby Alderweireld was missed in defence, Kane wore strapping on his right leg, Alli did not look fully fit after missing England duty and Harry Winks was ready only for a place on the bench, meaning that the visitors lacked control in midfield. Moussa Sissoko was careless in possession and Mousa Dembélé struggled with Arsenal’s tempo.\n\nTottenham did have their moments before Mustafi’s controversial opener. There was danger whenever Christian Eriksen found pockets of space behind Ramsey and Xhaka and Kane operated a shoot-on-sight policy.\n\nHowever, Petr Cech foiled Kane on two occasions, most notably when the striker broke down the left following miscommunication between Laurent Koscielny and Mustafi while Arsenal’s back three contained Alli. Eriksen clipped Cech’s right post with a low shot, but Arsenal’s football was silkier.\n\nThe game turned on a couple of tight decisions. First, Mike Dean penalised Davinson Sánchez when the Colombian tried to tackle his namesake in red and white. Özil floated the free-kick to the far post from the left, the flag stayed down and Mustafi escaped Jan Vertonghen to send a looping header beyond Lloris, the ball going in off the inside of the right post almost in slow motion.\n\nTottenham’s response was torpor, enabling Arsenal to tear into them. Lacazette’s elusive movement took him beyond Tottenham’s high line after a clever pass from Bellerín and his ball found Sánchez, who crashed a high shot past Lloris despite a heavy first touch.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexis Sánchez smashes home Arsenal’s second. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nJesús Pérez, Pochettino’s No2, remonstrated with Dean at the interval, but the main worry for Tottenham was how Arsenal’s greater energy in midfield allowed the attacking triumvirate of Lacazette, Özil and Sánchez to flourish. Sánchez had his most productive game of the season and Özil earned a standing ovation.

"Eddie Howe praised the resilience of Callum Wilson after the injury-plagued striker hit a fine hat-trick in 10-man Bournemouth’s crushing win against Huddersfield.\n\nWilson was sidelined for nine months by serious knee ligament damage suffered in January, having recovered from a similar problem sustained in September 2015. He put Bournemouth on course for victory with a quickfire double at the Vitality Stadium before completing his treble late on following the sending-off of the home captain, Simon Francis, and a strike from Harry Arter. The goals were Wilson’s first in the Premier League since the second knee operation and his second top-flight treble after his hat-trick in a 4-3 victory at West Ham a month before the first injury.\n\nManchester City sink Leicester with Kevin de Bruyne super strike Read more\n\nHowe said: “I’ve been there myself in the respect you get a serious injury, it’s a lonely place, it’s a hard place to come back from. Especially when you consider for Callum he’d just scored a hat-trick in the Premier League, in his first taste of the Premier League. It looked like he had the world at his feet and it changed in an instant. Through that period he always maintained his enthusiasm, his positivity, he’s always a good person to engage with and see. And he’s worked incredibly hard on his body to make sure he comes back in the shape that he has, so full credit to him. The quality of his finishes for the goals was really, really high so it’s been a really good night for him.”\n\nHuddersfield’s David Wagner criticised the officials and felt they made mistakes that turned the game in Bournemouth’s favour. The Terriers had been the better team in the opening stages but they fell behind when Wilson headed home Jordon Ibe’s corner moments after a strong challenge by Charlie Daniels on Florent Hadergjonaj went unpunished by the referee, Lee Probert. Wilson was then possibly marginally offside for Bournemouth’s second.\n\n“When we speak about a 2-0 half-time result against us, [it is] after two referee’s decisions which are not correct,” Wagner said. “For the first corner, it was a clear harsh tackle. It was maybe more than a yellow card in this moment and we concede a corner where they scored the first one and before the second goal it was a yard offside after a free-kick, so this is the referee’s job to see this. This wasn’t difficult to see because it was a set play.\n\nNiasse rescues point for Everton in chaotic draw with Crystal Palace Read more\n\n“Unfortunately, from my point of view, it wasn’t correct and this is what we have to accept. These two goals changed the game completely and then in the second half we have not created enough.”\n\nWilson had the final say when he drilled in his third goal six minutes from time after Josh

times for a historic club and miserable ones for what had been a modern-day success story.\n\nBurnley have now recorded a first hat-trick of top-flight wins since 1975 and are still level on points with Liverpool and Arsenal. In contrast, Swansea remain rooted in the relegation zone after a fifth successive defeat. Their American co-owner Steve Kaplan witnessed a wretched display, soundtracked by the 680 travelling fans calling for the chairman, Huw Jenkins, to go. While the manager Paul Clement’s job is not thought to be under immediate threat, too many more such performances will surely change that.\n\nChelsea turn up heat on Tony Pulis with four-goal rout of West Brom Read more\n\nOn and off the pitch, Swansea were architects of their own downfall. Both Burnley goals were eminently avoidable. The first, with crushing inevitability, was scored by the man they offloaded in the summer. Jack Cork’s November, which already included his England debut, duly got better. “What a couple of weeks he has had,” said his manager, Sean Dyche. “That was the business that was decided to be done,” said Clement, suggesting it was not his decision. “I like Jack a lot.”\n\nCork has quickly become integral at Burnley whereas Roque Mesa, the midfielder Swansea signed as he was sold, did not even make the visitors’ bench.\n\nIt was one of several instructive choices. Renato Sanches, a European Championship-winning central midfielder, was crowbarred into the team on the left wing as Clement switched to a conventional 4-4-2; he claimed it was an attacking gambit but it seemed a misguided attempt to match Burnley’s shape. The Clarets often attack on the flanks but, with Swansea undermanned in the middle, twice prospered in space in central areas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ashley Barnes scores Burnley’s second goal of the game during their win over Swansea Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA\n\nUnlike Clement, Dyche is in a golden phase of decision-making. He preferred Ashley Barnes to Sam Vokes, the match-winner at Southampton, to deputise for the rested Chris Wood and saw the New Zealander’s understudy contribute to the first goal and score the second.\n\nFor the opener, an unmarked Cork was a catalyst in a move he completed by meeting Robbie Brady’s cross. “I love to see my midfielders driving into the box,” said Dyche. “The days of Bryan Robson flying into the box and heading it in are not as often now.”\n\nSwansea were beaten. “When the first goal went in, belief and confidence got sucked out of the players,” Clement said. Barnes rifled in an unstoppable second. Jeff Hendrick, Barnes and Steven Defour were all denied other goals by Lukasz Fabianski. It was the first time since the opening-day victory at Chelsea that Burnley had scored more than once. They have made comparatively few goals go a long way.\n\nManchester City sink Leicester with Kevin de Bruyne super strike Read more\n\nSwansea have not. “Of course I am concerned,” said Clement. “I would be stupid if I wasn’t. I am concerned about our level of performance, our position in the table and the number of goals we have scored. Seven in 12 games is not enough.”\n\nNo team have had fewer efforts on target. Swansea added a solitary one to the list, a tame injury-time header from the substitute Wilfried Bony. Tammy Abraham, the scorer of 57 per cent of their league goals, was first starved of service and then taken off with a back spasm. The closest they came was courtesy of a Burnley player, Matthew Lowton’s cannonball of a volley flying past his own post.\n\n“We are playing under our potential and I have to find a way to break this cycle,” Clement added, confident Kaplan will give him the opportunity to do that but aware of the possible consequences of a slide. “If the owners feel there is someone that can get better out of these players, it is their right to do that.”"}, {"date": "18/11/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25526, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni",

26 – as evidence of Everton’s desperation to wrest back some control. But, in the end, all that truly remained was exasperation. “I can’t ask for more than I got from the players, but I must admit to being bitterly disappointed,” he said. “I want to see points on the board.”\n\nPalace are not performing like a side condemned to the foot of the division, with this the latest encouraging display that merited more than a mere point. They have belatedly injected some zest into their attacking play, boast pace and invention and their control of possession is less slapdash than it was. But they are still not winning games, and their leeway for dropping the odd point has gone. If Everton, such an awkward mishmash of a team, cannot be overcome, then who can?\n\nThe hosts were the more threatening team throughout, with Wilfried Zaha, Andros Townsend and Ruben Loftus-Cheek irrepressible. They eased ahead after barely 50 seconds, overcame a sense of injustice at Everton’s first equaliser to regain their lead and were even the more persuasive team after the interval. Yet the sight of Jordan Pickford pawing away efforts from Luka Milivojevic and Christian Benteke late on drew wails of frustration from the locals. This was a missed opportunity and, for all the controversy over the award of Leighton Baines’s penalty, it had been gifted to the visitors.\n\nPalace had regained the lead courtesy of Zaha’s superbly constructed goal as the game lurched into stoppage time at the end of the first half, with Julián Speroni dummying Oumar Niasse as he controlled the ball inside his own area. His pass to Scott Dann left the captain in the lurch, Idrissa Gueye duly snapping in to force the ball free. Niasse calmly collected, advanced and slid the visitors’ second equaliser into the corner. “We committed hara-kiri,” said Hodgson. Speroni would make amends of sorts with a fine save from Dominic Calvert‑Lewin after the break, but the sense of deflation at half-time was palpable.\n\nThe penalty award, too, had grated. Niasse had been in Palace’s Soho offices on transfer deadline day after terms had effectively been agreed with Everton over an £8m move, only for the plug to be pulled just before the cut-off. Here he was a nuisance with a point to prove, wriggling away from Dann five minutes in and apparently sensing the centre-half might dangle a leg en route. There was no trip forthcoming – the contact was between centre-half’s shoulder and striker’s chest, though it was hardly forceful – but the referee, Anthony Taylor, was still convinced enough by the crumple to award the spot-kick.\n\n“It was a long way away, but it looked like there was contact,” said David Unsworth. “But what I would say is Oumar will always take on an opportunity. If he’s got clipped or pushed …”\n\nBaines scored and Hodgson was still complaining to the fourth official when the second half kicked off, but he recognised his team should have prospered regardless. They had led initially through James McArthur’s volley, the Scot pouncing after Pickford pushed out Loftus-Cheek’s shot. Zaha’s second, converted from Joel Ward’s wonderful centre, would have had him purring, but other opportunities did not yield reward. The winner they craved never came.\n\nInstead it was Unsworth who was thumping his chest in pride at the end, the caretaker still desperate to make this position his own on a full-time basis. “If I get the job, I’ll be delighted,” he said. “But whoever gets the job, I’ll shake them by the hand and wish them the best. What will be will be.”\n\n\n\nHis team were fortunate, the rather disjointed nature of their squad all too apparent. But they are in a far healthier position than their hosts.\n\nMohamed Salah hits double to help Liverpool cruise past Southampton Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wilfried Zaha scores to make it 2-1 to Crystal Palace during their Premier League match with Everton.

"report": "It is hard to believe now that Manchester City lost this fixture 4-2 a year ago, putting in a shambolic performance that fatally undermined any pretensions they might have had of a title challenge.\n\nThey arrived here 18 points ahead of the Foxes and deservedly increased the gap to 21 with an impressive display of control, even with two centre-halves who were rusty through lack of games. Leicester City did not play badly; they might have taken something from the game against most opponents, but the whole point about Manchester City these days is that they are not any old opponents.\n\nMohamed Salah hits double to help Liverpool cruise past Southampton Read more\n\nThis was their 10th league win in a row, their 16th of an all-competition sequence, and it could have been even more emphatic, with Leroy Sané in particular finding space and running past defenders at will.\n\nWhen Pep Guardiola the perfectionist puts together his weekly mistake compilation for training-ground analysis, he will probably point to a couple of occasions in the second half when his side were grateful to see offside flags raised against Jamie Vardy, but will mostly be wanting to know why his forwards did not finish with the sort of precision they showed in their buildups.\n\n“We scored two amazing goals, but we created a lot more promising situations,” Guardiola said. “We could still be a little better in the final action.”\n\nMaking his first start in more than two months, Vincent Kompany was nearly in trouble after a couple of minutes for a professional foul on Vardy. A delicately weighted pass from Vicente Iborra hit Vardy’s stride before Kompany had recognised the danger and all the defender could do was bring down the Leicester striker before he raced into the penalty area. The home supporters clearly felt Graham Scott took the easy option in producing just a yellow card, for, although it was hardly the clearest of goalscoring opportunities, it was just the sort of chance Vardy thrives on. “Kompany was the last man and it should have been a red card,” Claude Puel said. “That could have changed the face of the game.”\n\nThe first real goal chance of the afternoon arrived midway through the first half when Kasper Schmeichel had to be alert to tip a David Silva shot over his bar. The visitors had been stroking the ball around expansively without managing to find Gabriel Jesus on the end of any of their approach work, but when Fabian Delph played Sané into space on the left, his cut-back brought a first-time shot on target from David Silva.\n\nA Manchester City backline already missing the suspended Nicolás Otamendi was further depleted on the half-hour when John Stones suffered a hamstring injury that will keep him out for a month. The England defender pulled up in pain after chasing the elusive Demarai Gray and was replaced by Eliaquim Mangala, making his second league appearance of the season. While Guardiola said he had no problem with Gareth Southgate playing Stones in both of England’s recent friendlies, he was the one who mentioned it.\n\nGuardiola was worried about the pace in Leicester’s frontline even before he lost both his first-choice central defenders, so a goal on the stroke of the interval must have come as a relief. The visitors had been threatening to score for a while, with David Silva shooting over and Sané bringing a save from Schmeichel, and the only surprise about the opening goal was the identity of its scorer. Jesus had been having such an unproductive afternoon it was easy to forget he was on the pitch, but he popped up in exactly the right place, as goalscorers often will, to complete a prolonged passing move with a tap-in. David Silva could probably have scored on his own after Raheem Sterling played a one-two with Kevin De Bruyne and left him with only Schmeichel to beat; instead, he opted to make sure, aware that Jesus was up in support to his right.\n\nManchester City underlined their superiority with a goal of similar quality at the start of the second half, though one had to feel slightly sorry for Leicester, who effectively began the move when Harry Maguire saw a shot come back off a post. The hugely impressive Fernandinho moved the play swiftly upfield to De Bruyne, who accepted a return pass from Sané before shuffling the ball to his left foot to beat Schmeichel with a glorious rising drive from outside the area.\n\nThere were no more goals after that, although there could have been. Perhaps Manchester City are not yet as clinical as they would like to be, but towards the end of the game, when Maguire was eventually booked for fouling Sterling twice in the same move at either end of the pitch, you could tell Leicester had had enough of being run ragged. Normally one of the most energetic teams, they just wanted the match to be over.\n\nWhile this draining effect on opponents might be nothing new for Guardiola, it is a significant, not to say ominous, development for opponents of Manchester City.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Stones had to go off with a hamstring injury on the half-hour mark.

He has quickly established a regal presence at club level too. Liverpool’s £36.9m summer signing struck another two goals as Southampton were comprehensively outclassed.\n\nSalah followed up a two-goal display at West Ham United before the international break with two more to take his place as the Premier League’s leading goalscorer. He was signed from Roma with speed and creativity in mind but he has exceeded expectations with 14 goals in 18 games in all competitions for his new, grateful club. Nine goals in his first 12 Premier League outings for Liverpool has also set a club record. And to think the former Chelsea winger’s finishing was subject to legitimate criticism earlier in the season.\n\nManchester City sink Leicester with Kevin de Bruyne super strike Read more\n\n“Mo is in a good moment,” said an understated Jürgen Klopp. “That is good for us. The first one was not a real chance from that position, I would say. It was a fantastic goal. The second goal was fantastic play.\n\n“It was an all-round good performance and also very important. We have pushed the top of the table together and that is really good. [Manchester] City are flying and pretty much alone. We cannot change that but we can make pressure on the others and we will do that.”\n\nSalah departed to a deserved standing ovation in the 80th minute and into an embrace from Klopp as he savoured his first league win over Southampton, at the fifth attempt, and a victory that moved Liverpool to within a point of Tottenham Hotspur in fourth. Philippe Coutinho provided the final flourish but Salah was the game‑changer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Philippe Coutinho celebrates after scoring Liverpool’s third goal. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images via Reuters\n\nSouthampton did not set out merely to absorb pressure and avoid a serious beating. They were just made to look that way as Liverpool controlled possession and gradually weakened a well-organised defence with the quality of their distribution and movement. That said, the manner of Liverpool’s breakthrough was galling for a manager of Mauricio Pellegrino’s defensive pedigree. One win in seven matches is a worry, he admitted, and that sequence was never in doubt from the moment Dusan Tadic committed a cardinal sin on the edge of his penalty area.\n\nLiverpool had dominated but created few clear openings when Virgil van Dijk headed a Jordan Henderson corner out to the Serbian winger. Tadic had space and opportunity to stretch the hosts. Instead, he ran across his area where three Liverpool players were lurking, with predictable results. Roberto Firmino dispossessed Tadic, Georginio Wijnaldum picked out Salah free on the right and the forward swept a stunning, angled finish beyond Fraser Forster from 20 yards. A gift brilliantly accepted.\n\n“You need these moments,” Klopp said. “We have not had them too often this season. We all know what it has been like after 50, 60 minutes here without a goal. It could be the same performance but you need these goals and thank God we scored them. That makes all the difference.”\n\nKenny Dalglish: ‘As long as we’re living we won’t have closure on Hillsborough’ Read more\n\nSalah’s second arrived courtesy of a truly exquisite ball into the area from Coutinho. There appeared little on for the Brazilian when he received Henderson’s pass 30 yards from the Southampton goal. But he spotted Salah’s run behind Wesley Hoedt and slipped the ball perfectly into his stride. Salah turned a first time shot past Forster with Southampton defenders appealing for offside, more in hope than expectation.\n\nThe visitors threatened little and a brief second-half surge was quashed by a Liverpool defence featuring impressive performances from Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dejan Lovren. Salah almost created a third for Alberto Moreno but his through ball got caught underneath the rampaging left-back, who missed the birth of his son, Alberto Junior, on Friday night to prepare for the game.\n\nThe pass that eventually delivered Liverpool’s third was, like Coutinho’s, an inspirational touch. Sadio Mané removed two defenders from the equation with a brilliant reverse ball into the unmarked Roberto Firmino. His shot cannoned off Forster and into the path of Coutinho who steered the ball home from 12 yards."}, {"date": "18/11/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 23592, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Hegazy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Grzegorz Krychowiak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver Burke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Tiemoué Bakayoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [38], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [19], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23, 62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ethan Ampadu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The message was loud and clear as the home supporters spelt out to Guochuan Lai, the club’s Chinese owner, exactly what they think of Tony Pulis.

Pulis’s position felt untenable come the end and the 59-year-old sounded like a man who is resigned to his fate when he attended the post-match press conference,\n\nThe empty seats before the game told a story – faith was lost in these parts a long time ago – and so did the sight of many others leaving with 27 minutes remaining. Eden Hazard had just scored his second and Chelsea’s fourth as they coasted to a fourth successive Premier League victory.\n\nThis had turned into an exercise in damage limitation for Albion long before half-time. Chelsea were 3-0 up after only 38 minutes and, as well as the Premier League champions played at times, it was alarming to see a team managed by Pulis defending so shambolically. There was so much time and space for Chelsea to exploit and the visitors were not going to pass up the opportunity.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eden Hazard was the architect of Chelsea’s win at West Brom, scoring twice. Photograph: Roland Harrison/AFP/Getty Images\n\nÁlvaro Morata continued his excellent start to the season, netting Chelsea’s first from close range and setting up the second for Hazard, taking his tally to eight goals and four assists in the league. Marcos Alonso then scored Chelsea’s third, taking advantage of some appalling marking from a set-piece, before Hazard added the goal that reflected the gulf in quality between the two sides.\n\nAntonio Conte will have few easier afternoons in the dugout. “The game became easy because we started very well,” said Chelsea’s manager, who senses that his team are finding some form. “Last season we won 13 games in a row and I must be honest, in this league it’s not simple to have this type of run, because every game you have to play with great concentration. But four wins in a row is important for us and our confidence. We started this season with many problems but we are trying slowly to find the right solution.”\n\nMorata certainly seems like the answer up front. The Spaniard’s opening goal was routine enough but it was an exquisite flick he produced from Cesc Fàbregas’s pass to set Hazard free for Chelsea’s second. Hazard rounded Ben Foster with the minimum of fuss, rolled the ball into the empty net and already, with 23 minutes gone, it felt like there was no way back for Albion.\n\nManchester City sink Leicester with Kevin de Bruyne super strike Read more\n\nThat feeling was reinforced when Alonso added the third. Fàbregas, who was involved in three of Chelsea’s four goals, delivered a free-kick from wide on the left and it is no exaggeration to say that there was no defender within five yards of Alonso, who volleyed high into the roof of the net with the angle against him at the far post.\n\nToothless up front, overrun in midfield and wide open at the back, Albion were all over the place and it was no surprise when Chelsea grabbed a fourth.

It still might not be enough when it comes to the task of catching, and overhauling, Manchester City at the top of the Premier League – but it must still feel reassuring for Manchester United’s supporters to see these two wearing the team’s colours again.\n\nFor Ibrahimovic, it was his first appearance since his cruciate ligaments were ruptured in April and it was a tremendous cheer when he came on in the 77th minute. All the goals had gone in by that stage but, Zlatan being Zlatan, one imagines he is certain he can still have a considerable influence on this season’s title race. He will be outraged, undoubtedly, that an acrobatic volley was saved by the Newcastle goalkeeper, Rob Elliot, to deny him a comeback goal in the final moments.\n\nManchester City sink Leicester with Kevin de Bruyne super strike Read more\n\nNo matter. This was still a satisfying evening for José Mourinho in many different ways. Pogba was excellent, capping his return from two months out with the team’s third goal, and Romelu Lukaku should also feel better after ending his barren run. Lukaku lashed in his goal in the manner of someone who had grown weary of being reminded he had not scored for his club since 30 September.\n\nIt was the seventh occasion this season Mourinho’s side have scored four times, with Anthony Martial and Chris Smalling also on target, but perhaps the most impressive part was what it said about the team’s resilience bearing in mind Newcastle had opened the scoring, via Dwight Gayle, and played superbly in the opening half an hour.\n\nIt was the first league goal scored by an opponent at Old Trafford this season and it took a while for Mourinho’s players to shake their heads clear. Newcastle could certainly feel aggrieved to be losing at half-time and will think back to the chance Jacob Murphy could not convert six minutes after Gayle’s precise strike. Newcastle looked impressive for long spells but that missed chance, with the opportunity to go 2-0 ahead, was crucial bearing in mind the way the complexion of the game changed before half-time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zlatan Ibrahimovic unleashes a bicycle kick which was saved by Rob Elliot. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe home team also had the taller players and there was always the danger Newcastle might come up short in defence, particularly with Jamaal Lascelles among their list of absentees. Martial was the first to take advantage, outjumping DeAndre Yedlin to head in Pogba’s cross for the equaliser and when the next goal arrived in first-half stoppage time it was another back-post header, albeit with the ball coming in from the opposite side. Smalling had drifted free and was inside the six-yard area when Ashley Young picked him out to apply the decisive touch.\n\nEven then, there was still time for Isaac Hayden to run clear before half-time only to be kept out by David de Gea’s save. Ultimately, though, Mourinho was not exaggerating with his assessment of the next 45 minutes. “The second half was ours,” he said. And Pogba’s performance? “Top,” the United manager added, matter-of-factly.\n\nArsenal front three give supporters a glimpse of better times ahead | Barney Roney Read more\n\nIt did not always click and Newcastle kept on attacking, making it another difficult occasion for Victor Lindelof, deputising for the injured Phil Jones. Lindelof has found it tough since his £30m move from Benfica and Gayle’s 14th-minute goal was another ordeal for the Sweden international. Yedlin, Newcastle’s attacking right-back, created the opening with a surging run and Lindelof’s slip left Gayle on his own. The striker’s finish was impeccable, aimed to De Gea’s right and going in off the upright.\n\nNewcastle were terrific in the opening exchanges and Mourinho even felt moved to praise Rafael Benítez, one of his old enemies, for the away team’s tactics. Not many teams are brave enough to come here with two strikers but perhaps Benítez sensed the home defence, also missing Eric Bailly, might be more vulnerable than usual. If so, he was absolutely correct.\n\nLukaku also looked a little hesitant early on, as might be expected for someone who had failed to score in the previous seven games. That, however, felt like a deception by the end. His goal was a demonstration of raw power, smashing his shot into the roof of the net after a bulldozing run, a one-two with Juan Mata and a wishy-washy challenge from Florian Lejeune, and the striker was also prominently involved when Pogba made it 3-1 nine minutes into the second half.\n\nLukaku’s cross was expertly delivered and it was a lovely cushioned header from Marcus Rashford to direct the ball across the six-yard area, leaving Pogba with a tap-in. Pogba danced for the crowd and the final word went to Ibrahimovic. Had he ever doubted, at the age of 36, that he would recover? “Never,” he said. “Because lions don’t recover like humans.”"}, {"date": "05/11/2017", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 65270, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georges-Kevin N'Koudou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Foyth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Whiteman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timothy Fosu-Mensah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luka Milivojevic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jairo Riedewald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Roy Hodgson turned on his heel and marched back towards the bench. The Crystal Palace manager’s stony-faced fury told the story. Football can be the cruellest of pursuits and how Hodgson felt it shortly after the hour at the home of English football – a venue that had been kind to him during his time in charge of England.\n\nHis Palace team had held Tottenham Hotspur at arm’s length and created a clutch of chances to take the lead. Paulo Gazzaniga, the third-choice goalkeeper for Tottenham, had been the reason why it remained goalless while Wilfried Zaha had blown a glorious chance in the 57th minute.\n\nIn a heartbeat the game turned, however, and Hodgson had that sinking feeling. Son Heung-min’s winner was a beautifully executed finish, quite out of keeping with the rest of his performance and that of his team. The South Korea forward’s body shape was perfect and he got his left-foot shot to bend back into the corner of the net from a yard or so outside the post.\n\nHodgson could curse how the ball had reached Son. After Danny Rose had jinked inside and seen a shot blocked, Moussa Sissoko continued the move with a low cross from the right. Yohan Cabaye had the chance to clear but he succeeded only in playing it straight to the Spurs man. The attacker did the rest and Palace could not rouse themselves thereafter.\n\nIt was a curious afternoon for Mauricio Pochettino and his players. After the epic Champions League win against Real Madrid on Wednesday, they could not muster the same verve; the manager admitted it was “not the best performance” and his side needed “some luck to win”. On the other hand, undeserved victories do have their charm.\n\nPochettino’s inclusion of Gazzaniga, for his Tottenham debut, had been unexpected. With Hugo Lloris out with an adductor muscle problem, Michel Vorm had been in line for a rare Premier League opportunity but he twisted a knee in training on Saturday.\n\nGazzaniga embraced the opportunity but only after flirting with disaster at the start. Three minutes were on the clock when Zaha – a player whom Spurs covet – curled in a lovely cross for Mamadou Sakho. The defender had the run on Gazzaniga but he could not get a touch when, perhaps, he should have done.\n\nIt is possible that he was spooked by the sight of Gazzaniga leaping wildly in his direction and, when the ball was gone, the goalkeeper essentially clotheslined him. Penalty? It seemed like the sort of action that would have been penalised outside the area. The referee, Kevin Friend, was unmoved and Hodgson later suggested he was more unhappy that Sakho did not reach the header.\n\nPochettino was without Dele Alli, the two-goal star of the Madrid win, because of a hamstring injury, and his team laboured for tempo and cohesion. Rose fluffed a first-half header while Son was torn between crossing and shooting when well-placed on the left of the area. In the end he did neither and the ball went out for a throw-in. Pochettino also lost Harry Winks to a twisted ankle at half-time.\n\nPalace did what many clubs have already done against Tottenham at Wembley this season: they kept men behind the ball, compressed the space between the lines and looked to punch on the counterattack or from a set‑piece.\n\nIt did not matter to them that Tottenham hogged 68% of possession. Pochettino’s team are sometimes more dangerous when they do not have a lot of the ball.\n\nPalace would have led in the 36th minute following a Cabaye corner but for an excellent save by Gazzaniga. Scott Dann rose above Eric Dier and he sent a header towards the bottom corner. Gazzaniga showcased his reflexes and Jan Vertonghen completed the clearance.\n\nBy the hour, it was difficult to understand how Palace were not in front. Gazzaniga tipped Andros Townsend’s low shot around the far post after the former Tottenham winger had seized upon a poor ball from Serge Aurier to run through, and he also beat out Luka Milivojevic’s header at the far post after a corner had deflected up off Dier.\n\nZaha was excellent – quick, powerful and direct – but he blotted his copybook with his miss. You would have got long odds on him dragging his shot past the far post, net gaping, after he had taken the ball around Gazzaniga on a fast break. That is what he did. The angle was a little tight but a player of his refinement had to score.\n\nThe chance had been presented by another blunder from Aurier and Townsend’s through-ball for Zaha was perfectly judged. Zaha was furious with himself. Son would twist the knife moments later."}, {"date": "05/11/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54286, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [19], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [50], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [59], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Macey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It still feels too early, with the leaves falling from the trees and fireworks in the sky, to assume Manchester City are going to turn the Premier League into a procession and that nothing can possibly go wrong for Pep Guardiola’s freewheeling side. But it certainly seems a possibility when they are playing this way, the goals are flying in from every angle and the team enjoying the view from the top of the league are on course to smash just about every scoring record in history.\n\nFrom their first 11 fixtures City have greedily accumulated 38 goals. Their goals-per-game ratio actually came down a touch here but, once again, it was difficult to tot up how many chances they created and, in the process, they made it another demoralising experience for Arsène Wenger’s side. This is the first time since 1981 Arsenal have lost four of their first six away games. The defeat leaves them sixth, 12 points from the top, and it would have been a rout had the home team been more ruthless during their periods of near-complete superiority.\n\nAs it was, City made do with a goal each for Kevin De Bruyne and the substitute Gabriel Jesus and, in between, a penalty for Sergio Agüero on the day the Argentinian was presented with a “Blue Boot” trophy for becoming the club’s all-time record scorer. Shaun Goater, Niall Quinn and David White were among the lineup of former City forwards at the pre‑match presentation and it was another reminder how this club has changed under Abu Dhabi ownership.\n\nThe scariest part for the chasing pack of teams is that Guardiola’s men might actually regard this as a slightly scruffy performance at times. There was even the sight of David Silva, Fernandino and De Bruyne misplacing a few passes and Raheem Sterling might wake in a cold sweat when he thinks back to a two-on-one breakaway in the first half when his mind filled with uncertainty and he made a pig’s ear of his pass to Leroy Sané. Guardiola, scarcely believing what he had just seen, looked close to the point of spontaneous combustion.\n\nUltimately, though, City were the better side by some distance and there was only one brief spell, after the Arsenal substitute Alexandre Lacazette had made it 2-1, when the home side had a period of vulnerability. By the end there were olés from the crowd, shortly after the announcement that the brilliant, mesmeric De Bruyne had been named as the game’s outstanding performer. Those olés are becoming the soundtrack to what is shaping up to be a record-breaking season. “Can anyone stop them?” Wenger asked afterwards. “It will be difficult this season.”\n\nWenger could not resist a spiky follow-up line about the standard of refereeing – “If they get decisions like that, at home, they will be unstoppable” – and was entitled to complain that City’s third goal was offside. Yet Arsenal look what they are: a side that has been drifting for too long, 13 years and counting since their last league title. “He wants to be blue,” the home fans sang about Alexis Sánchez and Wenger could not deny it. It was, he said, a “huge mental test” for Sánchez to face the team he nearly joined in the last transfer window.\n\nPlay Video 1:18 Wenger bemoans referee after Manchester City outclass Arsenal – video\n\nSánchez had a difficult afternoon and, on this evidence, he might not find it straightforward getting into City’s starting XI if the transfer is resurrected in January. Francis Coquelin looked out of place as an experimental centre-half in a 3-4-2-1 formation and it was not until Agüero’s penalty that Lacazette came on to score with a right-foot finish, set up by Aaron Ramsey, to raise the possibility of an Arsenal comeback.\n\nInstead back came City, swarming all over their opponents before Jesus turned in Silva’s pass while the Arsenal defence waited for offside to be given. The flag should have gone up but it was inches rather than yards – a bad decision, yes, but at this level it was startling to see the collective freeze from the visiting defence.\n\nDe Bruyne took his goal beautifully, playing a one-two with Fernandinho before drilling a diagonal left-foot shot past Petr Cech. But that, too, was aided by the reluctance of every single Arsenal player, most notably Laurent Koscielny, to make a tackle or close the Belgian down.\n\nWenger was unhappy about the penalty and claimed the standard of refereeing in the top division is going down year after year. These outbursts are nothing new after Arsenal defeats and, whatever Wenger might believe, the referee, Michael Oliver, was entitled to think Nacho Monreal had bundled Sterling over. It was debatable but most referees would have concluded it was a foul and Wenger, almost certainly, would have if it was the other way round. Agüero’s penalty went in off the post and, as City power on, Arsenal are becoming a speck in the distance."}, {"date": "05/11/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41615, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Tiemoué Bakayoko", "yellows": [20], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [55], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ethan Ampadu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This is the kind of result to stifle talk of crisis at Chelsea. The Premier League’s summit may remain distant but the joyous din which erupted inside the ground at the final whistle was an outpouring of relief. Antonio Conte celebrated manically, fists raised in triumph towards those in the upper tier of the East stand, before striding out on to the pitch to acknowledge each side of the ground in turn. José Mourinho waited near the tunnel to shake his counterpart’s hand but eventually gave up. He looked distinctly unimpressed to be enduring Conte’s moment.\n\nIt may seem vaguely ludicrous that a head coach who has now overseen 37 wins from his 49 Premier League games in charge could be considered under pressure but Conte had needed this victory. That humiliation in Rome in midweek had left him embattled, with suggestions the hierarchy had not taken kindly to the realism with which he has approached a cluttered campaign, and the first murmurings of discontent within the playing squad surfacing with every setback.\n\nYet against imposing opponents in Manchester United, and not for the first time since he arrived in England, his major decisions paid off: his side played with the same system, style and swagger as at Atlético Madrid in September; N’Golo Kanté’s reintegration in midfield was key to a second clean sheet in nine games; Andreas Christensen, preferred to David Luiz in the middle of the back three, was mightily impressive.\n\nGabriel Jesus strikes from the bench as rampant Manchester City see off Arsenal Read more\n\nThe Brazilian had worn heavy strapping on his right leg at the Stadio Olimpico but had been omitted here for “tactical reasons”, according to Conte, with the implication it was down to shoddy form. The Italian had pointed pre-match to Christensen’s early-season displays and to the fact “the club likes to bring in a young player” when it came to Ethan Ampadu, a 17-year-old without any experience of top-flight football, being preferred on the bench over David Luiz.\n\nAfter the match Conte suggested David Luiz would have “to work really hard, or [risk to] be on the bench or in the stand”. As it was, the defender sat behind the dugouts next to his compatriot Kenedy, whose yawn in Thursday’s debrief had been noted, and watched his team-mates put in their most convincing display for more than a month. It will be intriguing to see how such a charismatic figure now forces his way back into the fold. Certainly his team-mates have demonstrated they can do without him.\n\nIt was tempting to wonder whether Mourinho’s presence in the dugout had merely coaxed the best from Chelsea, as it once did so often when he was on the payroll. His current team never showed any real control on this occasion, their few chances squeezed out on the break – they mustered only two on target all afternoon – until a late rally which threatened to earn them an equaliser they would not have merited. Their own gap from Manchester City is now eight points, which “is not the same as eight points in the Portuguese league, La Liga, the Bundesliga”‚ according to the manager.\n\nSon Heung-min seals laboured Tottenham win over Crystal Palace Read more\n\nThe disappointment was in their inability to wound their hosts, with Marouane Fellaini’s late volley, turned away smartly by Thibaut Courtois, the closest they came to reward. Marcus Rashford’s was a pesky presence but there was no real rhythm to their approach and, without their injured absentees, they were forced too often into retreat. Romelu Lukaku, one spin and shot from distance aside, was isolated and contained. Teams far less imposing than United have created considerably more against these opponents this term, and that ended up feeling rather damning.\n\nAdmittedly Kanté’s energetic presence was significant and inevitably bolstered Chelsea’s collective. The champions had kept only one clean sheet during his six-game absence, with a hamstring injury sustained on international duty with France. Yet it was the home side’s attacking play which truly caught the eye. Their goal had been forged in familiar fashion, César Azpilicueta flinging over one of those trademark diagonal crosses from which Diego Costa and Álvaro Morata have benefited in recent times. The Spaniard met it emphatically, having trundled unnoticed into the space between United’s centre-halves with Chris Smalling drawn towards Tiémoué Bakayoko’s run, to plant his header beyond a static David de Gea and leave Mourinho cursing another miserable homecoming.\n\nBut Chelsea should have had more to show for their dominance. The excellent Eden Hazard, whose ankles had been kicked raw by the end, was denied regularly by De Gea, Cesc Fàbregas nodded into the side-netting from close range, Bakayoko missed two glorious opportunities and the referee, Anthony Taylor, penalised Morata for a push on Phil Jones early on after the defender had inadvertently conjured a volley as he crumpled clumsily which arrowed the ball into the top corner.\n\nEach miss had left Conte agonised on the touchline, his impatience drawing warnings from the fourth official, Craig Pawson, for encroachment as Mourinho watched on, presumably wondering if he would be treated quite so leniently. But this was the Italian’s day. “We can win or lose but our spirit must be this,” said Conte. “We started this season with a lot of problems. We were up and down. But this game showed that, if we want it, we can do it.”"}, {"date": "05/11/2017", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38609, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beni Baningime", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [67], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [74], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Carrillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [46], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jerome Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Orestis Karnezis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefano Okaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "David Unsworth may not land the Everton manager’s job he craves but he will never receive a better endorsement of his ability to generate spirit and fight in a team than what transpired on a truly remarkable evening at Goodison Park. The first win of his temporary reign came with passion, pandemonium, a 91st-minute penalty and a 100th-minute penalty miss. “I need a lie down,” said Unsworth after a breathless encounter in which Everton refused to do exactly that.\n\nWatford deservedly led 2-0 just after the hour and Goodison was stirring in revolt against an Everton team looking every inch the relegation candidate. The team, improved by Unsworth’s substitutions, pulled them back from the brink. The indefatigable Oumar Niasse instigated the fightback, Dominic Calvert-Lewin levelled and Leighton Baines converted a high-stakes penalty in injury time, replacing Unsworth as Everton’s all-time leading penalty scorer in the process.\n\nIt did not end there. In the 10th of 12 minutes added on for significant injuries to Heurelho Gomes and Christian Kabasele, Watford won a penalty of their own when Jordan Pickford fouled Richarlison. Tom Cleverley, a former Everton midfielder, stepped up in the absence of the suspended Troy Deeney. Goodison had a collective seizure. Cleverley missed.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos Read more\n\nIt now falls to Farhad Moshiri, Everton’s major shareholder, to appoint the club’s next manager. Sam Allardyce, assisted by Craig Shakespeare, is being given serious consideration by the Everton hierarchy. Watford’s Marco Silva is also of interest. At the last, and after three demoralising defeats, Unsworth promoted his claims too. “It is difficult to say what it will mean,” said Everton’s caretaker manager on the implications of victory on his job prospects. “But what we gave in the second half was what I’d say was a real Everton performance, full of heart and character. That is how you should play.”\n\nUnsworth has been the model of discretion on the subject of the imbalanced squad bequeathed to him by Ronald Koeman and the director of football, Steve Walsh, but his selections have damned several expensive signings and senior players. Morgan Schneiderlin joined the list of expensive absentees against Watford after his woeful season reached a new low with an unprofessional red card against Lyon.\n\nThere was an improvement in Everton’s pressing game during a flat first half but their lack of width and quality in the final third was again telling. Unsworth repeated the tried and mistrusted combination of Wayne Rooney and Gylfi Sigurdsson behind the hard-working Niasse. Both toiled yet again and were substituted to good effect.\n\nWatford did not recapture the form that scared Chelsea at Stamford Bridge and has produced three away wins this season, but were dangerous throughout. Richarlison should have opened the scoring shortly before half-time when released by the prominent Andre Gray but hit the side-netting having rounded the Everton goalkeeper. He made no mistake with his next opportunity.\n\nOnly 30 seconds had elapsed in the second half when Silva’s side exposed Everton’s weakness against the counterattack. Michael Keane was second best in a challenge with André Carrillo and suddenly Watford had two men against only Jonjoe Kenny. Gray clipped his pass to Richarlison, who again rounded Pickford and converted from close range. A roller-coaster of a second half was under way.\n\nÁlvaro Morata heads Chelsea to victory over Manchester United Read more\n\nSigurdsson should have levelled when Niasse picked him out unmarked in front of goal but, similarly to Baines in the first half, he shot too close to Heurelho Gomes and the visiting keeper saved comfortably. The keeper suffered a head injury when dealing with Rooney’s cross from the rebound, colliding with Kabasele, and his departure contributed to Everton’s recovery. But the home side were two goals in arrears when the comeback began.\n\nChristian Kabasele powered in a header from Kiko Femenía’s corner to double Watford’s advantage. Goodison erupted in anger but was soon given hope by Niasse, who capitalised on hesitation between Gomes’ replacement, the debutant Orestis Karnezis, and José Holebas as they attempted to deal with Ademola Lookman’s ball down the left. Niasse nipped in and his touch trickled over the line as Kabasele fouled him from behind. The introduction of Calvert-Lewin for Rooney paid swift dividends. Watford left the striker completely unmarked as Baines swept a corner to the back post and the England Under-21 forward punished the oversight with a close-range header. Another costly set-piece lapse for Silva’s team.\n\nGoodison was now in tumult, particularly when Holebas gave Everton the chance to win the game and possibly turn their season by conceding a late penalty. Aaron Lennon, Unsworth’s third substitution, flicked the ball over the left-back and was impeded when Holebas slipped in his path. “A harsh decision,” said a visibly enraged Silva, who refused to discuss the Everton links. After a lengthy wait, and with the weight of a relegation struggle on his shoulders, Baines fired the spot-kick beyond Karnezis’ despairing dive. Cleverley failed to do likewise, leaving Unsworth to depart with a hug for each of his players and a kiss to the crowd."}, {"date": "04/11/2017", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 29602, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [39], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramadan Sobhi Ahmed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Maxim Choupo-Moting", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Martins Indi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksander Dragovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Islam Slimani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Peter Crouch, age 36, has not started a Premier League game this season but he showed here that he is far from finished.

Everybody’s saying he’s a Plan B but if he continues he might be Plan A.”\n\nThat is Crouch’s plan. “It would be nice to be starting and scoring goals but it’s the way things are going for me,” he said. “When I come on I try and make an impact and hopefully try and get in the starting XI.”\n\nAlthough there is a unique joy in seeing Crouch continuing to lord it over defenders many years younger than him, a home win would have been harsh on Leicester, who were the better side for most of the match. In the first half, in particular, Claude Puel looked well on course to claim a second win in his second match since replacing Craig Shakespeare as Leicester manager.\n\nPuel declared straight after taking the job that he intended making the team more versatile, insisting they could not continue to rely almost exclusively on counterattacking. After making a promising start last Sunday at home to Everton he did not lapse into caution for his first away match as Leicester were proactive and fluent from the outset.\n\nStoke City 2-2 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nDemarai Gray, the 21-year-old winger who seldom started under Shakespeare, was involved in most of their brightest moves, frequently leaving poor Kurt Zouma bedazzled. In the 11th minute Gray skipped past Zouma down the left and delivered a low cross for Jamie Vardy, whose close-range shot was blocked by Kevin Wimmer.\n\nWith Leicester in the unfamiliar position of controlling possession away from home, they were almost beaten at their own old game when Riyad Mahrez had the ball pinched off him midway inside opposition territory and Stoke almost struck on the counterattack. Ramadan Sobhi found Maxim Choupo-Moting but Schmeichel saved.\n\nFour minutes later, Leicester took the lead from a set piece. Harry Maguire met a corner by Mahrez at the back post and headed the ball back across goal, leaving Vicente Iborra to sweep it into the net from six yards for his first goal since joining from Sevilla in the summer.\n\nLeicester threatened to run amok. Mahrez let Stoke off by delaying a pass to Vardy after a mistake by Zouma and then Iborra almost reprised his opening goal but this time his shot was blocked. In the 37th minute, Gray left Zouma in a tizzy again and pinged in another cross for Shinji Okazaki, whose header was tipped over by Jack Butland.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vicente Iborra celebrates after opening the scoring. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Imag\n\nThen, when it seemed like Stoke’s best hope was to survive to half-time without conceding again, the hosts equalised. Iborra and Christian Fuchs, perhaps rendered overconfident by Leicester’s dominance, lost sight of Shaqiri, and Choupo-Moting picked him out with a flicked pass. Shaqiri scurried into the right of the penalty area and curled the ball into the far corner.\n\nMahrez nearly restored Leicester’s lead early in the second half, collecting a pass from Gray before firing inches past the far post from 10 yards. Schmeichel had to make a terrific save from a header by Ryan Shawcross following a corner and then, moments later, Mahrez did give Leicester their lead back. Wilfried Ndidi whacked the ball off the toe of Diouf on halfway and, perhaps unwittingly, released Mahrez down the right. The Algerian shrugged off a weak challenge by Eric Pieters, skittered into the penalty area and slammed a low shot into the far corner.\n\nHughes had picked the same Stoke side that had assuaged criticism of him by winning at Watford last Saturday but Leicester’s second goal was the catalyst for the Stoke manager to make a change. As so often in time of need, Crouch came to the rescue, running on to an outswinging corner by Shaqiri to power home the equaliser."}, {"date": "04/11/2017", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24169, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [25], "reds": [57], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Malone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Elias Kachunga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rajiv van La Parra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [44], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Cranie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Williams", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Collin Quaner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Ahmed Hegazy", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Grzegorz Krychowiak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "David Wagner said Huddersfield’s latest league win was one for him and his players.

"report": "The soundtrack of boos which greeted the final whistle signalled a significant opportunity missed on Newcastle United’s part and a big chance seized by Bournemouth.\n\nIn many respects Steve Cook’s stoppage time winner for Eddie Howe’s hitherto struggling side represented a mutual return to old habits. While Rafa Benítez’s initially convincing players ended up reminding everyone of the countless bad old days when they were noted for losing concentration – and games – at set pieces, Bournemouth ultimately jogged memories of happier times.\n\nAs the visiting fans wondered if a watershed had been reached, Newcastle fans were left fretting over a run of one league win in six games. Some even took the rare, near heretical, step of criticising Benítez for a stubborn refusal not to bring Aleksandar Mitrovic off the bench.\n\nHowe was suitably delighted that the two attacking substitutes used by his Newcastle counterpart – the ineffective Ayoze Pérez and Jacob Murphy - failed to make an impact, thereby enabling Bournemouth to scramble out of the relegation zone. “Being in the bottom three is difficult,” he said. “Psychologically, being out of it is a big thing for us.”\n\nUnusually, Benítez began with two strikers, fielding Dwight Gayle and Joselu in tandem. For the first 20 minutes Bournemouth looked so vulnerable that this ostensibly bold decision seemed eminently logical.\n\nHuddersfield’s Rajiv van La Parra piles pressure on West Brom Read more\n\nWith Howe’s side starting in sluggishly low-tempo mode and proving worryingly slow to second balls, Newcastle dominated. They appeared to have a goal wrongly disallowed for offside when Matt Ritchie’s shot struck a post and Gayle tucked home the rebound.\n\nReplays suggested he had been onside and, having already survived a few scares, Bournemouth had reason to feel suitably reprieved. Foremost among those frights was the moment when Gayle’s header rather fortunately rebounded off Cook’s stomach but goalkeeper Asmir Begovic also did extremely well to repel shots from Christian Atsu and Ritchie.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Cook heads home in stoppage time to lift Bournemouth out of the relegation zone. Photograph: Jan Kruger/Getty Images\n\nYet if Begovic’s outfield colleagues’ passing had clearly lost its old crispness and they seemed to have forgotten how to force any sort of pace, occasional cameos served as reminders of the team they used to be. With the first period drawing to a conclusion, the hitherto underemployed Rob Elliot was stretched to the limit as he first finger-tipped Callum Wilson’s header to safety at the end of a surprise visiting counter-attack and then dived smartly to keep Josh King’s shot out.\n\nAlmost imperceptibly, Benítez’s players had lost a little of their momentum and Bournemouth suddenly looked capable of capitalising. Unfortunately a big part of their problem has been that Howe’s forwards appear to have forgotten how to take their chances with a prime example arriving early in the second half. Played in by King, Wilson found himself clean through with only Elliot to beat yet somehow contrived to screw his shot wide.\n\nAs Benítez shook his head, it was all too easy to understand how the visitors had now failed to score in six of their previous 10 League games.\n\nBurnley sink listless Southampton thanks to substitute Sam Vokes Read more\n\nYet as dusk descended, there was a growing sense of a game slipping through Newcastle’s fingers. As the minutes passed home fans realised precisely how much they were missing the injured Mikel Merino’s customary composure and midfield passing vision,\n\nWith Howe now deploying ultra-direct tactics, Bournemouth had improved to the point where they finished by far the stronger side. Benítez looked torn between relief and anger when Elliot and Ciaran Clark somehow combined to keep, albeit rather fortuitously, Marc Pugh’s shot out but the former emotion was to be short-lived.\n\nThree minutes’ stoppage time was underway when Andrew Surman swung in a late corner for the visitors and Cook out-leapt everyone to force a close-range header past Elliot before celebrating as if he had just clinched a title.\n\nWith games against Huddersfield Swansea and Burnley on the horizon, Cook and company can now alter this season’s narrative. Will they seize the moment? Can Newcastle recover from their own wobble?\n\n“We have to do better in these sorts of games, we created chances but you have to score,” said Benítez, whose untypically clipped responses to questions emphasised his unhappiness.\n\n“I’ll not talk about the referee’s decisions, because I’m not very happy with the decisions,” he said, when asked about Gayle’s disallowed ‘goal’. “But we didn’t do what we had to do on lots of occasions.\n\n“We made mistakes, and in the end we paid for them. We gave the ball away easily, we gave Bournemouth belief they could score.

A few minutes later Pope tried to inject some entertainment by nearly dribbling straight into Manolo Gabbiadini but basic competence quickly returned and he sensibly cleared.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Southampton’s struggles in front of goal at St Mary’s continued as they failed to break down Burnley’s defence. Photograph: Steve Bardens/Getty Images\n\nIt was not that the game was completely devoid of quality – there were a couple of zippy passing interchanges from both sides and Boufal danced out of trouble with a roulette at one point – but it was a distance from being good. At half-time there was virtually no reaction, positive or negative, from the crowd: it was as if 30,000 people were just glad to get out of the house. The game existed, but little more could be said either way.\n\nAfter the break Southampton dominated possession but Burnley held firm and that was when Dyche displayed one of the reasons he is so coveted when he brought on Vokes and Ashley Barnes, changing the shape, approach and the whole feel of the game.\n\nThe switch paid off brilliantly with nine minutes remaining. Johann Berg Gudmundsson collected the ball on the right touchline and boomed over an inswinging left-foot cross to Vokes. The highpoint of the Welshman’s career so far is probably his goal against Belgium at Euro 2016, and this was not a million miles from that: with his body angled away from goal he directed a superb header past the graspingFraser Forster.\n\nGlenn Murray strikes for Brighton as lacklustre Swansea stumble again Read more\n\n“It’s an amazing game, but painful too,” said Pellegrino, painting the picture of a flowing performance unfairly scuppered by some sort of dark arts. The Saints fans who booed their team off, and indeed any objective observer, would disagree.\n\nAt the final whistle Dyche applauded the travelling support for perhaps a touch longer than usual. Read into that what you will, but he spoke like a man planning for Burnley’s next game, rather than someone else’s.\n\n“It’s a so far story,” he said. “There are a lot of big teams we’ve got to play.

It was like the first half of last season all over again as the Swansea supporters vented their anger, turning on the board after another woeful performance culminated in a fifth Premier League defeat in six matches and condemned them to a place in the bottom three.\n\n“We want our club back” was one of the more polite chants on a day when Glenn Murray scored for the third game in succession to continue Brighton & Hove Albion’s excellent start to the season and briefly lift them up to eighth place. Swansea, such obliging opponents, registered only two shots on target and the brutal truth is that they already look like a team destined for the Championship.\n\nThey have now lost six of their seven home games in all competitions this season and it was alarming to see a team at this level playing with so little belief and conviction, never mind quality. The closest they came to scoring was in injury-time, when Luciano Narsingh hit the crossbar, but the 90 minutes prior to that were absolutely dreadful.\n\nSo many passes went astray, the glaring lack of creativity in the squad that should have been addressed in the summer was badly exposed once again, and the players’ confidence is shot to bits, summed up by the sight of so many abject free-kicks and corners being taken. Two of those in quick succession, with around 20 minutes remaining, proved to be the tipping point for the home fans. “You greedy bastards, get out of our club” – a chant aimed at the Swansea board – reverberated from the East Stand as the frustration that has been bubbling away for weeks came to the surface.\n\nSam Clucas, a summer signing from Hull City, was the man behind those two set-pieces and was substituted not long afterwards to ironic cheers from the home supporters. Tom Carroll, one of so many players to have badly lost their way this season, had already been subjected to the same treatment. In other words, patience has finally snapped at the Liberty Stadium and it was no surprise when the final whistle was met with a chorus of boos.\n\nPaul Clement, Swansea’s head coach, looked in a state of shock at what he had just witnessed. “My summary of that is if we play at that level and that standard, we can’t be expected to win a game. It was very poor the way we defended the goal – a simple throw-in, not dealing with that, not stopping the cross, players unmarked – and then you see a team that is really struggling with any kind of confidence.”\n\nClement admitted that the fans showed their frustration “more ferociously” than before and felt that filtered through to his team, yet he refused to use that as an excuse and said that players had to be brave enough to handle any criticism. “I think it affected the team, I think it affected some individuals, but our job is to deal with that. At the moment we’re in a really bad moment, no question about it. But together, with me at the front, we have to find a way to get a victory, just to stop this vicious cycle of poor performance, bad result, poor performance, bad result.”\n\nBrighton have no such problems. A second successive away win arrived courtesy of Murray, who nudged the ball over the line with his knee after Federico Fernández seemed to think that he was safe to let Anthony Knockaert’s cross sail over his head. From Swansea’s point of view it was a catalogue of errors, including Clucas, filling in at left-back, giving Knockaert far too much space to deliver his centre.\n\nBrighton would have had a second but for a superb save from Lukasz Fabianski to deny Lewis Dunk. In response Swansea created only two decent chances. The first when Mathew Ryan saved from Tammy Abraham and the second when Narsingh hit the woodwork. Brighton, in short, could not have been more comfortable. “We weren’t sure how the season was going to unfold, so for us to be where we are at this moment has probably surpassed our expectations,” said Chris Hughton, Brighton’s manager.\n\nHuddersfield’s Rajiv van La Parra piles pressure on West Brom Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Glenn Murray taps in from close range to give Brighton the lead in the first half.

stands had given way to resignation long before the final whistle, Slaven Bilic can have no complaints if it turns out West Ham’s patience has finally snapped.\n\nIt was another shambles on live television, the 10th time that West Ham have conceded at least three goals at home since last season’s move to the London Stadium and another game when the best way to beat the rush outside was to stay in your seat until the bitter end. Bilic wore a grim, haunted look as his team suffered the latest in a long line of humiliations.\n\nSlaven Bilic: I am always strong and I am facing the consequences Read more\n\nThe sole positive for West Ham’s manager was that Liverpool were not more ruthless, which is a funny thing to say after a 4-1 win that moved Jürgen Klopp’s side into sixth place, below Arsenal and Chelsea on goal difference.\n\nInspired by Sadio Mané , who created both of Mohamed Salah’s goals, Liverpool strolled to a third consecutive victory, while West Ham provided further evidence they are destined for a long scrap against relegation. They are crying out for extensive reconstructive surgery and the international fortnight offers David Sullivan and David Gold, the club’s owners, a chance to act.\n\nAnd what more do they need to see before putting Bilic out of his misery? It had been a fortnight since West Ham’s last home game, that chaotic 3-0 defeat to Brighton, and a week since the second-half capitulation in the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace, and this was a mess against opponents who also have a habit of making life needlessly difficult for themselves.\n\nPlay Video 1:14 'The situation is not good,' says Bilic after Liverpool thrash West Ham – video\n\nLiverpool fell apart on their last visit to London, losing to Tottenham Hotspur in a manner that raised further questions about Klopp’s approach, and they needed time to adjust to a new system that saw Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right and Salah operating in the hole behind Roberto Firmino, with Mané a constant roving menace on his surprise inclusion after a month out with an injured hamstring.\n\nIt did not help that Jordan Henderson was missing with a muscle problem but the impact of the midfielder’s absence was minimised by Gini Wijnaldum’s late recovery from an ankle injury.\n\nSteve Cook’s late winner stuns Newcastle to give Bournemouth a lift Read more\n\nThere was an early sense that West Ham’s forwards fancied their chances against Ragnar Klavan and Joël Matip. The hosts almost took an early lead when Manuel Lanzini’s deflected pass ran kindly for Andre Ayew, only for the forward’s post to hit the woodwork.\n\nWest Ham would rue Ayew’s miss. “We started well,” Bilic said. “We were not allowing them space in behind.” But then came the three-minute spell when the game spiralled out of West Ham’s control midway through the first half, a collapse sparked by a soft opening goal.\n\nIt beggared belief that Aaron Cresswell found himself confronted by three Liverpool attackers after a West Ham corner was cleared. Bilic insisted his team were set up well but it did not take much for Mané to burst through the middle and feed the ball to Salah, who slipped a low finish past Joe Hart and into the net. “We are conceding too many goals in that manner,” Bilic said.\n\nThe loss of shape was bewildering – Bilic spoke about naivety – and so was the defending that allowed Matip to double Liverpool’s lead. Salah’s low corner hit Mark Noble and although Hart showed sharp reflexes, Matip turned in the rebound.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain celebrates scoring his side’s third goal, which came moments after Manuel Lanzini had got West Ham back in the game. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\nLiverpool were not at their most fluent in the first half but they hardly needed to be. Yes, West Ham had selection issues in defence, with Sam Byram, James Collins and José Fonte injured and Pablo Zabaleta suspended, while the absence of the hamstrung Michail Antonio deprived them of attacking dynamism. Their problem, however, is a recurring inability to perform the basics and they were incapable of containing Liverpool, even after Lanzini had hauled them back into the contest early in the second half.\n\nWest Ham United 1-4 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nBilic’s response at the break was to introduce Andy Carroll in place of Edimilson Fernandes, who struggled at right wing-back, and switch from 3-4-1-2 to a gung-ho 4-2-4. Carroll’s height unnerved Liverpool and an increasingly direct approach paid off when Ayew’s deep cross reached Lanzini, who steered his shot past Mignolet.\n\nPerhaps West Ham were still feeling giddy after Lanzini’s goal, though. “That third goal was very naive because we needed a moment of calmness,” Bilic said. “We were very open to their counterattacking.”\n\nLiverpool’s response was immediate, Firmino releasing Oxlade-Chamberlain, who beat Hart at the second attempt. It was a lovely moment for the winger after his exclusion from the England squad.\n\nKlopp had said Mané was ready to play for 20 minutes. After watching him in training, however, he threw the forward in from the start. Philippe Coutinho was out but Mané was superb – “a little machine,” Klopp said – and he made another for Salah near the end after a weaving run.

Newcastle are very organised under Rafa and we had to work hard to break them down. It’s very difficult when your opponents stay as resolute as Newcastle did.”\n\nNewcastle did not quite manage to stay resolute enough, however. “We made one mistake, we were caught out of position, and we lost the match,” Benítez said. “We didn’t do what we had to do in defence and maybe we have to be a little bit better in attack.”\n\nHe can say that again. Both sides showed an early commitment to attack, with Hendrick shooting narrowly wide for Burnley in the opening minute and Christian Atsu going close at the other end following a corner. But after the early skirmishes the goalmouth action all but dried up.\n\nThe only notable attempt on target in the first half came from Newcastle when Atsu set up Jonjo Shelvey for a shot, the midfielder striking it well from just inside the area but firing it straight at Nick Pope in the Burnley goal.\n\nNewcastle were looking to Shelvey to supply some ideas in midfield but his distribution was erratic. Not only did a couple of straightforward passes go astray but on one occasion he also attempted to catch Burnley out with a quick free-kick and succeeded only in passing the ball to an opponent. Newcastle, nevertheless, began to take a hold and push Burnley back as the first half progressed.\n\nWithout the injured Chris Wood the home side had Ashley Barnes on his own up front and, though he did get his head to a Robbie Brady cross midway through the first half, the striker generally found it hard going against Florian Lejeune and Jamaal Lascelles. While neither side boasted an effective attacking spearhead, Newcastle managed to get a few more men forward to set up some promising situations, even if the final ball into the box was usually a disappointment.\n\nDeAndre Yedlin finished the first half with a prime example, a cross from the byline straight into the waiting arms of Pope when he had time and space to pick out someone in a black-and-white shirt. Newcastle made some promising inroads down both flanks, with Atsu and Matt Ritchie finding space to run intoand Yedlin frequently calling for the ball, to no avail. The American’s undoubted pace could have hurt Burnley – he let Stephen Ward know quite early how quickly he could switch between defence and attack – but Shelvey and Mohamed Diamé in the centre seemed more interested in slowing the game down with lateral passes.\n\nAt least the second half opened with a couple more attempts on goal. Ayoze Pérez’s curling but not especially fierce shot was kept out by a full-length save from Pope and then in Burnley’s next attack James Tarkowski got his head to a Brady free-kick but could only direct the ball straight at Rob Elliot. All the same the game seemed to be petering out uneventfully until Jack Cork got hold of the ball 16 minutes from the end.\n\nAfter exchanging passes with Johann Berg Gudmundsson, Cork managed a shot on target that Elliot saved, only for Gudmundsson to return the ball across goal where Hendrick was waiting at the far post for one of the easier goals of his career.\n\nNewcastle tried to come back and actually did quite well in searching for an equaliser in the closing minutes. Joselu was close with a shot that missed the target by no more than a foot, Isaac Hayden brought a fine last-gasp save from Pope and Javier Manquillo saw a header just clear the crossbar.\n\nPredictably it was too little and too late, and Burnley stood firm to pick up their second home win of the season and with a second 1-0 scoreline. In addition to five years and three points Dyche will be celebrating a fourth clean sheet in seven games, though until they released the handbrake in the last few minutes Newcastle’s attacking ideas mostly amounted to heading practice for Tarkowski and Ben Mee.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Burnley fans show their appreciation of Sean Dyche, who has been linked with the Everton job.

These two teams are a point apart halfway down (or up) the Premier League table. For the ninth-placed visitors it is a cause for doubts, uncertainty and the odd glance over the shoulder. For the hosts, now in 12th, it means success, affirmation and calls for feet to stay connected to the ground.\n\nSouthampton took an early lead thanks to Steven Davis, who turned home a rebound from James Ward-Prowse’s well-executed free-kick. Glenn Murray restored parity shortly after half-time with a canny striker’s header. There were few other chances to write about, which suited neither manager, but their mutual disappointment came from very different perspectives.\n\n“Confidence is as high as it’s been this season‚“ said Brighton’s Chris Hughton. “We’ve got good players and if we play at the right level we know we’ve got a chance of getting results. Home form will be so important for us in this division and it was just the end product that was lacking today. We had a lot of play in the final third but we didn’t create enough clear-cut chances.”\n\nHughton’s counterpart Mauricio Pellegrino, said: “We did the most difficult thing. We were in front with an early goal. But when you let your opponent back into the game in this division, every single team has the quality to hurt you. Brighton are mentally very high right now. We played well but when you control the game you must play with more determination to score the second one and kill the game.”\n\nBrighton are no longer everyone’s favourites for relegation after a solid start to the season was capped by last week’s eye-catching thumping of West Ham at the London Stadium. Southampton, for their part, are still perceived to be struggling for form. Indeed if you include Claude Puel’s time at the club, the jury has been out on the Saints for longer than the average fraud trial.\n\nLeicester City v Everton: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nGoals are the main concern for both teams. Pellegrino’s side have scored nine in 10 games, Brighton just one more. The word dour has been applied to both sides this term, but it has always seemed a little harsh when applied to Hughton’s team, not just because every point scraped from solidity is one towards safety but also because they tend to play with an attacking four, including two wingers. Saints went 4-3-3 here but struggled to make an impact with Sofiane Boufal and Dusan Tadic nominally playing out wide but neither showing much appetite for it.\n\nBoufal it was who set in motion the events that led to Southampton’s goal in the seventh minute. The foul he drew from Dale Stephens on the edge of the Brighton box wasn’t much of one, if indeed it was one at all, but Ward-Prowse made the most of the dubious advantage. Standing square of the ball the England international, making only his third league start of the season, took a minimal run up and drove his kick over the wall and off Mathew Ryan’s crossbar. Davis beat Shane Duffy to the rebound and scored with a bouncing header.\n\nBrighton are not used to being broken open so quickly in matches. Equally they are not at their most comfortable when chasing a game. But in their doppelganger wingers, Anthony Knockaert and José Izquierdo, they had the game’s most effective performers.\n\nWith both men in tandem for just the second time, newly promoted Brighton’s attacking play was faster and more confident than in the opening weeks of the season. Izquierdo’s pace was a real threat while Knockaert had the cuteness of touch to find space in small pockets. Both made a talented Southampton back line work hard for their corn.\n\nThe scores became level seven minutes after the restart. When the ball came to Knockaert on the edge of the box, he had the presence of mind to lay it off to Pascal Gross who was waiting wide right. The German swung a deep cross to Murray who had peeled off his marker and used his height advantage over right back Cédric Soares to head past Fraser Forster at the near post. It was the German’s fifth league assist this season (one fewer than Kevin De Bruyne), and Murray’s third goal. Once again, however, there will be questions over Forster, whose positioning was suspect and reactions slow.\n\nThe match drained away as both coaches sought to affect minor change through tactical substitutions, the risk of losing everything greater than the chance of a win it seemed.\n\n“It was unlucky because the ball deflected off Cedric and surprised the keeper‚“ Pellegrino said of the equaliser. Hughton, not surprisingly perhaps, took a different perspective. “It was an excellent header. There was only one place he could score and he put it right in that corner.”"}, {"date": "29/10/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31891, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [29], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [18], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksander Dragovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Islam Slimani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [20], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beni Baningime", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Claude Puel era is up and running at Leicester City and any dissenting voices about the Frenchman’s appointment will quickly be silenced if this proves to be a sign of things to come. Inspired by the outstanding Demarai Gray, Leicester looked menacing whenever they attacked, and the wonderful breakaway goal that Jamie Vardy converted to set them on their way to victory against a beleaguered Everton side was arguably the best possible riposte to any concerns about Puel’s playing style.\n\nIt was a classic piece of counterattacking and featured a splendid 60-yard run from Gray, who delivered a performance that will leave many wondering why the winger did not feature more often under Craig Shakespeare and Claudio Ranieri. Gray was the best player on the pitch by a distance and was also credited with the second goal – rather dubiously – after Jonjoe Kenny had horribly sliced the England under-21 international’s cross into his own net.\n\nLeicester City v Everton: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nIt was that sort of day for David Unsworth, who did nothing to improve his chances of getting the Everton job on a permanent basis as they slipped to a ninth defeat in 13 matches, leaving them third from bottom and facing up to a scenario that was unthinkable when £150m was spent in the summer.\n\nAsked whether Everton are in a relegation battle, Unsworth replied: “I think we have to be honest, we are where we are, if that continues then the answer is yes. At the same time it’s nothing that a couple of back-to-back wins wouldn’t put right. But Sunday’s game against Watford is now massive.”\n\nNothing went right for Unsworth here. His decision to start with wingers was scrapped at half-time, when he withdrew Aaron Lennon and Kevin Mirallas, and the sight of Wayne Rooney raising his arms in bewilderment when his number came up in the second half, as he prepared to take a corner, rather summed things up for a club that appears in serious trouble.\n\nTo add insult to injury for Unsworth he finished his post-match press conference answering a question about Joey Barton’s scathing assessment of him during a radio broadcast from the King Power Stadium. Barton described Unsworth as “a glorified PE teacher” among other things. “What Joey Barton says, I couldn’t care less,” Unsworth said.\n\nEverton have far bigger problems than Barton to deal with right now. Toothless up front and devoid of ideas in midfield they rarely looked like scoring despite dominating possession after a disastrous first half hour in which they conceded twice. Vardy, Gray and Riyad Mahrez caused Everton no end of problems with their pace, trickery and movement, in particular in that devastating early period that blew the visitors away.\n\nWith confidence so brittle among their players, and a legitimate goal threat painfully lacking in the absence of a proven centre-forward, it was hard to see Everton finding a response. Unsworth, however, was entitled to feel that Everton should have had an opportunity via the penalty spot when Christian Fuchs clattered into Lennon from behind shortly after Gray’s goal. Andre Marriner, the referee, inexplicably failed to point to the spot. “A little bit of Lady Luck isn’t going for us at the moment,” said Unsworth.\n\nLeicester, in contrast, are smiling again and this was a fine way for Puel to begin his reign. They started at a high tempo and the Frenchman’s decision to bring Gray into the team, giving him only his second league start of the season, was totally vindicated. Mahrez also thrived in a more advanced central role, just behind Vardy, and it was a lovely move in which those three attacking players combined to give Leicester the lead.\n\nGray was the chief protagonist, picking the ball up deep inside his own half after Leighton Baines’s free-kick was cleared. The winger skirted around Tom Davies close to the touchline, stepped inside Idrissa Gueye and left Rooney trailing in his wake as he tore at the heart of the Everton defence. It would have been easy for Gray to go for goal himself at that point but instead he kept his composure and played a perfectly weighted pass that released Mahrez on the right.\n\nMahrez looked up and delivered a low centre that Vardy was never going to miss from about six yards out. It was a brilliant goal that highlighted the blistering pace in one team and the total lack of it among their opponents.\n\nLeicester’s second owed much to good fortune as Gray, drifting out onto the left, delivered an inswinging cross that looked harmless enough until Kenny wildly miskicked, sending the ball spinning backwards, beyond Jordan Pickford and into the far corner of the net. It was a cruel moment for the 20-year-old right-back, who was making only his second Premier League start, and put Leicester in a commanding position.\n\nEverton switched to a midfield diamond after the interval as Unsworth introduced a second striker before eventually turning to Gylfi Sigurdsson, the club-record signing, as a replacement for Rooney in the 74th minute. That neither Rooney nor Sigurdsson acknowledged one another during that change said it all on another chastening afternoon for Everton."}, {"date": "28/10/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance":

Manchester United are no mugs under Jose Mourinho and they stuck grimly to their task to pick up an important win with a late Anthony Martial goal. That is not to suggest the match was grim, though scoreless for 82 minutes it was nothing like as barren as United’s draw at Anfield a fortnight ago, but two good sides were cancelling each other out until Spurs were undone by a long ball from the back.\n\nUnited have still not conceded a goal in five league games here. Whether they would have done with Kane on the pitch is a matter of debate, but what is not is that Martial is an effective substitute. For the fourth time this season he came on to score, this time winning the game in his 20-minute cameo. There were a few audible grumbles when Marcus Rashford had to make way, but, as Mourinho explained, the two players offer different qualities. “Martial is more comfortable dropping in between the lines to help drive the ball and not just attack space,” he said. “I told him to do that and to play off Lukaku, which is what he did.”\n\nThe sides employed similar formations with three at the back, though Tottenham were that little bit better at playing out from that area of the pitch. The visitors made better use of the ball all over the pitch throughout the first half with Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and Harry Winks all possessing a subtlety and invention in passing that the home side mostly lacked.\n\nJosé Mourinho tells critics to ‘calm down’ after Manchester United beat Spurs Read more\n\nFor all that there was little danger of the deadlock being broken before the interval. Eric Dier made a good tackle in the area to stop Rashford in his tracks early on and when the ball broke to Romelu Lukaku he missed the target spectacularly, whether his intention was a shot or a cross. Rashford registered United’s best attempt on goal in the first half, significantly with a free-kick from a long way out, and though Hugo Lloris dived to his right to save the ball looked to be going wide of the post anyway.\n\nAt the other end Spurs’ tidy approach worked tended to fizzle out by the time it reached Heung-min Son, notionally deployed as a striker, though Dier finally managed to bring a save from David de Gea on the stroke of half time with a weakly hit shot. De Gea’s goal had been in greater danger a few minutes earlier when he collided with Phil Jones in claiming a cross and spilled the ball, only for Moussa Sissoko to snatch at his brief chance and send his shot high into the Stretford End.\n\nUnited applied more pressure in the second half and succeeded in keeping Spurs pinned back for a while, though the end result was only a fiercely hit drive from Antonio Valencia from the edge of the area that was always clearing the crossbar.\n\nSpurs sent on Mousa Dembele to try and restore some midfield control, United responded with Jesse Lingard for Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Martial for Rashford. The last was slightly surprising, since Rashford was probably causing the Spurs defence the most problems, though Martial was almost instantly involved in helping set up a chance for Lukaku and the favour would be returned before the end.\n\nJosé Mourinho revels in the brutal beauty of sticking to his principles | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nWhen Valencia went into the book for diving in search of a penalty it began to look as if a goal would never arrive on another of Manchester’s wettest afternoons, yet both sides played their part in an eventful last 10 minutes. Alli ghosted on to a delightful diagonal ball from Eriksen for what looked a likely winner but could not quite get his feet in the right position to beat De Gea from close range, then at the other end Lukaku struck the post with a header from Lingard’s cross.\n\nYou would still have put money on a scoreless draw, but in the nick of time United came up with a textbook route one winner. De Gea launched the ball upfield, Lukaku beat Toby Alderweireld to the first header, which left Martial running clear into the area to shoot past Lloris. Who needs midfields anyway?

On six previous Premier League visits, they had won three and drawn one and, when Sam Clucas put them in front, it was possible to fear that a long afternoon lay ahead for Arsène Wenger and his players.\n\nThe nerves jangled among the home support during the first half and but for a one-on-one block from Petr Cech that denied Jordan Ayew in the 45th minute Swansea would have been two goals to the good at the break. “At half-time, I could be worried because we were 1-0 down and I knew that Swansea had conceded only one away goal the whole season,” Wenger said.\n\nCech’s save would prove to be the decisive moment because Arsenal were a team transformed in the second half. Inspired by Sead Kolasinac – a rampaging presence on the left – they turned things around to win with a measure of comfort. The Swansea hoodoo would not strike on this occasion.\n\nWenger had described his club’s home form as “impeccable” and it is now eight wins out of eight in all competitions this season – five of them coming in the Premier League.\n\nManchester United’s Anthony Martial rises to occasion to sink Spurs Read more\n\nKolasinac scored the equaliser with a bullet of a drive before he got the assist for Aaron Ramsey’s winner. The only disappointment was that he was forced off on 78 minutes with a recurrence of a hip problem. Wenger made it sound as though Kolasinac had to be a doubt for next Sunday’s trip to Manchester City. After a weekend off for the international break, Arsenal host Tottenham.\n\nWenger’s team hogged 73% of the possession and they had 17 shots to Swansea’s four but the statistics did not tell the story. Swansea executed Paul Clement’s game plan to perfection in the first half and they will look back upon Ayew’s chance with regret.\n\nThe striker robbed the dawdling Per Mertesacker inside the Arsenal area and, suddenly, he had only Cech to beat. The goalkeeper made himself big to save. “If that goes in, it’s a totally different situation,” Clement said. “These are the fine margins we are dealing with.”\n\nSwansea had arrived with a question mark at left-back. Martin Olsson, the club’s only specialist in the position, was out with hamstring trouble and so Clement asked Clucas to fill in at left wing-back for the first time since his £16.5m summer move from Hull City. The move would enjoy a stunning dividend.\n\nSwansea had barely crossed halfway in the game’s opening quarter but when Laurent Koscielny took a heavy touch and then slipped over, Tammy Abraham slid Clucas in behind Héctor Bellerín. He finished low and left-footed beyond Cech for his first goal in Swansea colours.\n\nThe visitors had previously conceded only once in four away league games this season and it was plain that Arsenal had it all to do. Their big moment of the first half came in the 41st minute when Kolasinac fed Alexis Sánchez and he extended Lukasz Fabianski, the former Arsenal goalkeeper, with a right-footed shot.\n\nThat apart, the pickings were slim. Wenger described the opening 45 minutes as “laboured” which was putting it mildly, and his team was booed off at the interval. Whatever he said during the break, it had the desired effect.\n\nWenger sent his players out early for the second half and they found their stride straight away. Kolasinac’s goal came after Alexandre Lacazette had dug out a smart backheel on the right of the area and Mesut Özil smuggled the ball on.\n\nThe Bosnian had a long run at the breaking ball and he thumped it into the far corner. The impressive Abraham had the ball in the net immediately afterwards only to be pulled back for offside but Arsenal could feel that the shackles had loosened.\n\nKoscielny fluffed a free header from a Sánchez free-kick before Kolasinac teed up Ramsey. Not for the first time, Granit Xhaka spread the play with a raking pass and Kolasinac put plenty of pace into his cutback, which Ramsey harnessed with his first-time shot.\n\nThe Emirates could relax and so could Wenger on the occasion of his 800th Premier League game.\n\nRamsey shot high, Lacazette worked Fabianski, Bellerín hooked a shot against the crossbar and the substitute Olivier Giroud, winner of Fifa’s best goal award on Monday, twice went close.

Crystal Palace had given everything in their demented pursuit of an equaliser in the second half. Joe Hart had made save after astonishing save, including one from James Tomkins in the 91st minute, and they had hit the woodwork twice. They were falling agonisingly short. As Robert Madley prepared to blow for full time, a ninth defeat in 10 matches beckoned for the Premier League’s bottom side.\n\nEden Hazard’s solitary strike secures victory for Chelsea over Bournemouth Read more\n\nThis, however, was football at its barmiest. West Ham were coasting at half-time, smart goals from Javier Hernández and Andre Ayew setting them on course for their first away win this season, but they were reduced to a rabble in the end, Zaha’s moment of opportunism the spark for a total loss of composure from Mark Noble, who had to be pulled away from Ruben Loftus-Cheek shortly after the final whistle.\n\nYou could understand the West Ham captain’s irritation at the way his team had blown a chance to pull clear of the bottom three. Moments before the leveller, Michail Antonio had possession deep in Palace territory. He just had to eat up a bit more time, but instead his needless cross found Julián Speroni. “To concede in that manner is very frustrating,” Slaven Bilic said. “All we had to do is keep the ball for five seconds. It’s very frustrating. It feels like a defeat.”\n\nIt felt like a win for Palace, even if they remain in deep peril after this draw. “I don’t know if it’s sweeter than the win over Chelsea,” Roy Hodgson said. “But I do think it’s showed me this team has more character than they’ve sometimes been credited for.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wilfried Zaha celebrates after rescuing a point for Palace. Photograph: Zemanek/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nHodgson was right. It would have been easy for Palace to capitulate when they trailed 2-0. There was a tinge of sympathy to the applause that greeted the home players as they made their way down the tunnel at the break, even if it was meant as a show of support, and an unmistakable air of resignation filled Selhurst Park when Ayew, a man transformed after his midweek heroics against Tottenham Hotspur, rocketed a brilliant left-footed drive past Speroni from the edge of the area in the 43rd minute.\n\nNot that Palace deserved to find themselves two goals down at the end of a slow-burn first half. There was not much between the sides during the opening stages and the game took a while to ignite after Palace lost Patrick van Aanholt to an early hamstring injury.\n\nNothing went Palace’s way in the opening period. After 30 minutes of scrappiness, one sharp burst summed up their misfortune. They were still seething at Zaha being refused a penalty for Jose Fonté’s clumsy challenge when West Ham countered, taking advantage of a loss of focus that offered space to Manuel Lanzini for the first time. The ball ran from Lanzini to Ayew to Aaron Cresswell and the left wing-back’s pass reached Hernández, who demonstrated his poaching instincts with a classy stabbed finish.\n\nWithout the injured Mamadou Sakho, Palace’s defence started to creak and West Ham doubled their lead after Hart’s spectacular double save from Tomkins and Jeffrey Schlupp. Ayew robbed Luka Milivojevic near halfway, ran at the exposed Palace defence, stepped past Scott Dann and notched his third goal in two games.\n\nBilic looked like a condemned man a week ago. Now the pressure was lifting on West Ham’s manager, who had inspired that sensational fightback against Tottenham, but he ended up accusing his players of naivety.\n\nPalace might have lacked a recognised forward, with Christian Benteke and Connor Wickham injured, but they had heart. Angelo Ogbonna foolishly tripped Andros Townsend in the 50th minute and Milivojevic halved the deficit from the spot. “Teams at the bottom need two things,” Hodgson said. “Character and ability.”\n\nWith West Ham tiring, Fonté and Cresswell went off injured and the visitors lost their shape. Palace poured forward. Cabayé hit the post and threatened with a free-kick before Hart pushed a Tomkins header on to the bar. Bakary Sako somehow turned the rebound over.\n\nIt seemed that Palace’s chance had gone, but Zaha kept pushing. Hart had denied him twice before he embarked on one last dribble.

For the Liverpool manager, a routine win at the end of a trying week meant so much more. “Big relief,” he sighed. “The pressure was there, no doubt about it. I could hear it.”\n\nDiscontent was audible around Anfield at the end of a first half that contained the lingering after-effects of that demoralising defeat at Tottenham Hotspur, stubborn opponents and a missed penalty by Mohamed Salah. A few boos accompanied Liverpool’s players down the tunnel. They reappeared with renewed energy and purpose and, though indebted to the visiting captain, Tommy Smith, for the crucial breakthrough, there was no denying the merit of Liverpool’s victory or its importance to Klopp. Daniel Sturridge, Roberto Firmino and Georginio Wijnaldum scored the second-half goals that lifted Liverpool’s anxieties.\n\nRaheem Sterling wraps it up for Manchester City despite West Brom rally Read more\n\n“We had not the best week as you can imagine and we take the situation very seriously,” the Liverpool manager said. “Tottenham was the worst game we have played this season, you cannot ignore it, and we were a bit stiff, not fluent and Huddersfield’s style was rather defensive, I would say. It was not too easy to fix it at half-time but we had more players between the decisive lines in the second half and made it more difficult for Huddersfield to defend. We forced the situation for the first goal. The second goal felt like Christmas.” The first half had felt like purgatory.\n\nAn initially disjointed Liverpool display was perhaps to be expected. Philippe Coutinho joined Sadio Mané on the sidelines with an adductor problem, denying Klopp much-needed invention against a Huddersfield team content to have 10 men behind the ball. Dejan Lovren survived the axe despite his calamitous performance against Spurs only to injure his groin in the warm-up. Even the minute’s silence for Remembrance Sunday did not proceed as planned.\n\nAlberto Moreno’s first contribution was to concede a corner attempting an overhead kick deep inside his own half. It threatened to be one of those days. Liverpool threatened little themselves until presented with a needless penalty shortly before the break. Kevin Friend spotted a pull on Firmino’s shirt by Smith as the pair jostled for a James Milner free-kick. No one inside Anfield seemed aware of the offence until the referee showed a yellow card to the Huddersfield captain and pointed to the spot.\n\nSalah took the penalty instead of Milner, presumably on the basis of his World Cup qualifying heroics for Egypt, but struck it straight at Jonas Lossl. Jordan Henderson drove the follow-up against a post. It was Liverpool’s third consecutive penalty miss at Anfield, all by different takers. “I have no idea why he whistled,” Wagner said of Friend. “If it was for holding then we have to have five or six penalties in every game.”\n\nLiverpool, to their credit, swiftly made an irrelevance of the first half. Klopp’s side were given a significant assist towards victory by another unforced error by Smith. The right-back was under minimal pressure as he attempted to cut out an aimless punt from Moreno but succeeded only in steering a wayward header across his own penalty area. Sturridge had sensed the slip and pounced in style, beating Lossl to the loose ball and lifting a nonchalant finish over the exposed keeper.\n\nSturridge was denied a second by a superb intervention from Mathias Jorgensen, who managed to divert Firmino’s low cross out for a corner after Henderson had released the Brazilian with another fine ball from deep. The reprieve was fleeting for Huddersfield. From the resulting Milner corner Firmino escaped his marker, Aaron Mooy, and planted an unstoppable header beyond Lossl from inside the six-yard box.\n\nSalah and Joël Matip both went close to scoring a third as Liverpool ultimately cruised to a much-needed win. It fell to Wijnaldum to deliver the final flourish, collecting Salah’s pass inside the penalty area and lashing the ball into the roof of the net as four defenders backed off.\n\n“Until the first goal we had defended very well and neutralised them,” the Huddersfield manager said, reflecting on defeat a week after beating Manchester United. “I haven’t seen Anfield as quiet as that for a long time. But after we conceded the first goal, when we gave the assist, they showed their offensive power. In the last two games we have learned that we are able to defend against the big guns and you can get points against the big guns if you get everything right. If not, they will punish you.”"}, {"date": "28/10/2017", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20087, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Carrillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Zeegelaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Orestis Karnezis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Ramadan Sobhi Ahmed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Maxim Choupo-Moting", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Julien Ngoy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Grant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Thomas Edwards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Mark Hughes told Troy Deeney he “should know better” after the Watford captain sparked a late melee in their 1-0 Premier League defeat by Stoke City.

The ball may have taken a slight deflection on its way underneath Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal but Fletcher did not care as he raced to celebrate with Hughes on the touchline.\n\nWatford piled forward in the second half and Richarlison, who was guilty of two bad misses in the 4-2 defeat at Chelsea last weekend, blew another chance by nodding a Miguel Britos cross wide.

Goals by Leroy Sané, Fernandinho and Raheem Sterling restored their five-point lead at the top of the table.\n\nStrikes for West Brom by Jay Rodriguez and Matt Phillips briefly introduced a smidgen of suspense into this contest, but ultimately served only as tantalising reminders that City do have vulnerabilities. The question is whether anyone will be able to exploit those often enough to prevent them from sashaying to the title. Pep Guardiola scoffed at Jürgen Klopp’s suggestion that City could have the title wrapped up ridiculously early.\n\nWilfried Zaha’s 97th-minute goal ends West Ham’s resistance at Crystal Palace Read more\n\n“Have you ever known a team to win the title by January? Me neither, it’s totally unrealistic,” he said, before adding how satisfied he was that his team have shown no signs of over-confidence. “When you win a lot of games in a row there is a risk of being ‘OK we can do less and we are going to win the same’, but the way we played from the beginning here showed me a lot. You can’t win all the time by five or six goals. That is not football at the highest level.”\n\nHe did believe, mind you, that City should have won at least 5-1 here. “We want to win titles so we need to be clinical,” he said.\n\nHe had a point. City squandered a clutch of late chances with Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus and David Silva all uncharacteristically wayward in front of goal.\n\nCity had found West Brom to be awkward opponents when they visited here last month in the Carabao Cup, eventually winning 2-1 thanks to a pair of goals by Sané. The German picked up where he left off by opening the scoring in the 10th minute. The defence was cut asunder by Fernandinho’s sharp low pass, allowing Sané to slam a shot past Ben Foster.\n\nThe goalkeeper appeared to be taken by surprise by the sudden ferocity of Sané’s shot but three minutes later it was City’s turn to be shocked, as West Brom drew level. They had already hinted at an ability to catch City out at the back when, in the fifth minute, Salomón Rondón ran on to a pass over the top by Grzegorz Krychowiak before John Stones got back to smother the danger. Stones was unable to bail out his team in the 13th minute when Gareth Barry’s chip found Rodriguez, who lifted the ball over the advancing Ederson and into the net.\n\nLuck turned against Barry two minutes later when he attempted to block Fernandinho’s low shot from 25 yards but succeeded only in helping it into the net via the post. Barry did not deserve such ill-fortune but Fernandinho could be said to have earned a good break as he was among City’s best performers.\n\nIn the 26th minute City’s hypnotic passing lulled West Brom to sleep and David Silva was able to get on the end of a delightful pass by De Bruyne, but the Spaniard headed over the bar .\n\nWest Brom seldom managed to carry the play down to the other end of the pitch but when they did they made City uncomfortable. A panicky slice by Fabian Delph in the 33rd minute enabled Rondón to send a header goalward from 10 yards, but not with enough power to alarm Ederson.\n\nSirens also sounded for the goalkeeper in the early minutes of the second half when Krychowiak crept in unnoticed at the back post to be on the end of a cross from the right, but his header turned out to be as weak as Rondon’s.\n\nSterling came off the bench on the hour to quash the home team’s resistance. Replacing Bernardo Silva, who had been tidy but not incisive, the England winger finished off an intricate City move in the 63rd minute, sidefooting a cross by Kyle Walker into the net.\n\nTony Pulis threw on Matt Phillips in pursuit of a comeback that never looked likely. West Brom mustered enough of a threat to expose more nervousness in City’s defence – encapsulated by Nicolás Otamendi’s yellow card for a wild tackle on Jake Livermore – but could not bother Ederson until stoppage time.

Yet, by the end, the sense lingered that Chelsea’s domestic campaign is returning to an even keel. Their margin for error has gone, of course, and the summit remains distant, but successive league wins have at least lanced the tension.\n\nThis finished feeling like a hard-fought victory though, in truth, the visitors should really have eased themselves clear during a one-sided opening period. Given their dominance at that stage, it seemed rather ludicrous that Eden Hazard’s shot, belted inside Asmir Begovic’s near-post six minutes into the second half, was ultimately all they had to show for some of their more vibrant attacking play of the campaign to date. The head coach acknowledged as much in the aftermath, urging his players to be more clinical in killing off games of this nature.\n\nYet, in the context of a dip in performance levels either side of the last international window and with references still coming to the untimely injuries which have blunted his team, Conte finished satisfied. He has spent the last week on a restoration exercise. His squad needed to be reminded of their qualities, with confidence rebuilt and both conviction and momentum returned to their campaign. “This was a deserved win, a good win for our confidence and a good win before another tough game against Roma in the Champions League,” said the Italian. “Honestly, last season we won 3-1 here but today we played better. We controlled the game. Last season we conceded more chances and, in one part of the game, we were lucky. So I saw a lot of positives tonight.”\n\nManchester United’s Anthony Martial rises to occasion to sink Spurs Read more\n\nPrincipal among them was Hazard’s display. The Belgian tends to thrive on visits to this arena, revelling in the space afforded him by Eddie Howe’s side, with this no exception. He would prove to be the match-winner, ramming that shot beyond Begovic, though the Bosnian, a team-mate and title winner last term, betrayed his own disappointment at his attempt to block with the subsequent slump of his shoulders.\n\nHowe pointed out that others were just as culpable with the winner having stemmed from a Bournemouth goal-kick but, in truth, Hazard was always likely to sear his name on this occasion. He was the outstanding performer, a constant menace with the ball glued to his instep, and a provider of opportunities for Álvaro Morata and David Luiz which should have yielded further rewards.\n\nChelsea will travel to Italy on Monday relieved to have their Belgian back to his best, for all that Roma will be more awkward opponents in midweek. They will certainly not afford Hazard as much time on the ball. Indeed, Howe bemoaned how “passive” his team had been through that one-sided opening period, when Morata had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside, and cited the fact the contest remained goalless at the break as a sole positive. Yet, even with Jermain Defoe withdrawn and their system rejigged thereafter, it was only at the death that they hinted at conjuring an equaliser. And even then, Steve Cook’s shot, curled straight at a grateful Thibaut Courtois, was their most presentable opening for all that César Azpilicueta and David Luiz were forced to fling themselves into blocks to deny Benik Afobe and Callum Wilson.\n\nOpponents have been exploiting the absence of N’Golo Kanté over recent weeks, with Chelsea having shipped eight goals in the four games while the Frenchman has been hamstrung, to suggest this was a missed opportunity. Conte hopes to have the midfielder restored at the Olympic Stadium but will be conscious that Manchester United await next Sunday. “If he’s ready, he plays,” said the head coach. “But everyone knows the importance of the player. I want to be sure he is ready.”\n\nYet Bournemouth never really threatened to inflict wounds in the way Crystal Palace, Roma, Watford and even Everton had. Some of the zest has drained from their approach this term, with the onus now on their manager to instigate a revival. “We have to work out why we’ve gone from a free-scoring team to a side who struggle to create clear-cut chances,” said Howe. “I have to work it out. I have to find the right formula.”\n\nHe has been hampered by injuries, too, and had lost Junior Stanislas and Afobe before the end. November’s games look kinder on paper but this division is notoriously treacherous, as Chelsea have been reminded of late. The champions know only a run as eye-catching as last term’s 13-game winning streak will thrust them back into the title race.

Other Evertonians laughed. Most headed for the exits. Arsenal then scored a fourth, then a fifth. Turning the screw.\n\n“Write what you want to write,” bristled Ronald Koeman when, having decried the amount of negativity around an Everton team now languishing in the bottom three, he was asked what positives he could see in a comprehensive home defeat.\n\nThe highly paid manager had needed a show of conviction, of progress and most of all a result with the pressure intensifying and him no closer to a solution to the conundrum posed by this summer’s investment of almost £140m. His team got a sound beating instead as Arsenal marked Arsène Wenger’s 68th birthday with a first away win in the Premier League this season and a scoreline to help exorcise the trauma of their last visit to Merseyside, the 4-0 reverse at Anfield in August.\n\nWenger deployed Alexis Sánchez, Mesut Özil and Alexandre Lacazette in attack for the first time this season and was rewarded with a vibrant, expansive and dominant display. But for Jordan Pickford, Everton’s £30m goalkeeper and rare success in the summer transfer market, Arsenal would have registered seven or eight. “That was maybe our most complete performance of the season defensively and offensively,” the Arsenal manager said. “Alexis was on fire. Mesut was superb – agile, quick, intelligent and always at the service of the team with his passing. He is an exceptional player.”\n\nAs for those Manchester United rumours about Özil, Wenger said: “As players and manager we can only give one response and that is to be focused on the pitch.”\n\nFor Koeman the focus will inevitably shift towards his future as Everton manager. His team are adrift, without hope and direction. Their manager is scrambling around for answers and producing nothing, although Koeman’s case here was not helped by the 68th-minute dismissal of Idrissa Gueye. Arsenal were on the front foot long before Wayne Rooney rolled back the years – 15 years and three days to be exact – to open the scoring with another long-range strike against Arsenal.\n\nThe 32-year-old’s finish carried echoes of his memorable debut goal against Wenger’s then league champions, in 2002. Right foot, Park End, textbook technique and struck to the Arsenal goalkeeper’s right; Rooney reminded the watching Gareth Southgate of his enduring quality as he used Nikola Vlasic’s decoy run to move into space before sweeping a 20-yard finish beyond Petr Cech.\n\nFor Arsenal it was an unnecessary – but only fleeting – reminder of their defensive deficiencies. Granit Xhaka was easily dispossessed by Gueye in midfield to allow Rooney to take possession. Defenders then backed off the former England and Manchester United captain as he lined up the 201st league goal of his career.\n\nIt was a gift for Everton, who desperately needed a release after two wins in 12 matches and had been besieged until that point. Koeman’s latest selection and formation shuffle had him arrive at a 3-4-2-1 shape that soon morphed into a bizarre 3-3-3-1, with Gueye all alone in central midfield as Vlasic followed his natural inclination to attack. Özil and Sánchez prospered in the space either side of the stranded Senegal international.\n\nThe only surprise about Arsenal’s equaliser was the identity of the goalscorer. Pickford had foiled Aaron Ramsey, Sánchez and Lacazette superbly but arguably could have done better with Xhaka’s low 25-yard shot than to parry back into the danger area. In mitigation, the midfielder’s effort took a slight deflection off Gylfi Sigurdsson, who endured another poor game, and Everton defenders reacted slower than Nacho Monreal to the rebound. The Arsenal defender converted emphatically and the stage was set for another dispiriting afternoon for Koeman and his team.\n\nEverton fell behind after a rare foray forward broke down in the Arsenal area. The visitors broke incisively. Sánchez, Goodison’s pantomime villain after demanding a second yellow card for Ashley Williams, carried the ball down the left and floated a delightful cross between Michael Keane and Phil Jagielka. Between the central defenders ghosted Özil, who gave Pickford no chance with a pristine header from six yards out.\n\nBelief, already fragile, vanished from Everton in an instant and their task became more ominous when Gueye was sent off for clattering into Xhaka, his second bookable offence. The needless challenge was duly punished.\n\nEverton v Arsenal: match preview Read more\n\nArsenal’s third stemmed from a careless pass by Vlasic to Hectór Bellerín. Xhaka released Özil down the right and, with no royal blue shirt near him, the Germany international strolled into the area and squared for Lacazette to beat Pickford with a convincing finish. It was the cue for Arsenal to start show-boating.\n\nRamsey converted a fine through ball from the substitute Jack Wilshere to extend the visitors’ lead and, though Oumar Niasse grabbed a consolation having dispossessed Cech, it was left to Sánchez to have the final say with a precise finish into the far corner in stoppage time. The final word on the pitch that is.Moshiri and Kenwright may determine otherwise if their patience in Koeman has evaporated."}, {"date": "22/10/2017", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 80827,

the more remarkable thing – Tottenham’s vivacious, springing attacks or Liverpool’s dozy, fluffy underbelly. Both aspects were in sharp focus as Mauricio Pochettino’s team marauded through what passed for the defensive efforts of the visitors. Diego Maradona was in attendance – interviewed as part of the half-time entertainment thanks to his trusty translator Ossie Ardiles – and even at the portly age of 56 the old master might have fancied a goal or two himself.\n\nAs it was the Tottenham crowd made merry thanks to a couple from their marksman of the moment Harry Kane, plus strikes from Son Heung-min and Dele Alli. It enabled Spurs to end a sequence of 10 games without beating Liverpool, and in fine style.\n\nIt all made for a special day for Pochettino, who was so emotional to see his former Newell’s Old Boys room-mate Maradona before the match he could barely bring himself to let go to watch the game itself. But, of course, his natural focus took over and he was delighted with what he observed.\n\nBoth teams were buoyed by eye-catching European excursions and hoping to use that as a springboard to build domestic possibilities. Tottenham’s positive energy flowed. Liverpool have shown that they possess something similar on a good day.

Jürgen Klopp confronted the statistic and looked momentarily lost for words.\n\nAfter their mission well accomplished at the Bernabéu, Tottenham returned with their point and reset to their more familiar and expansive structure, intent to test out Liverpool’s main area of vulnerability. With the visitors’ back line struck by a state of severe confusion, this was a wise and rewarding plan.\n\nIt was the man of the moment who wasted no time etching his attacking class on another game. Kane scored with a jewel of a strike and provided another for Son in a scorching opening 12 minutes. The subplot that linked the two goals took the form of Dejan Lovren, who looked utterly discombobulated as Tottenham’s slick play passed him by. It was like one of those mysterious illnesses you hear about when someone wakes up from a bang on the head speaking fluent Etruscan. After half an hour playing with a disorientated defender, Klopp withdrew Lovren but by then the damage was done.\n\nIn the fourth minute Kieran Trippier’s dinked pass completely bamboozled Lovren, inviting Kane to do what he does best. As soon as he received the ball his instinctive hunger to score took over. Despite losing his balance as he swayed past Simon Mignolet, he readjusted brilliantly to steer a low left-footed volley into the corner of the net.\n\nTottenham doubled their lead when Hugo Lloris hoiked a throw up the pitch, Lovren misjudged the flight of the ball and Kane was away, hurtling up the flank before brilliantly teeing up Son to whack in the second.\n\nAs Spurs attacked in electric waves, the sharp, inventive and determined runs offered by Kane and Son were a continuous danger to Klopp’s team. Son sprinted forward to smash another superb shot against the crossbar. Kane then smacked the ball into Lovren’s legs. There were easy pickings in the air.\n\nLiverpool’s only form of defence had to be attack, and they regained the sense they were in a game when they cut the deficit in the 24th minute. Jordan Henderson scooped a pass forward and Mohamed Salah was too quick for Tottenham’s retreating rearguard. The Egyptian’s cute little scuff deceived Lloris and crept in at the far post.\n\nTottenham’s cushion was re-established in first-half stoppage time. Joël Matip strained to divert Christian Eriksen’s lofted free-kick and Alli pounced to pick his spot. The hosts were alert and hungry for goals but Liverpool knew they made it far too easy.\n\nIt was hard to establish how Klopp might engineer a turnaround and whatever the half-time plan was, it did not do much to change the course of the game. Kane plundered another goal early in the second half. Mignolet could only punch a set-piece delivery to Jan Vertonghen, who tried to get a slice of the action. Although Roberto Firmino managed to pull off a goalline clearance, Kane just picked up the pieces and finished with unerring ruthlessness.\n\nSuch was the mood of swelling optimism around the bulk of this 80,000-plus Wembley crowd, one of the best received moments of the game came when Lloris sprang to exhibit his shot-stopping prowess with a stunning reflex save. He repelled one of those dizzyingly whipped shots from Philippe Coutinho to great acclaim.\n\nKane was substituted late on, feeling the back of his leg, but Pochettino said he was fine. He is likely to sit out the Carabao Cup game on Wednesday night against West Ham.

Their meaning was clear enough: you do not win titles without the wherewithal to make light of a seemingly lost cause and the way that – invigorated by Antonio Conte’s substitutions – they punished Watford in the last 20 minutes brought to mind some of last season’s remorseless displays.\n\nIt would be equally accurate, though, to say that a repeat performance seems some way off and the prospect would have receded into the distance had their excellent opponents killed them off during a blistering spell early in the second half. At that stage Watford, niggly off the ball but so purposeful with it, were ripping Chelsea apart at will and they will regret the 53rd-minute header that Richarlison, who was to the fore throughout, planted wide from in front of the posts at 2-1 up.\n\n‘I will never worry about sack,’ says Antonio Conte after Chelsea comeback Read more\n\nRicharlison had missed an even more glaring opportunity just after half-time but instantly made amends to set up Roberto Pereyra, who duly scored Watford’s second. Better aim upon meeting Miguel Britos’s cross would have deepened the October gloom for Chelsea; instead the pendulum swung decisively, Azpilicueta’s 87th-minute goal coming between two sharp finishes from the substitute Michy Batshuayi.\n\nNone of those efforts could hold a candle to the one that set Chelsea off and running, at which point it seemed this might be the kind of victory that dulls talk of second-season syndrome, recruitment failures and disquiet at players’ workloads. Watford, looking like a team happy to trouble Chelsea on their own terms after picking up 10 points on the road, had started well but could do nothing about the whipped, first-time 25-yarder from Pedro that left Heurelho Gomes standing as it pinged in off his far post. The short corner that bred the opening should not have been awarded, Eden Hazard clearly running the ball out of play, but Watford’s inattention in such situations would become a theme. Besides, Chelsea hardly cared: after two straight league defeats a stroke of either luck or brilliance would have done, and here they had both.\n\nChelsea 4-2 Watford: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHad Cesc Fàbregas opted for something more conventional than an attempted dink over Gomes, easily repelled, when supplied by Álvaro Morata, the afternoon’s fluctuations could have been avoided. Instead Watford, aided by Richarlison’s ability to win free-kicks but also by the strength and poise of Abdoulaye Doucouré in midfield, came again and deserved their equaliser. It arrived after David Luiz, heading a long throw against an unwitting Tiémoué Bakayoko, set the ball bobbling in the area and Doucouré finished without ceremony.\n\nHalf-time followed immediately but, while the equaliser complicated Conte’s team talk, the Chelsea manager could hardly have imagined the spell that would follow. He suggested afterwards that their defending, horribly loose and ill-disciplined, owed partly to a lack of time to prepare during a hectic schedule. That might not sufficiently explain the chaotic way in which their backline – a stumbling Gary Cahill among them– gave chase to Richarlison before the Brazilian freed Pereyra. Rarely, even in the depths of their 2015-16 season, have they looked this ragged at Stamford Bridge.\n\nTheir rivals will have noted those issues but, at the same time, the manner of their comeback should not be ignored. Conte appeared to switch Chelsea to a 4-4-2 after Batshuayi’s introduction although, against visual evidence, he later said their approach had hardly changed. Either way it seemed a risk to deploy the Belgium striker – one of many to disappoint at Crystal Palace and visibly unhappy upon his withdrawal that afternoon – in place of Morata and when an early loss of possession brought groans from the home crowd the die appeared to have been cast.\n\nSouthampton v West Brom: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nBut the noise was rather different when Batshuayi got across Britos to head an excellent Pedro delivery across Gomes after the visitors again switched off at a short set play and suddenly there was a sense that Chelsea were off the hook, especially after Christian Kabasele passed up on a presentable Watford chance, nodding straight at Courtois.\n\nAzpilicueta’s goal, which came almost unwittingly after a cross from another substitute, Willian, had flicked sharply off Kabasele, was no huge surprise when it came. Batshuayi, finishing confidently after latching onto a Bakayoko header, completed the comeback to give the score a flattering hue.\n\nThat was certainly the opinion of Marco Silva, the Watford manager, and Chelsea will continue to stumble through this most unforgiving of schedules if they do not find a way to tighten up. Reigning champions do not generally concede seven goals in a week but they do, as here, tend to muster the odd reminder of what has made them great."}, {"date": "21/10/2017", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24169, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [8], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [9], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Williams", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Elias Kachunga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [39]}, {"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [28], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Scott Malone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdelhamid Sabiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Cranie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rajiv van La Parra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [39], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [23]}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [8], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [23], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [78], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "They gave everything to see it out. They were quick to the ball, strong in the challenge and utterly determined not to let the game have a dramatic, late twist. And, finally, Huddersfield Town, the team whose glories all belonged to another era, could soak up the euphoria of a win against Manchester United, their first since March 1952, and one of those joyous occasions when football reminds you of its ability to conjure up a rare kind of excitement.\n\nThe last time Huddersfield beat a team from Old Trafford, Manchester, came just a few weeks after Elizabeth II was pronounced Queen, in the same year that London was covered in its worst smog and some bright spark at the New Musical Express had the idea of printing the first-ever Top 40. Huddersfield were relegated that season and United won the league, Sir Matt Busby’s first title, despite a 3-2 defeat at Leeds Road. On this evidence, do not be too sure it will be the same again this season for either club.\n\nJosé Mourinho made the same point when he seemed horrified that any side with title ambitions could be so feeble. His team, he said, had lost because one set of players had the correct attitude, and the other side did not, and it was noticeable that he took care not to make a scapegoat of Victor Lindelof on a harrowing day for the club’s £31m summer recruit.\n\nThe point he was making was that it was a collective failure – “I don’t even remember a friendly match where our attitude was so poor,” was one line – and for a team with United’s aspirations, with Manchester City powering on at the top of the league, it was a calamitous result.\n\nPlay Video 0:38 Mourinho questions Manchester United attitude after loss to Huddersfield – video\n\nThe damage was inflicted in a five-minute spell in the first half when Aaron Mooy and Laurent Depoitre punished some atrocious defending. Marcus Rashford’s header, after 78 minutes, set up a nerve-shredding finale. Even then, there were only sporadic moments when it seemed as though an equaliser would follow. No team, Sir Alex Ferguson used to say, scored more late than goals than his own. The modern-day side does not have that yet. Not here anyway.\n\nThe most startling part, however, was that United had kept seven clean sheets in their previous eight league fixtures and had arrived in west Yorkshire knowing that if they could manage one more it would be the first time a top-division side had started a season that way.\n\nInstead, it probably was not a coincidence that they disintegrated at the back once Phil Jones went off with an injury and within 10 minutes of Lindelof’s introduction they had conceded as many league goals as the previous two months. Jones has rarely seemed so important and here was the evidence why Mourinho has been so reluctant to use Lindelof during the early parts of the season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Phil Jones punches the floor in frustration after suffering an injury which turned out to be pivotal in the game. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters\n\nThe damage to his confidence will be considerable but this was a traumatic day for Juan Mata as well bearing in mind it was his mistake that led to the opening goal. Until that point David de Gea had scarcely been threatened but United were vulnerable as soon as Mooy dispossessed Mata. Huddersfield suddenly had a three-versus-two breakaway and when Mooy slipped the ball to his left Tom Ince turned Lindelof inside out. Ince’s shot came back off De Gea and the ball fell invitingly for Mooy to sweep in the rebound.\n\nChelsea’s César Azpilicueta makes Watford pay for misses in thriller Read more\n\nFor Lindelof, the game was becoming an ordeal. Five minutes later, Jonas Lossl aimed a long goal-kick into United’s half and the substitute had what should have been a routine header. It was a blowy afternoon, but there was no real mitigation for the way he misjudged the flight of the ball. Depoitre could hardly believe his luck, taking the ball around De Gea and slotting his shot into an exposed goal.\n\nThe most impressive part of Huddersfield’s performance was that they never allowed anxiety to creep in. They refused to let United settle and for long spells it was remarkable how comfortable they looked.\n\nRashford’s goal, a far-post header from Romelu Lukaku’s cross, did change the complexion and the home side also had to contend with four minutes of stoppage-time. Those were the moments, however, when Huddersfield’s players showed a spirit of togetherness that will be crucial in the coming months.\n\nMooy was the game’s outstanding performer but there were half a dozen of his team-mates, most notably Ince and Christopher Schindler, who pushed him close, whereas it was difficult to think of a single player in red who wore the colours with distinction. Rashford, one of two half-time substitutes, did at least bring something new, but that was about it. Nemanja Matic had his worst game for United by some distance and Anthony Martial, like Mata, was removed at the interval.\n\nMartial had been the only player on the pitch, barring the two goalkeepers, who felt the occasion warranted a pair of gloves and he melted out of the game after an early tête-à-tête with Tommy Smith, the home team’s right-back. Smith was excellent and somehow that told the story of this game."}, {"date": "21/10/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54118, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name":

It was entertaining enough on a wet and windy day, and as most people in the crowd were following the score in Manchester United’s game, absolutely no one was complaining.\n\nHuddersfield send Manchester United crashing to first Premier League defeat Read more\n\n“If people think they are going to see five-zero scores every week that’s not going to happen,” Pep Guardiola said. “Some matches are more difficult. Burnley have great physicality and a strong work ethic, and coming into such a game after playing in the Champions League makes life complicated.”\n\nBurnley were not given much chance here, some bookmakers were quoting the ludicrous odds of 30-1 for an away win, though it was clear from an early stage City were not going to find their opponents quite as accommodating as Stoke in last week’s 7-2 romp.\n\nFor one thing the scores were still level as the game entered its 30th minute, whereas Stoke had shipped three goals by then. For another, Burnley created the first goalscoring opportunity, when Chris Wood judged the bounce of the ball better than Kyle Walker, went on to beat Nicolás Otamendi and brought a brave save from Ederson, injuring himself in the process.\n\nUnfortunately for Burnley, by the end of the 30th minute they had fallen behind. Nick Pope initially made a good save from last week’s hero, Kevin De Bruyne, but he could not keep hold of the ball and showed his inexperience by trying to recover it from Bernardo Silva when the City player was moving away from goal.\n\nThe goalkeeper just about got a glove to the ball but Silva took the opportunity to go down under the contact, leaving Burnley to reflect on their own naivety as Roger East pointed to the spot. Agüero naturally scored, equalling Eric Brook’s 78-year-old club record of 177 goals. While it was inevitable the Argentina striker would reach the mark sooner or later, it was in keeping with a low-key match that the big moment should arrive with a penalty, and a soft penalty at that.\n\n“There was contact and I wouldn’t even say it was a defining moment because we still might have lost,” Sean Dyche said. “It’s still frustrating though, because it was minimal contact, and to get that high off the floor with your arms above your head was impressive. It can’t be just me who thinks there ought to be more honour in the game.”\n\nAgüero, in fairness, spent the rest of the first half attempting to add another from open play, only to roll one shot wide and be denied twice by Pope in the Burnley goal. On the second occasion, Bernardo Silva had the chance to follow up, but his venomous shot was blocked when James Tarkowski unflinchingly stuck his face in the way.\n\nMikel Merino’s late header sees Newcastle United defeat Crystal Palace Read more\n\nBurnley initially came out fighting for the second half and managed to put some pressure on the City goal, though they probably realised it was not going to be their afternoon when penalty appeals against Fabian Delph were waved away, the defender having kicked the ball against his own arm in attempting a clearance.\n\nThat impression was finally confirmed when City scored their second goal from a set piece. After their early flurry of attacking intent Burnley had reverted to keeping every man except Ashley Barnes behind the ball in an attempt to make City’s life more difficult, a plan that was working until Leroy Sané swung over a corner from the left and Otamendi outjumped Ben Mee at the far post to place a firm header downwards. Even then Burnley had a man on the post to deal with such an eventuality, but Steven Defour could not move his feet quickly enough and the ball trickled past him.\n\nThere was clearly no coming back from that and just to make sure De Bruyne took advantage of the only time Burnley lost their shape by slipping Sané into miles of space for a third goal two minutes later.\n\nThere could have been more: Sané, David Silva and Gabriel Jesus missed late chances to boost the City goal difference still further, but the scoreline was already emphatic enough. Even on a day when rain continually poured from the greyest of Manchester skies, City never came close to slipping up."}, {"date": "21/10/2017", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52251, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Lejeune", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Hayden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jacob Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mikel Merino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [86], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesús Gámez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luka Milivojevic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}], "subs": [{"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timothy Fosu-Mensah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jairo Riedewald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "They say the table does not lie: Newcastle United are sixth in the Premier League and Crystal Palace are bottom of it. But the standings do not tell the whole tale of this wet afternoon on Tyneside. Rafa Benítez grimaced his way through much of the game, while Roy Hodgson grimaced his way through the aftermath.\n\n“Can we do better?” Benítez asked after James McArthur’s 86th-minute clearing header cannoned off Mikel Merino’s forehead and flew past Julián Speroni. “Yes,” the Newcastle manager answered. But he also mentioned “determination” and “character” and those were the qualities that put his team across the line, something Palace were unable to achieve for all their first-half possession.\n\nFlying start for Michael Appleton as Leicester edge past Swansea Read more\n\nBenítez knows his team have convinced more in previous matches but there is always a different kind of satisfaction to be taken from collecting points while not flowing. Had he been offered 14 points after nine games when the transfer window closed, the Spaniard would have accepted gladly. “We are coming from the Championship, we didn’t sign too many players,” he said. “You tell me after 1 September that this is where we will be, I will tell you ‘fine’. Credit to our players, they are doing really well.”\n\nA clean sheet pleased Benítez and the Newcastle fans will have been impressed with the manner in which Florian Lejeune strong-armed his way through a tight tussle of a match. Gareth Southgate was also here, taking in Jamaal Lascelles and Jonjo Shelvey from Newcastle and the lively Andros Townsend for Palace.\n\nBut for all Townsend’s activity, with Wilfried Zaha in tandem, Palace barely forced the Newcastle keeper, Rob Elliot, into a save. There was a 23rd-minute cross-shot that Elliot dived on, which came at a stage when Palace had more possession and carried more threat.\n\nAmanda Staveley signs Newcastle non-disclosure agreement before likely bid Read more\n\nBut with Benítez trying to change Newcastle’s gears via substitutions in the second half, Palace’s share of the play ebbed. There was one exception, in the 80th minute, when the substitute Ruben Loftus-Cheek was granted the ball by a careless first touch from the just-on Aleksandar Mitrovic. Suddenly free in the Newcastle area, Loftus-Cheek had a chance to win all the points only to drag his shot wide. The 21-year-old was a lively presence but that miss means that after nine league games Palace have failed to score in eight.\n\nYet it was understandable that Hodgson should compare this display to last Saturday’s win against Chelsea. Then, Palace played well and won, he said, here they played well and lost. “You don’t always get what you deserve,” Hodgson said. “I would have been more disappointed had the performance not been as good as I wanted it to be. But when you give a good performance, you always hope you are going to get your reward. On this occasion we didn’t.”\n\nThis was certainly an improvement on the previous away defeats – 4-0 at Manchester United and 5-0 at Manchester City – but it is now seven consecutive away defeats and the last Palace league goal on another ground was from Christian Benteke at Anfield in April.\n\nChelsea’s César Azpilicueta makes Watford pay for misses in thriller Read more\n\nHodgson hopes to have the striker back soon, part of the reason he was able to restate his belief that the Eagles can stay up. “Why should I not believe that?” he said. “There are 29 games to go. We’ve beaten the champions and we’ve come to St James’ Park against a Newcastle side which is doing really well and we matched them.\n\n“In my opinion we were the stronger team through large periods of the game. So why should I not have belief?\n\n“I will stop believing when the number of points we are behind doesn’t match the number of games that are left. That is not going to happen in October. That could happen at some point in March, April at the earliest. There is a long way to go.”"}, {"date": "21/10/2017", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 29500, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

Second half there were some decent performances within the team, without creating the moments. We’ve got to go again. There’s no point feeling sorry for ourselves.\n\n“Until this week, our start to the Premier League season, which we get criticised for usually – everybody says we start slowly – but I think it was our third best start.\n\n“We’ve done OK up until this point but this week has damaged that view.

I thought we were very good and had total control.\n\n“You knew at half-time the game would change with the weather and Crouch coming on so the most pleasing thing is, at 2-1, with a large proportion of the game left, we looked very solid and didn’t give them many clear-cut chances.\n\n“I’ve never doubted the players’ character or desire to play for the club. We’ve just not quite been ourselves early in the season. I think that’s knocked confidence levels and, of course, confidence is such a huge thing in sport and if you don’t have it at its highest levels then you’re not going to perform as well.

points and producing the sort of performance that suggests not much needs fine-tuning whenever Craig Shakespeare’s successor takes over. Who that will be remains to be seen, with no announcement imminent, but this was certainly a display to give plenty of encouragement to anyone wondering whether to take the plunge.\n\nDo not be fooled by the scoreline. Leicester were far superior in every department and but for some outstanding goalkeeping from Lukasz Fabianski, the visitors would have been out of sight by half-time. Bright and positive from the outset, they did not look like a group of players who had arrived at the training ground on Thursday morning feeling, to borrow Michael Appleton’s description, “cheesed off and down in the dumps” about Shakespeare’s sacking.\n\nAppleton, the caretaker manager, was entitled to be delighted with the players’ reaction 48 hours later as Leicester registered only their second league win of the season, in front of Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, the vice-chairman. It was a day when Shinji Okazaki justified his return to the side with his fifth goal of the season, Vicente Iborra caught the eye in central midfield and Riyad Mahrez, whose form has been so indifferent since Leicester won the title, looked like the player everyone thought he was two seasons ago.\n\nMahrez set up Okazaki’s goal with a lovely cushioned first-time pass and it was the Algerian’s cross that Federico Fernández headed into his own net in the 24th minute. To put into perspective how one-sided the game had been up until that point, Fabianski had already produced four excellent saves.\n\nSwansea were all over the place, with and without the ball, and the boos at the final whistle told a story. Even after Alfie Mawson reduced the deficit early in the second half, the hosts never looked equalising and the truth is that it would have been an injustice if Paul Clement’s side had got anything out of the game. They have now lost four of their five home matches this season and everything points to a third successive battle against relegation.\n\nLeicester, in contrast, expect to finish in the top half and that objective looks perfectly plausible on the evidence of how they played here. “It’s obviously been a difficult week for everyone at the football club, but the first half, the amount of opportunities we created, and the way we created them, was very, very pleasing,” said Appleton, who will continue to take charge of the team for Tuesday’s Carabao Cup tie at home against Leeds United but seems more hopeful of holding on to his role as No2 rather than throwing his hat into the ring to take over permanently. “One game doesn’t make you a Premier League manager,” he added.\n\nLeicester’s chances came thick and fast. Fabianski kept out Okazaki’s glancing header, tipped over efforts from Marc Albrighton and Jamie Vardy, and clawed away Wilfred Ndidi’s header before Fernández’s own goal. Kyle Naughton was more to blame though, with the right-back making a half-hearted attempt to stop the cross that the Argentinian headed past Fabianski.\n\nHuddersfield send Manchester United crashing to first Premier League defeat Read more\n\nClement replaced Leon Britton with Ki Sung-yueng at the interval but within four minutes Leicester had a second. Tom Carroll’s poor free-kick was cleared and in the blink of an eye the visitors were breaking away. Albrighton picked out the unmarked Mahrez with a diagonal ball and Okazaki swept home the inviting lay-off.\n\nMawson’s low shot from a Renato Sanches corner beat Kasper Schmeichel seven minutes later but that was as good as it got for Swansea on another bleak afternoon in south Wales. “Last week I was really pleased with what they did. Today I’m not so pleased,” Clement said. “They’re sat in the dressing room for 10 minutes in silence waiting for me – they know that they can do a lot better.”"}, {"date": "21/10/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 29947, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Wesley Hoedt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam McQueen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [32]}, {"name": "Ahmed Hegazy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Grzegorz Krychowiak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [53]}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [32], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [53], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When Southampton broke their transfer record to sign Sofiane Boufal last summer, they were surely dreaming of match-winning moments like this. He started the move inside his own half, jinking past five West Bromwich Albion players before tucking the ball low beyond Ben Foster. Just four minutes after coming on and five minutes from time, the Morocco forward earned Mauricio Pellegrino’s side a well-deserved victory.\n\nBoufal arrived with a reputation for the spectacular and this mazy run and finish will find its way on to his showreel. First he robbed Allan Nyom, who then crashed into his team-mate Craig Dawson as Boufal bamboozled his way past a sea of navy and white shirts before coolly slotting home. Southampton supporters have been starved of such magic, Boufal being on the periphery of this team and having flattered to deceive since his £18m move from Lille. As Tony Pulis put it, Boufal “can drift in and out of games”.\n\nFor Pellegrino, it was a case of sheer relief after watching his team dominate the match against a desperately poor Albion side. For Boufal, he had seized his chance.\n\nManchester City’s Sergio Agüero equals scoring mark in win against Burnley Read more\n\n“Most of my players deserve to play but this is a team sport – you have to wait for your opportunity,” Pellegrino said. “I think it was one of the most beautiful goals this season. I am happy for Sofiane and my players because we needed three points. Hopefully this [result] will give us more confidence in the next few games.”\n\nBy the time these teams kicked off, the vidiprinter had thrown up an unwanted headache of scores that only heightened the importance of taking victory here, while Storm Brian was moving in for the night. Results elsewhere had pulled both West Brom and Southampton closer to the relegation zone. This victory pushed Saints back in the right direction, into mid-table, after three matches without a win.\n\nBefore the game Pulis had insisted his team are evolving but the numbers make increasingly grim reading for Albion. They are two points above the relegation zone and have won just two of their last 18 league matches. A miserable evening for them was compounded by injuries to the captain, Jonny Evans, the midfielder Gareth Barry and Craig Dawson, who limped down the tunnel as a result of that clash with Nyom, by which point Pulis had run out of substitutes.\n\nWest Brom somehow survived a first-half onslaught from Southampton in which Oriol Romeu and Shane Long both missed from close range. Ryan Bertrand also went close when his free-kick fizzed on to Ben Foster’s post via Evans’s head. Pulis altered things eight minutes into the second half, replacing Barry with Gareth McAuley and moving to a back three. Shortly after, the former Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez was guilty of missing his side’s best and, in reality, only real chance. He skewed horribly wide after latching on to a fine Grzegorz Krychowiak through-ball.\n\n“We were much better when we changed it, we were much more competitive,” Pulis said. “We have the best chance of the game really but unfortunately it did not go for the kid. If he scores that, we probably win the game.”\n\nPellegrino was reluctant to change things too soon but summoned Nathan Redmond with 20 minutes to play, before Charlie Austin and Boufal entered after 81 minutes. Redmond made an immediate impact, with his crossfield ball fortuitously finding Dusan Tadic, who shot straight at Foster before appearing to be fouled by the West Brom keeper. The referee, Graham Scott, was unmoved.\n\nBut just as it looked as though a winner would elude them, Boufal emphatically delivered, stealing possession in his own half before finding a stunning winner."}, {"date": "20/10/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [23], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Byram", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edimilson Fernandes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [10, 75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Connor Goldson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ezequiel Schelotto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Suttner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Izzy Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jayson Molumby", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "David Sullivan’s belief in morality will be severely tested after this humiliation. When West Ham United’s co-owner appeared on television before kick-off, he pinpointed a desire to do “what’s right” as the reason for backing Slaven Bilic when speculation over the manager’s future mounted last month. By full-time, however, those noble sentiments had a hollow feel. Chairmen tend not to worry about shows of loyalty when they see their side display the tactical cohesion of a pub team.\n\nWhile the anger raining down from the stands was a form of torture for Bilic – whose job must be hanging by a thread after this defeat – it was music to Brighton & Hove Albion’s ears. They have waited a long time to experience the feeling of winning away in the top flight – 34 years to be precise – and how they cherished putting that statistic to bed at the London Stadium, executing Chris Hughton’s immaculate plan to perfection.\n\nOn 1 March 1983 Brighton won 2-1 at Swansea City in the old First Division. The scoreline was far more emphatic here and the harsh reality for Bilic is that Brighton, up to 10th after this victory, could have helped themselves to more than three goals. In the end they settled for Glenn Murray opening his account for the season and José Izquierdo scoring for the first time since a £16m move from Club Brugge.\n\nJosé Mourinho: serial winners will always attract more criticism Read more\n\n“I’ve been around enough to know this is the type of division where you can lose three, four or five games on the spin,” Hughton said. Brighton’s manager was talking about whether his team had altered perceptions of themselves but it was a line that felt pertinent in the context of West Ham’s display. After starting the season with three straight defeats West Ham had responded to adversity by picking up eight points from five matches. Bilic was entitled to think that they were turning the corner. He saw encouraging signs in training during the week. “We thought this was going to be the game to lift us up the table,” he said.\n\nThat, unfortunately, was not the prelude to Bilic lavishing praise on his players. Instead he was ashen-faced and downbeat as he analysed the shambles he had just witnessed. He accepted the blame. “I don’t want to hide or run away,” he said. “It is my responsibility. Of course I can’t be happy with our performance. With the greatest respect it is one of those games where you are expecting to win.”\n\nHe quickly clarified that remark. “It is not expecting the win will come if you only show up on the pitch,” Bilic said. “I didn’t see that we didn’t try.” But he did see flaws. He pointed to too much ordinary play in the final third, criticising his forwards for being too passive, while there were gaping holes in West Ham’s defence.\n\nThe onus was on the hosts to seize the initiative. Instead Brighton took control, pressing high and passing with pleasing crispness and intent, threatening on the right thanks to Bruno’s overlapping runs beyond Anthony Knockaert. Their boldness paid off when Murray, capitalising on lazy marking from Pedro Obiang, glanced Pascal Gross’s free-kick past Joe Hart in the 10th minute.\n\nWest Ham toiled as they sought to overcome Brighton’s diligence and organisation but they would end the evening without forcing Maty Ryan to make a noteworthy save. Manuel Lanzini struggled to shake off Dale Stephens and Davy Propper, Michail Antonio’s end product was wayward and Javier Hernández was isolated against the excellent Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy.\n\nThe growing frustration took on an extra dimension when Brighton, satisfied that West Ham had little to offer without the suspended Andy Carroll’s battering ram qualities, attacked shortly before half-time. Moments after Hart made a fine save to deny Murray at the end of a flowing counterattack, Izquierdo gathered possession on the left, stepped past Obiang and aimed for the far corner from 20 yards. Hart got a hand to the Colombian winger’s bending effort, but managed only to push it into the corner of the net.\n\nBilic responded by tweaking his system at half-time, replacing Cheikhou Kouyaté with Andre Ayew, but there was a whiff of desperation about throwing on another forward so early. The change had no effect. West Ham were still a confused mess, bereft of wit or spark, and Brighton remained comfortable and dangerous.\n\nThe home side’s difficulties were summed up when Marko Arnautovic, their £24m summer signing, was jeered off in the 74th minute. Not that the departure of their record buy led to an improvement. A minute after Arnautovic’s withdrawal, Pablo Zabaleta’s trip on Murray allowed the Brighton striker to complete West Ham’s misery by sending Hart the wrong way from 12 yards. “The board will do what they are going to do,” Bilic said. “It’s their decision.”"}, {"date": "16/10/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 30203, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name":

But the way the pair combined after Slimani was brought off the bench to replace the £25m striker Kelechi Iheanacho – so ineffective on his full home Premier League debut – and cancel out Nacer Chadli’s brilliant free-kick will give Shakespeare hope that the spirit of 2015-16 has not all evaporated just yet.\n\n“He didn’t go away with Algeria, worked really hard at the training ground and gave me an issue over whether to start him at home,” said Shakespeare of the goalscorer, the relief evident in his voice. “He had an opportunity before that which he would have expected to score but he showed again he has that character to try and keep going and he’s got his just rewards.”\n\nThe pressure was on Leicester to show some signs of improvement after their poor run and Shakespeare responded by making three changes to the side that drew 0-0 at Bournemouth before the international break, with Jamie Vardy back from a groin injury and Mahrez recalled on the right flank. Tony Pulis also made three changes, with Boaz Myhill making his first league start for 18 months in place of Ben Foster, who injured his knee in an impromptu training session with his son in his back garden, as West Brom went in search of a first league victory since the second game of the season eight weeks ago.\n\nBut other than a frenetic opening in which Ahmed Hegazi – fresh from helping Egypt reach their first World Cup finals since being knocked out by England in 1990 – impeded Vardy with a variety of limbs which eventually led to a deserved booking from Mike Dean, neither side carried much of a threat during a dull first half. A brilliant free-kick from Mahrez that just eluded Iheanacho was the closest Leicester had come to breaking the deadlock until Danny Simpson’s effort from distance in the 35th minute was well saved by Myhill after a corner was only half cleared.\n\nGiven the lack of action, whether there had been any takers for the Shakespeare/Pulis half-and-half scarves on sale before the match was the main topic of discussion at half-time but Vardy ensured there was something to get the home fans off their seats within 30 seconds of the restart. A sloppy back pass from Hegazi was seized upon by the England striker and his touch took the ball beyond Myhill before the pair collided just outside the box.\n\nClaudio Ranieri is tinkering his way towards European football at Nantes Read more\n\nAfter some treatment, the keeper was allowed to continue but afterwards Pulis seemed concerned by his options in goal. “I don’t know what happened with Bo,” said the manager. “I don’t know if it was his hamstring, his back or his groin. Bo was in because Ben has hurt his knee, which is an enormous worry for us.”\n\nThe free-kick given as a result of Myhill’s challenge on Vardy was headed against the outside of the post by Harry Maguire. A few minutes later, a brilliant back-heel from Vardy played in Marc Albrighton down the left and his pull-back presented Mahrez with a golden opportunity to score his first goal of the season, only for his shot to sail harmlessly over the crossbar.\n\nBut just as Leicester seemed to be building some momentum, a sloppy piece of control from Iheanacho on the edge of his own box gifted West Brom a chance to take the lead. The Nigerian brought down Grzegorz Krychowiak 30 yards out, and Chadli’s superb curling free-kick totally deceived Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nShakespeare had to respond quickly and, to his credit, the decision to switch to a three-man defence as Slimani and Ben Chilwell were introduced from the bench paid dividends. Christian Fuchs’s deep cross to the back post was headed down by Slimani to Mahrez, who did the rest via a brilliant piece of chest control and a powerful right-foot finish.\n\n“The team is evolving,” said Pulis, whose side moved back into the top half of the table with this point. “We’ve got better players in the team now than when I started. Leicester threw everything at us in the final 20 minutes and there were times when we could have picked them off but the final pass wasn’t there. We’ve got to do better than that but this a relentless league. We know where we are and what we are trying to do.”"}, {"date": "15/10/2017", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30565, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name":

turning off early given the true English nature of what was on show: lots of huff and puff but little quality. For Ronald Koeman it also made for grim viewing up until the very final stages. Everton were losing again, with their Dutch manager having to endure taunts of “You’re getting sacked in the morning” from the home supporters, but then came salvation – a penalty scored by Wayne Rooney that provided Koeman with some respite on a difficult afternoon.\n\nNot that he saw it that way afterwards. Koeman was more interested in focusing on the positives, namely the “commitment and belief” shown by his players in their pursuit of a draw which, the 54-year-old insisted, they deserved. On the balance of play he was probably right, but for a club that spent close to £150m on recruits during the summer this was another largely unconvincing display, particularly from an attacking point of view. In that regard it was telling that it required a 90th-minute set piece for Everton to avoid what would have been a fifth defeat in eight Premier League matches, after they went behind to Anthony Knockaert’s close-range finish.\n\nBruno’s blunder is a Brighton body blow as Everton escape with a 1-1 draw | Paul MacInnes Read more\n\nEverton had created very little until the 88th minute, with Idrissa Gueye’s low drive in the first half and Mason Holgate’s angled strike after the interval the best they had to offer. Both efforts were saved with relative ease by Mathew Ryan and the Brighton goalkeeper was set for a second successive clean sheet at this venue only for Bruno to spoil that by thrusting his elbow into the neck of Dominic Calvert-Lewin as the home captain attempted to stop the 20-year-old connecting with Gylfi Sigurdsson’s free-kick.\n\nIt was a reckless as well as unnecessary challenge given Sigurdsson’s delivery was almost certainly drifting over Calvert-Lewin’s head. Chris Hughton did not offer a defence of his player. “I have no problems with the penalty,” said the Brighton manager.\n\nAfter a hold-up in play, up stepped Rooney. Back in the team after being dropped for the 1-0 loss to Burnley before the international break, the former England captain kept his nerve and sent Ryan the wrong way to score his fourth goal since returning to his boyhood club in July.\n\n“World-class” is how Koeman described Rooney’s contribution and, while that was rather over the top, his gratitude was understandable. Koeman was visited by Everton’s major shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, and chairman, Bill Kenwright, at the club’s Finch Farm base on Friday, and although there is little sense that they are planning to sack the former Holland defender 16 months after he was appointed, his survival chances would hardly have been helped by another loss, particularly to a team still adjusting to life in the top flight.\n\nInstead Koeman has a point that takes his side to 16th – two places behind Sunday’s opponents – and something to build on, at least, ahead of Thursday’s visit of Lyon in the Europa League. There is no doubt his players showed more fight and togetherness than they displayed in that morale-sapping defeat to Burnley. The visitors were particularly impressive at the very start of this contest, forcing Brighton back and moving the ball quickly and purposefully.\n\nDeployed in a 4-2-3-1 formation, Everton also had the width that has been severely lacking from their play this season, and following Gueye’s drive it seemed only a matter of time before they took the lead. But instead they lost their way, with passes increasingly going sideways and nowhere and Sigurdsson, deployed in his favoured No10 role, struggling to make an impact.\n\nBrighton began to assert themselves and on 31 minutes thought they should have had a penalty after Lewis Dunk’s shot appeared to hit Michael Keane’s arm. Michael Oliver waved away the appeals and replays showed the referee was right to do so.\n\nIn general this was a frantic affair, with players hurtling left, right and centre and showing little care when in possession, and it would have surprised no one in attendance – or those still watching in India – if it had ended goalless. And that seemed the way it was going only for Knockaert to change everything in the 82nd minute.\n\nTom Davies, the precious ray of light shining amid the Goodison Park gloom Read more\n\nBruno got away from Calvert-Lewin with ease and was able to pick out José Izquierdo with a right-sided cross that the forward struck towards goal. Keane was on hand to put in another important block but as the ball ran loose, Pascal Gross was able to poke it past Morgan Schneiderlin’s weak challenge and into the path of Knockaert, who reacted fastest to score his first goal of the season.\n\nBrighton seemed set for a third successive top-flight home victory for the first time since 1982, especially as Everton arrived here having scored only six times in their previous 12 games. But, as Koeman said, they kept going, kept believing – perhaps in part fuelled by a sense of injustice over Oliver’s decision not to send off Davy Pröpper on 56 minutes after he stamped on Gueye’s calf – and eventually they got their reward.\n\nEverton could even have won had it not been for a brilliant double save by Ryan in stoppage time but, given the circumstances, they will undeniably take

Mauricio Pellegrino allowed himself a sigh of relief at the full-time whistle, his embrace with his former mentor Rafael Benítez said it all. A hard-fought encounter in which Newcastle twice took the lead through Isaac Hayden and Ayoze Pérez, before Southampton were rescued by two goals from Manolo Gabbiadini, ended with the substitute Steven Davis clearing a Florian Lejeune header from under his crossbar.\n\nSuch are the margins in the Premier League, where the two managers at opposite ends of the experience spectrum saw their players produce an entertaining match that left both relatively happy in mid-table.\n\n“These kind of games you are disappointed because you could have won but at the same time happy because you go away with another point against a good team,” Benítez said. “I was not happy with the two goals we conceded but it’s a learning process and we are learning quickly.”\n\nAt around 330 miles the journey from St James’ Park to the south coast is one of the longest English football has to offer but even an awful record in which their side had conceded 11 goals in their last three visits did not stop 3,500 Geordies from coming down the A34 once again. After the promising start Benítez’s side have made to the season they travelled more in expectation this time.\n\nSouthampton, by contrast, have struggled to find their feet under Pellegrino, scoring only three goals at St Mary’s all season. In a bid to improve that statistic the former Argentina defender – who spent three years with Benítez at Valencia before joining him as first a player and then assistant coach at Liverpool and then Internazionale – recalled the Italy striker Gabbiadini.\n\nUnusually in the age of wings-backs and false nines Newcastle also lined up in a 4-4-2 formation, with Hayden replacing Mikel Merino alongside Jonjo Shelvey, who sported a blue cast to protect his fractured finger reportedly sustained breaking up a training ground fight last week, in central midfield.\n\nA couple of years ago the former Liverpool midfielder would have been away with England during the international break rather than acting as peacemaker at his club but he has since fallen down the pecking order despite possessing a range of passing that few can match. That was in evidence during the opening exchanges as Newcastle started with real intent.\n\nThe travelling fans did not have to wait long for their reward, with Hayden’s long-range volley catching Fraser Forster flat-footed in the Southampton goal after Christian Atsu’s initial effort was blocked. It was just the start Benítez must have wished for. Led by their outstanding captain Jamaal Lascelles, the rest of the half was a lesson in how to protect a lead from a manager who has made defensive stability his priority throughout his career.\n\nHis apprentice must have been scratching his head to find a way back into the game at half-time, with Maya Yoshida almost making the task even harder when he sliced a clearance against his own crossbar within two minutes of the restart. Gabbiadini finally provided the spark the home supporters craved when he eluded Lejeune to fire past Rob Elliot from the edge of the box.\n\nLess than 90 seconds later Matt Ritchie’s pass found Pérez on the right and the Spaniard pounced on the rebound when Forster spilled his initial effort. It was an embarrassing moment for the former Newcastle trainee, who left the north-east in 2012 having never appeared for the first team.\n\nPellegrino threw on Davis and Sofiane Boufal and his gamble paid off 15 minutes from time as Lejeune roughly challenged Shane Long in the penalty area and Gabbiadini made no mistake from the spot to rescue a point from a match neither side deserved to lose. “We got the point but it was a chaotic game,” Pellegrino said.\n\n“After the equaliser we conceded too quickly and a soft goal because we had to be better organised. The anxiety to try and score the second meant we lost some control and maybe that was my responsibility because I told my players to be more direct in the second half.”\n\nFor Benítez, conceding two goals when they had twice been ahead was a low point on a day when he felt Newcastle’s fans deserved more. “It was a pity for them not to go back with the three points,” he said. “The team spirit is very good, the city, the fans – everyone is behind the team.

It was the second successive season this fixture has ended goalless and it did not need a suspicious mind to deduce that José Mourinho had decided that would be enough to make it a satisfying day – and to hell with anyone who might question his lack of adventure.\n\nHis team had averaged three goals a game from their previous seven Premier League fixtures but this was the first time they had faced a side in the top-12 places. Mourinho altered his tactics accordingly and the second half, in particular, was an exercise in defensive parsimony directly in front of the Kop. Liverpool were unable to break them down and Mourinho has already made it clear what he thinks about the people who might blame him for ruining games as a spectacle. For the story of this match, refer to what he said after last season’s Europa League final against Ajax: “There are lots of poets in football, but poets don’t win many titles.”\n\nJosé Mourinho defends Manchester United tactics after Anfield stalemate Read more\n\nHe tends to know what he is doing but it was a risky strategy and it would have been intriguing to see Mourinho’s back-up plan if one of those Liverpool attacks had found a way behind United’s defence.\n\nInstead, the home side did not have the wit or creativity in decisive areas and, unfortunately for Jürgen Klopp, three points have never been awarded for moral victories. Liverpool have won only one of their last eight games in the various competitions and it all seemed rather flat at the end. “What did José Mourinho say?” Klopp wanted to know. “That we were the more defensive side? That would have been funny.”\n\nMourinho has heard it all before and will reflect on a job well done, no matter how much it grates with him when he is accused of putting together teams that do not play the classic United way. They did not manage a single noteworthy attack in the second half but the most extraordinary statistic of the afternoon was that it was not until the 17th minute that Romelu Lukaku managed a touch of the ball.\n\nLukaku is often accused of lacking his best work in the more challenging assignments but his failure to score here owed more to the circumstances. The Belgium striker had one chance in the first-half when he aimed his shot too close to the Liverpool goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, but he was isolated for most of the game and perhaps there was a measure of frustration in the challenge that sent Joe Gomez flying close to the touchline.\n\nInstead this was an afternoon where Phil Jones and Chris Smalling demonstrated their improvement under Mourinho, Lukaku could be seen helping out in defence, Anthony Martial spent most of the game inside his own half and in the one moment of old-fashioned excitement there was another reminder about David de Gea’s extraordinary ability to prevent the ball from going into his net.\n\nAnfield was already rising to its feet when Roberto Firmino deceived Nemanja Matic inside the penalty area and Joël Matip reached the cross first. The Liverpool defender made a solid connection, eight yards out, but in that split second De Gea was already adjusting his body, jutting out his left foot to block the shot on the goal-line. It was an exceptional piece of improvisational goalkeeping and when De Gea rose to his feet he still did not have a hair out of place. What an incredible keeper he has become.\n\nPlay Video 2:21 José Mourinho and Jürgen Klopp react to Anfield stalemate – video\n\nThat apart, there was not a great amount of penalty-area activity during a first half that was far too hectic to expect either side to pass the ball with their normal accuracy. Mohamed Salah showed, in flashes, some lovely, deft touches but there was so little time on the ball, with a challenge never too far away, it was difficult to build possession. Both sides were guilty of not taking enough care of the ball and perhaps that was inevitable when everything was so fast and furious.\n\nLiverpool 0-0 Manchester United: Premier League - as it happened Read more\n\nThe second half was a more controlled affair, with Liverpool pressing forward, forcing a succession of corners but without ever giving the impression they were wearing down their opponents. Klopp’s men played many passes, but never the killer one. Gomez came the closest with a clipped pass into Emre Can’s path but the German’s shot went into the Kop and, after that, there were only sporadic moments when De Gea was threatened again.\n\nMourinho brought on another centre-half, Victor Lindelof, in the final exchanges for Ashley Young, a converted defender playing here as a right winger, and the game huffed and puffed to its end under the glare of the autumnal sun. It was the first time ever there have been back-to-back 0-0 draws in this fixture and Klopp was asked afterwards if he would ever set up a team in the way that Mourinho had. “You could not play this way at Liverpool,” he replied, “but it’s OK for Manchester United.”"}, {"date": "14/10/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 20945, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [19], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [25], "reds": [27], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Some games are defined by false nines. This was a match that, for better and worse, revolved around old-fashioned target men. Long before Chris Wood headed Burnley’s equaliser, Andy Carroll had made a dramatic departure, dismissed for two challenges that evoked earlier eras and invited suggestions of idiocy. His Burnley counterpart ensured it eventually cost West Ham and the points were shared in a fixture some had dubbed “El Claretsico”.\n\nLiverpool left frustrated again by David de Gea and Manchester United Read more\n\nNot that it resembled a classic. West Ham were denied back-to-back victories, Burnley a chance to defy footballing gravity and break into the top four, if only for a couple of hours. Each, in their own way, could feel they showed spirit; typically, in Burnley’s case, and importantly, for Slaven Bilic.\n\n“I am proud of the players,” said the Croat. West Ham’s often beleaguered manager took solace from his side’s dogged determination. Pronouncing himself frustrated and disappointed, he rued the fact they needed to show such resolve. For the second time in four away league games, Bilic saw one of his supposedly destructive players show a self-destructive streak. If Marko Arnautovic’s sending off at Southampton seemed set to be the most senseless of West Ham’s season, Carroll rivalled it in a display of staggering stupidity.\n\nHe collected two yellow cards in 99 seconds, both for clattering into Burnley’s centre-backs. First he elbowed James Tarkowski. Then he smashed into Ben Mee, elbow raised again. “An unbelievably bad decision,” said Bilic, faulting Carroll rather than the referee Stuart Attwell. “You are asking for trouble.” Sean Dyche concurred. “The second is possibly a straight red,” said the Burnley manager.\n\nIf Carroll’s aggression felt like a throwback to another time, so did Bilic’s tactics. There was an illogical element to West Ham’s prowess; they started with a side overloaded with attackers and ended up defending valiantly, just as, when they had five forward-thinking players on the pitch, their goal was created by their goalkeeper.\n\nCrystal Palace shock champions Chelsea as Wilfried Zaha secures vital win Read more\n\nPep Guardiola had his doubts about Joe Hart’s distribution but the England international recorded a rare assist, albeit with a simple punt forward. A stretching Mee missed it. Michail Antonio met it, skipped past Nick Pope and slotted a shot into the unguarded net. “A really poor goal. That is unlike us,” added Dyche, whose defence had been virtually flawless this season.\n\nThen Carroll exited. Javier Hernández, the penalty-box poacher who had been an ersatz midfielder when Bilic tried to crowbar his most potent players into a system, was then allowed to lead the line. He combined slickly with Manuel Lanzini and Antonio when the Englishman could have doubled the lead. Pope saved instead.\n\nBurnley felt they could have been level before then, citing Hart’s challenge on Wood. “Joe touched the ball but if we were in that situation I would expect a penalty,” admitted an honest Bilic. The expectations changed for Burnley, too. Accustomed to excelling without the ball, they rarely enjoy 62% of possession or face the burden of being favourites against 10-man teams. Dyche, normally an advocate of continuity, made a double change at half-time. One of those introduced, Johann Berg Gudmundsson, struck the base of the post with a low drive and crossed for Wood to extend Burnley’s longest unbeaten run in the top flight since 1975 and help repay his club record £15m fee. “He is scoring goals,” said Dyche. “It is a great habit.”\n\nIt left Bilic lamenting the interventions of two strikers. “We defended well for 95%,” he added. “If it stayed 1-0 it would be heroic.” Instead, he was left to ponder the actions of his resident villain."}, {"date": "14/10/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 25480, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal

At 3.11pm, albeit courtesy of a Chelsea player, Crystal Palace finally scored a league goal. And more significantly in the context of this club’s season as a whole, at just before 5pm when Andre Marriner’s whistle shrilled and the division’s whipping boys, previously pointless and goalless, had hoisted themselves not off the foot, but at least off the mark. “It is the start of the fightback,” offered Wilfried Zaha in the tunnel. The din still reverberating around the stands betrayed new-found belief.\n\nThis was a script that no one, least of all Chelsea’s champions, had envisaged being played out in this previously angst-ridden corner of south-east London. Yet for all the visitors’ huff and puff after the interval as they desperately pursued parity, it was a contest Roy Hodgson’s team deserved to claim for their industry alone. Zaha, on his first appearance since the opening day, secured only Palace’s second home league win against these opponents in 27 years with a goal clipped across Thibaut Courtois on the stroke of half-time, just reward for Mamadou Sakho’s dispossession of Willian in midfield and a cleverly slid pass for the makeshift striker to collect.\n\nChristian Eriksen sinks Bournemouth for Spurs’ first Wembley league win Read more\n\nIt was a goal Palace’s zest merited, and a concession that rather summed up Chelsea’s off-colour performance, all indecision and lethargy where Palace snapped and harried. Willian had dawdled on the ball but none of Davide Zappacosta, César Azpilicueta or David Luiz was sharp enough to suffocate the threat posed by the Palace’s talisman, Zaha.\n\nThe atmosphere in this arena had been lifted merely at confirmation that the Ivory Coast forward, together with Julián Speroni, was in the starting lineup. The sight of opponents gasping in pursuit of the ball merely raised expectations further. “Our start was poor,” grumbled the Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte. “When you play against Crystal Palace away you have to start with more personality otherwise you allow your opponent to take confidence.”\n\nGiven Palace are one of the more generous teams at home in the top-flight, and had been beaten in 11 of their previous 12 league games, that was damning of Chelsea. They had pilfered an equaliser, Tiémoué Bakayoko rising to nod in Cesc Fàbregas’ corner after seven minutes in arrears, but lacked the dynamism of last term in the absence of N’Golo Kanté. Victor Moses became the latest to succumb to hamstring trouble before the break and though Fàbregas struck the bar and Speroni did well to deny Marcos Alonso and Pedro, this was uncharacteristically slack throughout.\n\n“The performance was not up to standard for whatever reason,” bemoaned the captain Gary Cahill before deflecting the most obvious excuse of the disruption caused by the international break. “We have many players who go away, but that’s part and parcel and we need to be livelier. Today it was the basics [that were wrong] and it was unlike us.”\n\nKevin De Bruyne leads the way as Manchester City thrash Stoke 7-2 Read more\n\nMichy Batshuayi’s stroppy substitution, swearing to the heavens and then flinging his strapping down on the touchline, summed up the fractious mood. This was a second successive league defeat, and that magnificent performance at Atlético Madrid suddenly seems an age away. “But we have to find the will to fight,” added Conte. “This season will be very difficult and, for this reason we have to put 150% in. It’s not enough to put 100% in like last year. We want to try and be competitive in all competitions, but it won’t be easy.” His team now languish nine points off the leaders, Manchester City. A year ago, when they had embarked on that 13-game winning streak, the gap was three at this point.\n\nPerhaps they had been shocked by Palace’s urgent opening, a feverish start which yielded that elusive first goal of the season. James McArthur had liberated Andros Townsend to the byline, with the winger pulling a cross back for Yohan Cabaye to collect on the run. David Luiz’s touch propelled the loose ball back on to the Frenchman who, almost inadvertently, poked it goalwards, but it took a deflection off Azpilicueta on the edge of the six-yard box to take it beyond the grasp of Courtois.\n\nIt had been 731 minutes, a drought stretching back to the final game of last season, since staff and supporters of the club last celebrated a league goal. All those dreadful records had been accumulating ever since as three managers tried and failed to find a way through, though by the end here, that was all forgotten.\n\nHodgson’s tactics, with Townsend and Zaha a skilful and rapid partnership and midfielders plugging gaps all over the pitch, had proved to be a masterstroke, the plan hatched over the two-week international break. They might have added further rewards before the end, with Patrick van Aanholt squirting a hurried shot wide of a gaping goal after Courtois could only palm out Townsend’s attempt, but it mattered not. They are off the mark and at the final whistle, life at the bottom of the league can never have been sweeter.\n\n“You forget how stressful those last minutes of a football match are, so it’s quite nice to be sitting here relaxed knowing Chelsea can’t score now,” added Hodgson. “I’m off to Southampton to watch [next Saturday’s opponents] Newcastle tomorrow, so my wife, who is accompanying me, can’t say I don’t give her a day out …”"}, {"date": "14/10/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54128, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [],

A slick first-time passing move produced an unanswerable goal for the home side, but a bamboozled Stoke City defence was already wearily familiar with that routine. What shocked about the third goal was that Kevin De Bruyne was not behind it.\n\nThe Belgian has been the inspiration behind much of what Manchester City have produced this season, yet here were his fellow forwards pinging the ball about with accuracy and imagination without him. Gabriel Jesus found Leroy Sané on the left, his firm cross was instinctively caught and turned back in a single touch by Raheem Sterling, which left David Silva the relatively simple task of arriving on the six-yard line to become the third different scorer of the afternoon.\n\nArsenal fall to soft penalty and Tom Cleverley’s late winner for Watford Read more\n\nEven by that stage, supporters in the posh new Tunnel Club seats were beginning to turn their back on the action to take selfies. In fairness, in under half an hour they had already witnessed the best of the De Bruyne show. “Kevin is a big talent, he’s dynamic and aggressive,” Pep Guardiola said. “When he gets possession with space ahead of him our forwards know to get moving because the ball is coming.”\n\nNot only the forwards, as it happens. For the first goal the visitors were slow to react to the danger when De Bruyne advanced with the ball, biding his time until Kyle Walker came steaming up on his inside to run behind Kevin Wimmer. Once De Bruyne knew he was ready the weight on his pass was perfect, leaving the right-back to cut the ball back from the goalline for Jesus to hook past Jack Butland.\n\nBefore Stoke had fully recovered their composure Manchester City struck again with another quality passing move. This time a disguised reverse pass from De Bruyne, quite possibly his most exquisite of the afternoon, set Sané free on the left with Jesus and Sterling practically queuing up in front of goal. Sané found the latter and Sterling came up with a composed finish. With David Silva missing an inviting opening just before his goal and De Bruyne bringing a fingertip save from Butland right on the stroke of half-time, Stoke could hardly have complained if they had turned round four or five goals in arrears.\n\nRemarkably, thanks to a determined run and shot from Mame Diouf and a neat return pass from Jesé, the interval deficit was just two. Stoke had managed to score with their only real attack of the first half and having had 16% of possession by that point, but it came at exactly the right time to remind all present this might not be the expected procession after all. That impression was only strengthened when Stoke opened the second half with another goal, Diouf reaching a Tom Edwards cross to score with the help of a significant deflection off Walker, though that was as good as the afternoon got for Mark Hughes and his 18-year-old debutant.\n\nEdwards did not enjoy the easiest of Premier League introductions trying to keep tabs on Sané, and though he must have been pleased with an assist his afternoon ended prematurely when an over-enthusiastic Fabian Delph challenge saw him depart on a stretcher with an ankle injury.\n\nTammy Abraham scores twice to give Swansea victory over Huddersfield Read more\n\nStoke never looked as threatening again and the home side regained control with ridiculous ease thanks to another burst of three quick goals. De Bruyne had a hand in them all, and though Stoke only had themselves to blame for the mix-up that led to the first, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the midfielder’s searching ball into the area and even more to admire in a dazzling first time finish from Jesus.\n\nFernandinho was next, taking a pass from De Bruyne via Delph to hammer home a long shot, and if Belgian influence on that occasion was minimal normal service was resumed with the sixth goal. A delightful diagonal ball left Sané an opportunity he could hardly miss, a fact not lost on a crowd who celebrated by singing De Bruyne’s name rather than that of the goalscorer.\n\n“De Bruyne is head and shoulders above anyone else in the Premier League,” Hughes said, unashamedly joining in the chorus of appreciation. “I have to be honest, some of their goals today were outstanding, almost impossible to defend against because of the quality of the passing. We weren’t at our best but we came up against an exceptional side full of world-class players.”\n\nStoke were as good as on the bus home by the time Sterling and Bernardo Silva combined for a seventh goal. Guardiola had withdrawn De Bruyne by then, but even with only 66 minutes on the pitch there was no question who was man of the match. “I cannot deny that was one of the best team performances I have seen here,” Guardiola said approvingly.\n\n“We played quick and we played simple, and I hope we can play as well in the next game against Napoli.” Tuesday’s Champions League fixture is likely to be a much sterner test for free-scoring City, but credit where it is due. There is no need for any further speculation about whether or not Guardiola can do it against Stoke."}, {"date": "14/10/2017", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20657, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [2], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tammy Abraham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42, 48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike van der Hoorn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Malone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Philip Billing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Elias Kachunga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rajiv van La Parra", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdelhamid Sabiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Cranie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Paul Clement emerged for the post-match press conference with his tie removed and his shirt collar loosened slightly. It was down to the unexpected mid-October heat, he said, but a sense of a weight being lifted was palpable nonetheless. Swansea City, more assertive than at any point in the season, had deserved their first home points from a match that had been laden with consequence from the outset and nobody minded that they had enjoyed a healthy slice of luck in getting them.\n\nIf this is the win that resets Swansea’s trajectory, so positive under Clement until recent weeks, then the Huddersfield Town goalkeeper Jonas Lössl will be high on the list of people to thank. Swansea’s early vigour had faded when the Dane, receiving a straightforward back-pass three minutes before half-time, paused to assess his options. They seemed clear-cut: there was no team-mate free to receive possession and, with Tom Carroll and Jordan Ayew in his eyeline, a wallop towards the halfway line would hardly be sacrilege. Instead he looked for a short pass that simply was not there, presenting the ball to Carroll. He made straight for the penalty area and centred for Tammy Abraham, who scored the first of his two goals.\n\nChristian Eriksen sinks Bournemouth for Spurs’ first Wembley league win Read more\n\n“The mistake was so obvious that we don’t have to speak about it,” the Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, said of Lössl’s aberration. “Yes, we like to play out from the back if possible, but if it’s necessary and the pressure is too high then we hit the ball. But it happens in football that a player makes a wrong decision and misjudges a situation.”\n\nAlthough coming after the fact, it was heartening to hear a manager endorse the more direct option. Goals of that nature are not uncommon and sometimes dogma risks taking exaggerated priority over expediency. But this one owed at least something to Swansea’s more positive approach, fine-tuned over the international break by Clement, who had decided the day after last month’s 1-0 defeat at West Ham to adopt a high-pressing 4-3-3 formation and saw eight days of training ground drills pay off.\n\n“The goal was a mistake but I’d argue that we practised this situation,” Clement said. “We persevered playing high, forced the error, and it was a good ball to provide Tammy with the goal.”\n\nSwansea’s players started both halves at a breakneck tempo. Abraham forced a sharp save from Lössl early in the first with a snap shot from Carroll’s lofted pass before finding greater reward three minutes into the second. His opening goal had been straightforward but this one, jabbed in from almost on the goalline to make sure Ayew’s angled chip went in, bore the hallmark of a seasoned poacher. The chance had arisen when Aaron Mooy, brought on at half-time, worked diligently to track back and tackle Luciano Narsingh only to inadvertently release Ayew.\n\nBayern Munich batter Freiburg while Hertha Berlin players ‘take a knee’ Read more\n\nIt in effect killed Huddersfield off, although Wagner announced himself happier with a second half in which their only real chance was Rajiv van La Parra’s deflected effort against the bar. They should have taken the lead during Swansea’s dip midway through the opening period, Tom Ince sweeping over when unmarked and then appealing for a penalty after a coming-together with Martin Olsson. Wagner pointed to “a lot of unlucky situations against us”, suggesting Leroy Fer could have been sent off for a charge on Lössl, but he could have few complaints and it is cause for concern that Huddersfield have not won since taking six points from their opening two games. Manchester United and Liverpool lie in wait next.\n\nFor Clement, this was the performance he needed to prevent next weekend’s visit of Leicester assuming monumental proportions. “I think we have to enjoy this,” he said. “We played well and it’s hard to win games at this level. What this does is lay down a platform for a standard that we need to expect and achieve as a minimum in every game we play.” He, and his team, will smarten up and go again."}, {"date": "14/10/2017", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 73502, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [47], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georges-Kevin N'Koudou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Foyth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [27], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Harry Kane team could be grateful to Christian Eriksen.

Apart from one effort by Kane, which Asmir Begovic saved, they offered little.\n\nPochettino had to do something and he did. He changed to 3-4-2-1 for the second half, with Dier making the third centre-half but stepping up when Tottenham did not have the ball, and Eriksen moving into central midfield.\n\nHe would unlock the stalemate almost immediately.\n\nChris Wood equalises late for Burnley to thwart 10-man West Ham Read more\n\nThere was a fortuitous element to the goal and, from a Bournemouth perspective, it was certainly a bad one to concede. Simon Francis jumped into a tackle on Eriksen, after Son Heung-min’s pass, and it was one that he had to make. But the ball wriggled underneath him and ran perfectly for Eriksen. He opened up his body, wafted his left foot and guided the ball low into the far corner.\n\nTottenham moved the ball with greater pace in the second half and the game became more watchable. Kane had a header ruled out for offside before he was twice denied by Begovic. It was not Kane’s day and, as if to emphasise the point, he shinned a volley so far wide on 65 minutes that the ball went out for a throw-in.\n\nHowe went for broke, introducing Defoe and switching to 4-4-2. How close Defoe would be to the equaliser. Fastening onto a pass from another substitute, Jordan Ibe, he struck low for the near post, but Lloris saved with his legs.\n\nTottenham finished strongly, with Eriksen working Begovic, Dier seeing a shot blocked by Steve Cook, Dele Alli heading wide and two substitutes, Moussa Sissoko and Georges-Kévin Nkoudou, failing to finish off a stoppage-time break – Begovic cleaned out Nkoudou on the edge of the area and Harry Winks lifted the follow-up high. Nkoudou was forced off and Tottenham would play out time with 10 men.\n\n“I’m so happy to win at Wembley in the league because I can now avoid these questions for the rest of the season,” Pochettino said, with a smile. “It wasn’t a great performance but we deserved it.”"}, {"date": "14/10/2017", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20384, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name":

spot by Troy Deeney. For Arsenal it boiled down to a tale of two Germans and one 20-year-old Brazilian.\n\nPer Mertesacker was on course to be the hero after heading Arsène Wenger’s team towards victory with a goal on his first league start for 18 months, but then Mesut Özil’s entrance coincided with the start of the Watford fightback, which was boosted by a spot-kick awarded following a sudden loss of verticality by Richarlison.\n\nArsène Wenger rails at ‘scandalous’ penalty after Watford beat Arsenal Read more\n\nWenger was appalled by that decision, adamant there had been no foul when Héctor Bellerín challenged the Brazilian, but even the visiting manager conceded Arsenal contributed to their own downfall. Mertesacker’s goal in the 39th minute gave Arsenal control of what had been an uneventful match and Özil could practically have confirmed victory by adding a second just after the hour.\n\nInstead he shot feebly at Heurelho Gomes after being put through by Alex Iwobi. Punishment for Arsenal’s lapsed standards was meted out shortly thereafter, albeit starting with the dubious penalty.\n\nWatford were not satisfied with a draw and having scored late goals this season against Liverpool, West Bromwich Albion and Swansea, they snatched maximum points after an attack that triggered panic in the Arsenal box. After a couple of shots ricocheted around the penalty area, Cleverley kept his cool to fire into the roof of the net from 10 yards. By then Arsenal had been deprived of two key players as their problems piled up, Danny Welbeck and Laurent Koscielny limping off with hamstring and calf problems respectively.\n\nThe departure of Welbeck, who had only just returned from injury, led to the introduction of Özil, who had begun on the bench as Wenger opted for Iwobi and the solidity that had yielded a 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge last month. Their other away league games this season were the 1-0 loss at Stoke City and the 4-0 defeat at Liverpool in late August.\n\nAlexis Sánchez and Aaron Ramsey, physically and mentally drained after their efforts that ended in World Cup elimination for Chile and Wales respectively, were not even included in the squad.\n\nWenger watched with a sense of vindication as his team enjoyed the better of a tight first half. Arsenal were energetic and disciplined and their midfield minimised the amount of pressure put on a defence in which Mertesacker was starting because of injury to Skhodran Mustafi.\n\nArsenal were the first to threaten. Adrian Mariappa made an excellent tackle to halt a run by Welbeck in the ninth minute and intervened again two minutes later to prevent Welbeck turning the ball into the net from close range after a volleyed cross by Sead Kolasinac.\n\nWatford created their first chance in the 18th minute, when Abdoulaye Doucouré ventured into the space behind Bellerín and delivered a dangerous cross. That might have ben rewarded with a goal if Roberto Pereyra had not mistimed a header from seven yards.\n\nWatford v Arsenal: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nMohamed Elneny tried to bypass the Watford defence on the half-hour by going straight for goal from 25 yards but his shot flew over. Then Alexandre Lacazette teed up Welbeck with a sumptuous dink, but José Holebas was alert and lithe enough to poke the ball off the foot of the striker before he could shoot.\n\nArsenal were gaining the upper hand. They capitalised by scoring a goal of textbook simplicity. Granit Xhaka floated over a corner from the right and Mertesacker made Mariappa and Cleverley look Lilliputian as he ignored their challenges and headed into the net. By half-time Arsenal were looking comfortable.\n\nÖzil, with a fine pass, offered Iwobi a chance to put them even more at ease, but Gomes tipped away the shot from the Nigeria international. Then Iwobi presented Özil with a better chance but the German’s attempted finish lacked power and precision, allowing Gomes to save.\n\nWorse, Arsenal were losing control, no longer able to keep Watford at bay. Richarlison may not have been fouled after bursting into the box but his raid was a sign of how play had changed course and Arsenal were losing their grip. Watford snatched victory after triggering panic in the away defence, Cleverley keeping cool to whack the ball into the net from 10 yards. The result took them up to fourth, overtaking not just the visitors but also Burnley, Liverpool and Chelsea."}, {"date": "01/10/2017", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59378, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Holding", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [17], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Izzy Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Goldson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ezequiel Schelotto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Suttner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jayson Molumby", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Arsène Wenger is not, generally, given to reflection and it was no surprise when he gave only a grudging acknowledgement that this was the 21st anniversary of his appointment at Arsenal. But the manager did recall the moment towards the end of August when he waved his players off on the previous international break.\n\nBack then, Wenger’s ears were ringing after the 4-0 humiliation at Liverpool while there was unease and uncertainty going into the final few days of the transfer window. “It was a nightmare,” he admitted. This time, there is tranquillity and positivity, and Wenger can luxuriate in the difference.\n\nThe 67-year-old is only ever one bad result from hearing the yells for his head but it never felt likely here, with his team in control from the first whistle. Were it not for some heroic defending from Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk, the scoreline would have been heavier for Chris Hughton and Brighton.\n\nWenger rarely fluffs his lines against newly promoted teams. The last one to win at the Emirates was Hughton’s Newcastle United in 2010 and Arsenal strolled to these points thanks to only a second Premier League goal from Nacho Monreal and another from Alex Iwobi.\n\nPlay Video 1:12 Arsène Wenger: 'Our last international break was a nightmare' – video\n\nPost-Liverpool, Arsenal have won three and drawn one in the league – and they have kept clean sheets on each occasion. Throw in a couple of Europa League victories and the mood is a world away from the hysteria that tracked the club from Anfield.\n\nBrighton looked tidy, at times, and they finished with their heads up. The substitute Glenn Murray flashed a header past the near post and Davy Pröpper curled a shot just wide. But they never carried enough of a threat to make the game competitive.\n\nArsenal were nowhere near ruthless enough and it was tempting to wonder how many goals the Manchester clubs would have stuck away. Wenger lamented how his players’ focus was “a bit in and out” but it was not an afternoon to split too many hairs.\n\n“I knew that after the game in Liverpool, everybody would write us off and I knew it just depends on us – how much we respond,” Wenger said. “Nothing is permanent. You’re not bad in a permanent way. You can do something about it.”\n\nThe home fans had rolled out of bed, yawned and sat back in expectation of a win. All the noise came from the Brighton hordes, who were magnificent, with those in red not inclined to extend themselves. They did not have long to wait for the opening goal.\n\nArsenal 2-0 Brighton & Hove Albion: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIt followed a bout of pinball inside the Brighton penalty area, after Alexandre Lacazette had headed back Granit Xhaka’s free-kick from the byline beyond the far post. Brighton argued the ball had crossed the line. They were wrong. Shkodran Mustafi was the first to take a swipe and his shot was hacked off the line by Duffy. Héctor Bellerín then had an effort blocked and, when it spun up to Monreal, he controlled on his chest and lashed home.\n\nArsenal were comfortable, even if Brighton had a few flickers during the first half, none more eye-catching than the beautifully worked free-kick routine that finished with Solly March thumping in a left-footed shot from 20 yards that beat Petr Cech only to clatter into the upright. There was also the moment on 41 minutes when Cech flapped at a Pascal Gross corner, although Arsenal scrambled the ball clear and broke through Alexis Sánchez. Bellerín played in the overlapping Sead Kolasinac and he crossed low for Aaron Ramsey, who looked odds-on to score. Mathew Ryan, who was going the wrong way, stuck out a leg to keep out the shot.\n\nHughton had set up Brighton in a 4-5-1 formation and he wanted to keep the space in between the lines to a minimum. As usual, the key for him was discipline or, to put it another way, damage limitation. The approach did not become any more expansive after Monreal’s goal.\n\nLacazette looked dangerous, all explosive movement in the final third and slick technique. He hit a post in the second minute with a right-footed pop from outside the area, which had Ryan beaten, while he burst through on 33 minutes but finished weakly.\n\nIwobi had started in the continuing absence of Mesut Özil, who has a knee problem, and he would make the points safe. For the umpteenth time, Arsenal probed on the edge of the Brighton area, with Ramsey ever eager to make the run beyond the final defender. He gave the ball to Sánchez and went for the return, with the Chilean manipulating a cute back-heel that looked to be intended for him. It ran through, instead, for Iwobi and he planted his shot high past Ryan.\n\nIwobi had previously been denied on 13 minutes by the Brighton goalkeeper. The goal delighted Wenger, who has been keen to see greater productivity from him. “Players like him must score 10 goals and give between six and 10 assists,” Wenger said.\n\nArsenal were also without Laurent Koscielny because of a heel injury – Wenger expects he and Özil will be fit after the international break – but it was no real inconvenience. Sánchez was lively and he was denied a goal by a last-ditch intervention by Dunk while Kolasinac saw a header cleared off the line by March and Dunk denied Lacazette with a saving tackle."}, {"date": "01/10/2017", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38448, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cuco Martina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Nikola Vlasic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Sandro Ramírez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Klaassen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [21], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Ronald Koeman had said he would need four consecutive home wins to enter the international break with a smile.

It should also worry the Everton manager that he changed personnel and formation yet still oversaw a weak attacking display and a fifth defeat in eight games.\n\nNot that Dyche has to worry himself with such pressures, having faced his own demanding start to the campaign and delivered Burnley’s best Premier League start. “The wins make a massive difference in the Premier League,” he reflected. “Away from home I don’t think anyone could have seen this start with the tough games we had. I think the players are shifting mentally. It is amazing what a difference it makes when you have that assuredness to go to these grounds. There are signs that we are improving.”\n\nEverton had showed signs of improvement themselves until Hendrick struck a classy winning goal. The improvement ceased at that point. Koeman had argued his team’s poor form stemmed from a lack of confidence – an assessment Rooney publicly disagreed with following the draw against Apollon Limassol on Thursday – when a lack of pace, width and balance have been this season’s glaring faults. At Rooney’s expense, the Everton manager finally addressed some problems by starting Nikola Vlasic and Oumar Niasse alongside Dominic Calvert-Lewin in attack, although persisting with Gylfi Sigurdsson on the left did little for the team’s balance.\n\nIt is also a strange use of the £45m record signing’s talents but Sigurdsson had licence to drift inside and should have given Everton the lead as a result. The Iceland international twice had sight of Nick Pope’s goal, from balls across the penalty area by Vlasic and Niasse, but failed to connect cleanly on both occasions. They would prove to be Everton’s best chances and costly misses.\n\nBurnley showed the composure that eluded Everton in the final third when they took the lead with an exquisite goal, one that Dyche may well refer to the next time someone applies the long ball label to his team. Robbie Brady instigated the breakthrough with a superb cross-field pass to Stephen Ward, who was overlapping on the left. Chris Wood headed Ward’s first-time cross to Hendrick, who found Scott Arfield before drifting into the box. Arfield released Ward and when the defender cut the ball back for the Republic of Ireland international he dummied Morgan Schneiderlin before placing a measured finish beyond Jordan Pickford.\n\nEverton’s defence was static and badly organised, with Ashley Williams playing Ward onside and Schneiderlin weak in the challenge, but that did not detract from an outstanding team goal.\n\nKoeman’s team offered little in response until Rooney arrived in the second half and the team shifted to a midfield diamond. Burnley absorbed the pressure comfortably with Ben Mee and James Tarkowski once again showing that Michael Keane’s £30m departure for Goodison has not had the disruptive effect many had feared. The visitors were almost presented with a second when Williams’s clearance cannoned off a claret shirt into the path of Arfield but the attacking midfielder went to ground too easily when he connected with the defender’s attempted recovery and was booked for diving. “I’m flummoxed by that,” said Dyche. “It looks like he gets a nick. Sigurdsson went down in the first half when there wasn’t contact and didn’t get booked. I’m not saying he dived, by the way. I just don’t think he needed to book him.”\n\nAimless shots from distance aside, Everton rarely threatened an equaliser and did not force Pope into a save until Calvert-Lewin shot straight at the keeper in the 87th minute. They claimed long and loud for two handballs by Matthew Lowton in the penalty area in the final stages. The second shout, from a Williams header, was rightly dismissed by the referee Jon Moss but the first, from Rooney’s flick, was a stronger claim, with the defender’s arm raised above his head. “You need to be lucky,” said Koeman.

The Newcastle United manager had reminded Liverpool fans precisely what they lost when he left in 2010 while his latest successor at Anfield, Jürgen Klopp, appeared to have succumbed to apoplexy.\n\nKlopp – who at one late juncture publicly berated Jordan Henderson, although the visiting captain was not alone in feeling the heat of his manager’s ire – knew his side really should have won.\n\nBurnley’s Jeff Hendrick strikes to pile further pressure on Everton Read more\n\nBenítez, though, is far too good a tactician not to have recognised that Liverpool’s high defensive line was there to be unhinged and, refusing to panic in the wake of Philippe Coutinho’s superb opener, duly demonstrated precisely how to do it.\n\nOnce Jonjo Shelvey’s passing range had unpicked a slack defensive lock, Joselu’s scruffy equaliser ensured the points were shared. That goal also maintained an appreciable distance between Liverpool in seventh place and the leaders, Manchester City. Pep Guardiola’s side are now seven points ahead.\n\nTynesiders have long dreamt of their club being the subject of a Manchester City-style takeover. On Sunday they woke to reports that an unspecified number of parties, a Chinese consortium included, had signed non-disclosure agreements with Mike Ashley, Newcastle’s owner, ahead of a potential sale. Shortly before kick-off, though, talk turned to a potential Middle Eastern buy-out when Amanda Staveley was spotted in the directors’ box.\n\nRenowned as a deal maker in football circles, Staveley has close links with Gulf Arab investors and her presence prompted excited chatter about the potential end of Ashley’s regime. The sports retail tycoon appears eager to sell but he is a notoriously awkward man to do business with and the path between negotiations and an exchange of contracts could well prove extremely tricky.\n\nLiverpool’s visit looked a similarly hazardous engagement for Newcastle but, after a minute’s applause for the former chairman Freddy Shepherd, who died last week, and evocative chants of “Rafa Benítez” from both sets of supporters, the home side began brightly.\n\nDeployed alongside another playmaker, Mikel Merino, Shelvey certainly seemed out to impress against his former employers and, from one of his stellar passes, Matt Ritchie’s curling shot forced Simon Mignolet into an early save.\n\nIf that represented cause for cautious geordie optimism, it was severely tempered by some exquisite touches from Coutinho and Mohamed Salah’s pace suffused advances.\n\nKlopp’s players really should have scored during one bout of goalmouth bagatelle involving Gini Wijnaldum, a Newcastle old boy, volleying against a post, Dejan Lovren seeing a shot cleared off the line and the underwhelming Sadio Mané dragging the rebound wide.\n\nEven so, Rob Elliot had very little to do until he picked the ball out of his net following Coutinho’s splendid opener. Perhaps intent on demonstrating why Liverpool were right to turn down Barcelona’s stratospheric bids, Coutinho cut inside from the left and, from around 25 yards, directed a curving, rising right foot shot through the gap between Elliot’s outstretched hand and the near post. It was a simply stunning, world-class finish but significantly Shelvey committed the cardinal sin of standing off.\n\nNo matter, Klopp’s high line offered him a route to redemption. Just as fans began questioning the decision to field Shelvey and Merino together and wondering if Isaac Hayden needed to come on and start breaking things up a bit, Shelvey unleashed a glorious through-ball between Lovren and Joël Matip before finding Joselu.\n\nWith Mignolet advancing Joselu dithered alarmingly, permitting Matip to attempt a sliding tackle which merely succeeded in bouncing the ball off the striker’s shin before eventually rolling into the corner.\n\nOnce again the vulnerability of a Liverpool defence which seemed susceptible to Christian Atsu’s counterattacking pace had been highlighted. Beautifully weighted as Shelvey’s pass was, acres of space separated Lovren and Matip.\n\nIf Klopp’s much vaunted pressing game is proving less efficient than usual this season – although there were long stretches here when Newcastle were pinned back in their own half – the imbalance between attack and defence is the fundamental concern.\n\nOnce level, Benítez’s players retreated into their highly organised shell, did everything in their power to avoid destabilisation by Salah’s quick feet and aimed to capitalise on the break.\n\nThey rode their luck when Ciaran Clark made a hash of clearing a Salah ball, permitting Daniel Sturridge to shoot and Elliot to save with an outstretched foot before the Egyptian volleyed the fall-out over the bar. Both forwards should have scored.\n\nLiverpool might subsequently have been reduced to 10 men but Joe Gomez escaped with a yellow card in the wake of a reckless-looking high challenge which left Atsu holding his head as the pair challenged for an aerial ball.\n\nIf that relieved Klopp, the German’s increasingly manic, and aggressive, technical area gesticulations hinted at much more than run-of-the-mill frustration. Clearly unhappy with the disappointing Sturridge, he used a break in play to berate a stony-faced Henderson.\n\nSuch angst only deepened as the substitutes Dominic Solanke and Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain directed diving headers off target. Oxlade-Chamberlain, especially, should have done much better but, unfortunately for Klopp, under-achievement is becoming a bit of a Liverpool habit."}, {"date": "30/09/2017", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24169, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Elias Kachunga", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rajiv van La Parra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Scott Malone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dean Whitehead", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philip Billing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdelhamid Sabiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Cranie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Green", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [58], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [9, 23], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georges-Kevin N'Koudou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Foyth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "These days a team is not really a Premier League side until Harry Kane has shattered their defence. So this was an initiation of sorts for Huddersfield Town, who became the latest victims of a striker whose goals are fuelling Tottenham’s trophy ambitions and his own quest to break records.\n\nDavid Wagner’s team had conceded only three goals in their first six top-flight matches since promotion but Tottenham fired that many past them in the first 23 minutes here, with Kane, inevitably, leading the onslaught. He scored the visitors’ first and third goals, and was instrumental in creating the second for Ben Davies. The left-back Davies helped the visitors add a fourth in stoppage time by setting up Moussa Sissoko.\n\nKane now has 84 goals from 123 Premier League appearances. And his strike rate is accelerating: factor in his midweek hat-trick in the Champions League against Apoel Nicosia and he has hit 13 goals in all competitions in September, the most productive month of the 24-year-old’s career to date. Mauricio Pochettino is almost lost for words.\n\nHuddersfield Town 0-4 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“It’s difficult to speak every three days about Harry Kane and find different words to describe him,” the Tottenham manager said. “He’s great in front of goal. And when we don’t have the ball he is the first to run and fight for it. He’s a very good example for football. So humble. It’s so lucky for us a to have a player like him.”\n\nKane tried to open the scoring here in the second minute but saw his shot deflected behind by Mathias Jorgensen. Then Huddersfield had the temerity to try to get on the scoresheet before him, Hugo Lloris thwarting a shock by diving full-length to tip away a powerful long-range effort by Tommy Smith. Then Kane took over.\n\nHe had unwitting help from Huddersfield’s left-back Chris Löwe, whose mistake on half-way turned a banal clearing header by Kieran Trippier into the perfect through-ball for Kane. The striker did the rest, cantering forward and into the box before finishing as matter-of-factly as a librarian slotting a book into the correct space on a shelf.\n\nLöwe was unfortunate to play a role in Spurs’ second, too. That came seven minutes later after snazzy interplay down the left between Dele Alli and Kane, who flicked a pass through to Christian Eriksen at the edge of the area. Löwe poked the ball off the Dane’s foot but when it ran across to the other side of the box, Davies lifted it over the advancing Jonas Lössl with a delicate finish.\n\nMauricio Pochettino praises ‘killer’ Harry Kane after Spurs hat-trick Read more\n\nWith Spurs seemingly intent on punishing every error, Lössl must have feared the worst when he miskicked an attempted clearance and thus gifted the ball to Kane. But the goalkeeper recovered sufficiently to rob the ball back. However, the relief was only temporary. In the 23rd minute Kane struck again, rolling past two opponents before curling a precise left-foot shot into the net from 20 yards. “He’s just a one-season wonder,” chanted the away fans with gleeful sarcasm.\n\nSpurs were a class above anyone Huddersfield have encountered so far this season. This was the fourth away match in a row in which they have struck three goals, and they could have increased the tally before half-time. Alli struck the post after one smooth move down the right.\n\nHuddersfield, made to look ragged at times, did not bow down. Laurent Depoitre cracked a ferocious long-range shot against the crossbar just before the break.\n\nThe home side tightened up in the second period, determined not to permit a tonking. Christopher Schindler hurled himself in front of a shot to prevent Kane plundering another hat-trick. Alli darted through the defence in the 57th minute but when he collapsed in the box as Lössl came to challenge him, the referee booked him for diving. He had been rumbled. “If it was [a dive], he must learn because this type of action doesn’t help him, doesn’t help the team and doesn’t help football,” said Pochettino. “We’ve talked in the last few years about fair play and being honest. I think he’s improving a lot but it’s still something he has to learn.”\n\nSpurs did not over-exert themselves after that, knowing the game was up for Huddersfield. But Sissoko scored in stoppage time, anyway, bundling the ball into the net after a charge down the left by Davies.\n\nKane had been substituted by then, leaving in the 86th minute to applause by supporters of both clubs.

Eddie Howe preached positivity while Craig Shakespeare praised his team’s resilience but this stalemate did few favours for either side. Leicester are still teetering above the relegation zone on goal difference, ahead of Bournemouth, who will spend the international break in the bottom three.\n\nAfter seven matches, both teams can only take solace from one win this season, against the same team, Brighton and Hove Albion.\n\nRicharlison’s late header salvages draw for Watford at West Bromwich Albion Read more\n\nBournemouth dominated this contest and should have had a first-half penalty, after Danny Simpson handled Marc Pugh’s goal-bound effort after Jermain Defoe struck the bar. Howe, though, had sympathy for the referee, Graham Scott, who was unsighted. “I didn’t see it at the time but when you see it again, slowed down, you see it’s a clear-cut penalty,” the Bournemouth manager said. “I don’t think it’s doom and gloom for us, I think it’s a positive day.”\n\nBournemouth amassed almost 20 shots on goal while chances were few and far between for Leicester, who could have smuggled away three points but for Shinji Okazaki’s second-half miss. It was the only time Leicester truly got the better of the Bournemouth backline, who did not have to contend with Riyad Mahrez until the final 15 minutes. Shakespeare dropped the winger from his starting lineup in the Premier League for the first time since April, with Demarai Gray, coveted by Bournemouth since he was a teenager at Birmingham City, preferred here.\n\nChristian Fuchs also returned at left-back while Jamie Vardy started, despite his omission from the England squad. The striker has hardly trained over the past fortnight and will have a steroid injection to treat a long-standing hip problem. Howe also made two changes, with Lewis Cook’s name ironically cheered by home supporters a few minutes from time after being awarded the man of the match award on his first league start this term.\n\nAfter a cagey opening couple of minutes, Bournemouth exploded into life. Joshua King played a neat one-two with Defoe, who scooped the ball on to the bar after beating Andy King to his strike-partner’s low cross. The rebound bounced its way towards Pugh, who would have scored but for the right hand of Simpson, who kept the ball out.\n\nDefoe then latched on to a marvellous defence-splitting through ball by Junior Stanislas but before bearing down on Kasper Schmeichel, the Leicester captain, Wes Morgan, did brilliantly to get back at his man after losing the footrace before Pugh dragged wide.\n\nSomehow Leicester, exposed time and again, survived but an exasperated Shakespeare sought personnel changes at the interval, introducing Vicente Iborra in place of King.\n\nChelsea sunk by Kevin De Bruyne winner for Manchester City Read more\n\nBournemouth continued to pry for an opening, with Cook, the England under-21 midfielder, jinking away from Iborra and Ndidi in the middle of the park before King’s lofted pass was eventually cleared. Then, against the run of play, Leicester squandered an unlikely lifeline on the hour mark. When Simon Francis’s clearing header fell straight to Okazaki, the Japan forward shot wide from 12 yards.\n\nThere was almost a stoppage-time twist in the tale when Mahrez’s cross forced Nathan Aké to clear agonisingly wide of his own goal.\n\n“I suppose we have to be happy with a point,” Shakespeare said. “We got a clean sheet, we’ve had a real tough start to the season but now we’ve got a chance to regroup.”"}, {"date": "30/09/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75118, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

"report": "The only good news for Roy Hodgson was that his second visit to Manchester in a week did not result in another 5-0 scoreline. It could have done but Manchester United were not exactly going flat out here. There was simply no need. That is the bad news for stricken Crystal Palace. There is so much of it that it is hard to know where to start.\n\nProbably the third minute, by which time United had taken the lead and the visiting manager was already staring glassy-eyed into space in the manner perfected with England last summer.\n\nA sublime turn by Marcus Rashford on the left wing had sent Joel Ward so far in the wrong direction that the Palace full-back practically had to pay to get back in, and left free to cut in along the goalline the England forward had the time and composure to look up and find Juan Mata waiting near the penalty spot for a goal to mark his 200th Premier League appearance.\n\nIn truth the game went a bit flat after such a sparkling start, with Palace doing their damage limitation work well and keeping two disciplined defensive lines behind the ball. It took United half an hour to find a way through, though when they did the danger again came from the left. This time it was Ashley Young in an advanced position, easily avoiding Andros Townsend’s token resistance to send over a cross to the far post, where Marouane Fellaini was able to sweep in a close-range volley.\n\nPalace made it to the interval without further mishap, yet in the 10 first-half minutes that remained after Fellaini’s goal United could easily have doubled their lead. Rashford struck a post just before the break, but the passage of play that best summed up the task facing Hodgson came a couple of minutes earlier, when Townsend needlessly conceded a corner because he could not find a team-mate to help him out, and Chris Smalling missed the target at the far post with a free header from Mata’s cross. All Palace had managed by way of attack in the first period was a shot from their stand-in striker Bakary Sako that David de Gea beat away, though it was significant that even when United made mistakes at the back, such as the clearance from the goalkeeper that went straight to Jeffrey Schlupp, their opponents were too timid to take advantage.\n\nHodgson’s second half began as badly as his first, with whatever he had said to his players in the dressing room rendered irrelevant by the free-kick Rashford arrowed into the area for Fellaini to score his second with a header on the six-yard line. Wayne Hennessey had to get down low to stop Young adding a fourth a few minutes later, after Palace had rather dozily allowed the left back to arrive unchallenged in the area to accept a short corner.\n\nAny semblance of a contest over, the only questions that remained as the game went into its final half hour were whether Palace might manage their first goal of the season and whether Romelu Lukaku could break Louis Saha’s record by scoring in each of his first seven league games. One of those possibilities seemed much more likely than the other, but Lukaku seemed to have missed his big chance when the ball broke to him off Jesse Lingard and he put a low shot the wrong side of a post, with the crowd so confident of his finishing prowess a goal was already being acclaimed.\n\nThat left Palace a window of opportunity but though Townsend went close with a free-kick from a long way out, it was not that close and Lukaku had the last laugh when Ander Herrera and Anthony Martial presented him with an unmissable chance five minutes from time.\n\nSo United ended up visiting the top of the table after scoring four for a fourth time in September, while pointless and goalless Palace must sit out the international break on the bottom with Chelsea to come when Premier League fixtures resume.\n\nIt is perfectly true, as Hodgson pointed out, that a team in Palace’s position is bound to miss players of the calibre of Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke, though at the end of a one-sided game one was left wondering what the chasm between the sides might have been like had United been able to call upon Paul Pogba and not had a Champions League trip to Moscow in midweek.\n\n“We’re Crystal Palace, we score when we want,” was the defiant chant from the travelling supporters.

It had looked as though the hosts would rue Saido Berahino’s fourth successive penalty miss when Maya Yoshida’s volley cancelled out Mame Diouf’s header, but the 36-year-old Crouch saved the day five minutes from time.\n\nCrouch, who joined Stoke for £10m in 2011, this year agreed a contract extension until next summer and Hughes has indicated a willingness to discuss fresh terms, despite the fact he will turn 38 in 2019. “It wasn’t a big decision [to offer him a new contract last season] because we know what he can bring,” Hughes said. “If he continues in the same vein, we will be having a similar discussion some time this year as well because his physical attributes haven’t waned.\n\nHarry Kane and Tottenham show Huddersfield no mercy to win at a canter Read more\n\n“He’s still doing things he was doing at 26, 27 and as long as he does he will remain effective at this level. Crouchy is invaluable. He’s a great guy, a fantastic personality to have within your club. He’s been doing that kind of thing all through his career.\n\n“I probably frustrate him on occasions because he still wants to start and I keep him back to have an impact, but when he comes on late in games he will always affect opposition defences.”\n\nCrouch came on for Berahino 20 minutes from time after the ex-West Brom forward saw a first-half penalty he won off Virgil van Dijk saved by Fraser Forster. It is now 32 games without a goal for Berahino, dating back to February 2016 when he was still with West Brom. He has nowmissed four penalties in that time.\n\n“He showed personality and showed responsibility, grabbing the ball and we were all willing him to score,” Hughes said. “He’s working hard and is just trying to get a break. Once it comes he will be off and running. That initial goal for us is a little bit elusive, unfortunately.\n\n“Something will hit his shin, knee or backside, who knows? When it comes that will get him off and running I’m sure.”\n\nSouthampton have won twice in Mauricio Pellegrino’s first eight games and have scored seven goals in their previous 14 dating back to last April. Yet the manager does not believe their issues in front of goal are psychological. “In football when you work with a group of people, when you’re right it’s about a lot of things, when you’re wrong it’s the same,” he said. “When the team doesn’t get results it’s not about one thing, it’s about a lot of things.

This felt more like a victory for Marco Silva’s resilient side, who recovered from being 2-0 down inside 21 minutes against notoriously difficult opponents to salvage a thoroughly deserved point courtesy of yet another last-gasp goal from Richarlison.\n\nThe Brazilian, who scored a 90th-minute winner against Swansea a week ago, is looking like one of the signings of the summer. Bought from Fluminense for £11.5m, he has already scored three times in the Premier League and Silva has no doubt that he has a special player on his hands. The Watford manager talked afterwards about a “huge talent” and a striker who “will achieve fantastic things in his career”.\n\nAs well as scoring the equaliser, Richarlison had a hand in Watford’s opening goal, which gave them a platform to claw their way back into a game that was in danger of passing them by when West Bromwich Albion scored twice in three minutes. Salomón Rondón, with only his second Premier League goal this year, got the first and Jonny Evans headed in the second.\n\nWatford, however, never looked like downing tools and the goal that Abdoulaye Doucouré pulled back eight minutes before half-time felt like just reward for their persistence. Albion lived dangerously thereafter, although it had looked as though they would hold on for a win until Richarlison met José Holebas’s free-kick with a towering header.\n\nTony Pulis was furious. The Albion manager was annoyed that his players had been so careless to allow Watford to break upfield so late in the game but more aggrieved with Michael Oliver, the referee. Pulis felt that James McClean should never have been penalised for a foul on Richarlison and pointed out that the goal was scored in the 95th minute, despite the fourth official signalling there would only be four minutes of added time.\n\n“It was disappointing. The challenge from McClean is fair. He plays the ball. And the referee again has got a great view of it, that’s two games in a row where a decision that has gone against us has cost us a goal,” said Pulis, referring to the defeat at Arsenal on Monday. “Having said that I still think we should have been more set up to make sure they didn’t counter-attack.”\n\nSilva, who had seen his side win their previous three Premier League away games, was full of praise for his players’ “character, personality and spirit”. The fact they enjoyed 65% possession and registered 15 shots to Albion’s nine supported the Watford manager’s claim that the least his team deserved was a draw.\n\nThat outcome looked unlikely, however, when Albion struck twice early on. Rondon’s opener owed much to the vision of Grzegorz Krychowiak, whose lovely pass from deep encouraged the Venezuelan to sprint clear. After outmuscling Christian Kabasele and with the angle against him, Rondon beat Heurelho Gomes at his near post with a neat finish.\n\nEvans then doubled Albion’s leader when he headed in a Matt Phillips corner and both Jay Rodriguez and Ahmed Hegazi had chances to score a third for the home side.\n\nWatford badly needed to gain a foothold in the game again and, to their credit, they managed to do so. André Carrillo ought to have scored with a header from three years out before Doucouré , running onto Richarlison’s clever flick, drilled a low left-footed shot across Ben Foster and into the far corner.\n\nRicharlison spurned one chance to head in at the far post but was not so forgiving when presented with a second opportunity late on. “An amazing boy,” said Silva. “When I told our board I want that player, I saw in him different things than are normal for a Brazilian footballer. But of course you never know if a 20-year-old boy can adapt as fast as him.”"}, {"date": "30/09/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56922, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Byram", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Renato Sanches", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Tammy Abraham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Mike van der Hoorn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roque Mesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "As the minutes ticked away at the London Stadium and the mood in the stands became increasingly ugly, this started to feel like the afternoon when West Ham’s supporters finally turned on Slaven Bilic. They had not hesitated to make their displeasure clear at several points in a dreadful game, jeering whenever yet another tentative move ran out of steam, and there was outright dissent when the fourth official’s board showed Javier Hernández’s number instead of Andy Carroll’s. Bilic’s approval ratings were plummeting to dangerous lows as Diafra Sakho entered the fray with 12 minutes left.\n\nIn the crowd’s eyes, the manager affectionately known as Super Slav had lost the plot. He was plain old Slav at that point, a man effectively writing his own P45. But football has the potential to make fools of us all. In the 90th minute, all that anger disappeared when Bilic watched two of his substitutes combine for a precious, tension-busting goal. In an ironic twist, it was Sakho, the man who faced disciplinary action after trying to engineer a transfer to Rennes in the summer, who broke Swansea City’s stubborn resistance by meeting Arthur Masuaku’s cross with a decisive finish that might just have kept Bilic in a job.\n\nChelsea sunk by Kevin De Bruyne winner for Manchester City Read more\n\nIn those circumstances, Bilic could have been forgiven for crowing about a tactical masterstroke. Instead, ever the gentleman, he was the master of diplomacy. “The fans want the best for the club, they are very demanding,” he said. “I would rather take the decision and risk the booing than do nothing.”\n\nPerhaps that magnanimity stemmed from Bilic’s awareness that West Ham had got away with one. The win lifted them to 15th, a jump of three places, and pushed Swansea into the bottom three, but Bilic admitted that his team’s performance merited criticism. For all that Sakho’s dramatic intervention sparked an outpouring of relief, it also masked a multitude of flaws.\n\nThis strange, lopsided muddle of a stadium felt even quieter than usual for much of a soporific first half. Bilic picked an attacking team and used a straightforward 4-4-2 system, with Carroll and Hernández forming a classic little and large partnership up front. The intent was obvious: despite showing all the mobility of the ArcelorMittal Orbit structure outside the ground during his wretched substitute appearance against Tottenham last weekend, Carroll has been the scourge of Swansea in the past and West Ham tried to make a fast, physical start, almost taking an early lead when Michail Antonio tested Lukasz Fabianski with a bouncing volley from Aaron Cresswell’s deep cross.\n\nWest Ham’s threat soon subsided, however. “The pressure was on the players,” Bilic said as he explained why his team’s urgency disappeared. They began to look painfully bereft of confidence and cohesion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Diafra Sakho is mobbed by team-mates after scoring the only goal as Swansea players stand dejected. Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty Images\n\nSwansea exerted control, outnumbering their hosts in midfield. The 35-year-old Leon Britton brought composure on his return to the side and Renato Sanches offered tantalising hints of his talent.\n\nSwansea’s stylish passing caught the eye, but it was largely restricted to unthreatening areas. It was clear to see why they have scored three goals in seven matches. Wilfried Bony, who went off at half-time with a tight hamstring, forced Joe Hart to make a flying save with a powerful drive from 25 yards and Martin Olsson curled a shot just wide in the second half, but that was it.\n\nPaul Clement was unimpressed with Bony, Tammy Abraham and Jordan Ayew. “I am concerned. I would have expected better in terms of points and performances,” Swansea’s manager said. “Good strikers carve out opportunities for themselves.”\n\nHaving kept three consecutive clean sheets on the road, however, Swansea backed themselves to absorb West Ham’s directionless pressure. Bilic turned to Manuel Lanzini just after the hour. The crowd were pleased to see the Argentinian back from a knee injury, but optimism soon gave way to rancour when Hernández was withdrawn. The Mexican angrily shook his head as he sat on the bench.\n\nBut perhaps Bilic knew what he was doing. Masuaku made an impact on the left, crossing for Carroll to hook a shot against the woodwork. Out of nowhere, Swansea were rattled and when Masuaku drove in another cross, the sliding Sakho crashed the ball high past Fabianski. Bilic limps on, safe for now."}, {"date": "30/09/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41530, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds":

thought for the other teams with aspirations of winning the Premier League is that Manchester City could produce this show of strength, passing the ball so elegantly and comprehensively outplaying the reigning champions, without even being able to call upon the player who is one goal short of establishing himself as their joint all-time record scorer.\n\nIt is a scary thought for the teams chasing Pep Guardiola’s side at the top of the league and if Chelsea had suspected Sergio Agüero’s absence might work in their favour they were quickly made to realise that was a mistake. The days have passed when an injury to Agüero might cause City lasting disruption. They were the better team in every department and, by the end, it was starting to feel like a trick of the imagination that they had trailed Chelsea by 15 points last season.\n\nGabriel Jesus stars to help Manchester City cope without Sergio Agüero | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nChelsea might do well just to stay in touch this season bearing in mind the imbalance of talent on show here and the latest evidence that the club were far too hasty in allowing Kevin De Bruyne to leave Stamford Bridge. De Bruyne is at a level now where he can justifiably be ranked among the world’s elite footballers. He was not the only player in City’s colours to excel and an argument could legitimately be made that it was the most complete team display, from back to front, of the Guardiola era. Yet it was De Bruyne who provided the game’s decisive moment.\n\nThe winning goal was another outstanding addition to the Belgian’s portfolio, aided and abetted by David Silva’s enduring brilliance, the penetrative qualities of Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling in the wide positions and the emergence of Gabriel Jesus as a player who can trouble the most accomplished defences. The celebrations at the end made it clear Guardiola and his players considered this more than just an ordinary victory.\n\nThey have now won eight games on the bounce in all competitions and, though it will always be their front players who attract most of the attention, it should not be overlooked that City, with Fabian Delph flourishing as a stand-in left-back, have beefed up their defence and now have a goalkeeper, Ederson, who is a clear upgrade on Claudio Bravo. Everybody knows the aesthetic qualities of Guardiola’s teams. Yet here, too, was a determination whenever they did lose the ball to get it back as quickly as possible. It was reminiscent of Barcelona’s tactics in Guardiola’s peak years – and that is the ultimate compliment, as far as his current club are concerned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kevin De Bruyne fires Manchester City to victory at Stamford Bridge after a smart piece of play with Gabriel Jesus. Photograph: Rex Shutterstock\n\nChelsea looked sluggish in comparison. They rallied late on but a goal at that stage would have been an injustice and their disappointment was exacerbated by the hamstring injury that deprived them of Álvaro Morata for most of the match. Morata lasted only 35 minutes, leaving Antonio Conte with another opportunity to reiterate his complaints about the fatigue caused by their midweek trip to Madrid. To be fair to Chelsea’s manager, he did not make as big a deal of it as might have been anticipated.\n\nIt was true that City played with greater energy but, more than anything, they exuded the confidence of a side that had scored 16 times without reply in their last three league fixtures. They were quickly into their rhythm, using the full width of the pitch, with Sané and Sterling under instructions to cling to the touchline and push back the two Chelsea wing-backs. Silva seemed to be at the heart of everything and Fernandinho, a player who does not get a sliver of the credit he deserves, had another fine game.\n\nPeter Crouch scores late winner as Stoke City edge out Southampton Read more\n\nThere are not many teams who will back themselves here to out-pass the hosts but City defended with a high line, pressed for the ball and moved it with a speed and accuracy that was beyond their opponents. Chelsea were pinned back at times and when they did break out they did not keep the ball long enough to build up any sustained pressure. Eden Hazard, starting his first league game of the season, faded after a bright start. There was the sight of N’Golo Kanté misplacing what should have been a routine six-yard pass and putting the ball straight out for a throw-in. Willian found it difficult to make any difference after replacing Morata and there was the clear sense that Cesc Fàbregas is no longer the player he was. The passing statistics told their own story: Chelsea had only 38% of the possession.\n\nIt was rare to see Chelsea being given this treatment on their own ground and when the goal arrived from De Bruyne’s left foot, midway through the second half, it was the culmination of a ten-minute spell when City had at least four opportunities to take the lead. De Bruyne’s one-two with Jesus was quick and incisive. As soon as De Bruyne moved on to the return pass, it was clear he was going to let fly. Twenty yards out, it was a beauty and City had the goal that propelled them back to the top of the league.

expectation when he stood over the ball contemplating how he should strike a penalty that seemed like it would be decisive. With Arsenal leading 1-0 against a dogged and aggrieved West Bromwich Albion, who wondered how they had not had a penalty of their own earlier in the game, all eyes were on Arsenal’s new French forward.\n\nLacazette stood behind the spot wearing the expression of a man contemplating what colour socks to wear that day. If he felt any pressure he certainly did not show it, and duly slammed the ball low and fiercely into the goalkeeper’s bottom-left corner. A pair of predatory goals to win a tense match does Lacazette the world of good as he continues to work his way into Premier League life.\n\nThe Oumar Niasse appreciation edition – Football Weekly Read more\n\nAs pivotal moments went it was, importantly, one of a handful that marked this encounter. Tony Pulis chose the I-don’t-want-to-talk-about-referees stance. Having said that, the Albion manager could not quite stop himself from a few plaintive yet pointed laments. Some frustration was understandable given an incident in the seventh minute when Jay Rodriguez scampered down the left, chased in unconvincing fashion by Shkodran Mustafi, who was lulled into a desperate challenge in the penalty area.\n\nMustafi’s luck that the referee Bobby Madley did not award a penalty was enhanced when West Bromwich could not take advantage as they played on. Rodriguez regained his footing and shot crisply. Petr Cech’s reflex save deflected the ball on to a post and Jake Livermore was frustrated as he screwed the rebound wide. “We believe it’s a penalty and if the lad’s the last man he should be sent off,” said Pulis. “People say Rodriguez has been too honest. Is honesty the thing to do?”\n\nThe Albion manager paused, leaving this existential question hanging in the air. “We haven’t had a penalty for over a year now. The facts are the facts.” After all that he made it clear he did not advocate that Rodriguez should have stayed down. It’s a moral maze all right.\n\nFor once Pulis and Arsène Wenger had some agreement as the Arsenal manager admitted it was a lucky break for his team. Had it been given, Wenger said, he “would not have said it was a scandal”.\n\nThe player himself admitted it never occurred to him to exaggerate and his eyes were focused only on trying to score. “I wouldn’t be rolling around trying to get free kicks,” Rodriguez said. “If I have the chance to score and see it, I am not going to stay down and shy away from it. It was just one of those things.”\n\nAnother remarkable, if less controversial, one of those things occurred when Nacho Monreal denied Rodriguez with the goal at his mercy shortly before half-time. His downward header beat Cech but at that precise moment Monreal unveiled a stunning impression of Bruce Lee, deflecting the ball with a mid-air kung-fu kick.\n\nPlay Video 0:54 'We've not had a penalty for over a year,' says West Brom's Tony Pulis – video\n\nFine margins. Arsenal’s two goals, one in each half, tilted the result to conclude a contest Wenger described as a comfortable finish after a nervy first half. Lacazette plundered the first after Alexis Sánchez executed a fine free-kick with zip and dip. Ben Foster in the Albion goal did well to help it on to the crossbar but Lacazette lurked with intent and nodded in the opening goal.\n\nThen came the only one of three potential penalties that was given by Madley. He waved one away when Sánchez’s shirt was pulled, then pointed to the spot after Allan Nyom barged over Aaron Ramsey. Lacazette impressed Wenger when Arsenal practised penalties in training so he has been given the duty. He responded with aplomb. He has scored 21 in just over three seasons – only Cristiano Ronaldo, with 22, has more from Europe’s top five leagues.\n\nWenger was pleased to see the striker provide another positive performance. “He is not only a goalscorer, his link-up play is good, he fights as well, he is not fazed by the physical challenges West Brom gave us. He looks to adapt very quickly and very well,” the manager added. There still looks like more to come from Lacazette in terms of combination play with Sánchez. Olivier Giroud was again in reserve and played seven minutes.\n\nSome rotation is expected as Arsenal head off to Belarus in the Europa League. “At moment I would say the schedule for us is a bit cruel,” said Wenger. “We play tonight, in Bate Borisov on Thursday night, then Sunday morning at 12 o’clock here. I will go with a team of senior players and certainly a young bench.”\n\nThis game marked Gareth Barry’s record-breaking 633rd Premier League appearance, exceeding the total set by Ryan Giggs. Perhaps fittingly it felt like standard fare for this competition, hotly competed, tense and tight in mood. The Albion man was presented with a memento by Wenger after the game signed by all the Arsenal players on the night. A classy touch on an evening when West Bromwich felt few gifts went their way.\n\n• This article was amended on 27 September 2017 to correct a phased/fazed homophone.\n\n"}, {"date": "24/09/2017", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30468, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Markus Suttner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [13], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tomer Hemed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [51], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Uwe Hünemeier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ezequiel Schelotto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Rosenior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Izzy Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chancel Mbemba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Isaac Hayden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Mikel Merino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jacob Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesús Gámez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "If Brighton & Hove Albion get relegated this season it will not be for a lack of valour, focus or determination. This narrowest of home wins against a team who were technically their better will be celebrated in this part of the south coast, though probably only briefly. The next test, at Arsenal next Sunday, is only around the corner.\n\nTomer Hemed’s dextrous second-half volley was enough to separate the home side from a Newcastle United who had come into the match after three consecutive wins and left it reminded of the fine margins of Premier League football. For Brighton, meanwhile, it was back-to-back victories at the Amex Stadium.\n\nBrighton v Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nControversy after the match centred on Hemed, who had appeared to stamp on DeAndre Yedlin during a defensive spell and shove Chancel Mbemba in the build up to his goal. If found guilty of the stamp, he could face a three-match retrospective ban. Others might argue, however, that a highly presentable chance passed up by Hemed’s opposite number, Joselu, had a more important influence on the match.\n\n“I’m delighted with the win but also very pleased with the manner of it,” a typically tranquil Chris Hughton said after the match. “Once we got the goal it was very difficult because you either press for the ball and leave space or you stay compact and they get a lot of the ball.” Albion, as is Hughton’s style, opted for the latter option and it worked. “We had to defend well to win this game and I thought we did.”\n\nThese two sides know each other well, of course, having contested a two-horse race for the title in the Championship last season. Both Hughton and Rafael Benítez acknowledged that there is not much to choose between them; not in personnel, attitude or even formation.\n\n“They’re quite similar in the way they play, a 4–4–1–1, though they probably have a bit more pace off the front than we have‚” Hughton said. “It was nice to win but they’d look at the fact they’re still two points ahead of us in the table.”\n\nIt was perhaps an acknowledgement of the speed provided by Christian Atsu and Matt Ritchie that Brighton were happy to play on the break, even during the opening exchanges. That was where the space was however, and when Anthony Knockaert found Solly March in room on the left in the 11th minute, the first big chance of the match followed. March whipped the ball across the face of goal where it eventually fell to Pascal Gross on the edge of the box. With the goal at his mercy, the German advanced on to the ball and drove his shot fiercely into Knockaert’s back.\n\nTen minutes later and Newcastle had contrived an even more glaring miss. It was a sweet move, flowing all the way from their own box with Mikel Merino robbing Knockaert, then advancing the ball to Atsu who drove inside and out at the Brighton defence before slipping in Ayoze Pérez for the cross.\n\nPérez found his fellow Spaniard on the edge of the six-yard box. Joselu, who contrived a series of glaring misses against Stoke last week, rolled his marker cleverly, spun on the ball and pushed his shot well wide of the far post.\n\nFrom that point the first half declined. Gross put paid to a well-worked counterattack with a six-yard pass straight to Ciaran Clark. Pérez shot over from close range when teed up by Chancel Mbemba. When the half-time whistle went, Hughton had a face like thunder.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend’s best Premier League photos Read more\n\nWithin six minutes of the restart, however, Brighton had the all-important opening goal. It came from a setpiece on the left-hand side of the Newcastle box, driven deep by Gross. Dale Stephens met the ball unmarked at the back post and nodded it back across goal where it skewed through a defender’s legs and up to chest height. With barely any time to react, Hemed managed to meet the ball both on the turn and on the volley and flashed it into the roof of the net.\n\nNewcastle did not look like their gameplan had been thrown out of the window, they remained calm and composed. But they were lacking the alacrity to penetrate a Brighton defence that had been happy to invite them on to them in the first place. For their part, Brighton’s counterattacks – even with half an hour remaining – were now largely seen as opportunities to run the ball into the corner.\n\nBenítez argued later that Hemed had shoved Mbemba as the initial ball came over the box. “It’s a player who is moving and pushing, not someone standing still,” he said. But he also acknowledged that his team needed to create more with the ball, especially after going behind.\n\n“We did some good things, we had some chances. But we have to learn from this defeat. You have to be stronger in defence if you want a clean sheet in the Premier League and you have to take your chances. It’s a pity with so much control at the end we didn’t create better chances.”"}, {"date": "23/09/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56988, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [87], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [28]}, {"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [28], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Byram", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [64], "reds": [70], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34, 38], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georges-Kevin N'Koudou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "On a slow-burn afternoon at the London Stadium, West Ham United summoned a late, doomed charge, but Tottenham Hotspur were always just about beyond their reach.

It looked a slightly strange, and indeed untranscribable, 3-2-1-2-1-1 formation, albeit one that West Ham never really tested when it might have mattered most.\n\nThe game took a while to thrum up through the gears. Spurs had their best moments down the Sissoko-Aurier right flank, which was also the source of the most glaring miss of the game after 20 minutes. Sissoko’s neat pass inside a square West Ham defence gave Aurier space to fizz a low hard cross that Kane miskicked in front of an open goal.\n\nWith 26 minutes gone Andy Carroll came on for Michail Antonio, who looked to have twanged his groin. It was a change that shifted the dynamic of West Ham’s attack, and not in a good way. Antonio can run all day, a relentless bullocking presence. These days Carroll tends to unsheathe his elbows, find a nice part of the attacking half and put his towel down there for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nJust past the half-hour mark the game began to wake up, Sissoko and Mark Noble bumping chests and yelling into each other’s faces after Noble had slid in a little roughly after a loose ball. Three minutes later Kane opened the scoring. There was a beautiful severity to the move, with four touches from the centre circle to back of the net. Christian Eriksen played an instant pass to put Dele Alli in space. He took a touch, crossed and Kane flashed a header into the corner.\n\nMoments later it was two. This time the move came down the right, Jan Vertonghen striding away from Carroll’s limp challenge and setting Alli galloping off into space. Joe Hart’s block sent the ball straight to Kane’s feet. He had time to stop, yawn and roll the ball into the net. It was not a disastrous goal to concede, just strangely sloppy and loose, a combination of half-hearted, low-pressure interventions and a lack of pace in that West Ham back three.\n\nOumar Niasse scores twice to give Everton victory over Bournemouth Read more\n\nFor a while at the start of the second half it was hard to believe a Premier League match was actually taking place, as half the stadium seemed to be finding its way back from the refreshment galleries, a football stadium that at times in practice seems like a vast, craning, cantilevered act of dilution.\n\nFor a while this became the Alli-Eriksen show, Spurs’ two most impish creative players finding space in awkward areas. Alli was tripped outside the area. Kane hit the post with a fiercely spanked free-kick, and from Aurier’s deflected cross Eriksen placed the ball low into the corner past Hart to make it 3-0.\n\nWest Ham pulled one back with 25 minutes to go, Javier Hernández heading in at the back post after José Fonte’s flick. It was a classic piece of poaching, Hernandez’s first shot at goal, and only his 20th touch of the ball.\n\nFinally we had something that resembled in shape and sound a London derby, as West Ham set about Spurs with a little intent. Aurier was sent off, drawing a second yellow for a hack on Carroll from behind. Cheikhou Kouyaté headed in from the substitute Arthur Masuaku’s fine cross, and by the end West Ham might even have snatched a point. This, though, was a game that was lost in that half-speed opening, and killed off by Kane’s lovable, cold-eyed precision."}, {"date": "23/09/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 20759,

I can’t abide it. I feel for the referee and I thought he was excellent in the moment. But he should be protected from that. “If it is a penalty they score, we lose and then he gets banned.

The manager who tried to shove him unceremoniously through the exit door will have felt sheepish, to say the least, when his Senegalese substitute turned the latest lacklustre Everton performance around.\n\nRonald Koeman’s ears must have been burning, if that expression is permissible in response to Twitter abuse, when Everton were trailing 1-0 to Bournemouth in the second half and looking unlikely to climb out of the bottom three. Supporters were rightly pointing out that the team was playing without wingers and looking feeble up front and when Niasse was brought on it appeared more an act of desperation than a likely path to salvation. Koeman admitted it was chiefly to protect the injured Wayne Rooney.\n\nÁlvaro Morata strikes treble for Chelsea in crushing defeat of Stoke Read more\n\nYet together with his fellow substitute Tom Davies the striker Koeman shunned last season turned the game, coming up with two goals in five minutes, and though Everton still look shaky at least they are moving up the table.\n\n“A win was important today,” a relieved Koeman said. “Everybody knows what it is like for managers, if you lose you are not sure about your job. Oumar was incredible when he came on, when he joined Dominic Calvert-Lewin we showed more aggression. We can use him more. Last season was different, we had Romelu Lukaku.”\n\nIt is Bournemouth who remain in the relegation zone after looking capable of winning for much of the game, and might have done had the normally reliable Jermain Defoe taken an opportunity to double their lead. “We had several chances, we looked good on the counter,” Eddie Howe said. “I don’t think we deserved to lose but we could still be pleased with the performance.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Josh King scores the opener with a low shot past Jordan Pickford in Everton’s goal. Photograph: Mark Robinson/Getty Images\n\nA desperately poor first half would have been completely forgettable but for a couple of penalty claims. Martin Atkinson saw nothing untoward when Gylfi Sigurdsson was pushed over, though he must have felt a little awkward in waving play on after a challenge by Simon Francis on Rooney when the Everton player regained his feet with blood pouring from an eye wound. Replays showed he had been caught by an elbow and while the contact was by no means as savage as that makes it sound, an incensed Rooney could be seen complaining that it was happening all the time. Atkinson could hardly award a penalty in retrospect, but Everton were a man down for most of the rest of the half as medics struggled to close the gash.\n\nIt was clear by the interval that both sides were short of attacking ideas. Bournemouth at least had a focus in Defoe but found it hard to supply him. For Everton, Dominic Calvert-Lewin had the beating of Nathan Aké every time the ball was in the air, though that was not often enough for the home side with even Leighton Baines having an off day with his crossing. The real problem for Everton was a lack of creativity, something Sigurdsson was supposed to remedy, yet the club’s record signing found himself pushed out to the left, with Rooney notionally playing on the right. Of all the No10s at Koeman’s disposal it seemed a trifle odd to hand Davy Klaassen the central role.\n\nPaul Clement takes the blame for Swansea’s defeat to Watford Read more\n\nPressure on Koeman increased early in the second half when Bournemouth registered their first away goal of the season. Josh King took a direct approach and after leaving Mason Holgate in his wake beat Jordan Pickford with a crisp shot from the edge of the area. Things nearly got worse two minutes later when King ran through the middle to free Defoe. It was the sort of chance the veteran goalscorer usually snaps up with relish, though on this occasion his attempt only found Pickford’s outstretched leg and Everton breathed again.\n\nKoeman threw on Niasse and Davies and though the effect was not immediate the gamble ultimately paid off. Niasse won possession and a sharp return through-ball from Davies set him up for his well-taken first goal and the same combination struck again to deliver the winner five minutes later. Davies’s ball into the box looped up off Steve Cook and came down at the far post, where Niasse outjumped the Bournemouth defence, hooking over the line to make sure.\n\nMuch more of this and Roberto Martínez’s judgment might have to be reappraised.

This fifth win of the Premier League season took the tally to 21 goals and added a fourth clean sheet to a formidable start from Pep Guardiola’s men.\n\nIt was a duck-shoot as Crystal Palace provided easy prey and their search for a first goal of the campaign continues. They have now lost all six of their opening games and if Roy Hodgson’s side go down next week they will equal Portsmouth’s record of seven straight losses from 2009-10.\n\nThe bad news for the Eagles is that Manchester United are up next but City will hardly care about that. What did annoy Guardiola was Neil Swarbrick’s failure to give a penalty after Timothy Fosu-Mensah pulled down the excellent Leroy Sané. However, when Sergio Agüero headed home for the fourth a few seconds afterwards, the smile returned to the Catalan – and his team were not finished.\n\nAs Guardiola noted, last year his side won their first six league matches, part of a run of 10 in all competitions. “We have less points than last season,” he said, “but I think we have more goals, conceded less and the feeling is a little bit better. But it’s just September.”\n\nAs expected, City were a constant blue swarm throughout. Palace lined up in a 4-5-1 that had Christian Benteke at the tip and Reuben Loftus-Cheek as the midfielder with licence to rove forward. The former Chelsea man came close to an unexpected opener, his shot beating Ederson but going the wrong side of the goalkeeper’s right post. Loftus-Cheek was later guilty of a glaring miss when a run took him deep into City’s area but his radar was awry after Fosu-Mensah picked him out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester City’s Leroy Sané scores his side’s first goal of the game.

The German fashioned a wonderful one-two with David Silva that featured a lovely chip from the latter and Sané did the rest with ease. At times it had been attack versus defence, with City completely camped in Palace’s half, so this was just reward for their superiority.\n\nGuardiola made one change from the last league outing and when it was announced it was received as a surprise. Yet after his opener the dropping of the talented Gabriel Jesus for Sané, who scored both goals in the midweek Carabao Cup win at West Brom, seemed smart.\n\nBy then City had lost Benjamin Mendy, the French left-back forced off in the 28th minute due to a knee injury, and replaced by Danilo. Following the game Mendy tweeted. “Tough knock for me but i will be ok inch’alla,” he said. Guardiola said he did not know if it was a ligament injury and that more would be known on Sunday.\n\nHodgson made three changes from his first match in charge, the last of the five previous league losses. Mamadou Sakho started for a first time while Patrick van Aanholt and Luka Milivojevic were also included.\n\nAs the second half kicked off, the Silva-Sané combo started up again almost instantly. Another percussive move switched the ball between them and after Sané threatened, Fernandinho was able to shoot but to no avail. Sané, though, was about to turn creator as City moved up the gears.\n\nTottenham hang on to beat West Ham with 10 men after Harry Kane double Read more\n\nThis was simple and slick: Kevin De Bruyne found Sané down the left and he pinged the ball past Sakho and in to Raheem Sterling and it was 2-0, the winger scoring a fourth goal of the season. Soon afterwards he should have had a fifth. Wayne Hennessey spilled a De Bruyne shot into the lurking Sterling’s path but he hit side-netting not the back of Hennessey’s goal, and Palace escaped.\n\nCity’s interplay now was delightful. Agüero went close after an exchange with Silva and Sterling did now strike again. Guardiola has wanted more from Agüero and here he got it, the No10 volleying a neat short-range pass that Sterling rolled home. This was the 22-year-old’s final act. Guardiola paid him a compliment by taking him off on the hour to protect him for Shakhtar Donetsk’s Champions League visit on Tuesday.\n\nBy the close it was all so familiar: Fabian Delph added the fifth as Palace became the latest patsies steamrolled by City.\n\nRomelu Lukaku strike enough to give Manchester United win at Southampton Read more\n\nHodgson, who had seen Benteke limp off in the second half, said: “It is ridiculous to talk about positives after being beaten 5-0, admittedly playing against a top-quality team. We will see some light at the end of the tunnel. I was beginning to see it at half-time, but that light has gone out by the end.”\n\nHe may be now be without Benteke due to his injury. “It is a form of ligament damage, but I don’t quite know how bad that is because he is going to have a scan tomorrow,” said the manager.\n\nAs for City, they can be expected to improve: it is a frightening prospect."}, {"date": "23/09/2017", "arena": " Mary's

though this was still the kind of victory to make him purr. Manchester United are enjoying their best start to a campaign in six years even if a contest they had initially threatened to dominate, bullying their hosts into submission, went on to become a far sterner test of their resilience. Southampton rallied impressively after the interval and it was the visitors who were left clinging on, though their manager will still have delighted in rugged success.\n\nMourinho has always valued wins that have to be chiselled out and orchestrated shrewdly from the bench. He had flung on Chris Smalling and resorted to a back five before the end in an attempt to contain the hosts, Mauricio Pellegrino having exhausted his own team’s firepower from the bench. Even Fraser Forster ventured upfield at a set-piece while Mourinho was still shaking the hands of Southampton’s coaching staff having been sent to the stands, apparently for encroaching on to the pitch.\n\nThe final whistle would have sounded by the time he returned to the dressing room, leaving him to praise his team as “solid, with good solidarity, organisation and spirit, and amazing points”.\n\nÁlvaro Morata strikes treble for Chelsea in crushing defeat of Stoke Read more\n\nIt felt a significant win. Those around second-place United secured more riotous successes on Saturday but, in the manner it was achieved, this was arguably as impressive a result. Retreat to last season and United might have wilted, shipping an equaliser to record another of those horribly wasteful and familiar score draws. As it is they are four points better off than at the same stage last season having demonstrated they can scintillate or grind out results dependent upon the occasion. Phil Jones and Eric Bailly flung themselves at anything that moved, while Nemanja Matic and Marouane Fellaini offered a measure of authority in central midfield. Oriol Romeu should still probably have equalised, conjuring two headers and a shot wide of David de Gea’s far post having eased himself clear, but United heaved and succeeded in keeping their opponents blunted.\n\nThe management will wonder why their initial dominance had been eroded. “What pleased me was the pragmatism, but we were really tired at the end,” said Mourinho. “And nine of them didn’t play in midweek [in the League Cup], so for nine of them it’s not even an accumulation of fatigue. The weather was beautiful and even if you train at 11am, 12pm or 3pm in Manchester we don’t get this weather. Seriously. The last time we had this was in Los Angeles in preseason and then in Macedonia [for the Uefa Super Cup], and I think they felt [it]. I saw some players not sharp. Great spirit and always trying, but not the same sharpness.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest José Mourinho is sent to the stands by the referee Craig Pawson. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nThat more than justified his late move to five at the back, once Manolo Gabbiadini had been introduced, and six in stoppage time.\n\nMourinho, sent to the stands against Burnley and West Ham last season, could offer no explanation for his own dismissal. He had been exasperated that too many of his players had ventured upfield on the counter, and appeared to enter the playing area before accidentally bumping into the fourth official, Mike Jones. “Craig [Pawson, the referee] told me to leave, so I left,” he said.\n\nHe was barely more forthcoming on the travelling support’s insistence on airing that infamous Romelu Lukaku chant once again, following it up with “We’re Man United, we’ll sing what we want”. The only terrace song Mourinho claimed to have heard was one from the Southampton fans telling him where to go, and described the travelling support as “amazing”.\n\nOumar Niasse hits brace from bench to give Everton victory over Bournemouth Read more\n\nUnited’s rearguard ended up seeing them home, but Lukaku was their match-winner. The forward had bruised Maya Yoshida and Wesley Hoedt during a one-sided opening period and eventually scored his sixth goal in six Premier League games for his new club midway through the half.\n\nAshley Young patiently waited to squeeze space from Dusan Tadic on the flank before flinging over a cross to the edge of the six-yard box. Lukaku had already held off Hoedt, the Dutchman crumpling to the turf but not complaining of a foul, and Ryan Bertrand was in no position to choke his header. Forster did well to push that effort out, but the Belgian merely converted the rebound into the empty net.\n\nSouthampton had appeared fragile at that stage, but will take heart in how they recovered their poise – presumably to the satisfaction of the new owner, Gao Jisheng, who was watching for the first time from the directors’ box – for all that they have now gone scoreless in nine of their past 11 home league matches. They are “getting better”, according to Pellegrino.\n\nAs are United. “We are better this season than last, but this is nothing,” said Mourinho. “It’s just a start.”"}, {"date": "23/09/2017", "arena":

pacing up and down and waving his arms around, yet this was one of those afternoons when the Chelsea manager could have put his feet up, sat back and enjoyed the show as the outstanding Álvaro Morata took centre stage with a superb hat-trick.\n\nChelsea’s record signing took his tally to an impressive seven goals in seven games in the process and it felt fitting that he should deliver such an outstanding performance at the end of a week when the Premier League champions finally said goodbye to Diego Costa. Diego who?\n\nFew at Chelsea will be pining for Costa’s rampaging presence up front if Morata continues to play with this sort of finesse while also displaying such composure in front of goal. Chelsea’s supporters have already fallen in love with the man Conte described 24 hours earlier as the type of person a father would be happy for his daughter to marry.\n\nManchester City and Raheem Sterling pile on Crystal Palace misery Read more\n\nMorata’s name was once again ringing out from the away end in the second half, just as it had at Leicester a couple of weeks ago, only this time the words were far more palatable, suggesting that the striker is better than Harry Kane rather than a crude reference to “Yids”.\n\nTime will tell whether Morata can score as prolifically as Kane in the Premier League but on what we have seen so far the 24-year-old will give the England international a run for his money when it comes to the golden boot. Morata’s second here was particularly special and he could easily have ended up with four or five.\n\nPedro scored the other goal in a comfortable Chelsea victory that provided good preparation for a crucial week with Conte’s players travelling to Atlético Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday and take on Manchester City at Stamford Bridge three days later.\n\nIt is a safe bet that neither Atlético nor City will be as obliging opponents as Stoke, who contributed to their own downfall by making what Mark Hughes described as “catastrophic errors”. With two central defenders injured, and Kurt Zouma ineligible to play against his parent club, Hughes was entitled to point to mitigating circumstances, but that was still no excuse for the way Stoke gifted Chelsea their first two goals.\n\nManchester City and Raheem Sterling pile on Crystal Palace misery Read more\n\nMorata scored the first, with 81 seconds on the clock, and that set the tone. Hughes felt aggrieved that Marcos Alonso escaped with a talking to from Mike Dean, the referee, rather than a second yellow card early in the second half and also suggested that the scoreline flattered Chelsea. That may have been so to an extent, yet there was still no escaping the gulf in class, epitomised by Morata’s display up front.\n\n“Álvaro performed very well,” Conte said. “He scored a hat-trick and for a striker that is very important. Don’t forget the last game against Nottingham Forest the same happened with [Michy] Batshuayi. It means that we create the chances for our strikers to take. I am pleased with his performance and I’m pleased with the performance of the team.”\n\nConte, rather dubiously, claimed that it was a tactical decision to take Alonso off shortly after the Stoke supporters bayed for the left wing-back to be dismissed following a foul on Mame Diouf. Either way, it was a wise call and prevented Alonso from running the risk of becoming the fourth Chelsea player to be sent off in six league games this season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The two managers – Mark Hughes, left, and Antonio Conte – get animated on the touchline. Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images\n\nBy that stage Chelsea were two goals to the good. Morata’s first came about after Bruno Martins Indi, who limped off with a groin strain in the second half to add to Stoke’s defensive woes, was caught ball-watching. Running on to César Azpilicueta’s floated pass, Morata took a touch before prodding coolly past Jack Butland.\n\nPedro then doubled Chelsea’s lead when he pounced on Darren Fletcher’s mistake and struck a beautifully placed shot from the edge of the area across Butland and into the far corner.\n\nAlthough Fletcher should have pulled a goal back after the restart with a free header from Xherdan Shaqiri’s free-kick, there was always a sense that Chelsea had another gear. They found it when Tiémoué Bakayoko charged down Glen Johnson’s clearance and Morata scampered clear on the left. Leaving Fletcher in his wake, Morata showed wonderful composure as he delightfully lifted the ball into the corner with the angle against him.\n\nA tap-in from another Azpilicueta assist completed the rout and Morata’s hat-trick. “He’s a top-quality striker, clearly,” said Hughes."}, {"date": "23/09/2017", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20372, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City",

It was also Watford’s first league success at Swansea since 1983.\n\nSwansea substitute Tammy Abraham had earlier cancelled out Andre Gray’s first Watford goal to reward a better second-half showing from the hosts. But that only came after Clement had sent on Roque Mesa and Abraham at half-time and switched from playing three central defenders to a flat back four.\n\nOumar Niasse scores twice to give Everton victory over Bournemouth Read more\n\nWatford should have been ahead before Gray produced the first dividend since leaving Burnley last month in a deal believed to be worth up to £18.5m.\n\n“We played really poorly in the first half and I have to take responsibility for that because I chose the shape of the team,” Clement said.\n\n“I chose the lineup and it proved to be incorrect, and I think I did the right thing to make the changes at half-time in terms of the shape and personnel.\n\n“We took the initiative, had a lot more control of the game and got back in it. There looked like there was only one team who would go on and win it at that point. But in that position you must make sure you do not lose the game, and when I look back at their two goals they are gifts.”\n\nClement had praised his players after their goalless draw against Tottenham at Wembley last Saturday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andre Gray gives Watford the lead in the first half. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images\n\nBut he criticised them for the second consecutive home game after Richarlison punished Alfie Mawson’s timid tackle with a composed finish off the underside of the crossbar.\n\nAfter the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle, Clement said he found it difficult to “understand what he saw”. This time, he said Swansea had “only played for 40 minutes”.\n\n“I am very disappointed for the supporters, they have come here to see their side play three times at home and we have lost every game,” Clement said.\n\n“On reflection that was a 95-minute game, but we only played for 40 minutes. That is not good enough. It is supposed to be easier at home, but for some reason at the moment it is not. We played really well here at the end of last season.\n\nBurnley and Huddersfield in stalemate as Wood fails to shake off Schindler Read more\n\n“The crowd were disappointed with the first-half performance and I can understand that, I felt the same.”\n\nMarco Silva was delighted his Watford side had quickly put last Saturday’s 6-0 home defeat by Manchester City behind them.\n\n“It was a tough afternoon last week, but it’s in the past,” Silva said. “Our team showed they had forgotten what happened last Saturday, which was really important.\n\n“We wanted three really important points and we’ve got our third win away in the Premier League, which is very difficult for a team like Watford.\n\n“We started the game with some really nice football, we scored a goal and controlled the match well. But we needed to believe we could score the second to kill the match. If we’d have scored a second we could have been a bit more confident.”"}, {"date": "23/09/2017", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32004, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Maguire", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Onyinye Wilfred Ndidi", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [17], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [73], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Islam Slimani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vicente Iborra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Matches like this are what the Premier League does best, fast-paced blockbusters with breathtaking attacking and thigh-slapping clangers. Leicester and, especially, Liverpool are among the leading exponents of an intoxicating genre.\n\nJürgen Klopp’s men scored three splendid goals here but still needed Simon Mignolet to save a late penalty from Jamie Vardy to secure a much-needed win. Mignolet, almost inevitably, had conceded the penalty himself, rushing off his line in an attempt to intercept the ball, which he touched before clattering into Vardy. The goalkeeper also bore some blame for earlier goals by Vardy and Shinji Okazaki, even if he was not helped on those occasions by questionable refereeing.\n\nIn the end, however, Liverpool banked three points because their vibrancy going forward more than offset their problems at the rear, earning reward in the form of goals by Mohamed Salah, Philippe Coutinho and Jordan Henderson.\n\nRomelu Lukaku strike enough to give Manchester United win at Southampton Read more\n\nIt would be wrong to claim the German came into this game with many Liverpool supporters calling for his head, but it is true that a lot were questioning what goes through it. In particular, the failure to shore up a persistently leaky defence remained a vexing puzzle. After losing here in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday Klopp had said he was sick of conceding preventable goals. He would have been well advised to pack anti-nausea tablets this time, even though he was able to deploy his preferred centre-backs with Dejan Lovren and Joël Matip having regained fitness.\n\nThat duo, along with several other Liverpool players, could do with silencing a growing number of sceptics. They also had to subdue Vardy and Okazaki, who set about testing them early on. In the fifth minute Okazaki released his strike partner, who sprinted past Matip and into the box. Mignolet blocked his shot at the near post and, with Lovren hesitant, Riyad Mahrez pounced on the rebound but whacked the bouncing ball over from seven yards.\n\nThen Liverpool found their attacking groove. Coutinho and Salah, both thrumming dangerously, combined slickly to create their first chance, although Emre Can still had plenty to do. The German almost did it perfectly but his drive from 25 yards bounced off the base of a post. Salah swatted the rebound wide from close range but turned out to be offside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Simon Mignolet saves Jamie Vardy’s second-half penalty. Photograph: Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images\n\nSalah was sharper three minutes later when he opened the scoring. The Egyptian sneaked behind Ben Chilwell to meet a lovely cross by Coutinho and send a powerful header into the net from an acute angle. Kasper Schmeichel seemed to be taken by surprise.\n\nThe same could be said of Mignolet moments later when the Belgian goalkeeper, as too often, was caught dozing. As he took his sweet time to kick clear outside his area, Vardy darted in to dispossess him. The ball squirted out to Okazaki, whose attempt to fire into the net from 25 yards was deflected wide.\n\nAs if reminded that they would probably need to score more than once to win, Liverpool hurtled quickly down the other end. Alberto Moreno was tripped outside the area and Coutinho curled a sumptuous free-kick into the net. The Brazilian was excellent throughout, showing why Barcelona covet him and Liverpool cherish the 25-year-old.\n\nOumar Niasse scores twice to give Everton victory over Bournemouth Read more\n\nLeicester halved the deficit before half-time, with Liverpool complaining of injustice. First Matip was booked when Vardy went to ground, then Mahrez swung over a corner, which Mignolet came for and missed after interference by Okazaki. Joe Gomez, jostled by Harry Maguire, was unable to prevent Wilfred Ndidi’s header from bouncing off him and towards the net. Okazaki nudged the ball over the line despite being pulled back by Mignolet.\n\nThere are managers who in such situations would shut the game down to complete a 2-1 away win. Klopp is no such manager, at least not with these players. He can tweak his approach but really has only one setting: frenetic. So the spectacle remained thrilling, the outcome unknowable. “We would have loved to control it but it was a little hectic,” said Klopp of the period just after half-time.\n\nLeicester played their part well. The breakneck pace suited most of their players, too, but not Mahrez, who was mostly a drifter before being replaced by Demarai Gray. Matip blocked a shot by Vardy before, in the 68th minute, Liverpool broke fast to increase their lead. The substitute Daniel Sturridge unselfishly fed Henderson, who slotted past Schmeichel from the middle of the penalty area.\n\nStill Liverpool were not safe. Leicester hit back one minute later, Mignolet parrying a shot by Gray into the path of Vardy, who accepted the invitation to score.\n\nTwo minutes later Mignolet conceded the penalty. Vardy blasted it down the middle and the goalkeeper stood up to it to ensure the last laugh was his, this time."}, {"date": "17/09/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41478, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [52], "reds": [87], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}], "subs": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tiemoué Bakayoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}], "subs": [{"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ainsley Maitland-Niles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "By the time this contest erupted three minutes from time it is safe to assume both managers may actually have accepted the whole occasion fizzling out as a goalless non-event. Chelsea had been surprised by the visitors’ tenacity and refusal to wilt and had only generated the upbeat tempo that can set them apart in sporadic bursts. A point almost felt like a bonus. Arsenal, saddled with that wretched recent record both against the recent top six and here in particular, would have been delighted merely to check a five-match losing streak in this corner of the capital. A draw represented progress.\n\nYet, given the rather frazzled nature of the latter stages, this game was never likely to pass off entirely without incident. Frustration had been mounting all afternoon, with David Luiz and Sead Kolasinac’s duels increasingly spiky and played out all over the field. Alexis Sánchez’s introduction seemed to raise the locals’ hackles even more. Then, three minutes from time, the Brazilian centre-back became preoccupied trying to shield the loose ball from the Chilean as Sánchez grappled at him from behind. In darted Kolasinac to thump the ball in-field, with David Luiz, flustered, diving in and catching the Bosnian on the base of his left shin.\n\nAntonio Conte says Chelsea ‘need more luck’ with referees after latest red card Read more\n\nThe defender had already been booked earlier in the period, for an overhead kick that connected with Laurent Koscielny inside the Arsenal penalty area, but Michael Oliver flourished a straight red to spark a melee on the touchline. Antonio Conte led the protests, barking his fury at the official having strode, incensed, into Wenger’s technical area.\n\nThe Italian has already endured the absence of Gary Cahill for three games this term and Cesc Fàbregas for one, as ramifications of the chaotic opening day loss to Burnley. Now he will be without the linchpin of his defence for games against Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup, Stoke City and, most significantly, Manchester City at the end of a draining month.\n\nThe flashpoint provided the snarl at the end of the stalemate, leaving Chelsea’s head coach reflecting upon a disciplinary record of five red cards in his side’s last eight domestic matches, taking into account those shown to Pedro and Victor Moses in recent meetings with these opponents at Wembley. The more damning statistic is probably three dismissals in five Premier League games, the same number as in their previous 73 fixtures.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shkodran Mustafi (not pictured) puts the ball in the net for Arsenal, but the goal is disallowed for offside. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nConte described that as “strange” and spoke of a need to work on discipline and decision-making in the same way he makes his players address tactical or physical deficiencies, although he added there was a need, too, “to be more lucky with the refereeing decisions”. Had Oliver spotted Sánchez’s perceived fouls, he argued, then it might never have come to this. Even so, David Luiz should have known better.\n\nHis rush of blood did not cost Chelsea the point. Arsenal’s profligacy arguably cost them their chance to take all three, so dominant had the visitors been through most of the first half once they had survived Pedro’s burst unchecked on to Fàbregas’s pass. Petr Cech saved the visitors on that occasion but, from then on in, Granit Xhaka and Aaron Ramsey exerted a stranglehold on midfield that had not been in the pre-match script. Shkodran Mustafi was commanding at the heart of the visitors’ backline and Cech was inspired when required against his former club. There were times when Chelsea were crying out for the brawn of Diego Costa just to bully the Arsenal rearguard into submission. As impressive as Álvaro Morata has been, this was an education.\n\nArsenal should have forged ahead in that first half, when Tiémoué Bakayoko was still kicking his heels on the home bench and the visitors commanded the centre. Twice around the quarter-hour mark they sliced Chelsea apart down the champions’ left. First Alex Iwobi liberated the galloping Héctor Bellerín only for Danny Welbeck, who would later depart with a groin problem, to plant a header wide. Seconds later it was Ramsey who picked his moment cleverly to send Bellerín beyond Marcos Alonso to the byline, with Thibaut Courtois eventually smothering Alexandre Lacazette’s attempt to guide in a shot at the near post.\n\nArsenal’s desire epitomised by Shkodran Mustafi in well-deserved draw | David Hytner Read more\n\nBoth chances were impressively created and the fact they had been passed up felt wasteful. But it was another, squeezed out four minutes from half-time, which had those on the visitors’ bench cursing. Yet again it was Ramsey, revelling in central midfield, who cut Chelsea open, easing away from Fàbregas and then swerving beyond César Azpilicueta and David Luiz in the penalty area to poke a shot on to the far post. Courtois was helpless, Cahill caught on his heels, yet Lacazette’s awkward attempt to convert the rebound flew high and wide of a gaping goal.\n\nChelsea improved, at least, after the interval, with Bakayoko impressive in their midst and Eden Hazard offering a fine cameo from the bench, but Arsenal were steeled where, in previous years, they have obligingly succumbed. They thought they had finally prised apart the hosts when, 15 minutes from time, Xhaka’s free-kick was nodded home by Mustafi only for an offside flag to choke the celebrations.\n\nThis visit would not yield a first win here since 2011 but the visitors still departed encouraged. “With the attitude and determination, it was vital for us to come out with a solid performance,” Wenger said, memories of that thrashing at Liverpool still raw. “We did that.”"}, {"date": "17/09/2017", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75042, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David

He had heard his name sung and, before he disappeared into the tunnel, there was a little, polite wave of appreciation. Yet Rooney wore the look of a man whose return to Old Trafford had felt like an ordeal and he can never have imagined there would come a time when he would find himself in the away dressing room ruminating on what it is like to be in the relegation zone.\n\nThe paradox is that this was not always the fluent, dangerous Manchester United that has been seen in other parts in the new season and it felt slightly perplexing that José Mourinho described it as their best performance so far. Indeed, for a long part of the second half they had flirted with the idea of letting their opponents back into the match and there was clear evidence of how much they would miss the injured Paul Pogba.\n\nManchester United 4-0 Everton: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nUltimately, though, it turned into the third 4-0 win of their opening five league fixtures and another reminder of the team’s firepower. It is the first time United have won their opening three home games since the 2011-12 season and they are level with Manchester City at the top of the Premier League on identical records: 13 points, 15 goals scored, two conceded. Pep Guardiola’s team are top solely because their second name starts with a C rather than a U.\n\nEverton, in stark contrast, find themselves in the bottom three on the back of that late flurry of goals when Henrikh Mkhitaryan (83 minutes), Romelu Lukaku (89) and the substitute Anthony Martial (92) quadrupled the score and Rooney, chin in hands, watched forlornly from the dugout, having just been substituted.\n\nAntonio Valencia had opened the scoring, four minutes in, with a firecracker of a shot and these feel like difficult moments for Ronald Koeman and his players. Everton have now gone six games in all competitions without a victory, losing the last four with a combined score of 0-12, and have not won in the league since the opening weekend of the season. “Please be realistic,” Koeman said afterwards, taking issue with Mourinho’s reference to Everton being a club that had ambitions of a top-four finish. The reality, however, is that Everton’s supporters were entitled to expect more after an extensive period of summer recruitment.\n\nA lot of those fans had already left by the time Martial’s penalty, after a Morgan Schneiderlin handball, completed the scoring. They enjoyed that moment in the first half when Lukaku shot wide when it seemed certain he would score. Yet they also had to endure being shushed by their former striker after he had set up Mkhitaryan’s goal. Lukaku had been booed by the away end and, when he added the third goal, he made a beeline towards the Evertonians, cupping his ear as if to ask why the volume had suddenly gone down.\n\nAs for Rooney, he found it difficult early on to provide any evidence that he can still flourish at United’s level. He did, however, grow into the game and became a difficult opponent for Eric Bailly in particular. It needed David de Gea’s quick reactions to deny Rooney an equaliser early in the second half and it was something of a surprise that Koeman removed him in the 81st minute. At the risk of sounding slightly cruel it was a better performance than the crowd here became used to seeing from Rooney in recent seasons. Throughout the middle hour of the game there was not actually a great deal between the two teams. Yet Valencia’s goal was a beauty and it is difficult to think of any other time in his eight years at Old Trafford when he has struck a shot more powerfully. United’s captain was 20 yards from goal, aiming diagonally from close to the far corner of the penalty area, when Nemanja Matic’s crossfield pass curled his way and he let fly.\n\nThe noise of the crowd made it clear they had witnessed something special and the ball flashed past Jordan Pickford at the kind of speed that makes it harsh, perhaps, to question the goalkeeper. Even so, an argument could be made that the shot was central enough to be saved. Hypothetical, perhaps, but it is difficult to think De Gea would have been beaten that way.\n\nEven in a four-goal win De Gea showed again why he is so valuable with second-half saves from Rooney and Gylfi Sigurdsson. An equaliser would not have been implausible at that stage but it was still more likely that the home team would score next.\n\nMkhitaryan swept a low shot past Pickford to soothe the crowd’s nerves and Lukaku’s seventh goal in seven games for his new club came from close range in a crowded penalty area. Lukaku’s free-kick had bounced back off the defensive wall but Matic fired the loose ball back in and United’s £75m striker had dashed forward, anticipating the ball might come back his way.

This was meant to be a glorious homecoming, the son of a Croydon bus driver returning to his boyhood club and immediately kick-starting a recovery. Instead, it ended in Palace becoming the first club in top-flight history to lose their opening five league games without scoring and now feeling ever more uncertain of maintaining their status.\n\nThat may be an overly dire thing to suggest in mid-September but these are dire circumstances for Palace. They are rooted to the foot of the table and could well find themselves in that position come mid-October given their next three league fixtures are trips to the two Manchester clubs followed by a visit from Chelsea. Hence why this was viewed as a must-win fixture for the hosts, but they deservedly lost to a reinvigorated Southampton side and for Hodgson, stood in a downpour as the final whistle blew, the size of the task ahead of him became glaringly apparent.\n\nRoy Hodgson fears more pain ahead for Palace after disappointing homecoming Read more\n\nHaving replaced Frank de Boer following his 77-day tenure in charge of Palace, Hodgson could take some encouragement from the endeavour his side displayed. Their commitment was total and they would have grabbed at least a point following Steven Davis’s early goal had it not been for two stunning reaction saves by Fraser Forster. But overall there was a lack of quality and conviction from Palace, with Hodgson admitting that part of his task in the coming days and weeks is to restore confidence to his players. They appear to have none.\n\nFor the visitors this was a much-needed victory after their home defeat to Watford last week and one carved out of a display marked by assurance and togetherness. For Mauricio Pellegrino there was also the opportunity to introduce Virgil van Dijk as a late substitute following his failed attempt to leave the club and the warm applause the defender received from the travelling support suggested his attempted mutiny has been forgiven if not totally forgotten.\n\nPellegrino spoke of how his team had controlled the ball and while that was not quite the case – Southampton had marginally more possession than Palace – they rarely looked troubled after taking the lead.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Frustration for Roy Hodgson during the game. Photograph: Daniel Hambury/PA\n\nSix minutes had been played when Davis, making his 200th appearance for Southampton, slid a pass into the path of Dusan Tadic that he quickly redirected towards the six-yard box having manoeuvred past Palace’s left-back, Jeffrey Schlupp. Wayne Hennessey was able to parry the cross away but only as far as Davis who, having run forward, steered the ball into the far corner of the net from an unmarked position.\n\nThe goal, Southampton’s second from open play in the Premier League this season, sucked the life out of Selhurst Park and despair turned to agitation as the visitors began to dominate possession. Their passing was crisp and their use of the width of the pitch a concern for Palace, with Cédric Soares’s charging runs causing Schlupp regular problems.\n\nThe hosts, lined-up in a 4-4-1-1 formation that Hodgson has traditionally favoured, did not cave in. They tried hard to close down the opposition and once in possession moved the ball quickly, with no one standing out more than Ruben Loftus-Cheek who on his return from injury was deployed in a supporting role behind Christian Benteke and regularly troubled Southampton with his powerful and direct approach play.\n\nOn 29 minutes he hit a low drive that went just wide and shortly before that delivered a right-sided cross that led to the first of Forster’s eye-catching stops. The keeper looked beaten after Benteke fired at him from point-blank range but Forster managed to claw the ball away for a corner to much disbelief.\n\nSergio Agüero hat-trick puts rampant Manchester City top of the table Read more\n\nAfter 49 minutes Forster reacted quickly to prevent Jason Puncheon from equalising after he slid in and made strong contact with Schlupp’s low cross. Cue more disbelief.\n\nA Palace goal suddenly felt inevitable but from there their approach play again became disjointed, with their threat further neutered by Hodgson’s decision to replace Loftus-Cheek with Bakary Sako on 78 minutes. Boos rang out from the home support but, as the manager explained, the Chelsea loanee had to come off due to cramp.\n\nSouthampton saw the contest out relatively comfortably with Mario Lemina particularly impressing with his muscular presence in central midfield. By the time Van Dijk entered the fray on 86 minutes Palace knew the jig was up, with Joel Ward’s high and wide shot in stoppage time summing up the hosts waywardness and leading to an exodus of Palace fans, many chuntering with frustration as they departed.

ground to mark the 125th anniversary of Liverpool’s first ever game, against Rotherham Town, but there was precious little in the present to celebrate for Jürgen Klopp. “Fortune was not wearing a Liverpool shirt today,” their manager said. Fortune did not fashion a stalemate with Burnley either.\n\nSean Dyche’s team have clearly learned the lessons of a painful campaign on the road last season, when they took until 29 April to record their first win and suffered 14 away defeats. The experience of a second consecutive season in the top flight is showing in players who have taken five points from visits to Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea. The lessons the home side are learning in their second full season under Klopp are more difficult to ascertain.\n\nSergio Agüero hat-trick puts rampant Manchester City top of the table Read more\n\nNot for the first time, indeed for the second time in four days, Liverpool dominated on home soil but fell behind to a cheap goal conceded from their opponents’ first meaningful attack. They also produced 35 shots but Nick Pope, making the first Premier League start of his career was forced into mainly routine saves from distance as Liverpool’s winless run extended to three games in all competitions.\n\nAfter a 5-0 defeat at Manchester City and an avoidable Champions League draw with Sevilla, Klopp labelled this week the most frustrating of his Anfield reign “results-wise”. He added: “But, honestly, I am not like this as a person. My job is to see the performance and we reacted really well. We made seven changes and still played this type of football – no one should take this for granted. There were a lot of positive things although I don’t feel any positivity at the moment.”\n\nThe first act came as no surprise to the Anfield regulars. Liverpool controlled proceedings only to encounter stubborn resistance and creak under the first spell of pressure. When James Tarkowski swung a long ball out to the left wing the defence disintegrated. First Robbie Brady beat Trent Alexander-Arnold in the air. Both Liverpool centre-halves, Joël Matip and Ragnar Klavan, closed on Chris Wood for the second ball but neither prevented the towering striker nudging a slight touch towards the unmarked Scott Arfield. The forward steered a crisp finish inside Simon Mignolet’s right post to leave Klopp raging at his defenders from the sideline.\n\n“It was just a long ball,” he said. “We could have won the first header and the ball bounced in the wrong direction. Robbo [full-back Andrew Robertson] knows he should have seen Arfield quicker. They are better in these situations, they are more used to it. A good goal for them. We could have defended much better.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scott Arfield, centre, celebrates his goal to open the scoring for Burnley at Anfield. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images via Reuters\n\nDyche said Burnley deliberately targeted Alexander-Arnold in the air and while that tactic paid dividends they did not allow Liverpool a monopoly on weak defending against a long ball. Emre Can created a swift equaliser with a measured ball over the top from just inside his own half. Mohamed Salah read the delivery perfectly, unlike Stephen Ward and Ben Mee who backed off and allowed the Egypt international to control and steer a fine low finish beyond Pope.\n\nNormal service resumed thereafter. Liverpool continued to dominate and Burnley rediscovered their resilience to frustrate them. It was only in the final stages that Burnley attacked in numbers and late adventure almost edged them back in front. Brady stung Mignolet’s palms from 25 yards before, from two corners in quick succession by the Republic of Ireland international, Mee had two free headers at the back post. The defender’s first was headed off the line by Matip. His second was saved at close range by the Liverpool goalkeeper with Anfield enraged by a warning unheeded.\n\nJamaal Lascelles heads Newcastle United to win over Stoke City Read more\n\nKlopp introduced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Dominic Solanke in a concerted push for victory. The latter went close to obliging when he volleyed against the bar from close range after Alexander-Arnold’s cross deflected into his path. Klopp claimed a penalty for a challenge on Salah in the build-up to Solanke’s chance while Dyche credited Pope with a vital save. Both were stretching it.\n\n“Our plan was to keep them from our goal,” Dyche said. “It is much harder to score from 30 yards than six and we did that well other than their goal.\n\n“We got caught on a long ball, the irony of that. They made seven changes, players who have been brought in for absolute fortunes, players on the bench who have come in for £35m. The challenge we have as managers is we are judged exactly the same but the playing field is not level. But I don’t want to make too much of a big deal because I believe in my players, however much they cost.”"}, {"date": "16/09/2017", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51795,

afternoon for a convalescent to be outdoors but nonetheless it seemed to do Rafael Benítez a power of good.\n\nA fortnight after undergoing surgery to clear infection from the site of an old hernia repair, Newcastle United’s manager walked gingerly into the dugout but departed with a spring in his step.\n\nLiverpool frustrated by missed chances after Burnley hold on for draw Read more\n\nWith excellent performances from Christian Atsu, Matt Ritchie and Jamaal Lascelles possibly proving more restorative than a week at a health farm, Benítez was left to celebrate his side’s third straight Premier League win. Maybe, just maybe, the Tynesiders are not quite as weak as he had feared.\n\n“We deserved to win,” said Benítez who watched his team rise to fourth on a day when Joselu missed three good chances. “I’m really pleased with our togetherness, work rate, character and connection with the fans. There’s a lot of positives but we also have things to correct. There’s plenty of room for improvement.”\n\nAfter spending the transfer window forlornly imploring Mike Ashley to fortify his squad Benítez seems to have called a truce with Newcastle’s owner but is necessarily adopting pragmatic tactics. Often sitting back and permitting Stoke a degree of possession before catching them out on the counterattack, this was a Newcastle win crafted on the training ground. Heavily dependent on elbow grease and meticulous organisation, it seemed a testament to the thoroughness of Benítez’s preparation.\n\nTypically, he included a spot of rotation with perhaps the most notable alteration from the side who won at Swansea in his absence last Sunday featuring the much improved Atsu’s reintroduction on the left wing.\n\nBy the 19th minute it looked a particularly inspired switch as he connected with Ritchie’s gorgeously curling cross, extending his left foot to volley Newcastle ahead from close range.\n\nAll scorching change of pace and excellent positional sense, Atsu at times ripped apart Mark Hughes’s imposing three man backline at the seams and the scoreline would surely have been more decisive had Joselu taken proper advantage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rafa Benítez, left, and Mark Hughes get animated on the touchline. Photograph: Ian MacNicol/Getty Images\n\nNewcastle’s £5m buy from Stoke – who says he departed the Potteries because Hughes did not “trust” him – looked suitably dejected after his three misses. The last opening saw the one time Real Madrid striker steer the ball well over the bar after being sent clean through by another Atsu delivery; perhaps he was simply trying too hard to prove a point to his former manager.\n\nAt least Joselu put his heart and soul into battling Stoke’s defence. How Hughes must have wished the same could be said of the much vaunted Jesé, who proved particularly disappointing.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri, too, had looked somewhat off the pace until, finally granted a yard of space, the Swiss playmaker met Joe Allen’s pass and directed a fine, left foot, 20-yard shot into the bottom corner. It was a characteristically classy finish but Rob Elliot, a goalkeeper Benítez had hoped to replace, appeared crestfallen at his failure to divert it.\n\nHappily, Elliot soon showed off his ability, performing wonders to keep out Mame Biram Diouf’s header. It seemed a watershed moment as, shortly afterwards, Newcastle felt they should have had a penalty when Kurt Zouma appeared to trip Atsu.\n\nSteven Davis spoils Roy Hodgson’s big day as Crystal Palace lose again Read more\n\nAlthough replays from a certain angle suggested the defender won the ball, a sense of righteous indignation fuelled Benítez’s players. Making the most of the resultant surge of attacking momentum they restored their lead when Lascelles – another player improving in leaps and bounds – met Ritchie’s clever corner and, having soared above all-comers, powered a header in off the bar and beyond Jack Butland.\n\nEric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Diouf spurned decent opportunities but Hughes was not fooled. “Our loose passing played into Newcastle’s hands,” the Stoke manager said. “We didn’t play particularly well.”"}, {"date": "16/09/2017", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20305, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup":

Watford, watched by Elton John and unbeaten before Pep Guardiola’s men rocked up here, fancied their chances but were blown away by a three-goal salvo before half-time.\n\nCity did not relent and struck the same number again in the second half, bringing their tally to 15 goals from their past three matches, this demonstration of their attacking power coming after the demolitions of Liverpool and Feyenoord.\n\nPep Guardiola: ‘We are doing many things now that we didn’t do last season’ Read more\n\nCity settled the contest in the first half thanks to a three-goal salvo in 10 minutes. Sergio Agüero scored twice and created one for Gabriel Jesus. Nicolás Otamendi added a fourth after the interval with a close-range header. Then Agüero rounded off his hat-trick, which is why he was happy to let Raheem Sterling take the penalty when the winger was fouled a minute from time. Sterling expressed his gratitude by finishing with the ruthlessness he sometimes lacks.\n\nWatford had come into the game on the back of three successive clean sheets in the Premier League but with their first-choice centre-backs still out injured extending that sequence to four was always going to be a tall order against one of Europe’s most awesome attacking forces.\n\nGuardiola made one alteration to the City lineup that had started the midweek dismantling of Feyenoord in the Champions League, with Sterling replacing Bernardo Silva. It took him 20 seconds to make an impact as Sterling skittered down the right and delivered a low cross to David Silva. Adrian Mariappa blocked the Spaniard’s close-range shot, but the storm was never going to abate.\n\nDavid Silva and Kevin De Bruyne orchestrated City’s relentless assaults. Benjamin Mendy thrashed a 20-yard shot just over the bar before, in the 10th minute, David Silva swept a diagonal pass over to De Bruyne, who cushioned the ball into the path of Sterling. However, the England winger mis-hit his shot from 10 yards. That was the only stain on an otherwise sparkling display by Sterling.\n\nDe Bruyne and Agüero went close with shots from outside the area as Watford were corralled deep into their own half. Yet in the 24th minute the hosts almost took a surprise lead from their first venture forward, Richarlison meeting a free-kick by José Holebas and heading a yard wide.\n\nAgüero soon showed the Brazilian how it should be done. In the 27th minute, after Tom Cleverley was penalised near halfway for a foul on John Stones, De Bruyne flighted in the free-kick and Agüero headed past Heurelho Gomes, much to the annoyance of Marco Silva, the Watford manager appealing vigorously for offside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gabriel Jesus scores his side’s third goal past the Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes. Photograph: Dan Mullan/Getty Images\n\nThe rain was hurtling down and the sky soon fell in on Watford. Agüero scored his second four minutes later, tapping into the net from four yards after excellent work on the left by Jesus and a feeble attempt by Gomes to cut out David Silva’s cross.\n\nAgüero then became the supplier, running at Watford’s frazzled defence before slipping a pass through to Jesus, who fired into the bottom corner of the net from 10 yards.\n\nWatford were inferior, no doubt about that, but never submissive. They rebelled quite strongly at the start of the second half and even had Ederson in the City goal worried for a moment, André Carrillo cracking a fine volley a couple of yards wide from the right-hand corner of the box.\n\nThen Agüero resumed his quest for his hat-trick, twice shooting wide after being fed by Mendy. On the hour the Argentinian was thwarted by Gomes, who batted a crisp shot over the bar. The resultant corner led to City’s fourth goal, Otamendi heading home a cross by David Silva.\n\nTottenham suffer more Wembley frustration after Swansea hold firm Read more\n\nNine minutes from time Agüero finally completed his treble. And with brio, too. After a fine run and pass by Kyle Walker, the striker burst past Christian Kabasele and guided a low shot beyond the reach of the advancing Gomes.\n\nAnother tricky run by Sterling provoked a foul in the box in the 89th minute. The winger picked himself up, consulted with Agüero and rifled the ball into the net from the penalty spot.\n\nCity, then, surpassed the 5-0 defeat they inflicted on Walter Mazzarri’s Watford back in May. Under Silva they are much better and went into this game knowing that a win would send them to the top of English football for the first time since 1982-83.

supporters sometimes wonder if life might be more thrilling without Tony Pulis in the dugout.\n\nLoud boos greeted that minor show of mutiny when the final whistle put everyone out of their misery, and it hardly reflected well on West Brom that Hal Robson-Kanu’s tame header was one of their better openings on an afternoon when Gareth Barry equalling Ryan Giggs’s record of 632 Premier League appearances stood out as a memorable talking point. It is doubtful Barry has played in a duller game.\n\nGareth Barry’s remarkable career continues to push the boundaries Read more\n\nAt least West Ham United were reasonably satisfied with a goalless draw, albeit frustrated not to have capitalised on West Brom’s lack of ambition. While the visitors did not create much either, Slaven Bilic could point to a second consecutive clean sheet as evidence he knows what he is doing after weeks of speculation about his future.\n\n“It hasn’t been a great game of football, but we limited them,” Bilic said. “To get more, the quality in the last third was missing. But a clean sheet and a point away, you can’t be too negative. We won’t be raving about this game, but this week has been good.”\n\nBilic stuck with the players who ground out that ugly win over Huddersfield on Monday, using a tight 3-4-3 system that suited West Ham’s slow defence. The pressure on Bilic has forced him to be more pragmatic, but his willingness to defend in large numbers against opponents as unadventurous as West Brom created a grim spectacle. “You’re best off talking about Gareth,” Pulis said.\n\nNeither team treated the ball with sufficient care, mustering one shot on target apiece. West Brom had an early chance after Pedro Obiang’s slip allowed Chris Brunt to wriggle clear on the right, only for Winston Reid to throw himself in front of Kieran Gibbs’s goalbound volley. Barry headed just over from the corner.\n\nYet the hosts were cautious after last week’s defeat at Brighton, leaving Jay Rodriguez isolated up front. It was a shapeless mess and, for all their commitment, West Ham missed Manuel Lanzini’s creativity. Their unbalanced attack relied too much on isolated bursts from Michail Antonio, Javier Hernández toiled in an unfamiliar wide role, and there were too many long balls to Andy Carroll. Their best moment came out of the blue, Obiang hitting the bar with an audacious attempt to catch Ben Foster off his line from long range.\n\nBilic responded positively when James Collins went off with an ankle injury in the second half, replacing the centre-back with Marko Arnautovic, and West Ham provided a rare spot of excitement when Carroll’s flick sent Hernández through. Foster hurtled out of his area and tripped the Mexican. With two West Brom defenders covering the goalkeeper, though, it was a yellow card and the free-kick came to nothing, much like the game as a whole."}, {"date": "16/09/2017", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 65366, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Foyth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike van der Hoorn", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Renato Sanches", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tammy Abraham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roque Mesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The intense frustration for Tottenham is that, however anybody dresses it up, this was such a step backwards. Their disposal of Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, effected so clinically, was supposed to have shaken off all that talk of a Wembley jinx; it certainly looked the perfect platform for a routine evening against Swansea City, but once again they laboured at their temporary home and the familiar doubts returned as quickly as they had evaporated.\n\nA dogged Swansea were worthy of their point despite failing, for the third time this season, to have a shot on target. They were rarely pulled apart, only wobbling to any considerable extent during a period midway through the second half in which Harry Kane struck the crossbar. By then Tottenham’s pressure had reached siege levels; the goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski played his part in keeping them out but the zest and clarity that marked Spurs’ form at White Hart Lane last season simply have yet to appear here in the Premier League.\n\nSergio Agüero hat-trick puts rampant Manchester City top of the table Read more\n\nMauricio Pochettino has long since tired of questions about Spurs’ domestic setup but had to go through it all again and could not dispel the suspicion that all the talk risks becoming self-fulfilling. “I think it’s a good talking point [for you], but Dortmund was at Wembley too,” he said. “What can we do? We need to play here and we need to make Wembley home. We need to move on, it’s so important, because if not then we are in the past.”\n\nIt hardly helped that a largely subdued atmosphere bore little relation to their previous abode at its throbbing best, although Pochettino’s team offered little excitement during the opening period. He had freshened up his starting lineup with Kieran Trippier, Moussa Sissoko and Dele Alli, moving Son Heung-min to left wing-back for the first half, but the effect had that wearyingly disjointed post-Champions League feel.\n\nAlli, in particular, found it difficult to find space between Swansea’s two compact banks of three and struggled to move the ball quickly enough when gaps did appear; Son and Kane drew smart saves from Fabianski but Spurs’ approach play was ponderous and telegraphed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lukasz Fabianski tips another Spurs effort over his crossbar. Photograph: Steve Bardens/Getty Images\n\nThey emerged for the second half with brisker pace and a more cogent shape. Kane should have scored midway through when Sissoko, retrieving possession after another sharp Fabianski save from Son, teed him up eight yards out but his first-time effort shuddered the frame. Fabianski made his best stop shortly afterwards, flipping Kane’s near-post header over the bar, but what looked likely to be a wild last 20 minutes for the away side turned into mere speculation on Tottenham’s part. The introduction of Fernando Llorente, making his league debut against the club that sold him, promised a storyline but served only to detract almost instantly from their cohesion.\n\n“I’m disappointed with the result because I think we deserved more,” Pochettino said. “We created a lot of chances, didn’t concede a shot on target and the performance was good. I’m not worried; playing that way we’ll win a lot of games.”\n\nPhilippe Coutinho left frustrated on Liverpool return against Burnley Read more\n\nPochettino was irked by what he saw as overcompensation from the referee, Mike Dean, in his efforts to explain the non-awarding of two penalties to Tottenham, notably when Martin Olsson appeared to handle a Trippier cross shortly before Kane’s chance. They seemed to have a case with that one; it was hard, though, to begrudge Swansea a stroke of fortune.\n\nSwansea’s point pleased Paul Clement, who had been concerned by what he called a “complacent” performance in last Sunday’s defeat by Newcastle. They offered next to nothing going forwards bar a first-half glimmer when Tammy Abraham, leading the line with maturity, created an opening for Tom Carroll that Sissoko quickly snuffed out. Three away games have brought three clean sheets; it is the kind of foundation on which successful battles against the drop are built.\n\n“Good defending should be applauded,” Clement said. “Clearly we want to attack better and have a little bit more control but we also have to be realistic.” His tough, well-drilled team had achieved an outcome in line with their ambitions; Tottenham’s struggle to do the same in these opulent, slightly jarring surroundings will drag on to Bournemouth’s visit a month from now."}, {"date": "15/09/2017", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10369,

years with his first goal for the club since 2001, when the England international was a teenager, his manager was a team-mate and the thought of winning Premier League matches was a long way from anyone’s mind.\n\nDefoe, Bournemouth and Howe have come a long way since those days, when they were knocking around in the third tier, yet they badly needed this victory to ease the tension that was creeping into these parts after four successive league defeats. For a brief period it looked as though that sequence would be extended to five after Solly March headed Brighton & Hove Albion in front early in the second half but two goals in six minutes turned the game on its head.\n\nPremier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend Read more\n\nDefoe and Andrew Surman were the scorers but it was Jordon Ibe who provided the most influential contribution by coming off the bench to set up both goals at a time when Bournemouth were crying out for some craft and guile to break down a resolute Brighton defence. Remarkably Ibe never had an assist to his name in his previous 28 Premier League appearances for Bournemouth – a statistic that spells out just what a struggle it has been for him since moving south from Liverpool for £15m last year.\n\nNot that a lack of confidence appeared to be a problem when he came on midway through the second half. It was an exquisite backheel that set Surman free for the midfielder’s first Premier League goal for the club and a wonderfully weighted pass that released Defoe for the second to bring a smile to Howe’s face after a testing few weeks.\n\n“I’m very relieved,” the Bournemouth manager said. “I think that is the emotion. It is pure relief for everyone connected with the club. At the start of the season you’re desperate to hit the ground running and get off to a good start – that hasn’t happened. We had to dig really deep tonight, that was a real test for us and thankfully the players came through it.\n\n“It would have been easy to go under. I think that’s the most impressive thing about tonight’s win – we did it the hard way. We went 1-0 down and I’m sure the players were looking at each other and thinking: ’How are we going to respond here?’ Full credit to them and it maybe took Jordon’s cameo to spark that revival.”\n\nUp until that point Bournemouth had rarely looked like scoring as they ran out of ideas as to how to find a way through the massed ranks of yellow shirts that were content to sit deep and frustrate their opponents. Too many passes went sideways rather than forwards until Ibe’s introduction gave Bournemouth a new dimension.\n\n“Jordon showed real quality in the final third,” said Howe. “His backheel was a moment of magic – that was the first time we really opened Brighton up – and then the weight of pass was so good for Jermain. Full credit to him for his impact. He’s a player of immense promise. I feel the same as a lot of other people I’m sure, that you underestimate how young he is because it feels he’s been around a long time. But I think he’s come back a better player than he was last season. Hopefully this is the start of a real lift for him.”\n\nChris Hughton admitted that he thought his Brighton side would go on and win the game when March converted a superb cross from Pascal Gross, who has been involved in all four of their goals this season. That breakthrough had been coming after a spell of Brighton pressure in which Surman cleared two headers off the line, from Shane Duffy and Davy Pröpper, and Dale Stephens nodded another chance against the crossbar.\n\nBournemouth v Brighton: Premier League – as it happened ! Read more\n\nOn top and in front, Brighton were in command for a spell but unable to see the game through. “You’ve got to be resilient right until the end,” said Hughton, who hopes that the knee injury Gross picked up late in the second half is not serious. “I thought we defended really well for large periods but the two times we didn’t was on their goals and that’s a tough lesson for us.”\n\nIndeed from the moment that Ibe’s pass ran into Defoe’s path there was a sense of inevitably about what would follow. “He’s one of the best finishers I’ve ever seen,” Howe said. “The disappointing thing for us this season is that we haven’t created enough chances for him. That was the first real chance that he got and he took it.”"}, {"date": "11/09/2017", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [72], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Byram", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philip Billing", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Elias Kachunga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Tom Ince", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rajiv van La Parra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Scott Malone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdelhamid Sabiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Hefele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Second-half goals from Pedro Obiang and André Ayew sealed West Ham’s first win of the season and alleviated the pressure on Slaven Bilic. The West Ham manager admitted the sacking of Frank de Boer by Crystal Palace earlier on Monday had been “in the back of my mind” before the match.\n\nOn the night, West Ham United did not look like a team of experienced, expensively recruited players. Their style was disjointed, their shape questionable. But in terms of fight and determination, Slaven Bilic’s side gave their all in the sort of performance you might associate with a far less glamorous side – a Huddersfield Town perhaps. In the end it was enough to take three points.\n\nA deflected strike from Pedro Obiang was followed by André Ayew’s six-yard finish as West Ham cracked open a tightly contested encounter in the final 20 minutes. The Huddersfield manager, David Wagner, was disappointed in his team, who were organised in defence but rarely threatened going forward.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read more\n\nWest Ham’s manager, meanwhile, was delighted. The game was scrappy and lacked quality but his team’s performance offered up half a dozen decent chances. On Bilic’s 49th birthday and after three consecutive demoralising defeats, this was a welcome gift.\n\n“They gave everything,” Bilic said. “It was a top performance from us, not in the sense we played beautiful football but in other aspects. Determination in executing the game plan, in stopping them from doing anything.\n\n“I’m 49 and I’ve been in serious football for 31 years,” Bilic added.\n\n“I know how it goes, especially today, and I’m not going to lie, [De Boer] was in the back of my mind. But I’ve come to the zone where I don’t care about that. I care about the team. I saw my team really focus, not just today but yesterday, the day before.”\n\n“It was a deserved defeat,” Wagner said. “Defensively we were OK, we were aware of the direct style. We got the flicks, we were good on the second balls but football is also an offensive game and offensively we weren’t good enough. We made so many unforced errors, bad decisions. It makes totally no sense to play without bravery and confidence especially after what the boys have done in the past. We haven’t shown what we are capable of.”\n\nWagner’s criticisms could have been equally applicable to the hosts. West Ham were making their first home appearance of the season and had adopted a new formation. Bilic, acting to plug the leaks that had led to his team accruing a goal difference of minus eight, had shifted to a back three, with James Collins returning to the team. Up front there was room for both Javier Hernández and Andy Carroll, the England striker making his first start in five months.\n\nWith Michail Antonio also in attack it was an unfamiliar and often uncertain formation, one held together by individual gumption. That said, it created chances and West Ham could have been ahead after only two minutes. A floated cross from the right found Carroll at the back post. Instead of heading, however, he opted to drop off his man and took the ball on his chest. Carroll then flashed the ball across goal but a sliding Cheikhou Kouyaté could not turn it over the line even from inches away.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pedro Obiang’s shot deflects off Huddersfield defender Mathias Jorgensen and loops into the net. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTen minutes later and another clear opportunity came the home side’s way. This time it was all of Antonio’s making as he powered past Chris Löwe and again managed to cut the ball back across the box. This time the cross skewed to Hernández but the Mexican poacher crashed his shot off the bar.\n\nWith five minutes of the half remaining, they crafted another opportunity, Carroll forcing Mathias Jorgensen into a weak clearing header only for Kouyaté, standing on the penalty spot, to make a complete hash of his shot.\n\nFor all that Wagner was down on his team for a lack of assertiveness, Huddersfield began to come into the game in the second half. They started to throw more numbers forward. Philip Billing forced Joe Hart into his first save in the 54th minute. On the hour they eked out their first corner.\n\nAt the other end West Ham were starting to look ragged. Hernández in particular was struggling in an unusual position at inside-forward. He was trying his best and twice tried to slide in the hard running Antonio but neither opening resulted in a shot. With 25 minutes remaining he was removed in favour of Ayew and it turned out to be the spark that changed the game.\n\nIn the 72nd minute the Ghana forward found Obiang just outside the penalty box. The midfielder unleashed a fierce, left-foot shot which hit Jorgensen, who had turned his back on it, and was deflected well over his goalkeeper Jonas Lössl and into the net. Five minutes later Ayew was on hand to force home another Aaron Cresswell corner. The relief in the stadium was palpable. Bilic jumped up and down like a birthday boy about to unwrap his presents.\n\nAfter victory was sealed, Bilic sought to clarify remarks he had made about his chairman, David Sullivan, who had claimed the Croat had turned down the chance to sign Renato Sanches and Grzegorz Krychowiak.\n\nWest Ham United 2-0 Huddersfield Town: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“I’ve said some things. I said them and I wasn’t drunk,” Bilic said.\n\n“I said nothing bad about the chairman, on the contrary I said we’d done good business. I defended him and just wanted to clear the situation with Sanches and Krychowiak. I didn’t want those players.”\n\nBilic added that, after a troubled year, the London Stadium was starting to feel like home. “We couldn’t wait to play here again,” he said. “This is the situation now. It will never be Upton Park but it doesn’t mean it can’t be our home. I really have a feeling and I see the players that we like it more and more here. That can only come with good results and good individual performances.” He achieved the former in this match, at least."}, {"date": "10/09/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 18862, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [36]}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [36], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timothy Fosu-Mensah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}], "subs": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luka Milivojevic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sullay Kaikai", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jairo Riedewald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Levi Lumeka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A manager on the brink rarely speaks optimistically of the future but Crystal Palace hired Frank de Boer to be different. He responded to what may yet prove his last game in charge by casting his thoughts forward. A man who displayed great on-field eloquence in his playing days, courtesy of his wonderful left foot, showed another kind in a reaction to a fourth consecutive league defeat. The result seemed to render his own position more precarious. He insisted the display did not.\n\n“I am not disappointed about the performance and it gives me a lot of hope for the future,” the Dutchman insisted, though it remains a moot point if his own is at Selhurst Park. A manager who has failed to beat Huddersfield, Liverpool, Swansea and now Burnley is in a private battle with himself. He lasted 85 days at Internazionale. He is up to 76 at Palace now.\n\nJosé Mourinho refuses Mark Hughes handshake after believing he was sworn at Read more\n\nDe Boer’s afternoon at Turf Moor was bookended by displays of schadenfreude, taunts that he would be “sacked in the morning” following both Burnley’s third-minute winner and the final whistle. If so, the newly-hired sporting director, Dougie Freedman, would step in while they looked for an 11th permanent manager since 2010. De Boer himself shrugged off suggestions he had been given an ultimatum: win at Burnley or else. His June appointment was described by the chairman Steve Parish as an “amazing milestone”. He is charged with determining if the Dutchman, four league games into a three-year contract, is now a millstone.\n\n“They have to decide,” De Boer said. “When I’m still the manager of Palace, I will give 100%. I just focus on what I can do. We are still with the project and we know where we come from and what we want to achieve. I’m convinced we are going to achieve it.” He was recruited to implement change and it is undeniable he has had an impact. The Eagles have made their worst start to a season for 92 years and stand alone among the 92 Premier and Football League clubs: everyone else has mustered at least one league goal.\n\n“The only thing we didn’t do was score,” the former Ajax manager rued, his irritation increased by the knowledge Palace had furnished Burnley with the decider. The London club have reached a statistical low in his tenure, but other numbers offered him encouragement: they had 23 attempts at goal. Burnley had four.\n\n“I will sign for this every game if we create that amount of chances against any opponent,” De Boer said. “This is what I want to see from any team I manage. We played with courage. That gives me a lot of hope. It was quite dynamic.”\n\nPlay Video 0:42 De Boer: 'I'm focussing on what i can control' –video\n\nThat might be stretching it. Palace had 65% of possession but much of it came under the category of sterile domination. Yet it was conceivable that the centre-back Scott Dann could have had a hat-trick. “They had two fantastic chances, especially Dann’s header at the end,” the Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, said.\n\nDann headed wide, though, and he had been denied by twin goal-line clearances from Matthew Lowton and the excellent James Tarkowski. Christian Benteke had other opportunities. His radar was for once awry. When it functioned correctly, he met unexpected obduracy in the shape of Burnley’s reserve goalkeeper Nick Pope. Yet the damning element for Palace was that they rarely troubled a Premier League debutant.\n\n“Technically, a fantastic save,” Dyche said after the deputy was summoned when Tom Heaton landed awkwardly catching a cross. The England goalkeeper has a suspected dislocated shoulder. “If it is, it is not weeks [out], more like months,” Dyche said. He had “empathy, not sympathy” with De Boer, seeking out his counterpart for a consoling word.\n\n“I thought they were the better side,” he said. “I told him so. They were very good. They played with more freedom.” He attributed that to De Boer’s decision to jettison his favoured 3-4-3 formation for a more familiar 4-3-3.\n\nA winner could afford to be magnanimous. While Palace wrestle with an identity crisis, Burnley know who they are and what they have to do. “We had to fight for every inch,” Dyche said. But a goal came gift-wrapped. Criticised for sideways passing under De Boer, Palace were quick to supply a defence-splitting ball. Sadly for the recalled Lee Chung-yong, the defence he bisected was his own. Brought in to supply Benteke, he instead picked out Chris Wood with a misguided attempt to find the goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey. Burnley’s record signing provided an assured finish to vindicate Dyche, who promoted the £15m forward, the scorer of a late leveller against Tottenham last time out, to the starting 11.\n\n“We gave a very sloppy goal away,” said De Boer. If it suggested his players were eager to hasten his exit, they responded. “We showed spirit,” he said. Yet if Palace are pointless, goalless and possibly luckless and he may soon be jobless, Burnley are buoyant.\n\nThey had already beaten Chelsea and drawn with Tottenham. More capital gains capped their profitable start to the season while Palace’s losses are mounting.

Swansea were desperately poor in so many areas and the goal they conceded to lose the game, when Lascelles was granted the freedom of the Swansea penalty area to score with a powerful header, summed up the home team’s afternoon. They were toothless up front, desperately short of creativity and guile in midfield and gave the ball away on far too many occasions.\n\nRenato Sanches, the invisible wonderkid, goes from celebrity to the Liberty | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nNewcastle, in contrast, executed their game-plan perfectly, aided throughout by Benítez’s open telephone line to his backroom staff. Although Lascelles made a superb goal-line clearance to deny Tammy Abraham in the second half, Newcastle generally looked comfortable. They restricted Swansea to few goalscoring opportunities and would have taken the lead earlier but for Lukasz Fabianski producing a wonderful fingertip save to keep out Joselu’s header.\n\nFor Benítez, the outcome was just what the doctor ordered. “After the game Rafa rang, he has congratulated everybody, especially the players because they have done a massive job,” said Miguel Moreno, the assistant manager. “We are very glad because we planned the game in a way to win three points, we didn’t risk anything with Rafa’s health and we also did the job.”\n\nThe match was nothing like as enjoyable for Paul Clement. Swansea’s head coach sounded baffled, frustrated and annoyed by the way his team had played. “I’m finding it difficult to understand why I saw what I saw,” he said. “Although the margin of defeat is very small, ultimately decided by a set-play, for me the difference in the two teams in the performance was much greater than that.\n\n“We made too many mistakes, we gave the ball away too often. Even right up to the end, where we did continue to push, we couldn’t get a decent ball into the box. That wasn’t good enough. Our shape didn’t cause them enough problems. We got the overload in midfield but we never got control of the game. Some of the basics we never got right, just that competitiveness.\n\n“I said to the players in the dressing room, there’s all the make-believe stuff, what’s written on the paper and how we think it’s going to go, and then there’s the reality of what actually happens in the game. I think we missed an opportunity there today, I really do. They’re a good, well-organised side but we should have done better, there’s no question about that.”\n\nPonderous and pedestrian in possession, Swansea only cut through Newcastle on one occasion, when Leroy Fer released Abraham on the hour. One‑on‑one with Rob Elliot, the striker rounded the Newcastle goalkeeper but looked on in despair as Lascelles, covering brilliantly, made a sliding intervention to clear the ball behind.\n\nThe Newcastle captain then made another huge contribution at the other end when he darted into the Swansea area to meet Matt Ritchie’s corner with a header that exposed some abject defending. It is the second time this season that Swansea have conceded in that fashion although Clement, pointing to their excellent record when defending set-pieces last season, refused to accept that the zonal‑marking system is to blame. “Something is obviously not right on this in the details of how we defended and that’s what we’ve got to get right,” he said.\n\nWilfried Bony, another deadline-day signing, had replaced Sanches by that stage but starved of service, the Ivorian had little chance to make an impact on the game as Swansea ran out of ideas. “I said to the players, there is no crisis,” Clement said. “We’ve not played well and we’ve lost the game. It’s very early on, we’ve got new faces who need to be integrated as soon as possible. But, at the same time, we’ve got to wake up quickly.”"}, {"date": "09/09/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54172, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [6], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Mendy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45, 53], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77, 90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Foden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Trent Alexander-Arnold", "yellows": [19], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Matip", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ragnar Klavan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Salah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [37], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Solanke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "By the time this game had finished Ederson, Manchester City’s goalkeeper, had just reappeared from the x-ray suite at the clinic where he had been taken to check his cheekbone and jaw were still in working order. Ederson had been caught flush in the face, head-high, by Sadio Mané’s flying studs and the red card that was shown to the Liverpool player does at least offer his team some kind of excuse for this score.\n\nNot entirely, though. There is a way of playing with 10 men and this was absolutely not it. Liverpool’s response to Mané’s dismissal did not offer great encouragement about their competitive courage and, not for the first time, it was difficult to imagine how Jürgen Klopp can achieve his ambitions if his side are going to defend this generously. Liverpool crumbled far too easily and once City sense weakness they can be merciless opponents. It was the first time City have scored four, or more, past the team from Anfield since 1937 – and Liverpool’s heaviest defeat in Manchester for 70 years.\n\nManchester City 5-0 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nCity were already winning, courtesy of Sergio Agüero, by the time the referee, Jon Moss, decided that Mané’s collision with Ederson 25 yards from goal constituted an automatic sending-off eight minutes before half-time. Gabriel Jesus headed in a second in the time added on at the end of the first half and when the same player made it 3-0 early in the second half it was almost a surprise City restricted themselves to two more. Leroy Sané, one of their second-half substitutes, scored them both and Ederson had just arrived back in the stadium to see the final one – the game’s outstanding moment – fly into the top corner.\n\nThis was certainly not the way Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, a substitute, must have imagined his Liverpool debut going and the punishment for Mané will be considerable, with a three-match ban to follow. Will Liverpool appeal? Possibly, but it is unlikely that the decision will be overturned. These matters are not decided on whether or not it was intentional. Klopp’s reaction was that it would be “another waste of time”.\n\nKevin De Bruyne’s perfect touch delights Pep Guardiola and keeps Silvas at bay | Sachin Nakrani Read more\n\nAs red cards go this one will polarise opinion. Mané’s sympathisers will argue that he was entitled to go for the ball and that, as Guardiola conceded, it was an accidental collision. Equally, the attacker’s studs were way off the ground if the argument is whether it constituted dangerous play. All that can really be said for certain is that it poleaxed Ederson and left a clutch of City players frantically waving for medical assistance. The goalkeeper had taken an almighty whack, requiring eight minutes of intensive treatment, and it was lamentable that some Liverpool fans seemed to hold him responsible, booing as the stretcher bearers prepared to take him off.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sadio Mané catches Ederson in the face, resulting in a red card for the Liverpool player. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters\n\nA goal behind and a man down, it was always going to be a challenging and potentially treacherous afternoon for Liverpool from that point. Even so, it was startling to see the way they capitulated. Klopp’s team seemed unsettled, to say the least, as soon as play restarted. They had little or no idea about what was required for a side in that position and, unfortunately for them, they were not playing a team that was going to exhibit any form of pity.\n\nA linesman’s flag saved the visitors, two minutes into first-half stoppage time, when Kevin De Bruyne crossed from the right and Jesus sent a header past Simon Mignolet. The next time De Bruyne picked out the Brazilian, this time from the left, he was onside and unmarked again. Mignolet was hopelessly exposed and, regardless of what had happened with Mané, the problem for Liverpool here was the absence of defending and leadership.\n\nEarly on, the same could be said of their opponents bearing in mind there were long parts of the first half, at 11 v 11, when the home team had seemed intent on providing hard evidence that Pep Guardiola had been neglecting defensive work. Not for the first time, Nicolás Otamendi in particular looked susceptible. Mohamed Salah gave him a torrid time in the opening exchanges but the Egyptian was withdrawn after Mané’s red card and the second half was a fun, stress-free 45 minutes for the home side.\n\nArsenal v Bournemouth, Everton v Tottenham and more: clockwatch – live! Read more\n\nLiverpool’s carelessness could be summed up by the stray pass from Jordan Henderson that led to City’s third goal, with Fernandinho’s through ball leaving Agüero running free. The Argentinian had been in this position for the opening goal, picked out by De Bruyne’s brilliantly measured pass, and chose on that occasion to take the ball around Mignolet. Now, however, he had Jesus in support and rolled the ball sideways to leave his team-mate with a straightforward finish.\n\nThe last half-hour was an exercise in damage limitation for Liverpool but there was still a distinct lack of evidence that they knew how to keep it tight and make sure the afternoon did not become even more of an ordeal. Sané’s first goal followed a slick exchange of passes with Benjamin Mendy on the left and the best was saved for last as the substitute let fly from 25 yards to send a curling shot into the top right

over an abject Bournemouth team to blow the storm clouds away but for Arsène Wenger and Arsenal, this was a start. Inspired by Danny Welbeck, they took what was a must-win game by the scruff of the neck and never looked like suffering further early-season damage.\n\nThere had been plenty of time for Arsenal’s edgy fan base to pick over the humiliation from Liverpool two weeks ago and the tension had been simmering. Yet Bournemouth were the most obliging of opponents and they remain pointless for the season – which was a neat way of reflecting upon their display.\n\nPascal Gross double leads lowly Brighton to victory over West Brom Read more\n\nWenger had named Alexis Sánchez among the substitutes, following his return on Thursday from two World Cup qualifiers with Chile – which was not a surprising move – and it meant that Welbeck was able to retain his starting place. He more than repaid Wenger’s faith, putting Arsenal in charge with a scruffy early finish, adding an assist for Alexandre Lacazette and another, altogether cleaner strike in the second half.\n\nSánchez had been invited onto the field before the game to receive his Supporters’ Player of the Season trophy for his efforts last time out. He smiled for the photographers and then legged it up the tunnel. He would be introduced from the bench in the 75th minute and the reaction from the home support was best described as mixed. There were boos from some fans – a reaction to Sánchez’s attempt to force a move to Manchester City before the transfer deadline.\n\nArsenal played the final 10 minutes with 10 men, after another of their substitutes, Francis Coquelin, limped off with a hamstring injury; Wenger had made all of his changes. It was the prompt for Bournemouth to finally work Petr Cech through Charlie Daniels and Josh King but it was too little, too late.\n\nWenger acknowledged the boos for Sánchez and he made the point that “the best way to get people on your side is to perform”. He was happier to talk up Welbeck, who was a dynamic presence from the outset. “Welbeck gets stronger and stronger,” Wenger said. “People are not convinced that he is a great finisher but these kind of goals will help him.”\n\nEddie Howe had spoken about the importance of a good start for Bournemouth but they were behind after six minutes, following the failure of their three-man backline to track Welbeck. It was a sharp piece of movement from the Arsenal forward inside the area and he will argue that he made his own luck when he rose to meet Sead Kolasinac’s inviting centre. The ball squirmed in off his shoulder, rather than his forehead.\n\nWelbeck was involved in the second goal, although Bournemouth will lament the part that Nathan Aké played in it. The defender moved over to deal with Mesut Özil’s ball forward but he swiped at it and missed. It ran for Welbeck, who turned it back to Lacazette and the £53m summer signing – in the space vacated by Aké – guided a glorious curler up and around Asmir Begovic.\n\nBournemouth were horribly loose with and without the ball and their travails were summed up in the 37th minute when Begovic took a heavy touch following Tyrone Mings’s backpass and was closed down by Welbeck. The ball broke towards Lacazette but Begovic reacted quickly to block at the striker’s feet. The goalkeeper directed a tirade at Mings, in which he essentially told the defender that he did not want the ball like that.\n\nHowe squirmed during the first half, when his team barely crossed halfway. They left spaces at the back, with Lacazette preying on those in between the central defenders, while in possession they were – to use Howe’s words – wasteful, negative and slow.\n\nChelsea hold on as N’Golo Kanté goal edges them past Leicester City Read more\n\nThe half-time whistle might have felt like a relief and Arsenal could conceivably have been further in front. Begovic saved smartly from Granit Xhaka and Özil while Xhaka lifted another shot over the bar and Kolasinac saw a volley blocked by Adam Smith.\n\nHowe still knew that if his side could pull a goal back it could see Arsenal wobble and they almost got it on 48 minutes when Jermain Defoe headed the substitute Jordon Ibe’s cross against the post. Bournemouth, reconfigured into 4-3-3, with Aké having stepped up into midfield, had a flicker of hope. But it was snuffed out almost immediately when Welbeck got his second.\n\nOnce again, the goal was marked by Bournemouth sloppiness.

Awkward and established opponents were swept aside here with aplomb, the hosts running riot while Tony Pulis barked his disgust at West Bromwich Albion’s slack display from the sidelines. This was a win for the locals to savour, a victory 34 years in the waiting.\n\nThe last team Brighton had beaten in the elite were Coventry City, now of League Two, back in April 1983. They had never defeated the Baggies at this level though, in truth, they must have sensed this was their moment from the early stages, so off-colour were the visitors. It still took time for them to ease into an advantage but once Pascal Gross, one of the more impressive performers as Ingolstadt slipped out of the Bundesliga last term, had found his range, confidence flooded through their play. They will have few afternoons this comfortable over the campaign ahead.\n\nDaryl Janmaat thunderbolt wraps up Watford victory over Southampton Read more\n\nIt was their urgency which set them apart, coupled with the class in possession that had seen them cut through most opponents in the Championship. Here was evidence those qualities can be imposed on better opponents. While West Brom huffed and puffed to precious little effect until the game was long gone, Brighton stretched the play with Gross revelling in pockets of space behind Tomer Hemed, and Anthony Knockaert demonstrating he belongs at this level by tormenting Allan Nyom on the wing. No other player could match the 95 chances created by Gross in the Bundesliga last season. He seems a bargain at £3m.\n\nThe 26-year-old would have the honour of plundering his club’s first top-flight goal since Gordon Smith netted in a defeat to Norwich over 34 years ago. Shane Duffy had been denied by an assistant’s flag before, in first-half stoppage time, Solly March clipped over a cross which a leaping Nyom could not repel. There was Gross lurking unattended to collect superbly on his right boot, and then risk passing up his opportunity as he cut back inside and three West Brom players converged upon him. Yet the playmaker still spat away a left-footed shot as he slipped, the effort bulging the net inside Ben Foster’s near-post, and Brighton had the reward their pressure deserved.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brighton players celebrate after Tomer Hemed scores the hosts’ third goal. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images\n\nGross was not finished yet, collecting from Hemed early in the second period to scuttle a low shot across Foster from the edge of the area and into the corner. “He’s someone who works very hard for the team and, if he can get into areas where he can finish, he has good technique with both feet,” said Chris Hughton. “He was one of our first summer buys, is very knowledgeable about the English game, and has very good English which helped him from day one. He’s a good acquisition.”\n\nThere would be further reward before West Brom stirred, Gross pouncing on Craig Dawson’s poor touch to dart down the left with his centre headed home emphatically by a diving Hemed at the near post.\n\nWest Brom endure days like this at times, when they appear unable to rouse themselves. Grzegorz Krychowiak was classy enough at their heart, but there was a distinct lack of pizzazz to a team fielding three defensively-minded midfielders. Salomón Rondón departed early with Tony Pulis bemoaning Brighton’s goals either side of the break as “a kick in the goolies”. At least Oliver Burke and Kieran Gibbs injected energy late on, the Scot nodding back for his compatriot James Morrison to volley through Duffy’s attempt to block.\n\nYet, for all the flurry of half-chances created thereafter with Mathew Ryan denying Morrison a second goal, parity always appeared a pipe dream. “Let’s just say Brighton were better than us,” said Pulis. ”They looked a bit tired and jaded today. The centre-half [Ahmed Hegazi] has played in Uganda and Egypt, the centre-forward [Rondón] in Argentina and Venezuela, and this is different to the other leagues they’ve played in.” West Brom have now won only three of 16 games against newly-promoted opposition under Pulis.

There was no sign of that here. Tottenham swatted away Everton’s challenge with almost contemptuous ease, leaving Ronald Koeman to reflect that even significant summer spending does not appear to have made the job any easier.\n\nThe Everton manager had been highly complimentary about Spurs beforehand, describing them as one of the strongest teams in the Premier League. That is hardly an exclusive: Tottenham have looked the part for several seasons now, but lest anyone underestimate Mauricio Pochettino’s players after a slowish opening this was an object lesson in how to control a game through application and intelligence.\n\nDanny Welbeck’s double eases Arsenal angst to see off feeble Bournemouth Read more\n\nDavinson Sánchez, making a solid start as the central defender in a back three and looking as comfortable as if he had been there all his life, must be wondering if all the reports about the toughness of the Premier League are correct. Everton is supposed to be one of the more daunting venues to visit, after all, yet Spurs were so far ahead by the end of the first half they could practically afford to take the second half off. The home supporters marked Goodison’s 125th birthday with an uncharacteristic 45-minute silence. Long before the end of the game the Spurs fans were the only ones making any noise and the Gwladys Street end was half empty.\n\n“We had problems coping with their diamond in midfield,” Koeman said. “Because of the movement of Alli and Eriksen they were always able to easily find their free player.”\n\nWith August out of the way Harry Kane was free to start scoring again, and his 100th goal for Spurs was one to remember. Jordan Pickford, at least, will not forget it in a hurry, Everton’s new goalkeeper being unaccustomed to being beaten by dipping shots from a long way outside the box, but intentionally or otherwise Kane put the ball in the one place where no one could reach it. That included his Spurs team-mates, too, so if Kane was attempting to cross after retrieving an overhit corner – he later said he had not intended a shot – it was a poor effort.\n\nSo in one sense Tottenham’s opener came from nothing, though by that point the visitors had weathered Everton’s early storm – if one chance for Sandro Ramírez from a glorious cross by Cuco Martina can be thus described – and begun to dictate play on their own terms. Spurs not only pressed better than Everton, constantly forcing the defence and midfield to turn the ball back towards their own goal, they passed better than the home side too. Christian Eriksen’s poise and distribution was particularly notable, completely overshadowing Gylfi Sigurdsson’s contribution on his home debut, and for a while it appeared that almost any Spurs player in any part of the pitch had the capacity to find Ben Davies overlapping in space on the left. “He’s a great player but today he was fantastic,” Pochettino said. “Everyone played well though, we haven’t had an easy period and that was the solid performance we needed.”\n\nMoussa Sissoko could have put Spurs ahead from a Davies cross even before Kane broke the deadlock, but with the Everton defence scrambling he was unable to come up with a convincing finish. Eriksen had no such problem in extending the Spurs lead three minutes before the interval. Pickford had partly redeemed himself with a point-blank save from Ben Davies, but the goalkeeper could not hold the ball and Eriksen was on hand with an emphatic follow-up.\n\nEverton fell apart a little after that. They had to negotiate three or four minutes to reach the sanctuary of the dressing room, yet in that short time they could easily have shipped another couple of goals. You would have put money on Dele Alli scoring when Kane picked him out in front of goal but the England player could not adjust his feet quickly enough, then with virtually the last kick of the first half Kane rolled a low shot just inches past a post. There was audible grumbling by this stage, and the half-time whistle was greeted by more than a few boos.\n\nDaryl Janmaat thunderbolt wraps up Watford victory over Southampton Read more\n\nKoeman’s response was to send on Tom Davies and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, yet remarkably Everton failed to shut down Ben Davies on the left. It took less than a minute after the restart for the wing-back to make them regret that, easily picking out Kane for the striker to register his 101st Spurs goal with a languid finish.\n\nWhatever the Everton manager had said at the interval was now irrelevant; his side were involved in a damage limitation exercise. Namely, trying to keep the final score more respectable than the one Liverpool ended up with at Manchester City. Thanks to a flying save from Pickford that kept out an Eriksen volley and a couple of late misses from an anonymous Wayne Rooney, the score remained unchanged. Officially, at least, this was not as heavy a defeat as the one Liverpool suffered. While there might be one or two Everton fans who will take a hollow crumb of comfort from that knowledge, Liverpool were playing away from home.

points and grey skies in the Midlands, as Chelsea continued their resurgence with a third successive Premier League victory.\n\nThese are still early days, but it feels as though normal service has been resumed with the Premier League champions, as the memories of that chaotic defeat at home against Burnley on the opening weekend of the season begin to fade. Chelsea are up to third in the table, winning matches without playing at their best and, on the evidence of what we have seen so far, will not be losing any sleep about Diego Costa’s absence when Álvaro Morata is in this sort of form.\n\nThe Spaniard scored for the third time since his club-record transfer from Real Madrid, expertly guiding a header beyond Kasper Schmeichel to set Chelsea on their way, and N’Golo Kanté marked his return to his former club with a rare goal as Leicester slipped to a third defeat in four matches.\n\nChelsea did not have everything their own way, however, and there were a few anxious moments for Conte and his players to endure after Jamie Vardy converted a penalty shortly after the hour mark to bring Leicester back into the game. A spell of late Leicester pressure ended with Vardy stretching every sinew but not quite managing to get a touch to a cross from the substitute Andy King that flashed across goal.\n\nTottenham’s Harry Kane gets lucky to chagrin of Everton and Pickford Read more\n\nChelsea should have been out of sight by that point.

Photograph: Rebecca Naden/Reuters\n\n“The mentality was very strong, very positive, until the penalty because we were in total control. After the penalty, Leicester tried to put a bit of pressure but, despite this, we created many chances to improve our scoreline. We must be satisfied with that.\n\n“We are trying to involve new players with the old players of last season and this is a process. We need time.”\n\nMorata seems to be adapting quicker than anyone and is proving lethal in the air. His three Chelsea goals have been scored with his head and there was something particularly impressive about the way he steered César Azpilicueta’s superb centre into the bottom corner after drifting away from his marker, Wes Morgan. “A good day for the team and a good day for Álvaro,” said Conte.\n\nDanny Welbeck’s double eases Arsenal angst to see off feeble Bournemouth Read more\n\nThe Chelsea manager also saw positive signs in the performance of Tiemoué Bakayoko, who lined up alongside Kanté in a midfield that overpowered Leicester in the first half. Leicester, though, still had their chances, in particular just before Morata’s goal, when Chelsea were hit on the counterattack as Riyad Mahrez released Islam Slimani. The Algerian was one-on-one with Thibaut Courtois, but the Chelsea goalkeeper came out on top, blocking the striker’s shot with his right hand. “The big moments aren’t going our way,” said Craig Shakespeare, alluding to that opportunity.\n\nLeicester had only themselves to blame for Chelsea’s second, which arrived five minutes into the second half and just after Shakespeare had made a couple of substitutions to try to change the game. Kanté, who is not exactly renowned for his goalscoring ability, had so much time and space to look up and strike a 30-yard shot, which took a slight deflection and almost seemed to find the far corner of the net in slow motion.\n\nTo their credit, Leicester never surrendered and the home team got their reward when Vardy dispatched a penalty after he had been tripped by Courtois. But they had left themselves too much to do.\n\n“We showed a lot of character and resilience,” said Shakespeare. “But we couldn’t quite find that breakthrough once we got the penalty.”\n\nChelsea condemn Morata ‘yids’ chant\n\nChelsea have condemned the antisemitic language used by a section of their supporters at the King Power Stadium in a terrace chant about Álvaro Morata, with the Spaniard and the club demanding the fans stop with immediate effect.\n\nThe song, linked to their bitter rivalry with Tottenham Hotspur, contains a reference to “Yids”and was heard during Chelsea’s 2-1 victory at Leicester, when Morata scored his third goal for the club. Chelsea said the language was “not acceptable”.\n\nSteve Atkins, Chelsea’s head of communications, said: “The club and the players appreciate the fans’ passionate support away from home, of course. But the language in that song is not acceptable at all.\n\n“We have spoken to Álvaro after the game. He does not want to be connected with that song in any way and both the player and the club request that the supporters stop singing that song with immediate effect.”"}, {"date": "09/09/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31435, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wesley Hoedt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam McQueen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [38], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Carrillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}], "subs": [{"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Orestis Karnezis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Long-range strikes from Abdoulaye Doucouré and Daryl Janmaat ended Southampton’s unbeaten start to the season and lifted Watford into the top four. The goals secured a 2-0 victory for the upwardly mobile Hornets in a game where Saints’ struggles in front of goal continued.\n\nDoucouré pounced shortly before half-time from outside the penalty area and Janmaat hit a second-half cracker four minutes after coming on as a substitute. Meanwhile, Southampton drew a blank for the third time in their four Premier League matches this season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Abdoulaye Doucouré of Watford celebrates after opening the scoring at St Mary’s. Photograph: Tony Marshall/Getty Images\n\n“Obviously I’m not happy with our performance said the Southampton manager, Mauricio Pellegrino. “But to score goals is not just for the strikers.”\n\nHis side have issues to address at the back, too. There was again no Virgil van Dijk in the squad – the club captain is now building up his fitness after failing to secure a move to Liverpool – so in his absence another Dutch centre-back, Wesley Hoedt, was handed his debut.\n\nHoedt was kept busy early on by Watford’s bustling striker Andre Gray, while the Brazilian youngster Richarlison was proving a handful down the left. Richarlison created the first decent opening, midway through the first half, when he evaded two defenders before seeing his shot deflected wide by Jack Stephens.\n\nNeither goalkeeper had been forced into action until seven minutes before half-time, when Southampton only half-cleared a ball into their penalty area. It fell to Doucouré 20 yards out and the French midfielder lashed a volley past Fraser Forster into the bottom corner.\n\nForster did make a save moments later, at his near post to deny Richarlison and Doucouré side-footed narrowly over as Watford finished the half on top. There were boos from some of the Southampton faithful as their side trudged off – harsh given they were previously unbeaten this campaign.\n\nThe home side staged a brief revival after the interval but failed to make the most of their chances: Sofiane Boufal sliced his shot over and Nathan Redmond hit the side-netting.\n\nPascal Gross double leads lowly Brighton to victory over West Brom Read more\n\nA Watford defence already hit by injuries was stretched further when Younès Kaboul and Kiko Femenía both limped off on the hour, but rather than knocking the visitors out of their stride the changes paid immediate dividends as one of the substitutes, Janmaat, expertly found the net from 25 yards.\n\n“It can happen in football,” said Marco Silva. “The first goal was a moment when we worked really hard. And the second goal is a great finish, a moment sometimes you might not expect.”\n\nPellegrino sent on Shane Long and Charlie Austin in desperate search of a goal but the only cheers from the home crowd were the ironic ones that greeted Southampton’s first shot on target, from Cédric Soares, which came in stoppage time.\n\n“I am here because the team was in trouble last season,” said Pellegrino. “If everything was perfect there would be a different manager here.”"}, {"date": "09/09/2017", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 29320, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup":

questions throughout a riveting contest. José Mourinho’s side remain league leaders – ahead of Manchester City, who trounced Liverpool 5-0, on goal difference – but again failed to leave this venue with three points; they last won here four years ago.\n\n“One team tried to win, one team tried to get the point but they fought hard to get that point,” said Mourinho. “They defended well, they counterattacked and in set pieces they are powerful.”\n\nThat was disingenuous: Stoke carried a real threat. When Mourinho’s comments were put to Mark Hughes, Stoke’s manager said: “What do you think? We were up against the best side in the Premier League judging by what they have shown so far. We didn’t allow them as much space and everything I asked the guys to do, they fulfilled.”\n\nStoke began the better. Almost straight from kick-off the excellent Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting forced a corner on the right. Xherdan Shaqiri took it but overhit his effort.\n\nThe attack set the tempo for a high-paced contest where Stoke pinned United back before the visitors exerted some control. Mourinho plumped for a 4-3-3 setup that brought in a holding midfielder, Ander Herrera, in place of an attacking one, Juan Mata, from the 2-0 win over Leicester City last time out.\n\nThe midfield trident repeatedly pinged passes into the front three of Romelu Lukaku, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford. One break put Lukaku in down the right and from his cross Paul Pogba backheeled the ball at Jack Butland.\n\nAs in the 1-0 victory over Arsenal in Stoke’s previous home league outing, Hughes’s side showed an attractive fluency. Shaqiri floated in from his right-hand berth when his fancy demanded and one move ended in a shot from the Swiss forward that De Gea had to watch carefully. A few moments later Shaqiri repeated the trick, appearing in a central area and taking aim again.\n\nFor the challenge of picking up where United left off before the international break Mourinho made three changes. Out went Daley Blind, Anthony Martial and Mata and in came Matteo Darmian, Rashford and Herrera. While the manager had one eye on Tuesday night’s visit of Basel in the Champions League, Mark Hughes gave Kevin Wimmer his Stoke debut, for the injured Ryan Shawcross, and Mame Biram Diouf replaced Bruno Martins Indi.\n\nIn a furious first-half finale, the lively Rashford forced Butland into a save from the left, Antonio Valencia’s radar was just awry with a cross, and then two goals in two minutes made the score 1-1 at the break.\n\nStoke sucker-punched United with a fine Choupo-Moting strike. Diouf crossed the ball in from the right after being released by a superb pass by Darren Fletcher and the forward fired home from close range. Hughes’ side lost concentration moments later as Nemanja Matic flicked on a Mkhitaryan corner to the unmarked Pogba, whose header beat Butland via a deflection off Rashford.\n\nThe Stoke players protested about the equaliser, arguing Rashford was in an offside position. Hughes appeared unhappy and for the second half took off Geoff Cameron for Martins Indi.\n\nUnited claimed this period’s first corner, again due to Rashford’s probing and though it amounted to nothing Mourinho could be pleased. The Portuguese will have been less happy at the way the full-back Darmian headed out for a corner when De Gea could have collected the ball. From Shaqiri’s delivery another mix-up in the United defence followed , from which they were lucky to escape unscathed.\n\nThe lead was taken by United then lost within six minutes. Joe Allen was pickpocketed by Darmian and he fed Mkhitaryan.\n\nThe weight and direction of the Armenian’s pass was sublime, cutting through Stoke’s defence and putting Lukaku clear. At the second attempt the Belgian scored his fourth league goal this term.\n\nStoke’s equaliser came from a Shaqiri corner. Phil Jones lost his footing and Choupo-Moting headed home. Mourinho was in no doubt Jones was at fault. “He knows the mistake. No problem – these things are part of the game,” the manager said.\n\nEighteen minutes from time Mourinho went for the jugular by introducing Martial and Mata for Rashford and Herrera. United might have grabbed a late triumph but Lukaku snatched at a close-range chance and Pogba hooked over.\n\nMourinho rejects Hughes handshake\n\nMark Hughes claimed José Mourinho failed to shake hands at the end of Stoke City’s 2-2 draw as it was a “negative result” for Manchester United’s manager. Mourinho shook hands with some Stoke City staff but not Hughes. During the match the two clashed when Mourinho wandered near his opposite number.\n\nAsked about the handshake Hughes said: “I pushed him because he was in my technical area. Maybe that is why he didn’t want to shake my hand. It has to be viewed as a negative result for him. Sometimes managers of top-six clubs don’t take negative results too kindly. Maybe he reacted in the wrong way.\n\n“In fairness I have my history with handshakes. Maybe it’s me. I’m not quite sure I seem to get involved on handshake issues, I offered my hand but José didn’t want to take it from me, maybe he was a bit upset about the result, sometimes these top managers don’t have these results too often and can get upset.”\n\nHughes has previously had issues regarding the post-match formality with managers including Tony Pulis (twice), Roberto Mancini, Martin Jol and Arsène Wenger.\n\nYet Mourinho, left, was irritated when asked about the incident. “I don’t speak about stupid things, I’m too old for that, talking about stupid things is for stupid people,” the Portuguese said. “I prefer not to answer the question because your question is a bad question. Because it looks like is my fault, is my problem. And your question is not correct, I am sorry.”"}, {"date": "27/08/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41382, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [27], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tiemoué Bakayoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charly Musonda", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fikayo Tomori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [9], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro Ramírez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}], "subs": [{"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cuco Martina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chelsea enter the final week of the transfer window with much still to achieve in the market but momentum well and truly regained on the pitch. Confrontations with Everton have tended to bring the best out of Antonio Conte’s charges and the visitors, even with their ranks strengthened over the summer, were swept aside almost at will yet again by a team the Italian is desperate to reinforce. Conte must hope performances this dominant do not undermine his insistence with the board that strengthening is still desperately required.\n\nIn truth, a glimpse at Everton’s toils would actually justify his urgency. The champions benefited here from Everton having been overwhelmed as much by an onerous schedule as the home side’s persuasive football. The demands of taking on Manchester City, Hajduk Split and Chelsea within seven days proved beyond Ronald Koeman’s team, with weariness creeping into legs, fatigue into minds and sluggishness into approach play. Everton did not muster a single shot on target all afternoon and always appeared utterly incapable of retrieving the two‑goal deficit shipped before the break.\n\nAntonio Conte defends Chelsea policy of loaning out young players Read more\n\nChelsea bypassed them far too easily for comfort with Koeman, rendered ruddy in the searing afternoon sunshine, left to bemoan a lack of movement or incision. They will improve, particularly if the Dutchman secures the two players he feels are imperative – one at least must be a striker – before the cut-off. Chelsea want rather more than two new faces, with interest maintained in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Danny Drinkwater and the visitors’ Ross Barkley, currently in rehabilitation from a torn hamstring. A trio of England internationals would add further depth to the squad with Champions League football a few weeks away. Yet at least the first-team is functioning efficiently again after that unexpected stutter against Burnley on the opening afternoon. Normality has been resumed on that front.\n\nThis was a more imposing performance than that which defeated Tottenham Hotspur on the counterattack at Wembley the previous Sunday. Chelsea found their upbeat tempo early and did not allow the rhythm to waver until the lead felt impregnable with Willian, a figure rejuvenated after last season’s regular interruptions, forever driving them forward and too much creation and energy in midfield for Everton to combat. It never threatened to become a repeat of last season’s 5-0 mauling in this arena, a home win inspired by Eden Hazard’s slippery movement, but it was still not much of a contest.\n\nJordan Pickford had already thwarted a series of Chelsea efforts before Everton eventually cracked, their concentration fractured at a quickly taken free-kick. Willian found Cesc Fàbregas who exchanged passes with Álvaro Morata, the striker eventually nodding down his return, the midfielder’s finish crisply dispatched low across the goalkeeper with the outside of his right boot.\n\nThe lead did not check Chelsea’s intent. Victor Moses was duly crunched on the edge of the penalty area five minutes from the break; the referee, Jon Moss, opted to play an advantage Conte did not instantly recognise. The Italian was still berating the fourth official when Willian lost the ball and still, in the confusion which ensued, while César Azpilicueta crossed and Morata eased beyond a static Phil Jagielka to steer a header past Pickford. It was the record signing’s second goal for his new club, and reward for another afternoon of industry.\n\nConte revealed post-match that, after speaking with Roberto Martínez, Hazard will link up with the Belgium squad and potentially make his return from ankle surgery in the World Cup qualifier against Gibraltar on Thursday. “The player is happy to go and stay with the national team,” the head coach said. “He’s the captain. But the most important thing is to continue to work very hard to improve, then have the possibility to bring him to the bench after the international break and start to think he’s a new player for Chelsea this season.”\n\nEverton had issues with their own Belgian forward Kevin Mirallas, whose absence from the matchday squad was apparently due to a poor attitude. “He is struggling to deal with moments of disappointment,” Koeman said. “I expect from everybody to be part of the team. If somebody is showing that he is disappointed and his attitude is not the same, then I make decisions.” In contrast, Mo Besic’s second-half appearance here came despite his father, Meho, having been shot, in the hand and leg, at the family home near Srebrenik. “I spoke to him on Saturday evening and he’d spoken to his father,” the Dutchman said. “He said he was ready and committed. After the game he will talk to his family to see what he needs to do.”\n\nThat contributed to a difficult build-up, though they would still have expected to muster more of a threat than this. Sandro Ramírez latched on to Wayne Rooney’s slipped pass but saw a shot deflected behind by Antonio Rüdiger, and Ashley Williams guided a header just wide of Thibaut Courtois’ post, but that was as close as Everton came to a response. Their own pursuit of a forward would appear to be just as pressing as Chelsea’s search for senior bodies."}, {"date": "27/08/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 22704, "home_team": {"name":

Hughes was talking about Xherdan Shaqiri and Stoke City’s attacking football while gazing out of the window in the press conference room afterwards when he was distracted by a line of lawnmowers going up and down the playing surface. “It’s difficult just to get that little spark at the top end of the pitch... I see they’re cutting the grass now,” the Stoke City manager said, smiling. “They should have done it before the game, but there you go.”\n\nIt was a little dig that is in keeping with the sort of needle that surrounds this fixture, in particular the relationship between the two managers, who have little time for one another. Asked whether keeping the grass long had been designed to counteract Stoke’s passing game, Hughes replied: “Quite possibly. I don’t know. You’ll have to ask the people involved.”\n\nThe expression on Tony Pulis’s face said it all when that comment was put to him moments later. Albion’s head coach yawned, made the point that the grass was the same length against Bournemouth in their opening home game, and then got in a jab of his own. “We’re still unbeaten against them,” Pulis said, referring to the fact that he has yet to taste defeat in seven Premier League matches as a manager against Stoke City since he left the club in 2013.\n\nFive of those games have ended in victory and it would have been six but for Peter Crouch’s late header cancelling out Jay Rodriguez’s first Premier League goal for Albion since his £12m summer transfer from Southampton. Pulis signed Crouch for Stoke in 2011 – the same year that the club reached the FA Cup final – yet the chants that emanated from the travelling supporters suggested they have little time for the Welshman and his achievements across his seven years in charge. “Tony Pulis, your football is shit,” rang out on several occasions.\n\nPulis chose his words carefully in response. “I think that’s the way the world is. I don’t think that matters at all,” he said. “There’s a person in the stand called Peter Coates [the Stoke chairman] and his family, who respect what I did there more than anybody else. And they are the people I respect more than anybody else.”\n\nOn the pitch things were nothing like as entertaining. The game was desperately dull – a point that Hughes was quick to make. “I have to say I didn’t particularly enjoy it as a spectacle, or even being involved at management level,” said the Stoke manager, who is set to complete the signing of Kevin Wimmer from Tottenham Hotspur for £15m.\n\n“It was frustrating to say the least. But maybe we shouldn’t have expected anything different; it’s always difficult when you come here. Those are the type of games that you have to face more often than not.”\n\nIn the end a draw felt like a fair result, yet Albion’s disappointment at the final whistle was understandable given the poor goal they conceded to allow Stoke back into the game. Ahmed Hegazi, who had scored on his debut in the previous home match, got in a terrible tangle trying to clear a cross from Ramadan Sobhi, the central defender slashing wildly at a ball that Ben Foster, Albion’s keeper, had come off his line to gather. Crouch, loitering at the far post, accepted the gift, nodding home his 104th Premier League goal and his 51st with his head. “Probably the easiest headed goal that Crouchy has ever scored,” Hughes said.\n\nAlthough Hughes took satisfaction from the fact that two of his substitutes combined to haul Stoke level, there was a glaring lack of conviction about Stoke’s offensive play before their introduction. Kurt Zouma’s 20-yard deflected shot, which was expertly tipped over the bar by Foster, was the sum total of their attacking threat prior to Crouch’s header. Everything looked a little disjointed with Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting leading the line and Jesé Rodríguez drifting out onto the left.\n\nAlbion, in fairness, were no better going forward, and it was a goal totally out of the blue that gave them the lead on 61 minutes. Allan Nyom broke on the right side of the pitch and delivered a fine cross that ran through to the far post, where Rodriguez reacted much quicker than Zouma and Geoff Cameron, who were both caught on their heels. Stooping to meet the ball with a diving header from about six yards, Rodriguez beat the goalkeeper Jack Butland. “Jay adds another goalscorer to this team but we need more,” Pulis admitted as the lawnmowers ploughed on in the background."}, {"date": "27/08/2017", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53206, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Loris Karius", "yellows": [],

himself, if he had guaranteed a happy ending after winning the FA Cup in May and spared himself these kind of ordeals. Arsenal, once again, are lurching towards another of their now-familiar crises. It all feels so predictable and the danger for Wenger is that the boos from the away end here might become the soundtrack to his season.\n\nLiverpool outclassed them in every department and perhaps the most worrying part for Arsenal’s fans is that these kind of routs no longer feel like a shock. Arsenal have now conceded 17 goals in their last five Anfield visits and, if anything, it was a surprise the latest capitulation stopped at four. Arsenal – weak, rudderless, anaemic – were not a great deal worse that time they let in eight at Manchester United.\n\nYet again, it was all the usual shortcomings, all the same old problems that should have been addressed a long time but now feel synonymous with the latter part of Wenger’s fading reign. Liverpool were a class apart and, in the process, Jürgen Klopp’s men proved something here. Liverpool without Philippe Coutinho have been portrayed in some quarters as a flower without sunlight.\n\nIt simply isn’t true.\n\nWhatever happens with Coutinho, Liverpool are entitled to think optimistically when Sadio Mané, Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah are capable of playing with this kind of vibrancy. All of their three attackers scored, along with the substitute Daniel Sturridge, and by the time Salah had sprinted half the length of the pitch to stroke in the third goal Alexis Sánchez was crouched down by the left touchline, lost in his own thoughts and cut off from the rest of his team-mates. His body language told its own story.\n\nPerhaps they were unlucky to come up against a Liverpool side playing at the point of maximum expression but, unfortunately for Arsenal, these are the occasions when we are reminded why Sánchez wants out, why Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain thinks there might be greater adventures elsewhere and why a third player, Mesut Özil, is guilty of leaving the same impression. Wenger was asked afterwards what had gone wrong. “Everything,” he said. Arsenal have now lost nine out of their last 14 away games if we think back to the travel sickness that afflicted them last season, too. They took only nine points from their 10 games against the other top-six sides in that campaign and it would be madness, on the evidence of their latest defeat, to think they will be any closer to challenging for the title this season.\n\nTransfer window 2017 – every deal in Europe's top five leagues Read more\n\nWhere to start? As tragicomedies go, it doesn’t get much better than Granit Xhaka trying to back-heel the ball to his own goalkeeper and putting it out for a corner. There was the attack when Georginio Wijnaldum took the ball past Aaron Ramsey, then went back to do it again. Or how about the moment Rob Holding aimed a simple pass out to Oxlade-Chamberlain on the right and could not even get that right? Holding missed his team-mate by several yards and gave away a throw-in. It might be harsh to pick out one player after a performance of this nature but Holding looks out of his depth and opponents have worked that out. He looked shot before an hour had been played and, for his own sake, he could probably do with a spell out of the team now.\n\nLiverpool took a little while to realise their opponents were ripe for a beating but once Firmino headed them into a 17th-minute lead it was startling to see the imbalance between the two sides. Klopp’s men swarmed all over a team that, in Wenger’s own words, were “an easy opponent for Liverpool.” Ramsey was removed at half-time. Özil has never been a chaser of lost causes and Oxlade-Chamberlain made it feel laughable he is the subject of £35m bids and a £180,000-a-week contract offer. Is he really worth it? His afternoon here ended with a substitution and the sight of him throwing his tracksuit top on the floor.\n\nArsène Wenger keen to see Alexandre Lacazette and Alexis Sánchez together Read more\n\nMané’s goal to make it 2-0 was just one of countless occasions when Holding was exposed. Joe Gomez, Liverpool’s young right-back, started the counter-attack. The referee, Craig Pawson, played advantage when Xhaka fouled Wijnaldum and within moments Liverpool had swept upfield, Firmino’s pass had left Mané with the chance to take on Holding and Petr Cech was picking the ball out of his net.\n\nGomez had also been involved in the first goal, pinching the ball off Hector Bellerin before crossing for Firmino score with an unchallenged header. Bellerin also gave away possession when Salah chased him down and ran clear for the third. An Arsenal corner had turned into a Liverpool goal and, once again, it was alarming to see the chaos within Wenger’s ranks.\n\nSturridge headed in the fourth from Salah’s left-wing cross and Arsenal will not even wish to contemplate what the score might have been if Cech had not made several splendid saves. Loris Karius, in stark contrast, must consider Arsenal were obliging opponents on the day Klopp made the unorthodox decision to “rest” Simon Mignolet, leaving his usual No 1 out of his entire squad. Karius still had some awkward moments, twice chased down by Daniel Welbeck with the ball at his feet, but he did not have to make a single noteworthy save.\n\n“We’re going to win the league,” Arsenal’s fans sang.

For a club that want to challenge for the title this season, Spurs cannot let too many more results slip through their fingers.\n\nPicking through the entrails of this match will not be simple. Dele Alli’s second goal of the season was cancelled out in added time by a debut strike from Chris Wood, the £15m signing tucking home a superlative pass from Robbie Brady. Spurs first struggled to break down a superbly organised opponent then, once they had, wasted a hatful of chances. Burnley, for their part, stuck to their plan regardless. A conservative opening half was followed by a more expansive second, and Sean Dyche will feel that the game panned out as he had hoped.\n\nCesc Fábregas and Alvaro Morata on target as Chelsea dispatch Everton Read more\n\nPochettino was visibly frustrated at what he believed to be his side’s loss of concentration in the final moments. “The performance was good, we had a lot of chances, and we had the chance to kill the game,” he said. “I was very disappointed in the way we conceded the goal. It wasn’t a long ball, it was a pass between our lines and we gave them the chance too easily. When you are 1-0 up and you have the opportunity to kill the game, OK you can miss. But if you don’t kill the game you can’t concede. You certainly can’t concede a goal with five or six players behind the ball.”\n\nThe finish from Wood was calm and low under Hugo Lloris, his run off the former Burnley full-back Kieran Trippier catching the defender napping. But the goal was made by Brady’s pass; the Irishman having switched from his natural left flank to the right bisected the entire Spurs back line with just seconds of the match remaining.\n\n“I thought the way we grew into the second half, the belief and endeavour of the side was absolutely outstanding today,” Dyche said. “I’m really pleased for Chris Wood, he’s come into a good group, he’s enjoying it but I must say what a fantastic pass from Brady. I felt as the game wore on we were deserving of it, they dominated the first half but I think overall we just about deserved something today.”\n\nThe first half was indeed dominated by the home side, clearly prepared to be patient in prising their opponents open. This, in and of itself, is a necessary reaction to the surroundings of the national stadium where a crowd of 68,000 can make its concerns quite palpable.\n\nPeter Crouch goal secures point for Stoke City at West Bromwich Albion Read more\n\nSpurs were methodically varied in their approach. They tried shots from range, Christian Eriksen earning the hosts’ first corner with a drive off James Tarkowski in the 10th minute. They sought to draw fouls in and around the area; when Alli went down under Matt Lowton’s challenge in the 17th minute, Harry Kane came close to opening the scoring, only for Ben Mee to do just enough to put him off his header. They went direct, a long ball to Son Heung-min then knocked down to Alli in the 36th minute, his fierce shot from the edge of the box deflected wide. They sought to overlap with the full-backs too, Ben Davies teeing up Kane again, this time in the six-yard box, but the ball got tangled in the England forward’s feet and his shot was blocked.\n\nAll that huffing and puffing apparently came to an end within four minutes of the restart after the redoubtable Mee scuffed his clearance from another Eriksen corner and Alli smashed home at the second time of asking. The England star barely celebrated, almost as if to suggest that breaching the Burnley wall was the bare minimum.\n\nDyche immediately brought on Wood for Sam Vokes and switched Brady wide right, but Spurs had their best spell of the game. Kane had at least three chances to score his first Premier League goal in August but Tom Heaton was equal to them all. The keeper also stopped an Eriksen piledriver from 12 yards and another Alli effort from six. This is the period of the match that will have frustrated Pochettino as much as the goal conceded; Spurs were not clinical enough, looking like they wanted to put on a show for the crowd as much as get the crucial second.\n\nPochettino denies there is a problem with Wembley but admits the players have to adapt. He also says the league title is still very much a possibility even though he knows that only a high points total is likely to be enough to win the thing.\n\n“Of course, we need to make Wembley our home but, if you remember, my first season at White Hart Lane was difficult,” Pochettino said. “Last season you would not say Chelsea would be the champions after their opening matches. It’s clear we need to improve our mental level, to try to be strong. We have to try to keep the balance and add players who will help us in the future. I am optimistic, but of course I feel bad.”"}, {"date": "26/08/2017", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10419, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [23], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [13], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Mendy", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [21], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [90], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Claudio Bravo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "In the seventh minute of added time, the Manchester City technical area exploded into life as Raheem Sterling wheeled away after earning three points on a picture-postcard afternoon at Bournemouth. His celebrations, which included jumping into a frenzy of travelling supporters who had spilled on to the pitch, earned him a second yellow card, as Pep Guardiola’s side took victory in the cruellest manner following a superb and often heated contest between two teams coached by perfectionists.\n\nIt was the second time this week that Sterling had come up with the goods, after his equaliser at Everton on Monday. City were heading for a second successive Premier League draw before he nicked the winner, firing home Danilo’s low cross with only seconds left. It was a bonkers finale to a game that concluded in the 101st minute. Gabriel Jesus had drilled in a first-half equaliser for City after the Bournemouth defender Charlie Daniels filed an early contender for goal of the season, with a rasping half-volley, that pinballed off the crossbar and in from 20 yards. By the final whistle, when Eddie Howe had his head in his hands, Daniels’ spectacular strike seemed a distant memory.\n\nPep Guardiola demands explanation for Raheem Sterling’s sending off Read more\n\nCity made life difficult, and Bournemouth must take spirit from how they stifled Guardiola’s side for so long, but his side extended their unbeaten record to 11 matches and broke hearts in the process. Howe and his players were aggrieved with the referee, Mike Dean, for penalising the substitute Lys Mousset in the buildup to City’s winner, although the hosts could count themselves lucky not to have finished the game with 10 players themselves. The numbers are not adding up at the moment for Bournemouth, pointless after three games.\n\nGuardiola made four changes from Monday’s draw, with Sergio Agüero among those to drop to a bench brimming with more than £202m worth of talent. Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva, both of whom arrived from Monaco over the summer, made their first starts while Guardiola shifted to a back four, with another summer signing, Danilo, at right-back. Howe handed Jermain Defoe his first Premier League start for Bournemouth, after he re-signed for the club over the summer.\n\nIt was a measure of how impressively they began that a first league goal this season, after 13 minutes, took nobody by surprise. After a swell of pressure Dan Gosling’s effort was headed away by Vincent Kompany, but only so far as an onrushing Daniels, who needed no second invitation to thrash the ball home. He rifled an unwavering half-volley towards goal, which smacked the inner frame of Ederson’s crossbar before crashing in past the City goalkeeper.\n\nCity looked shell-shocked and could have fell further behind but for Ederson, who denied Defoe from close range after the England striker lost his marker, Mendy, to meet Andrew Surman’s neat first-time cross.\n\nBournemouth had City rattled but not for much longer, with David Silva crafting a fine equaliser eight minutes later. The move was started and finished by Jesus, who took a quick free-kick before Silva slid him through with a beautifully weighted pass and he rolled the ball beyond Asmir Begovic.\n\nBournemouth 1-2 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nSixty seconds later, Jesus again got the better of Nathan Aké, robbing him of the ball before he was fouled by the Bournemouth defender 25 yards from goal. Aké was arguably the last man and fortunate to escape with only a booking. Jesus then shinned an effort wide after a dangerous ball by Mendy. Bernardo Silva, too, had a golden chance but spurned what was virtually a free hit at Begovic’s goal. City had suddenly found their groove and dominated the rest of the first half.\n\nAfter the interval, Steve Cook put in a bruising late challenge on Jesus but both came away from the tackle unscathed. City continued to pry for an opening as Kevin De Bruyne grew increasingly instrumental. It was his sweeping cross that eventually found its way to Bernardo Silva, but the forward got himself in a tangle at the back post. Then Bournemouth went close. King struck an upright with Ederson beaten all ends up.\n\nCity continued to pour forward and Guardiola called upon Agüero in search of a winner. He won a corner with which De Bruyne laid the ball on a plate for the unmarked Nicolas Otamendi – erratic at times in his own penalty area – whose tame header struck the post. Then came Leroy Sané, in place of Jesus.\n\nBournemouth had one more warning, only for Daniels to get his team-mate Aké off the hook. The Dutchman threw a stray boot at Mendy’s devious cross but Daniels slid in to deny an onrushing David Silva the simplest of finishes. But after Lee Probert signalled for five added minutes, City eventually found a shattering winner."}, {"date": "26/08/2017", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 23477, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timothy Fosu-Mensah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [41]}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luka Milivojevic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [10], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Eyenga Lokilo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Keshi Anderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [41], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mike van der Hoorn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samuel Clucas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tammy Abraham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [44], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}], "subs": [{"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roque Mesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Fulton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver McBurnie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The good news for Frank de Boer is that the natives are not restless just yet. Well, not all of them, if the applause directed towards the Dutchman and his players from many home supporters after the final whistle is anything to go by. But there were boos, too, after a third straight Premier League defeat for a Crystal Palace side struggling badly to come to terms with the ways of their latest manager and even at this early stage of the season there must be doubts about whether he will be given time to see through the job.\n\nSuch is life in the cut-throat surroundings of England’s top flight, and especially when a team is not only losing but playing in a manner that suggests a first victory is not around the corner. Palace were deservedly beaten here on the back of a shoddy and toothless display, and following their reverses against Huddersfield on the opening day and Liverpool last week find themselves on zero points going into the international break, having scored no goals and conceded six.\n\nFor Swansea City the outlook is much brighter following a first win of the season achieved through goals either side of half-time from Tammy Abraham and Jordan Ayew. But as Paul Clement admitted afterwards, the visitors hardly sparkled during what was a poor-quality encounter and that they had to barely get out of third gear to triumph only damns the bleak display Palace served up in the south London sunshine.\n\n“This result is very disappointing,” conceded De Boer. “Especially in the first half we did not show courage on the ball. There were a lot of moments we could have played on the ground but we did not look comfortable with the ball.\n\n“And that wasn’t because Swansea did a fantastic job – this was a game in which two teams did not play their best and the team that makes less mistakes wins this type of game, which is what happened.”\n\nThere was no mistake greater than the one committed by Martin Kelly in the buildup to Swansea’s second goal. The second half was barely three minutes old when the defender’s casual manner allowed Kyle Naughton to steal possession away from him and deliver a pass into the path of Ayew, who, clean through, pushed the ball past the outrushing Wayne Hennessey and watched as it ricocheted off the goalkeeper and rolled into an empty net.\n\nKelly, who had come on as a substitute for the injured James Tomkins on 41 minutes, was also at fault for Swansea’s first goal when he was easily outmuscled by Abraham .The striker ran on to Leroy Fer’s cross and sent the ball past Hennessey with a side-footed volley from close range. It was an impressive finish by the England Under-21 international, who caught the eye here with his movement and technique and now has his first Premier League goal for Swansea having arrived on loan from Chelsea in the summer.\n\nSwansea’s goals summed up Palace’s lack of defensive awareness and sturdiness in a 3-4-2-1 formation that appears to suit none of their players. Their midfield, missing the injured Ruben Loftus-Cheek but containing James McArthur following his brace in Tuesday’s 2-1 victory over Ipswich, failed to impose themselves against the central trio of Swansea, for whom Sam Clucas delivered an encouraging display on his debut. Up front Christian Benteke cut a frustrated figure as he regularly failed to link up with Jason Puncheon and Andros Townsend.\n\nPalace posed more of a threat in the second half and Townsend could well have pulled a goal back with a side-footed shot that went just wide. But Swansea coped and overall created the better chances, most notably an Alfie Mawson header on 36 minutes that landed just past the post.\n\n“This was an important win for us given we drew our first game and lost our second 4-0,” said Clement.

And this performance swelled their belief in themselves, even though the third match of their debut Premier League campaign was the first that they have failed to win. Southampton proved to be the finest team David Wagner’s side have encountered so far, but the visitors were second best for much of this match.\n\n“The players have seen now that, even in the Premier League, if they follow their identity and be brave, then they have a chance,” said Wagner. “Seven points, three clean sheets and into the next round of the [Carabao] Cup – it is a perfect start for us.”\n\nMake that ‘almost perfect’. With sharper finishing in the first half here, Huddersfield might have plundered maximum points. “We could have killed the game in the first half,” said Wagner, whose team shook up the visitors in the opening period, but could not deliver a telling blow. Southampton, mind you, suffered from a similar problem late on, when they rallied powerfully.\n\nJoselu blows away Newcastle gloom and adds to the pressure on Slaven Bilic Read more\n\nAs so often during Huddersfield’s recent rise, a vibrant atmosphere in the John Smith’s Stadium was inspired and matched by the home players. Wagner’s team is well known by now, but to be forewarned is not always to be forearmed, and Southampton seemed to be taken aback by the ferocity of the hosts’ pressing and the swiftness of their attacking.\n\nDespite suffering several scares in the early minutes, the visitors created the first clear scoring opportunity thanks to the enduring class of Steven Davis.\n\nIn the 13th minute, the Northern Irishman unhinged the home defence with a pass behind Tommy Smith, sending Nathan Redmond through on goal. The winger, famously compared to Thierry Henry by Southampton’s former manager Claude Puel, tried to replicate one of the French striker’s characteristic finishes, but his low curling shot went wide of the far post.\n\nHuddersfield were quick to respond, Mathias Jorgensen forcing a save from Fraser Forster with a header. Then Southampton asserted their quality again, Cédric Soares and Dusan Tadic combining slickly to serve Davis, who was thwarted by an excellent tackle by Chris Löwe. Soon, Maya Yoshida had to make a similar intervention at the other end to deny Elias Kachunga. After that tit-for-tat exchange, Huddersfield bossed the first half.\n\nFor all their dynamic adventure, Huddersfield’s best chance in the first half came courtesy of an error by Forster, who fumbled an over-hit cross into the path of Kachunga. Luckily for the goalkeeper, Kachunga seemed too surprised by the mistake to exploit it. Forster saved the striker’s weak shot with his feet.\n\nThe second period was more balanced, and as time ebbed away Southampton launched a series of dangerous counterattacks.\n\nGloom for Crystal Palace after Tammy Abraham inspires Swansea to easy win Read more\n\nRedmond was guilty of shooting straight at Jonas Lössl from 15 yards out after fine service by Shane Long. In stoppage time, Southampton’s left-back, Ryan Bertrand, encapsulated the late switch of momentum by storming forward to get on the end of a header. Smith cleared it off the line to preserve Huddersfield’s sequence of clean sheets.\n\n“That showed our desire and our togetherness, and those are the reasons we have these clean sheets,” said Wagner, who welcomed the forthcoming international break because his players need to replenish their energy. “Although even Huddersfield now have eight players going off on international duty,” added the manager, noting a further demonstration of his club’s rise.\n\nWagner also confirmed he is poised to sign former England international Rob Green as reserve goalkeeper. “He is an experienced guy and a good guy; he knows the role I expect from him over the next 10 months,” said Wagner of the 37-year-old."}, {"date": "26/08/2017", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52093,

Ashley that his summer transfer market parsimony has been fully justified\n\nFine performances from Joselu, Ciaran Clark, Mikel Merino, Isaac Hayden, Matt Ritchie and Chancel Mbemba, in particular, certainly suggested that Newcastle United’s squad might not be quite as weak as their manager fears after all.\n\nYet if Ashley feels this represents glorious vindication of his idiosyncratic ownership model, there is a caveat: West Ham United were poor, very poor. Slaven Bilic’s body language never really embraces joyous but nor does the Croatian usually look quite as utterly miserable as he did standing on the edge of the technical area.\n\nIt remains extremely early days but, as Newcastle celebrated their first Premier League goals, and points, of the new season, West Ham headed for the bottom of the table. Their concession of 10 goals in three games only intensifies the sense that Bilic’s hold on his job is fragile. Indeed, it is not inconceivable that the Hammers board could attempt to replace him with Benítez before the clocks go back.\n\nGloom for Crystal Palace after Tammy Abraham inspires Swansea to easy win Read more\n\n“It’s still very early,” said the West Ham manager when asked about the apparent precariousness of his position. “It’s disturbing and I’m worried but I’m not panicking. It was a very difficult afternoon. Newcastle were better in every aspect of the game, they had more power and determination and they were first to second balls.”\n\nIn contrast Benítez was smiling broadly for the first time in weeks. Asked if the afternoon had reminded him of why he had come to St James’ Park in the first place, his reply proved telling. “Yes,” he said. “It’s the fans, the city, the stature of the club, when everything is right, you can enjoy it – and today everything was right. The way we won, the performance of the team and the connection between fans and players was, for me, ideal.”\n\nNot that he will stop agitating Ashley. “We have to have new players,” stressed the Spaniard. “Nothing has changed. Hopefully we can do what we want.”\n\nPlaying under a bright blue sky, his side started slowly, their initial play proving somewhat less sparkling than the welcome August sunshine. With the excellent Hayden and Merino impressing in central midfield, they were the better side but took time to make their final ball count.\n\nThen, just as the atmosphere among another full house began turning edgy, Bilic’s 18-year-old midfielder Declan Rice lost possession to Ritchie and Merino’s inspired through ball picked out Christian Atsu. The winger squared unselfishly for the hard-working Joselu who, under pressure from two defenders, extended his right boot to give them the lead from close range.\n\nThanks to that moment of incision on the part of his £5m signing from Stoke, a look of something resembling mild contentment flickered across Benítez’s face.\n\nNewcastle’s first league goal of the season seemed to remove much of the early tension from their play, dictating that passes were no longer snatched or mis-placed. Indeed, by half time they were settling into something approaching a rhythmic passing groove.\n\nPoor Rice looked out of his depth and it came as no surprise when he was replaced by Manuel Lanzini at the interval. Not that this switch had much impact on the balance of power as Newcastle’s continued superiority manifested itself in Joselu – by now heading for cult-hero status among the Gallowgate End – creating a chance for Ayoze Pérez, whose left-foot shot was well saved by Joe Hart.\n\nShortly afterwards Benítez’s players weathered a pivotal moment. This time, the otherwise barely troubled Rob Elliot was the goalkeeper being stretched to the limit, performing wonders to repel Aaron Cresswell’s ferocious shot before Clark cleared Javier Hernández’s follow up off the line.\n\nWatford’s Miguel Britos sees red for late tackle as Brighton gain first point Read more\n\nSuitably warned, Newcastle upped their tempo and, in a near symmetrical cameo at the other end, Hart saved smartly from Ritchie with Pablo Zabaleta scooping off the line to deny Joselu a tap in.\n\nNo sooner had the tiring Spanish centre-forward departed to a standing ovation – to be replaced by Aleksandar Mitrovic – than his side scored again. This time Ritchie danced past Lanzini before crossing sublimely for Clark to beat Hart with a header which went in off a post. Considering Clark, deployed out of position at left-back, had enjoyed an outstanding afternoon in defence there could hardly have been a more appropriate scorer.\n\nBy the time Mitrovic connected with Ritchie’s through ball and rounded Hart to score a wildly acclaimed third, West Ham looked to have long since surrendered. “Every club has its ups and downs and it’s my job to be confident,” said Bilic. “But we did not look good today.”"}, {"date": "26/08/2017", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20181, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [],

"While a first ever Premier League point is not to be sniffed at Brighton will wonder how they did not tick off all the mini missions they need to convince themselves they mean business at the highest echelon of the English game. Three matches in and a goal still eludes them. A confidence-boosting win is still needed as soon as possible. It was not for want of trying, here, particularly when Watford’s numbers were depleted in the 24th minute after Miguel Britos was sent off when his dangerous, hotheaded challenge left Anthony Knockaert floored.\n\nThe flashpoint happened when Knockaert, performing with elan in his first start of the season, gave chase with a searing run down the wing only to be halted in violent fashion by Britos. A late, knee-high, studs-up, airborne tackle looked ugly and Chris Hughton was concerned that it might have caused serious injury to his player. The Uruguayan defender looked aghast when the referee Graham Stott appeared with a red card – unfortunately for him, three dismissals in his last 11 Premier League games at Vicarage Road does not make a great case for leniency.\n\nJoselu blows away Newcastle gloom and adds to the pressure on Slaven Bilic Read more\n\nIt is obvious that a player oversteps the mark when his own manager makes no attempt to excuse him. “It’s a red card, a fair red card as well,” said Marco Silva. “It is not a normal situation. We need to keep focus and keep our emotional balance and in that moment he didn’t do that. With an experienced player like him it’s impossible to lose your control and emotional balance.” He plans to talk to Britos about the ramifications of a rash moment of serious indiscipline.\n\nQuite apart from the fact it reflects poorly all round, it shaped the rest of the game. The home team had to redraw their gameplan and lean on a defensive ethos. It gave Brighton the initiative. The Seagulls will not have too many invitations as plain as this to gather three precious Premier League points. Gaps opened up for them to carve out chances. Twice they hit the post. Heurelho Gomes stepped in with a handful of important saves. Yet long periods of dominance spent peppering the goal protected by Watford’s 10 men ended with a gnawing frustration that they could not take more positives on the journey home. “I would veer towards two points dropped,” Hughton said on the choice between viewing the result with optimism or disappointment.\n\nKnockaert was the focal point for Brighton as they searched for a breakthrough. He was involved in most of their attempts and the pick of the bunch came when he hit a beautifully bending shot against a post.\n\nHuddersfield’s winning run ends after Southampton soak up pressure Read more\n\nThe Frenchman was also involved in the game’s other pivotal moment when he was challenged by Abdoulaye Doucouré with a high foot in the box. Hughton felt it should have been a penalty. “You only have to look at Anthony’s nose to see that there was contact,” he explained. “I spoke to the referee. He wasn’t sure. If he isn’t sure he can’t give it, hence he gave an indirect free-kick. As a newly promoted team you need as much fortune in decisions to go your way.” It was not to be.\n\nSilva took some satisfaction that his team showed the concentration and resolve to stick at it with 10 men and make sure they did not lose. “It was a good moment because they showed to me what I want: work together, good commitment,” he said. Unbeaten in the Premier League, the Watford manager gave the impression this was one to file away and move on from assertively.\n\nFor Brighton, the quest for goals goes on."}, {"date": "26/08/2017",

contest only two minutes when he sparked Manchester United’s third successive league victory.\n\nOn as a 68th-minute substitute, the 19-year-old initially won a corner when his cross was deflected out. Then from Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s delivery Rashford hit an instant finish beyond the Leicester City goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, for his first goal of the season.\n\nThis followed Romelu Lukaku’s saved penalty just after the break and when fellow substitute Marouane Fellaini doubled the advantage eight minutes from time, United were heading for a two-point lead over Huddersfield Town and Manchester City at the top of the table.\n\nManchester United 2-0 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe performance had José Mourinho purring about his side’s resilience. “Normally when you miss a penalty with half an hour to go there is a little collapse,” the manager said. “We kept playing today.”\n\nDespite having started the campaign with two 4-0 wins, Mourinho indicated that each player has to perform to retain their place as he dropped Rashford for Anthony Martial. With Craig Shakespeare opting for the same XI that beat Brighton & Hove Albion 2-0 last Saturday and lost 4-3 at Arsenal the week before that, both sides could be viewed as settled.\n\nWhat Leicester hoped to do was stymie any early United pressure, having conceded here in the 22nd minute in last season’s corresponding fixture. Mourinho’s team went on to win that game 4-1 and here began by hitting Schmeichel’s area with crosses from Martial and Antonio Valencia. The response was a 20-yard Matty James sighter that David de Gea watched roll wide.\n\nOf note during the early exchanges was Martial’s willingness to rove infield to take the ball and drive at the visitors. United were superior in possession, taking residence in Leicester’s half and moving the blue shirts expertly around. When Jamie Vardy threatened to break towards De Gea at speed, Eric Bailly’s assurance in killing the danger underlined United’s control.\n\nJust before the 20-minute mark United appeared to have a fair goal scrubbed out. Lukaku swivelled and fired at Schmeichel. The Dane saved well but the ball rebounded to Juan Mata, who finished having pounced from a seemingly onside position but the assistant referee’s flag was raised.\n\nAfter last year’s two trophies Old Trafford is a more vibrant arena. So it was that the noise ratcheted up when they next attacked. Lukaku threaded a clever pass to Martial along the left, he flipped a cross to the far post and Paul Pogba’s diving attempt went wide of Schmeichel’s right post. A breathless couple of minutes was completed when the keeper’s athleticism was again required to repel an effort from Mata.\n\nLeicester offered flashes of quality in the rare openings they had. Shinji Okazaki’s sudden shot from 25 yards had to be monitored by De Gea but this was as close as the visitors were allowed to the Spaniard’s goal.\n\nMost of the action was at the other end. Twice Pogba unloaded at Schmeichel from long range and Mourinho will have been pleased by how his midfielder bossed proceedings. He will be less happy with United’s inability to make their domination count. The sense was that a first strike might again herald a few goals for the home side, yet as half-time neared the game remained deadlocked as a 35-yard free-kick from Pogba smacked the wall and landed safely in Schmeichel’s hands.\n\nMourinho’s instruction for the second half might have been to be more ruthless. His team’s opening gambit was to pepper Schmeichel’s area again. Mata and Pogba aimed in crosses but both failed to find a team-mate. Martial was one of United’s better performers and it was his darting run that came close to prising Leicester open. He passed to Lukaku, who tried to turn but went down when tussling with Harry Maguire.\n\nJoselu blows away Newcastle gloom and adds to the pressure on Slaven Bilic Read more\n\nNext Martial won the penalty from which Lukaku missed. The forward’s attempted delivery from the left hit Danny Simpson’s arm and Michael Oliver pointed at the spot. After Schmeichel debated the decision with the referee, Lukaku smacked the penalty to his right and the keeper made yet another fine save.\n\nMoments later frustration for United nearly became despair when Riyad Mahrez bamboozled Phil Jones and skipped in along the right but De Gea saved his fierce drive. Next Mkhitaryan spurned a golden opening from Mata’s balletic twirl and pass. Instead of shooting straight away, his elaboration led to the chance vanishing.\n\nWhen Shakespeare brought on Andy King and Demarai Gray for Okazaki and Marc Albrighton before the hour, Mourinho responded by bringing on Rashford for Mata in what proved a decisive move. Almost instantly came Rashford’s moment, as he was left unmarked to volley home. “Set pieces are our achilles heel at the moment,” Shakespeare said.\n\nFrom here United closed the match down, Fellaini’s point-blank finish after some good work by Jesse Lingard – another replacement – sealing victory.\n\nUnited have nine points, have scored 10 times and are yet to concede. It is an excellent beginning to their tilt at claiming a 21st title.\n\nMourinho: I am happy for Marouane, for Jesse, for Marcus\n\nJosé Mourinho praised his substitutes after they were key in maintaining Manchester United’s 100% start to the season in the 2-0 win over Leicester. United head into the international break with nine points from their opening three matches and at the top of the Premier League. They have scored 10 times and are yet to concede.\n\nAfter facing stiff resistance from the visitors and seeing Romelu Lukaka’s penalty saved Mourinho brought on Marcus Rashford, who put United ahead, and Marouane Fellaini, who scored shortly after coming on, having been set up by another substitute, Jesse Lingard, to seal United’s third victory in as many fixtures.\n\nThe 54-year-old refused to take credit for his substitutions but said: “This is about the quality of the players, the players are good, and not just good, they are motivated to help the players. It doesn’t matter if they play from the beginning, if they come from the bench. The group is solid, very, very friendly in between games and [there’s] great empathy. I’m really happy, not for me. When [managers] make changes, we always make the right changes, sometimes it works against us. I’m happy for them, for Marouane, for Jesse, for Marcus.”\n\nMourinho then turned to those critics who argue his tactics are overly defensive. “Maybe they are going to say that [I am defensive] because my team is not conceding goals,” he said. “Maybe they say I am defensive. We are playing well. Maybe in some matches we are going to be defensive and if the opponent is playing better than us we have to be pragmatic and defend but today we didn’t need that. I am not carried away, three matches, nine points is good, 10 goal difference is good.”\n\nHe added: “We are playing well. We didn’t have many matches last season where we played 90 minutes with the control we had today. Is [Jamie] Vardy a very dangerous player? I would say one of the most dangerous in the Premier League. Was he dangerous today? I would say no because we played very well to control that. Were Leicester very dangerous against Arsenal [in a 4-3 defeat]? Yes, I watched the match three times. Were they dangerous against us? No.”\n\nMourinho believes United’s work during the summer is key to the flying start. “We had a very good pre-season,” the manager said. “We worked really well. We had great conditions to work together, to be together in a beautiful atmosphere. We played against good teams, the best team in Europe [Real Madrid] twice. The pre-season was very complete and then we start the Premier League. We are playing well.” Jamie Jackson"}, {"date": "21/08/2017", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54009, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [],

only losing to one of the Premier League’s coming teams but also playing with 10 men because of the sending off that had spoiled Kyle Walker’s first night in front of his new fans.\n\nBy the end, there was even the sense that Pep Guardiola’s players were disappointed they could not complete the recovery and conjure a late, decisive winner once Raheem Sterling, one of their second-half substitutes, had volleyed in an 82nd-minute equaliser.\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin’s late dismissal, after two bookings of his own, had levelled the numbers and City were still smouldering with a sense of injustice at the end because of the nature of Walker’s second booking and the amateur dramatics from Dominic Calvert-Lewin that made it an ignominious home debut for the £50m man.\n\nThe game was not short of talking points and Everton ought to be disappointed they could not make it a second successive win given the story of the first half and another goal for Wayne Rooney to advance the theory that he might yet return to the England set-up.\n\nGareth Southgate, the national team manager, was here in readiness for Thursday’s squad announcement for the World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia and it is not too outlandish to think Rooney could add to his 119 caps.\n\nThis was also his 200th top-division goal, making him only the second player after Alan Shearer to reach that number in the Premier League era, and there was another impressive statistic that showed, approaching the age of 32, he covered more ground than any other Everton player. Calvert-Lewin cannot have been too far behind and it is just a pity, perhaps, that the 20-year-old tarnished an otherwise impressive night with the incident that led to Walker’s second booking in the space of two minutes at the end of the first half.\n\nWalker cannot have too many complaints about the first yellow card for a challenge on Leighton Baines. He was, however, entitled to be aggrieved in the extreme about what happened as he and Calvert-Lewin waited for a high ball to come down. Walker did give his opponent a nudge but it was little more than a gentle reminder of his presence. The collapse from Calvert-Lewin was a deception and the referee, , Bobby Madley, fell for it, having taken the advice of the fourth official, Michael Oliver.\n\nAs the players returned to the pitch for the second half, Guardiola was in the tunnel demonstrating to Oliver what had happened with a little nudge of his own and struggling perhaps to conceal the fact he was obviously livid. It is not often the City manager turns on officials in full view of the TV cameras. On this occasion, however, he had legitimate complaints even if Ronald Koeman argued that Schneiderlin might also have been harshly treated for his two bookings, both for fouls on Sergio Agüero.\n\nAfter being reduced to 10 men, City deserve a lot of credit for still having the ability to trouble the team with the numerical advantage. Gabriel Jesus was removed at half-time and Sterling quickly set about trying to make a favourable impression on the right. Everton were guilty at times of not taking enough care of the ball – Koeman complained that his side had gone long too often – and chose to operate on the counter-attack when the evidence of the first half indicated that Ederson, City’s new goalkeeper, should be put under more sustained pressure.\n\nEderson was brought in from Benfica, at £34.7m, following a wretched first season for Claudio Bravo and Guardiola could probably be forgiven for thinking the new man should have saved Rooney’s shot. Instead, a rare left-foot effort from the Everton man went through Ederson’s legs, ricocheted off a post and the former England captain was wheeling away to celebrate, cupping his ears to the fans who had been berating him because of his Manchester United connections.\n\nRooney’s goal was also an ordeal for Leroy Sané given it was his mistake, trying to keep the ball in play, that gave away possession and left City vulnerable to the attack that saw Calvert-Lewin link up with Mason Holgate before laying on the decisive cross.\n\nA couple of minutes earlier, David Silva had cracked a shot against a post and at that stage, it had looked as though City were getting on top. Yet Phil Jagielka in particular was a difficult opponent for Agüero, denying the striker on a number of occasions with some outstanding defending.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson, Everton’s record signing, came on for his debut after an hour but City kept pressing and never looked disheartened. Danilo, one of their own substitutes, forced a splendid save from Jordan Pickford and, finally, the home side’s perseverance paid off. Danilo sent over the cross from the right, Holgate’s attempted clearance went straight to Sterling and it was a lovely, instinctive volley he sent flying into the corner of the net."}, {"date":

The Terriers are now up there with Manchester United with two wins from two games and if they are not quite hurtling down the motorway at the same speed as José Mourinho’s side, six points and two clean sheets is an early return few in West Yorkshire will have been expecting.\n\nMany in the north-east, on the other hand, will have been unsurprised at Newcastle United’s second defeat of the season. The visitors were 3-1 winners here last season, when both sides were in the Championship, but never produced enough going forward to suggest a repeat might be on the cards. Even when they went behind their commitment to attack was questionable, and unless Rafael Benítez can liven things up with a few quick signings this could be another long season on Tyneside.\n\nIn a game of few clear chances Newcastle arguably had better opportunities than Huddersfield, though they never summoned enough conviction to take them. Town were never in any danger of rivalling Manchester United’s goal difference, moreover, mainly because Newcastle were more composed and better organised than Crystal Palace, though the goal they did score was a thing of beauty. Aaron Mooy will score few better, indeed Frank Worthington, watching approvingly from the stands, would have been happy to claim such a matchwinner.\n\nIt was a magic moment from Aaron... scoring first is always going to be important against a team like Newcastle David Wagner\n\n“It was a magic moment from Aaron,” David Wagner, the Huddersfield manager, said. “I was really pleased with the way we defended the lead, but scoring first is always going to be important against a team as hard to break down as Newcastle.”\n\nThe pattern of the game was established fairly early on, with Newcastle content to soak up the home side’s pressure and wait for occasional chances on the break. Huddersfield did most of the pressing and passing without creating a clear opening in the first half, whereas on the rare occasions their opponents got forward they managed to look slightly more dangerous. Matt Ritchie cut inside from the left to bring the first save of the game from Jonas Lossl, and Christian Atsu was a threat whenever he found space on the right.\n\nNewcastle saw a couple of half‑hearted penalty appeals turned down in the first half, one for a possible handball from Chris Löwe, the other when Dwight Gayle was dispossessed quite fairly by Christopher Schindler, while it took Huddersfield the whole 45 minutes to stretch the visitors’ defence. When they did, Chancel Mbemba got back quickly to snuff out a pass from Elias Kachunga that was in danger of setting Steve Mounié free. The Town striker did not enjoy anything like the freedom he found on the opening day at Crystal Palace, with Newcastle defending capably and refusing to allow any space behind their back-line.\n\nAll that changed early in the second half, when the Terriers came up with the goal the game and the occasion badly needed. Mooy, who had been influential in the first but mostly from deep positions, decided to get further forward and made the breakthrough. Exchanging passes with Kachunga on the left he moved into the area to take the return, then looked up and beat Rob Elliot with a perfectly placed shot that curled just inside the right-hand upright.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joselu was booked after for his late challenge on Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lössl. Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images\n\nNewcastle had to come out and play after that, and Benítez sent on Joselu in place of Gayle, only to see his new striker booked for following through on Lossl. The forward was perfectly entitled to pressurise the goalkeeper when he attempted to clear a back-pass from Kachunga but not to leave a foot in when Lossl reached the ball first.\n\nThe former Stoke player did slightly better in forcing a save from Lossl moments later when Atsu set up a shooting opportunity, though there was no real force behind Joselu’s shot and the goalkeeper found it easy to palm away.\n\nHuddersfield played out the rest of the game as if they were enjoying it, while Newcastle seemed oddly resigned to defeat. Their only real chance of salvaging a point came 10 minutes from the end when the magical substitute Jacob Murphy found himself in an advanced position, but a good recovery tackle from Löwe cleared the danger before the Newcastle player could manage a shot.\n\nAfter the game it was put to a glum Benítez, himself appearing oddly resigned to defeat, that Huddersfield had managed to build on their promotion momentum while Newcastle’s had all but evaporated. “They were playing at home for the first time in the Premier League, we knew they would be excited,” the Newcastle manager said. “I think we can improve but you are right. Promotion was a long time ago.”"}, {"date": "20/08/2017", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 73587, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Janssen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [30], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tiemoué Bakayoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24, 88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charly Musonda", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [82], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fikayo Tomori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Scott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It has taken a little longer than Chelsea would have liked but, finally, they have reminded everybody of the qualities that elevated them to the Premier League title last season. They played on Sunday as though affronted by the criticism that has engulfed them over the previous week. Their season has lift-off and, though it would be stretching the truth to say one result resolves all their issues, they were barely recognisable from the team that finished against Burnley looking in need of smelling salts.\n\nTottenham Hotspur v Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAntonio Conte’s men have had to withstand an awful lot of scrutiny since capsizing against the team from Turf Moor. Their response was the kind of performance that should answer a lot of the questions about their character and powers of endurance. For a team apparently teetering on the brink of crisis, they looked an awful lot like the side that had left everyone in their wing-mirrors last season.\n\nThey had to do it the hard way, missing key personnel against the team that chased them harder than anyone to that title success. Yet the aberration against Burnley feels almost freakish given the story of this follow-up win and the strength of personality shown by a newly assembled and experimental side. Another team might have wilted after Michy Batshuayi, one of Chelsea’s second-half substitutes, had headed in the own-goal that provided Spurs with an 82nd-minute equaliser but not Chelsea. The decisive goal, Marcos Alonso’s second of the afternoon, was a personal ordeal for Hugo Lloris in the Spurs goal but what does it say about Chelsea that they could recover from Batshuayi’s misfortune to conjure up a winner in the 88th minute?\n\nThe answer almost certainly is that nobody should entirely write off the idea of a successful title defence just yet. Chelsea had to withstand some long spells of pressure after Alonso’s elegant free-kick had given them a first-half lead and, totting up the number of chances for Harry Kane alone, it was difficult even to keep count of the number of occasions when last season’s golden-boot winner let fly from all sorts of distances and angles. Kane hit the post with one first-half effort and there were other times when Chelsea were grateful to Thibaut Courtois’ goalkeeping. They defended with great resilience, in complete contrast to that 3-2 defeat on the opening weekend, and in the process they made it a demoralising way for Mauricio Pochettino’s team to begin their tenancy of Wembley.\n\nSpurs, lest it be forgotten, went unbeaten at White Hart Lane last season for the first time since the 1964-65 campaign. After one game at Wembley they have already been defeated and this result will advance the theory that it is not going to be easy for last season’s runners-up to adjust to life at the national stadium. Spurs have now lost eight of their last 10 games here, if penalty shootouts count. Four have come against Chelsea and the latest must feel particularly galling given the sense beforehand that this was a ripe moment to face the champions.\n\nIt certainly looked that way given Chelsea had a new-look defence, with David Luiz pushed forward into midfield, and three players on the bench – Fikayo Tomori, Charly Musonda and Kyle Scott – who would not ordinarily have been involved but for the combination of injuries, suspensions and transfer-market frustrations that have darkened Conte’s mood lately.\n\nÁlvaro Morata had a stodgy afternoon, including one miss early on – unchallenged inside the six-yard area – that would embarrass any professional footballer, let alone one who had cost an initial £58m. Otherwise Chelsea’s recruits all demonstrated their worth. Antonio Rüdiger excelled alongside the equally impressive Andreas Christensen, deputising for the suspended Gary Cahill. Tiémoué Bakayoko played with great energy and, though Spurs had plenty of the ball in promising positions, it was also the case that, when Batshuayi headed Christian Eriksen’s free-kick into his own net to make it 1-1, it was at a point of the game when the home side were looking short of ideas.\n\nIt was an embattled, streetwise performance from Chelsea but they could also reflect on Willian skimming a second-half shot against the post and, when it comes to Alonso’s contribution, the first goal in particular was a beauty. Spurs had a five-man defensive wall in place and the players making up that protective barrier could not be accused of deserting their positions. Alonso still had the guile to beat everyone with the trajectory of his curling left-footed shot. It was the perfect combination of bend and leverage and it finished with the ball arcing into the top corner of Lloris’s goal.\n\nUnfortunately for Lloris Alonso’s second goal was the result of poor goalkeeping on the part of the France international. To start with, his throw to Victor Wanyama put his team-mate under pressure in a central area of the pitch, inside the Spurs half. Wanyama should still have done better but Spurs, with too many players out of position, were vulnerable as soon as he lost possession. Pedro, another of Chelsea’s substitutes, slipped the pass into Alonso’s path and his low, powerfully struck shot inside the near post seemed to catch Lloris by surprise."}, {"date": "19/08/2017",

ahead for Manchester United but his players have navigated their way through the first two games of the season serenely enough, collecting maximum points, scoring freely and looking like a side who have all the credentials to mount a legitimate challenge for the Premier League title.\n\nThese are early days, of course, and United will certainly face much tougher examinations than those posed by West Ham United and Swansea City. Yet there is something ominous about the fact that they have started by racking up four goals in each of the opening two league games – the first time United have done that since 1907 – and also demonstrated that they have the ability to go through the gears as and when required.\n\nJosé Mourinho wary of roadworks despite Manchester United’s fast start Read more\n\nThat shift came in the final 10 minutes here as United, with a devastating spell of attacking football, scored three goals in the space of 221 seconds to not just take the game away from Swansea but inflict a thumping defeat. Romelu Lukaku, who had been kept quiet for much of the game, registered his third United goal while Paul Pogba and Anthony Martial also scored for the second successive game.\n\nIt was, in short, a perfect away day for Mourinho, although the United manager is not getting carried away. When the statistics about the start of the 20th century were thrown at him afterwards he responded by pointing out that United won the first two games last season and ended up sixth. The key difference between that team and this one, according to Mourinho, is confidence.\n\nThe question Mourinho is interested to answer is how his team respond to going behind – something the United manager came close to discovering after only three minutes when Jordan Ayew hit the crossbar from an acute angle. That, however, was as close as Swansea came to scoring on an afternoon when their attacking limitations in the absence of the departed Gylfi Sigurdsson and the injured Fernando Llorente were once again laid bare. Swansea have failed to score in their first two matches of the season and registered only one shot on target – an overhead kick from Martin Olsson that was more of a cross and comfortably caught by David de Gea.\n\nPaul Clement badly needs the Sigurdsson fee to be reinvested and fast. Swansea’s net spend this summer is the lowest in the Premier League and that has been reflected in their performances against Southampton and now United. “When you haven’t got Gylfi, Llorente, who is injured, and Ki Sung-yueng, who finished the season strongly, we’re weaker,” Swansea’s head coach said. “Texts, emails and telephone calls are going back and forth between various parties [with a view to making signings] because the necessity is there, it’s clear. We need to do some good business.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eric Bailly opens the scoring for Manchester United just before half-time. Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/EPA\n\nDespite the emphatic nature of the scoreline, this had actually started as one of those days when United needed to be patient as Swansea, playing with a five-man defence, sat deep. The visitors got a little frustrated at times. Marcus Rashford showed flashes of brilliance but also moments of petulance and Pogba was involved in that incident with Olsson not long after being booked for a foul on Tom Carroll. It felt like one of those challenges that would almost certainly have led to a yellow card had Pogba not already been booked.\n\nThe breakthrough arrived for United on the stroke of half-time. Daley Blind’s corner exposed some poor marking in the Swansea defence, leaving Pogba with a free header. The Frenchman’s effort was flicked on to the bar via Lukasz Fabianski’s fingertips, bounced on the line and Eric Bailly, reacting much quicker than Federico Fernández, who seemed to be expecting the Swansea keeper to jump to his feet, stabbed home. It was Bailly’s first league goal in 67 appearances for three different clubs.\n\nSwansea City v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nClement felt the need to make a couple of attacking changes early in the second half – “I don’t want to be a coach that’s happy to lose 1-0 at home,” –but Swansea never seriously threatened to equalise and the game was in effect over for them when Lukaku, set up by Henrikh Mkhitaryan and in so much space, swept a left-footed shot past Fabianski.\n\nAfter that Swansea capitulated. Carroll’s wayward pass was intercepted by Pogba, who played a one-two with Mkhitaryan, continued his run and deftly lifted the ball over the advancing Fabianski. In the blink of an eye it was 4-0 as Martial, teed up by Pogba, calmly slotted in the fourth. “The second goal was a gift,” Clement said. “And then we played into their strengths, 2-0 down, trying to get a goal back, a loose pass, you get hit on the counterattack and then another counterattack, 4-0. It’s a hard one to take in the end.”"}, {"date": "19/08/2017", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10501, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows":

Howe has managed to pull off at Bournemouth was brought into stark relief once again with an early home defeat at the hands of a Watford side who look ready to kick on from a disappointing end to last season.\n\nWith Watford having more physicality, more pace and the technical ability to match the hosts, there was only going to be one winner when the match opened up after a tight first half. Goals from the impressive Brazilian signing Richarlison and Étienne Capoue were enough to earn Marco Silva his first away win in the Premier League. For Bournemouth a belated appearance from Jermain Defoe was not enough to turn the tide.\n\nLeicester’s Okazaki and Maguire give Brighton harsh lesson in top-flight life Read more\n\n“Of course, I am happy,” Silva said. “Our second half was really very good. I like to control every moment of the game and we did that. Normally when they play at home they cause opponents problems but we controlled it very well. And we had personality. The players did everything as we prepared it.”\n\nFor Howe, all his preparation went to waste as the Cherries served up their second insipid performance on the trot after an opening-day defeat at West Brom. “It’s incredibly frustrating not just for me but for the players who feel the same as I do,” Howe said. “I know we’re a lot better than that but I thought our tempo was too slow last week and it was a similar problem today. I wanted a quick game, it’s the best way for us to play. But it was slow again, too methodical.”\n\nBenik Afobe started up front ahead of Defoe for Bournemouth and could have opened the scoring in the seventh minute only to balloon Heurelho Gomes’s parry over the bar. He had another effort later in the half that Gomes saved and one more when he failed to do justice to a Ryan Fraser cross in the opening minute of the second half.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Étienne Capoue scores Watford’s second goal from 25 yards.

Substitute Capoue sealed the match with four minutes remaining, lashing the ball home with precision from 25 yards out.\n\n“I know very well the player, we have watched him for the previous months,” said Silva of the skilful Richarlison, an £11m summer signing from Fluminense. “He’s a talent but he’s a player who comes every day to work hard and I’m happy. We have to be calm with him, he’s a young boy experiencing his first moments in Europe, and he doesn’t speak one word of English. But it’s not a surprise for me how he played.”"}, {"date": "19/08/2017", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19619, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [],

Premier League history to come off the bench, score and be sent off in a lively 20-minute cameo that earned Albion their second straight 1-0 success.\n\nSadio Mané makes vital breakthrough for Liverpool against Crystal Palace Read more\n\nHis dismissal came seven minutes from time when the upper part of his forearm caught Matthew Lowton in the head as Robson-Kanu attempted to challenge him for a header in the air, with the referee, Martin Atkinson, immediately showing a red card.\n\n“He took his goal really well, it was a good goal, and then he’s sent off so it’s obviously disappointing,” Pulis said. “I’ve not seen it but I will have a good look at it afterwards and then I’ll comment on it. Whether it was or wasn’t, the referee has made the decision so we had to get on with it.\n\n“It was difficult [after he was sent off]. He was sent off with seven minutes to go and it seemed like an hour. We had to defend for our lives. What Burnley do, they do very, very well and they deserve a lot of credit for it. We have had to ride our luck but the lads have fought and fought all game.”\n\nIt is Albion’s best start to a Premier League season and it has been achieved without their captain, Jonny Evans, who was once again absent due to a hamstring problem.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hal Robson-Kanu is sent off late in the match by Martin Atkinson. Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images via Reuters\n\nWest Brom have turned down a bid from Manchester City for Evans and Pulis reiterated that his omission was injury-related, rather than anything to do with the interest in him. “Jonny’s not the type of lad, even if Man City were involved, not to play a game of football if he was fit,” Pulis added. “He’s a smashing lad, I’ve got a lot of time for him and he’s been fantastic for us. This injury came about before Manchester City have made an enquiry.”\n\nBurnley had nearly 70% of possession, a rarity for them, but managed just one attempt on target and were made to pay for their wastefulness by Robson‑Kanu.\n\nRegarding his later dismissal, Sean Dyche had no doubt the decision was correct. “It’s a definite red that has to be given,” the Burnley manager said. “It’s a late elbow, I don’t think it’s malicious, it’s the flow of the body more than anything, but it’s still an elbow to the face.”\n\nDespite the result, Dyche was upbeat about what he saw from a team that defeated the champions, Chelsea, at Stamford Bridge the previous weekend. “I thought it was a good performance,” he said. “You end up scratching your head that you don’t get something, particularly when you perform so well, other than a smack up pitch that we didn’t deal with really.\n\nRicharlison and Capoue strikes reward battling Watford at Bournemouth Read more\n\n“I thought we limited them to very few chances and made a number ourselves. I’m disappointed with the outcome but definitely not the performance.”\n\nDyche refused to comment directly when asked about the decision by the striker Chris Wood, wanted by Burnley for £15m, to rule himself out of Leeds’ game at Sunderland and release a statement about his desire to play in the Premier League. “I choose to not look at other players in the public arena, I prefer to keep our

All Leicester City needed to register their first win of the season were toothless opponents, and in that respect, Brighton fitted the bill nicely.\n\nIt helped, of course, that the Foxes were ahead within a minute. While Craig Shakespeare’s side were unchanged from that beaten 4-3 at Arsenal in their opening fixture, it was immediately apparent Shinji Okazaki would be playing in a more advanced role; too often last season the 31-year-old was peripheral, though in fairness it is not easy to get involved when you are sitting on the bench.\n\nHaving scored in the fifth minute at Arsenal, Okazaki wasted barely 60 seconds in making his case: Riyad Mahrez did not so much embarrass as humiliate Albion left-back Markus Suttner as he cut into the area from the right, and though the goalkeeper Mat Ryan blocked the low shot, Okazaki was on hand to tuck away the rebound.\n\nWith the visitors offering the square root of nothing going forward, the rest of the match was an absolute stroll for City. They created a few more chances in the first half, the best when Okazaki turned a Jamie Vardy cross just wide from close range, and made the game safe – as if it wasn’t already – early in the second period when centre-half Harry Maguire endeared himself to the Leicester faithful on his home debut by nodding in Mahrez’s corner. And other than Vardy limping off in injury time, that really was that.\n\nWith little to talk about regarding the game, the questions for Shakespeare concerned the future of Mahrez, one of a number of Leicester players who may be on the move before the transfer window closes. The Algeria international winger could not be accused of downing tools, as Shakespeare acknowledged.\n\n“Riyad knows while he’s here he needs to be respectful of his team-mates and the club, and credit to him, he was today. He’s the type of player who enjoys his football – he’s that kid in the playground who wants to train and play all the time, and he set us off today,” said the Leicester manager.\n\nShakespeare then turned to his other absentees, several of whom, including Danny Drinkwater, Robert Huth and Nampalys Mendy, are expected to return to full training next week. The impending fitness of the new signing Kelechi Iheanacho is less clear, the former Manchester City striker having aggravated a toe injury, but assuming his return is not long delayed, the competition for places looks likely to be healthy, even if one or two depart the King Power.\n\nHow Chris Hughton would relish a similar problem. After having just 23% possession in their first match against Manchester City, Brighton had the ball more frequently against a Leicester side whose forte remains speedy thrusts but the visitors had little idea what to do in terms of creating chances.\n\n“When you come here the last thing you need to do is go one-nil down so early but we certainly weren’t at the level we needed to be,” said Hughton.\n\nWhether the new £13.5m signing José Izquierdo can make the sort of improvement Brighton need seems unlikely.\n\n“I’m disappointed with the performance but we will have many of these this season, and it’s about staying in there and getting back into games like this,” said Hughton. “What we can’t afford to do is let our heads go down. I know our players can and will play better than they did today.

The same applied to his team’s performance against defensive opposition until a gift from Luka Milivojevic and a predatory finish from Sadio Mané lifted the curse of Crystal Palace here.\n\nLiverpool’s first league win of the campaign and first home win over Palace in four years was merited. Their focus was admirable, too, given Barcelona’s persistent pursuit of Coutinho produced a third bid for the injured Brazil international, and third rejection from Liverpool, on the eve of the game. But it took that unforced error from Milivojevic and a glaring miss from Christian Benteke against his old club to ease Liverpool’s recurring frustrations on home soil.\n\nFrank de Boer almost succeeded where many others have led in thwarting Liverpool with a defensive display, yet Palace’s difficult start continued courtesy of their own failings. “We played very concentrated for 95 minutes,” said Palace’s new, and winless, manager.\n\n“The chances we get, you have to punish them. Christian had the biggest one. I said to the team if you keep playing with this kind of intensity and discipline the results will come. To lose 1-0 is very disappointing because we deserved more but I am convinced if we show this every week the results will come.”\n\nLiverpool’s victory rewarded their manager’s faith in his resources. The importance of the Champions League playoff and the effect of Tuesday’s first leg in Hoffenheim was writ large on the Liverpool team-sheet. Klopp made five changes to the side that started the midweek win in Germany, shifting Mohamed Salah to the bench and resting Trent Alexander-Arnold in readiness for the return leg on Wednesday. In their place came Daniel Sturridge and Joe Gomez, though it was Andy Robertson at left-back who made the biggest impression.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joël Matip misses a chance as Liverpool struggled to break Crystal Palace down. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images via Reuters\n\nLiverpool’s £10m summer signing from Hull City adapted well on his full debut. The quality of his crossing immediately stood out and will prove a potent asset for Liverpool this season and they should have capitalised swiftly. Wayne Hennessey, the Palace goalkeeper, failed to connect with an inch-perfect Robertson delivery from the left leaving Joel Matip with a free header in front of an unguarded net. The defender headed wastefully wide.\n\nSouthampton’s Charlie Austin crushes West Ham’s 10-man fightback Read more\n\nJames Milner tested the visiting keeper, Mané miscued from another Robertson cross and Sturridge struck the wall with a free-kick but the changes had an inevitable impact on Liverpool’s rhythm. Palace also take credit for a more resilient showing than at home to Huddersfield. Palace’s formation remained the same as in the opening day 3-0 defeat but their defensive duties were executed properly here, albeit while sacrificing support to Benteke, Andros Townsend and Jason Puncheon in the opposition half.\n\n“The football could have been much better in the first half, 100%,” said Klopp. “But I was happy with the chances we created in the second half. The first half was about making the right decision at the right moment. We showed the players at half-time where the spaces are ‘one pass and then the world is much nicer’ and they used that in the second half. The crosses from Robbo especially were good but in the first half we had nobody in the box.”\n\nRicharlison and Capoue strikes reward battling Watford at Bournemouth Read more\n\nThere was more urgency to Liverpool’s performance after the restart. Georginio Wijnaldum and Jordan Henderson forced Hennessey to save at full stretch and the introduction of Salah for Sturridge restored balance to the home attack, allowing Firmino to return to a central role. But it was Benteke who had the best chance of the game before Mané’s winner. Ruben Loftus-Cheek rolled Ragnar Klavan inside the Liverpool area before cutting the ball back from the by-line. The centre-forward timed his run perfectly but the same could not be said of his finish, blazed over from seven yards with only Simon Mignolet to beat.\n\nIt was a rare opportunity Palace could not afford to squander, although their eventual punishment was self-inflicted. Patrick van Aanholt blocked from Mané and Wijnaldum in a goal-mouth scramble but just as the travelling support began to sense a shutout, and the home crowd became edgy, Palace imploded. Or, to be precise and blunt, Milivojevic imploded to cost his team.\n\nThe Serbia midfielder was under no pressure when he intercepted a cross-field ball facing his own goal. Two careless touches, however, carried the ball away from Milivojevic and into the path of Mane who seized on the invitation to sweep beyond Hennessey at close range.\n\n“I don’t think it was a lack of concentration but he was out of control,” said De Boer. “I don’t know exactly what happened.

Austin sent Joe Hart, the West Ham goalkeeper, the wrong way as Mauricio Pellegrino clinched his first win as Southampton manager in a dramatic finale. After the visitors had trailed by two goals, Javier Hernández rolled back the years with a couple of trademark finishes but it proved not quite enough to get the Hammers off the hook.\n\nAs Slaven Bilic put it, they “knew what we are getting” with Hernández, a £16m summer signing from Bayer Leverkusen. There was a concerning familiarity about the problems at the other end, though, with his vulnerable back line, that has now been breached seven times in just two matches.\n\nSadio Mané makes vital breakthrough for Liverpool against Crystal Palace Read more\n\nManolo Gabbiadini opened the scoring, ending Southampton supporters’ 587-minute wait for a home goal in the process. Dusan Tadic then doubled Saints’ lead from the penalty spot, shortly after Marko Arnautovic was given a red card for an elbow on Jack Stephens.\n\nBilic revealed Arnautovic, who posted an apology to supporters on Instagram, also said sorry to team-mates who played more than an hour without him. “It is hard to play with 10 men for such a long time,” the West Ham manager said. “We are all gutted to know we lost a point but we gained a lot of positive things from this performance.”\n\nWest Ham settled quicker and could have taken the lead through Arnautovic who drilled wide after being slid through by Michail Antonio.\n\nSouthampton did not look dangerous until Gabbiadini was rewarded for coming deep to collect the ball. After a neat give and go with Nathan Redmond, the striker burst into a gaping hole between Angelo Ogbonna and José Fonte and scuffed his effort home. It was a goal that punctured West Ham’s promising start, before Arnautovic totally deflated them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lee Mason shows Marko Arnautovic a red card. Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images via Reuters\n\nAfter Stephens had played the ball, Arnautovic played anything but, leading with his elbow on the Southampton defender, who fell to ground. The referee, Lee Mason, had little choice but to give Arnautovic a straight red card. It was not the kind of impact West Ham’s watching owners, David Sullivan and David Gold, had hoped for from their £20m club-record signing, who strutted down the tunnel, kicking the floor in anger as he went. Moments before his sending-off, he had gone close, stooping to head Hernández’s low cross from the right.\n\nThen things got worse, with Southampton awarded a penalty after 37 minutes. Fonté tugged on Steven Davis’s shirt inside the box and up stepped Tadic to convert from 12 yards, via Hart’s legs. It summed up a difficult afternoon for the former Southampton captain. But just as Saints were cruising towards half-time, Hernández gave West Ham a lifeline, poking home after Fraser Forster parried Antonio’s hopeful effort from distance. It was his first Premier League goal since April 2014, for Manchester United at Newcastle.\n\nLeicester’s Okazaki and Maguire give Brighton harsh lesson in top-flight life Read more\n\nAfter the interval, Gabbiadini rattled the crossbar from 25 yards in an otherwise stale start to the second half. Bilic made a couple of personnel changes, introducing Diafra Sakho in place of Antonio, who was making his first appearance in four months after a hamstring injury. Sakho made a rapid impact too. His powerful header from Aaron Cresswell’s whipped cross was pushed on to the bar by Forster but again lurking to tap home was Hernández after 74 minutes.\n\n“I think after the second goal, we were a little bit relaxed – not in terms of concentration but in terms of being clinical enough to score the third one,” Pellegrino said. “When you give the chance to an opponent to grab opportunities, you will be in trouble.”\n\nSouthampton responded by throwing on the strikers Austin and Shane Long in search of a winner themselves. Long had a goal correctly disallowed after Ryan Bertrand fouled Hart before Redmond crashed an effort on to the crossbar. Eventually, though, Saints got their reward, a minute into added time.

win on an evening when Arsenal suggested theirs may be another frustrating Premier League campaign.\n\nArsène Wenger’s side ended up bombarding Butland yet lacked a ruthless edge. The sight of the record £52m signing Lacazette – anonymous apart from the disallowed 72nd-minute finish after his foot had been marginally in an offside position when the ball was played forward – being taken off near the close summed up their bluntness.\n\nArsène Wenger criticises Granit Xhaka and referee after defeat at Stoke Read more\n\nThe result allowed Mark Hughes to have a pop at Stoke naysayers who believe the team’s prime tactic is to spoil. “We have been criticised a bit, some of it unfair,” the home manager said. “We’ll take valid criticism but when we get things going we’ll always be a feature in this league.”\n\nBoth teams had had shaky opening displays. Stoke went down 1-0 at Everton and Arsenal had to come from behind to grab a late 4-3 victory over Leicester City at the Emirates Stadium. This was the Potters’ first home outing and so an inaugural performance at an enhanced Bet365 Stadium that boasts a new south-east quadrant, raising capacity to just over 30,000.\n\nAmid a raucous, vibrant atmosphere, the game began in invigorating, end-to-end style that continued until the break. Darren Fletcher sparked proceedings with a run and pass to Rodríguez, whose shot was smothered by Petr Cech. Next Arsenal roved forward via Héctor Bellerín. The wing-back surged into Stoke’s area and a precisely timed Kurt Zouma tackle was required to kill the danger.\n\nAfter a Granit Xhaka corner broke and fell to Danny Welbeck, who miskicked, Aaron Ramsey got in down the left-hand channel. His attempted shot rolled to Butland but this area was proving a popular one for Arsenal. Next a precise Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain pass found Welbeck and Butland needed to be alert to repel the attempt.\n\nHughes had made two changes from the defeat at Goodison Park, the new signings Rodríguez and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting coming in for Saido Berahino and Bojan Krkic. The manager’s strategy lasted only 25 minutes, though. Xherdan Shaqiri took a knock and so Berahino replaced him in a rejig that pushed Choupo-Moting to the right. Wenger decided on two changes, too, as Ramsey replaced Mohamed Elneny and Shkodran Mustafi came in for Rob Holding.\n\nIn addition to the broken leg Ramsey suffered from a Ryan Shawcross challenge here in February 2010, Rodríguez also faced his own injury-nemesis in Sead Kolasinac, Arsenal’s free summer transfer from Schalke. The Spaniard, who arrived at Stoke on loan from Paris Saint-Germain earlier in the week, had his rise at Real Madrid halted by a Kolasinac tackle that caused an anterior cruciate tear in a Champions League last-16 game in March 2014.\n\nRodríguez was among Stoke’s brightest players as half-time approached. He will have been disappointed with a weak effort that hit Cech but a willingness to take on and beat Arsenal players posed the visitors awkward questions. Before kick-off Geoff Cameron had said Stoke wanted to get in Arsenal’s faces and they did so by taking the match to them. Joe Allen engineered an opening along the right, Rodríguez won a free-kick from Xhaka, and Mame Biram Diouf set off on a barrelling run that took him into enemy territory before being halted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexandre Lacazette is given offside before lashing the ball into the top corner.

Oxlade-Chamberlain swung over a free-kick and Ramsey broke clear to bundle the ball at Butland, who blocked.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half and Stoke fans could regale Arsenal with taunts of “Who are you?” after Rodríguez’s goal, which derived from a slick but simple move following Xhaka’s concession of possession. While Wenger called this a “stupid mistake” from the midfielder, when Berahino took over he passed to Rodríguez, who slipped behind a slumbering Shkodran Mustafi, then pulled the trigger to beat Cech.\n\nCue a jubilant Hughes while Wenger again rued the slipshod defending that had allowed Leicester three goals. “It was frustrating getting caught cold for the goal. Defensively there is no excuse. We gave them a cheap goal,” the Frenchman said.\n\nAgainst the Foxes Olivier Giroud was the matchwinner, the France striker scoring with five minutes to go after coming on as a substitute. He was again Wenger’s go-to option here, yet an hour into the game the manager maintained the same XI.\n\nArsène Wenger criticises Granit Xhaka and referee after defeat at Stoke Read more\n\nBut in Butland Arsenal faced a determined keeper, who first punched away an Oxlade-Chamberlain cross, then kept out a Bellerín shot, and Stoke’s maintained menace was illustrated when Cech beat away a Berahino header.\n\nNow, Wenger acted, bringing on Giroud for Kolasinac on 66 minutes. It nearly reaped an instant dividend as a one-two with Welbeck again required Butland to be brave. Next Ramsey, who like Lacazette virtually vanished after half-time, broke into the area though his run yielded nothing.\n\nSo, with Lacazette’s strike chalked off, Arsenal drew a blank. And despite there being 36 matches left, Wenger’s challenge of ensuring they are genuine contenders looks difficult already."}, {"date": "13/08/2017", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52077, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Lejeune", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [34]}, {"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [7]}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [48], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Hayden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [7], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jacob Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chancel Mbemba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [34], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mikel Merino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [61], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [31], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Janssen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Carter-Vickers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Familiarity can so often be wonderfully reassuring but, for Newcastle United, it all too frequently provokes depression. There was to be no exception to this general Geordie rule on Sunday when the sight of Mike Ashley with his arms determinedly folded in the directors’ box simply served as a reminder of how badly the club’s owner has let Rafael Benítez down in the transfer market this summer.\n\nAs if that were not sufficient, a moment of mindless, all too typically self-destructive stupidity from Jonjo Shelvey – namely stepping on Delle Alli’s ankle straight in front of the referee – at the outset of the second half saw Benítez’s side reduced to 10 men.\n\nGoals from Alli and Ben Davies consequently enabled a visiting team who had hitherto struggled to undo Newcastle’s defensive organisation to rediscover the benefits of what some fear has become an almost stifling familiarity.\n\nAfter a summer of total transfer market frustration Mauricio Pochettino is desperate to introduce a few new faces ahead of a potential title challenge but, despite playing well within themselves, his existing crew were too good for their newly promoted hosts.\n\nIn some ways the first half went reasonably well for Newcastle; Rob Elliot’s goal was barely threatened, Christian Atsu’s pace periodically troubled the young debutant Kyle Walker-Peters, Dwight Gayle looked lively if not exactly subtle and Pochettino’s mounting frustration seemed highlighted when he ordered Moussa Sissoko and Christian Eriksen to swap flanks. Arguably, most reassuringly of all, the Tynesiders defended very well.\n\nYet there was still plenty to worry Benítez. Foremost among his concerns must have been Shelvey’s struggles to touch the ball, let alone unleash a penetrative play-making pass but Newcastle’s collective penchant for forfeiting possession far too cheaply can hardly have represented a cause for optimism either.\n\nIt did not help that Paul Dummett’s early attempt to intercept Sissoko left the home left-back hamstrung. That injury prompted Jamaal Lascelles’s introduction, with Benítez’s club captain swiftly proving his worth courtesy of a difficult block to prevent the impressive Mousa Dembélé from driving a shot into the bottom corner.\n\nThe substitution interrupted Newcastle’s initially ferocious tempo and, inexorably, Spurs began controlling the pace - and dominating possession. Benítez’s best hope appeared to rest with getting men behind the ball and thwarting his guests before using the pace of Atsu and Gayle to accelerate behind Pochettino’s high defensive line on the break.\n\nSure enough one such counter-attack did conclude with Walker-Peters tripping the striker in the area. Had a linesman not flagged for offside against Gayle, it would have been a penalty. No matter; the novice right-back may not quite be the new Kyle Walker but Walker-Peters did sufficient good things to suggest he has an extremely bright future.\n\nThe home bench suffered further disappointment when Harry Kane – then rivalling Shelvey in terms of minimal impact on events – was rightly shown a yellow card for catching Florian Lejeune late with an unfortunate tackle from behind which Benítez thought worthy of a red. The centre-half, newly recruited from Eibar, hobbled off and was replaced by Chancel Mbemba as Newcastle’s defence underwent yet another revamp.\n\nThat unit’s enduring efficiency ensured a slightly soporific ending to a first 45 minutes characterised by unusually abundant sunshine, a cacophony of piercing boos greeting St James’ Park old boy Sissoko’s every touch and Ashley’s looming directors’ box presence.\n\nEarlier Sky had released excerpts of a pre-recorded interview with Newcastle’s owner featuring an admission that he had been “naive” in sacking Sam Allardyce and an apology to Chris Hughton for his treatment of the club’s former manager.\n\nIf that “sorry” was long overdue, Shelvey owed a very big apology to a lot of people after his idiotic 48th-minute sending off. With Alli prone on the turf after conceding a free-kick and cheekily pushing the ball away from his adversary, the midfielder stood on the England creator’s ankle, directly in front of Andre Marriner.\n\nDecisions are rarely more straightforward and the referee wasted no time in reaching for his red card. With Lascelles beginning on the bench, Benítez had made Shelvey captain for the afternoon but, now, the Spaniard deliberately looked away as he trudged off.\n\nNewcastle’s 10 men soon fell behind. Like Kane, Alli had endured an uncharacteristically ineffective start but he issued a belated reminder of his talent by registering that opening goal.\n\nIt arrived at the end of a hallmark Spurs passing move, concluding with Kane picking out Eriksen whose cross was met by Alli’s left foot and a stretching finish far too good for Elliot after the scorer had darted between Lascelles and Mbemba.\n\nIf Alli’s run had been timed to perfection so, too, was Ben Davies’s dash into the box as Pochettino’s left-back, claimed the second goal with a low, six-yard shot following slick first-time passes, from Kane and Alli and the increasingly excellent Eriksen’s deception of the home defence by shaping to shoot himself.\n\nAnxious not to be eclipsed, Kane then hit a post before seeing a ’goal’ disallowed for offside. His moment will come - but Newcastle’s horizon looks ominously clouded.\n\nDanny Rose the rebel causes thorny problem for Daniel Levy and Spurs | Daniel Taylor Read more"}, {"date": "13/08/2017",

game of the new season could have gone much better other than perhaps another goal or two to polish up their superiority. As it was, they shouldn’t be too greedy. Romelu Lukaku has wasted little time demonstrating why he became the club’s most expensive summer recruit and, on this evidence, it is shaping up to be a season of rich promise for José≈ Mourinho’s team.\n\nLukaku should certainly have dispelled any lingering self-doubt with the two goals that laid the foundations for the most emphatic league win of the Mourinho era. Not that the £75m signing displayed even a flicker of stage fright with the left-foot finish and close-range header with which he introduced himself to the Old Trafford crowd.\n\nNewcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey sees red as Dele Alli has last laugh for Tottenham Read more\n\nLukaku ended a hugely satisfying afternoon waving appreciatively to the Stretford End and he might have finished with the ball as a souvenir had it not been for a brilliant saving tackle by Pablo Zabaleta, one of three West Ham debutants, to deny him a hat-trick just after the hour.\n\nYet this was more than just a story of Lukaku easing into life in Manchester and, though the new signing deserves the headlines, the form of Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba, among others, should also fill Mourinho with optimism that his team are capable of significant improvement after last season’s sixth-placed finish.\n\nPotential champions? You wouldn’t bet your mortgage against it and, for what it is worth at this time of the season, this rout puts them top already. Mourinho also made the point afterwards that we should anticipate the team getting better. “I’m not going to say the performance was perfect because it wasn’t perfect. There is still room for improvement.”\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan was another of the star performers and, not for the first time, it felt faintly ludicrous that Chelsea had allowed Nemanja Matic to defect to one of their title rivals. Matic fitted in seamlessly and the home side were not flattered by the late one-two when the substitute Anthony Martial slotted in the third goal, quickly followed by the brilliantly effective Pogba knocking another in from 20 yards. It was a tepid show from West Ham and they have now lost 11 opening-day fixtures in the Premier League era, more than any other club.\n\nAs the crowd serenaded Mourinho and Joe Hart, West Ham’s new goalkeeper, was reminded that it was a long way down since he was winning championships with Manchester City, it did not seem to matter too much that Victor Lindelof, the £31m acquisition from Benfica, was not even in the home squad because of his unimpressive form in pre-season.\n\nAnother manager might have felt duty-bound to involve such a costly signing. Mourinho does not operate with those kinds of constraints and Phil Jones was recalled alongside Eric Bailly to make sure Javier Hernández did not have a profitable return to Old Trafford.\n\nHernández scored 37 goals in 103 league games during his days in Manchester and one imagines he would have loved the kind of chances that Lukaku’s team-mates served up for the Belgian. Mkhitaryan’s expertly delivered free-kick for the second goal was the case in point. Rashford’s beautifully weighted pass for the first was another. These are the opportunities Lukaku thrives upon and, as long as it continues this way, he should get a hatful this season. Rashford was also involved in the second goal, having been chopped down by Zabaleta for the free-kick, and the teenager curled another shot against the post before Martial took over for the last 10 minutes.\n\nThese are early days but Mourinho, slowly but surely, seems to be assembling a side with no obvious weaknesses and Matic’s contribution for the first goal was a splendid snapshot of why he had been added to the payroll. Matic played with great control and it was his interception, cutting out Pedro Obiang’s pass, that sent Rashford haring away on the counter-attacking move that led to Lukaku scoring from 12 yards.\n\nWest Ham had defended stoutly until that point but they set about the afternoon with a distinct lack of adventure and there were only sporadic moments when their new-look frontline of Hernández, Marko Arnautovic and André Ayew flickered into life. Arnautovic had their best moment with a looping header that David de Gea tipped over the crossbar but the score was 2-0 at that stage and, for the most part, Slaven Bilic’s men were pinned inside their own half. “They were better than us in every department,” Bilic reflected. “We are very low.”\n\nMkhitaryan’s precise pass left Martial with the opportunity to stroke in the third goal and the away end was rapidly emptying as Pogba added the final flourish and Hart was beaten for the second time in three minutes. “The fans have reason to be optimistic,” Mourinho said."}, {"date":

What a difference someone like Virgil van Dijk – one of Liverpool’s prime transfer targets – could have made in a defence that never looked comfortable throughout. “We know we can do better and we have to do better,” Klopp said of the goals Liverpool conceded.\n\nWatford 3-3 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nStefano Okaka exposed those all too familiar shortcomings with Watford’s first, the striker’s free header from close range flashing beyond Simon Mignolet, and the defending in the lead-up to the second goal, shortly after Sadio Mané had equalised with a superb solo effort, was every bit as calamitous. New season, same old Liverpool rather sums it up in that respect.\n\nThe good news for Klopp is that Liverpool looked menacing at the other end of the pitch once they got their act together in the second half, scoring two goals in as many minutes to turn the game on its head. Roberto Firmino got the first via the penalty spot to haul Liverpool level after Mohamed Salah was brought down, and those two also combined for the third, with the Egyptian marking his debut with a goal.\n\nLiverpool were dominant in that period and had enough chances to put the game to bed, yet their failure to take one of them – Alberto Moreno and Dejan Lovren were denied by Heurelho Gomes either side of Joël Matip heading against the bar – proved costly when Britos plundered that equaliser.\n\nKlopp, understandably, was reluctant to criticise his players too heavily, making the point that the opening day of the season was no time to look for perfection. He admitted, though, that he was disappointed with the way that Liverpool were second best to Watford physically in the first half, and also with the lack of direction in his team for spells.\n\nWatford deserve credit for starting so well. Okaka, in particular, caught the eye during a bright period from Marco Silva’s side. Snapping into tackles, they denied Liverpool the time and space to impose themselves and took the lead after only eight minutes. José Holebas delivered an inswinging corner from the right and the shortcomings of Liverpool’s zonal marking system were there for all to see as Okaka, with Lovren caught in no-man’s land, drifted into the six-yard box to head home.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho defies Liverpool with transfer request Read more\n\nAlthough Liverpool were struggling to play with any fluency, their equaliser was a beauty. Moreno, who was given his first Premier League start for 10 months, swapped passes with Mané on the edge of the area before sliding a low ball into the feet of Emre Can. Mané ran in behind, adroitly stepping over the ball before accepting Can’s first-time lay-off and curling a splendid shot into the far corner.\n\nIt was a moment of brilliance that should have had a calming effect on Liverpool, yet 161 seconds later Mignolet was picking the ball out of the back of the net again. Tom Cleverley got away from Jordan Henderson in the inside-right channel and delivered a low centre that pinballed between Trent Alexander-Arnold and Matip, gifting Abdoulaye Doucouré Watford’s second.\n\nThe pattern of the game changed after the restart as Liverpool attacked with much more conviction. Firmino dispatched his spot-kick with the minimum of fuss after Salah, racing on to the Brazilian’s pass, was clumsily brought down by Gomes. When Salah nudged the ball over the line moments later following a lovely piece of skill from Firmino, Liverpool were in total control, yet victory was snatched from them courtesy of that controversial Britos goal. “Offside,” said Klopp. “That’s really not fun.”"}, {"date": "12/08/2017", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41616, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [14], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [16], "reds": [81], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [3], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeremie Boga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [18]}, {"name": "Michy Batshuayi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}], "subs": [{"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [69], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charly Musonda", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [18], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Fikayo Tomori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Scott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [39], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Johann Berg Gudmundsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Steven Defour", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Vokes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24, 43], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nick Pope", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Arfield", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "There are title defences. And then there are Chelsea title defences. As an exercise in exploring how quickly a steamrollering champion team can be reduced to a frazzled, meandering rabble, Chelsea’s opening 45 minutes of the Premier League season here against Burnley is likely to take some beating.\n\nA red card for the captain, Gary Cahill, on 13 minutes was followed by goals from Sam Vokes, Stephen Ward and Vokes again as Burnley produced a performance as controlled and incisive as Chelsea were flaccid.\n\nChelsea v Burnley: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nReduced to 10 men and 3-0 down at the break against a team they had not lost to since 1971, Chelsea did rouse themselves in the second half, Álvaro Morata scoring his first goal for the club before Cesc Fàbregas was also sent off, shown a second yellow card for a lunging challenge.\n\nDavid Luiz pulled back another to make it 3-2 at the end and draw a roar of defiance around Stamford Bridge. But really this was a disastrous start for the champions, and an opening day defeat that some will suggest came heavily trailed.\n\nIt is no secret there has been discontent around the place, not least friction between manager and club hierarchy. So profound was the ambient gloom during a summer when Chelsea replenished rather than expanded their squad that casual observers might have assumed Antonio Conte’s team would start here already trailing on minus five points, or with the kit-man squeezed into a spare pair of shorts at kick-off.\n\nThe Chelsea team sheet did have an air of shoulders being shrugged towards the directors’ boxes. Jérémie Boga made his debut in midfield, nine years after joining the club as an 11-year-old and moving from Marseille to New Malden. Antonio Rüdiger started in a three-man defence and Michy Batshuayi led the attack, albeit only in name during 59 largely feeble minutes on the pitch. On the bench Kenedy emerged from his doghouse to sit alongside an assortment of kids, a record signing No9 and the substitute goalkeeper.\n\nFor Burnley Jack Cork made his debut as Sean Dyche packed the centre of the pitch. And Burnley were hugely impressive here, starting in a rush and pressing hard and high up the pitch. Albeit the game had barely got out of second gear when Cahill received a straight red for a challenge on Steven Defour. Cahill overstretched as he missed the ball. His studs were visible. Craig Pawson produced the card instantly. Modern precedents suggest it was fair, although it was hardly a vicious foul.\n\nMoments later Vokes had the ball in the net from an offside position after a bout of headed pingpong as Chelsea struggled to rejig. And on 24 minutes Burnley went ahead via another soft goal on the weekend the world forgot how to defend. Matthew Lowton advanced unimpeded down the right and floated in a cross that was missed by David Luiz and Vokes beat Thibaut Courtois with a faint contact that dribbled perfectly into the far corner.\n\nThe Burnley end rejoiced, Dyche punched the air and Chelsea continued to play like a team still sleepwalking through the dog days of summer, astonishingly short on passing rhythm or any kind of combinations going forward without Eden Hazard on the pitch.\n\nIn the shakeup after Cahill’s red, Conte had taken off Boga and brought on Andreas Christensen to keep his defence the same shape but there was a striking feebleness to Chelsea’s right side as Burnley went 2-0 up five minutes before half-time. Not that anything should take away from the quality of Ward’s goal after a short free-kick, the left-back weaving into the area then spanking a wonderful shot into the far corner.\n\nThings fall apart. The centre cannot hold. At least, this often seems to be the case when David Luiz is involved. Within three minutes it was 3-0: another simple cross from the right by Defour, another terrible piece of marking by the Brazilian and another headed finish by Vokes in hectares of space.\n\nChelsea came haring out early after the break and to their credit they rallied. Alonso had a fierce free-kick well saved by Tom Heaton. Morata added some guile, holding the ball up well and producing a neat finish after Willian’s cross from the right.\n\nAnd by the end Stamford Bridge was in uproar for the right reasons as Chelsea pressed hard, Burnley hung on with great heart and the home crowd could at least cheer their bloodied champions from the pitch at the end of a wild season’s opener."}, {"date": "12/08/2017", "arena":

After a 45-year absence, Huddersfield Town strode back into the top flight of English football and immediately served notice of their intention to stick around, despite their widespread billing as certainties for relegation.\n\nDavid Wagner’s team played with clever vibrancy as they heralded their return to the big time with a deserved victory at Selhurst Park, which, coincidentally, had been the scene of their last match among the elite in 1972.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the opening weekend's action Read more\n\nIf anyone resembled Premier League impostors it was Crystal Palace, who floundered in their first match under their new manager, Frank de Boer.\n\nAs the home team struggled to adapt to the style and shape being introduced by the Dutchman, who arrived only six weeks ago, Huddersfield performed with the same dynamic enterprise that gained them promotion from the Championship last season, but with extra deadliness thanks to the predatory skills of Steve Mounié. The Benin striker became the club’s record signing when he joined in the summer for £11.5m from Montpellier, and he scored two fine goals here.\n\n“I said beforehand we will not change our identity just because we are in the Premier League,” said Wagner. “If you think you have a strength and you trust in what you are doing, then you have to do it, even at the highest stage of football.”\n\nAbout 20 minutes into the game, Huddersfield were playing with such boldness that the 2,900 fans who had travelled excitedly from West Yorkshire began taunting the fretful home crowd with chants of “Where’s your famous atmosphere?” If that was the first sign that the visitors realised the Premier League might not be all it is hyped up to be, a more enjoyable one came moments later when Huddersfield took the lead by exploiting clueless defending.\n\nChris Schindler flicked on a corner by Aaron Mooy at the near post, Mathias Jorgensen met it just beyond the back post, and Joel Ward inadvertently nudged the ball over his own line.\n\nHuddersfield did not get carried away celebrating; instead, they exposed the hosts’ vulnerability anew, doubling their lead three minutes later. Mooy was involved again, crossing from the left after being released by Chris Löwe and neglected by Palace’s defence. Mounié, similarly free in the middle, expressed his gratitude for the slovenly defending by banging a header into the net from seven yards out, as Patrick van Aanholt stood watching in bemusement.\n\nConfusion was the defining characteristic of Palace early on. Some of De Boer’s selections seemed particularly awkward: Van Aanholt struggled on the left side of a three-man defence, while Ruben Loftus-Cheek looked lost on the right wing, which made the exclusion of Andros Townsend seem perverse.\n\nThe manager rectified that at half-time by introducing Townsend for Luka Milivojevic and redeploying the on-loan Chelsea player to his customary position in central midfield. Palace improved, but not enough.\n\nHuddersfield, by contrast, were smooth, even with four debutants. Their cohesion made the home side seem all the more disjointed and their smart pressing sabotaged Palace’s attempts to swagger out from the back. One of their summer signings, Tom Ince, could have opened the scoring in the second minute but volleyed straight at the goalkeeper after being teed up by Tommy Smith.\n\nInce had another chance just after the quick-fire salvo that gave Huddersfield their lead but Ward thwarted the attacker with a superb last-ditch tackle. Jorgensen then headed wide from a corner as Wagner’s side threatened to rack up a humiliating scoreline.\n\nPalace got better after the break, with Wilfried Zaha tormenting Smith so much that Wagner made a change at right-back. Early in the second half, Christian Benteke forced Jonas Lossl into his first difficult save, the summer signing from Mainz diving well to turn away a header. Actually, Lossl had also got a touch to a dangerous shot by Zaha just before half-time, but the referee did not spot it and failed to award a corner. A lack of luck was another of Palace’s problems on a dispiriting day.\n\nDann should have given the hosts renewed hope 13 minutes from the end but thrashed a shot over the bar after a corner. Moments later, Mounié finished a swift counterattack by guiding a shot into the net from 10 yards.\n\n“Nobody expected that, it was a harsh lesson,” said De Boer, who attributed his team’s defeat to “wrong choices” by players during 15 first-half minutes.\n\nWagner burst into laughter when asked afterwards how it felt to be top of the league. “I cannot take this question seriously,” he replied in giggles.\n\n“Let’s just focus on the performance, which was good.

With his sons looking on the 31-year-old marked his return to his boyhood club with a fine winner against Stoke City and an influential performance for Ronald Koeman’s new-look side. An ugly game was elevated by the romantic script.\n\n“To score the winning goal at Goodison is a special moment,” said Rooney. “To play for this football club again is a huge deal for me and to score the winning goal at Goodison in the first Premier League game; it doesn’t get much better.”\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the opening weekend's action Read more\n\nEngland’s all-time leading goalscorer converted a thumping header on the stroke of half-time - as Mark Hughes feared he might - and was a quality, wily influence on the second half as he eased himself back into the old routine in royal blue. Rooney’s 199th Premier League goal was also his first for Everton since April 2004, not that he has endured a 13-year drought, of course, and he was not the only debutant to impress for Koeman. The most expensive British goalkeeper in history, the £30m Jordan Pickford, produced an excellent save to prevent Xherdan Shaqiri equalising with a 25-yard bullet in stoppage time.\n\n“There was one player in an Everton shirt today who, from the first second to the last, was comfortable on the pitch,” said the Everton manager on his summer acquisition from Manchester United. “Every decision he made was the right one and he scored a great, great goal from a great cross by Dominic [Calvert-Lewin]. In difficult moments of the game he showed his experience, he was clever, comfortable on the ball and that was different to some other players on the pitch. That’s why we signed him.”\n\nEverton and Rooney prospered after a pedestrian start. Stoke, with two new signings in the starting line-up, settled quicker than their unbalanced hosts with Darren Fletcher enjoying an assured debut alongside Joe Allen in central midfield.\n\nKoeman’s decision to deploy Calvert-Lewin and Leighton Baines as wing-backs flanking a three-man central defence did not produce the pace or width he envisaged - with the notable exception of the all-important goal - and his team laboured in a tedious first half. Goodison had fallen into a stupor when Rooney suddenly illuminated the contest.\n\nSandro Ramírez, Everton’s other attacking recruit of the summer, released Calvert-Lewin into space on the right. The young striker was an odd choice at wing-back but he vindicated his manager’s selection with an inch-perfect cross into the penalty area. Rooney rose majestically to steer a fine header back across Jack Butland and into the same net that received his first league strike for the club, against Arsenal in 2002. The forward broke Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring record for United against Hughes’ Stoke side last season and revelled in his latest punishment, sliding to his knees in front of the Park End stand. His influence grew thereafter.\n\nKoeman switched to a four-man defence for the second half, replacing Ashley Williams with Cuco Martina and pushing Calvert-Lewin into the attack. The changes brought immediate improvement from Everton who, with greater awareness from the England Under-20 World Cup-winning striker, could have established a more comfortable lead. Twice he went for goal when team-mates were free and better placed. Rooney made his feelings clear.\n\n“I expected to get space on the right so put a winger there instead of Tom Davies, Mason Holgate or Cuco,” the Everton manager explained. “That wasn’t how it went but that wasn’t Dominic’s problem. That was my fault. Even at 1-0 after 45 minutes I decided to change and we were much more comfortable with four defenders and had more control. It was not the best performance but we know we can do much better.”\n\nThe introduction of Peter Crouch for the anonymous Saido Berahino gave Stoke a presence and menace they previously lacked and it needed several last-ditch interventions by Everton to preserve their clean sheet. Pickford dominated his penalty area too when called upon and his late save from Shaqiri showed the value of investing between the posts.\n\nHughes lamented: “It was not the result we wanted but I thought the performance was fine. We had a lot of control in the first half. We needed to get to half-time but probably the only chance Everton created in the first half was a quality ball into the box for you know who. He was always going to be part of the story today. That was always the worry.”"}, {"date": "12/08/2017", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31447, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Fraser Forster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [33], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [16], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manolo Gabbiadini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Lemina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sofiane Boufal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stuart Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Bednarek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam McQueen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tammy Abraham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Luciano Narsingh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roque Mesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Fulton", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver McBurnie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Southampton had hopes of welcoming a new era under Mauricio Pellegrino but this stalemate with Swansea City felt all too reminiscent of his predecessor’s reign. They had a stupendous total of 29 shots on goal but only two were on target. Playing at St Mary’s has been Southampton’s achilles heel for too long, all of last season in fact, and this was a record sixth successive home league match without scoring in front of their own supporters. It is more than 545 minutes since they last scored here, against Crystal Palace on 5 April.\n\nThe absence of any goals did little to prevent the Southampton manager’s first competitive match in charge being overshadowed by those missing parties. Neither Virgil van Dijk, the Saints captain, nor Gylfi Sigurdsson, the Swansea midfielder, featured as questions rumble on over their immediate futures.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the opening weekend's action Read more\n\nVan Dijk was present in the stands, at least. “It is good news that Virgil was here, like all the team-mates,” Pellegrino said. “Because when you are outside the team you have to be behind them and supporting them. Hopefully he can change his point of view to be with us in the next few weeks. I’ve talked with him twice and the club was clear with him. We will repeat again the same.”\n\nSwansea were totally devoid of any creativity and their own frustrations revolve around Sigurdsson’s elongated, but expected, transfer to Everton. “I do not think it is far [away],” Paul Clement, the Swansea manager, said. “What would be a better situation would be if the window closed before the start of the season. I don’t really understand why it goes to the end of August. You should know who you’ve got and who you haven’t got.”\n\nThere was a swell of anticipation at a sold-out St Mary’s about a new era under Pellegrino while before kick-off there was a touching tribute to the former Southampton owner Markus Liebherr, with last Thursday the seventh anniversary of his passing.\n\nPellegrino made one change from the Southampton team that started against Stoke City in May – Claude Puel’s final match in charge – with Manolo Gabbiadini preferred to Charlie Austin in a familiar 4-2-3-1 formation. Both of Pellegrino’s summer signings, Mario Lemina and Jan Bednarek, were on the Southampton bench. Clement, meanwhile, handed Tammy Abraham his full Swansea and Premier League debut, with Fernando Llorente absent with a broken arm. It was an encouraging start for Abraham but he was left isolated throughout.\n\nPuel’s ultimate undoing was Southampton’s dreadful home performances last term, in which they scored only 17 league goals at St Mary’s. And while Saints seemed to have rediscovered their buzz under Pellegrino, the Argentinian was left scratching his head at Saints’ usual profligacy in front of goal. Gabbiadini grazed the bar in the opening minute before Dusan Tadic fired wide from Ryan Bertrand’s low cross.\n\nThe lack of conviction against a vulnerable Swansea backline was painful, verging on comical. James Ward-Prowse was guilty of trying to walk the ball into the net, by which point Swansea had 10 bodies defending in the box. He was, though, only one of several Saints culprits. On the brink of half-time, Ward-Prowse vented his frustrations on Martin Olsson, sending the Swansea left-back tumbling over the advertising hoardings with a brisk shoulder barge.\n\nWith Southampton’s tally of shots well into double figures with nothing to show for it, Pellegrino summoned Charlie Austin in place of Gabbiadini after 68 minutes. Tadic then let fly from distance, before Maya Yoshida spurned another great opening. Steven Davis’s whipped cross was helped on by Oriol Romeu but lurking at the back post was not Austin, but the Japanese defender who headed over. Swansea retreated deeper and deeper. Abraham’s withdrawal was met by anger from the away supporters, with the defender Kyle Bartley brought on to shut up shop. By the end, Yoshida was curling free-kicks wide of goal and Cédric Soares blasting wide from distance."}, {"date": "12/08/2017", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25011, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ahmed Hegazy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [31], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Phillips", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Jake Livermore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Field", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Hal Robson-Kanu", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rekeem Harper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Leko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kane Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fraser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [86], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}], "subs": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyrone Mings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lys Mousset", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Here was a match to buck the new trend for slipshod defending and goals raining in every 10 minutes, but Tony Pulis will not be losing any sleep over that. The only goal came from a set piece, and the West Bromwich Albion manager will not have any objection on those grounds either.\n\nHis side have three points in the bag, their first win since March, and in Jay Rodriguez and Ahmed Hegazi the Baggies appear to have found a couple of players who will liven up Saturday afternoons at The Hawthorns.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the opening weekend's action Read more\n\nRodriguez slowed up after a lively start, ending up being booked for a foul on Ryan Fraser, though Hegazi was impressive all the way through.\n\nA craggy centre-half on loan from al-Ahly, the Egyptian defended and distributed well, in addition to scoring the winning goal, and – considering this was his first taste of the Premier League – he could easily emerge as a cult hero with a few more games under his belt.\n\n“He made a great start,” Pulis said. “I watched a couple of games in the African Cup of Nations and was impressed by Egypt, so we followed it up and took a chance.”\n\nAlbion supporters probably need a little more excitement in their lives, judging by the way they greeted the new season with a chant of “there’s only one Gary Megson”. Pulis’s new assistant spent four years here as manager and received a royal welcome back.\n\nWest Brom made the more spirited opening, with Rodriguez prominent in most of their attacks. The striker set up Matt Phillips for the first shot of the game, then brought the first save of the afternoon from Asmir Begovic with a crafty effort on the turn.\n\nIt took a well-timed tackle by Steve Cook to stop Rodriguez bearing down on goal after Jake Livermore’s pass had set him free, then the former Southampton player headed too high from Chris Brunt’s corner.\n\nIt was the other debutant who opened the scoring, however, when Hegazi met Brunt’s well-flighted free-kick at the far post to nod down and under Begovic. It was not a great goal for the Cherries to concede; Brunt’s delivery is usually reliable but there was little pressure on Hegazi as he reached the ball and Begovic might have reacted more decisively.\n\nThe big defender almost had a second a few minutes later, shooting hurriedly over the bar when the ball unexpectedly broke to him in a forward position, but Pulis will have been pleased to note his new acquisition continued to cause havoc at set pieces. He reached a corner first just before the interval to set up a chance that Brunt put narrowly wide, before resuming his defensive duties to clear from Benik Afobe.\n\nThe only brief chance Bournemouth had of drawing level before half-time was when Ben Foster came a long way off his line for a ball he could not quite reach, but Josh King slipped in trying to take advantage and Claudio Yacob was able to tidy up.\n\nAfter 18 uneventful second-half minutes of the home side retreating into defence and the visitors struggling to break them down – now known in these parts as Walking in a Megson Wonderland – Eddie Howe did the obvious thing and sent on Jermain Defoe for the last half-hour. The 34-year-old would dearly have loved a goal on his latest debut but was not allowed a sniff. You have to work hard to force openings against West Brom at this stage of the season, and with Bournemouth not forceful or creative enough, the home defence was never really in trouble.\n\n“They killed the game in the second half; they are tough to break down when they are in front,” Eddie Howe said. “We dominated possession but didn’t do enough with it.

It was never likely to be about the winning, not against Premier League favourites with all the massed qualities that Manchester City bring. In some ways it is no bad thing this one is ticked off now. Brighton can get on with the task in hand with a different kind of focus.\n\nCity were not at their slickest but still possessed more than enough finesse to dominate, cruise through the game and pick up three points thanks to two late goals.\n\nPep Guardiola’s satisfaction to begin the campaign with an exercise in control and a straightforward win was clear. They did everything required, with gallons of potential in the tank. But do not go reading too much into it now.\n\nBrighton and Hove Albion: Seagulls fans get ready for top flight Read more\n\n“Last season I was sitting here after the Sunderland game and you said: ‘You are the favourites, most beautiful, handsome and nice guys in the league.’ And after, you know what happened last season? Chelsea killed us,” he said. “OK, we accept what the people say but all we have to try is to improve and improve.”\n\nThe speed of their attacking patterns is an area he wants to tweak, and it was notable how many dynamic players were in reserve. What a bench – Bernardo Silva, Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling came on for late cameos.\n\nGuardiola was pleased to see his defence was relatively untroubled. The presence of Vincent Kompany always makes a difference, Kyle Walker slotted in comfortably and his fellow summer signing, Ederson, in goal, had only one nerve-wracking moment to contend with.\n\nBrighton could have been handed a gentler first course at English football’s top table. Perhaps a Watford or Huddersfield or Burnley or so the stereotype would have it … As it turned out the highly tuned and luxuriously reinforced ambition of Guardiola’s City ensured the excitement was mixed with an understandable dose of trepidation.\n\nThe chasm in terms of resources was made plain by the fact City’s new collection of full-backs cost more than the funds raised to construct the Amex Stadium, but it was the football gap Brighton were keen to mind.\n\nFirst of all they had to master their own nerves. The sense of heady occasion, the mark of history, all the anticipation that had gripped this part of the south coast seemed to weigh heavily on the Brighton players for the first 20 minutes. Chris Hughton was conscious that this was a special day, and a tricky one for his players to manage calmly.\n\n“It’s understandable,” he said. “Today was very much a club day. This club had a very difficult history – there were a lot of supporters here who were not able to come not so long ago. Our first game in the Premier League was going to be a big occasion but the fact Man City were coming made it even bigger.”\n\nThe return of top-flight football for the first time since 1983, and the depths of their plummet in the meantime, meant emotions were charged as this boisterous crowd rubbed their eyes and welcomed this big step with spine-tingling noise.\n\nMaking inroads against City was not the priority. Containment was. Their illustrious opponents hugged the ball, retaining possession for long stretches.\n\nDavid Silva’s creative spark shone. Gabriel Jesus had flashes in the spotlight in search of a breakthrough. On one occasion the Brazilian caught the ball at speed and it bounced off his leg and scooped off his arm and in. Michael Oliver, the referee, immediately spotted the infringement and there was no question of a goal.\n\nNine-man Chelsea shocked by Sam Vokes double for Burnley Read more\n\nCity stepped up a gear after the break and the crowd held its collective breath for an Agüero-must-score moment. He opened up his body and looked set for a deadly finish but his shot was strangely off beam.\n\nThen Brighton found another gear of their own. Shane Duffy stabbed in a shot. Lewis Dunk came close and when the ball pinballed out to Davy Pröpper the Dutchman lashed wide.\n\nThe pendulum swung back as City regained momentum and began probing again. De Bruyne carved room for himself to strike with ferocity. The ball hit Dunk’s hand and despite City’s protestations the official showed no inclination to award a penalty.\n\nThe visitors would not wait long to clinch the points, though. When Dale Stephens lost possession City broke with clinical precision. Kevin De Bruyne clipped the ball to Silva, whose cute first- touch pass was threaded perfectly for Agüero. The ball was guided past Ryan with unerring cool.\n\nThere would be no way back for Brighton when City doubled their lead three minutes later as Dunk turned Fernandinho’s cross into his own net.\n\nAll in all it was a lesson for Brighton. How much they take on board, and how quickly, will be the focus for Hughton. “Now we dust ourselves down,” he said. “It’s a very tough league.\n\n“You have to be able to park these defeats very, very quickly. We have to make sure we have a squad to compete in this league by the end of this window.”"}, {"date": "11/08/2017", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59387, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal",

Emirates, where the good news is Arsenal broke their transfer record for a striker but the bad news is they ended their first game of the season with a classically dysfunctional defence. It was an extraordinary combination – a midfield player at right-back, two left-backs at centre-back and a right-back at left-back. Confused? Who wouldn’t be. Leicester had all the clarity as they took advantage and a 3-2 lead into the final stages of an intoxicating tussle.\n\nOh Arsenal. Typical Arsenal. Absurd Arsenal. But where in seasons past this kind of situation tended to end with opening day navel-gazing, this time they found the resources to twist the tale with a theatrical flourish. Wenger threw on Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud to attempt a rescue mission and both of them delivered with goals to transform the atmosphere from fretful and pressurised to the liberating joy of a thumping comeback. The match-winner from Giroud sent shudders through north London. In finding the composure to power a header while wrestling his marker he made his point that the purchase of Alexandre Lacazette would not easily make him expendable.\n\nArsène Wenger praises match-winner Olivier Giroud for staying at Arsenal Read more\n\nArsenal’s penchant for starting seasons by getting a wobble in early has become something of an epidemic and they made a good stab at a repeat here. Arsène Wenger leaned on the game’s statistics to suggest this win was somehow logical – bags of possession and 27 shots for his team compared to three on target for the visitors – but few in the crowd would have argued had Leicester been able to hold on to the lead they seized with moments of ferocious determination.\n\nA frenetic opening five minutes set the tone and presented a microcosm of all of Arsenal’s weird, paradoxical sense of possibility. Their ability to exude verve and be vulnerable in the same few flashes of a game was there for all to see. Day-one optimism cascaded down from the stands as the record signing Lacazette opened the scoring with his first meaningful Premier League touch. A mere two minutes into his official Arsenal career he was unmarked in the box to steer a powerful header past Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nThe Emirates crowd cherished the moment. But not for long. Leicester’s response was resolute and instant, exposing the old familiar defensive off-switch in Arsenal’s mechanics. Leicester loaded players into forward positions and when Marc Albrighton floated a cross over to the far post, the impressive Harry Maguire was more alert to the situation than any Arsenal defender. He sprinted to nod the ball back to Shinji Okazaki, whose movement was sparkier than any opponent and he finished instinctively.\n\nHaving equalised, it would have been rude of Leicester to turn down the opportunity to take the lead in the 28th minute. Mohamed Elneny and Granit Xhaka were punished for some casual passing in midfield as Albrighton pounced to carve the kind of opening that inspired Jamie Vardy to become synonymous with so many Leicester parties. The strike was smart and true.\n\nThe goal sucked the confidence out of Arsenal. Rob Holding was robbed of the ball. Leicester zoomed into another break and Okazaki was a fraction away from heading in a third. It spoke volumes of how Leicester interpreted the temperature of the game that both their centre-backs, Maguire and Wes Morgan, felt compelled to amble forward and frighten Arsenal’s rearguard from open play.\n\nThe makeshift defence that Wenger pieced together, without the senior influences of Laurent Koscielny, Per Mertesacker or Shkodran Mustafi, was jittery and easily stretched. A bizarre half ended with a reprieve for the home team. After Lacazette’s shot was blocked Leicester’s defenders raised choreographed “offside” arms while Sead Kolasinac ambled on to poke the ball for Danny Welbeck to prod in an equaliser. The half-time whistle was greeted by bubbling chitter-chatter about the reintroduction to the inexplicable emotional strain of Premier League chaos.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette claims goal on initiation into crazy world of Arsenal | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nIt did not ease off too much after the break. Emergency action from Petr Cech, twice, to deny the onrushing Vardy and then a clever shot from Riyad Mahrez, merely delayed the seemingly inevitable. Mahrez’s well-whipped corner was gobbled up by Vardy with a textbook glancing header. Set piece, simple stuff for Leicester. It was the umpteenth time one of their players had moved untracked on to an aerial ball. Wenger later tried a touch of positive spin by saying his team were good at corners last season and insisted they could work on this and iron out the kinks. Time will tell on that one.\n\nThe introduction of Giroud and Ramsey was influential, and a missed handball from Mesut Özil in the build-up to the equaliser was also helpful. Following a corner, Ramsey neatly controlled Xhaka’s dinked cross with one touch and buried his shot into the far corner with the next.\n\nArsenal went for the jugular. Lacazette danced through the pack and tested Schmeichel but it was Giroud who majestically delivered the coup de grace. Both Leicester’s dejection and Arsenal’s elation were understandable."}]
