Highlights from Manchester City's win over Brighton in the Premier League. Manchester City came from behind to retain the Premier League title in style with a 4-1 victory at Brighton on the final day of the season. City looked on course for a nerve-jangling final outing at the Amex Stadium when Sadio Mane's opener for Liverpool against Wolves - which temporarily moved the Reds top of the table - was compounded by Glenn Murray heading Brighton into the lead on 27 minutes. But City produced the response of champions. Sergio Aguero struck just 83 seconds after Murray's opener, before Aymeric Laporte's header secured a half-time lead. Riyad Mahrez rifled City's third into the top corner on 63 minutes before an exquisite Ilkay Gundogan free-kick sparked wild scenes of celebrations among Pep Guardiola's players and staff. Ilkay Gundogan celebrates his goal City's 14th consecutive league victory sees them end one of the most remarkable Premier League title races on top of the pile with 98 points, and sees them become the first side since 2009 to retain the title. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Bruno (6), Duffy (6), Dunk (7), Bernardo (6), Knockaert (6), Kayal (6), Bissouma (7), Jahanbakhsh (6), Gross (6), Murray (7).

Subs: De Bruyne (5), Danilo (n/a), Otamendi (n/a) Man of the Match: Riyad Mahrez. How City survived scare to retain title Brighton relished the prospect of going against the script to potentially crash City's coronation. Alireza Jahanbakhsh flashed a fierce drive inches wide of goal on nine minutes, an effort which forced Guardiola to squat in his technical area as the pressure mounted. Glenn Murray celebrates his opener vs Manchester City News of Mane's opener on 17 minutes at Anfield trickled through, and the plot thickened 10 minutes later as Murray beat Ederson at the near post to head Brighton in front with his 14th goal of the season. Team news Brighton: Anthony Knockaert and Beram Kayal returned as Solly March and Dale Stephens dropped out. Bruno captained the Seagulls for the final time ahead of his retirement. Anthony Knockaert and Beram Kayal returned as Solly March and Dale Stephens dropped out. Bruno captained the Seagulls for the final time ahead of his retirement. Man City: Riyad Mahrez replaced Phil Foden in Manchester City’s only change from Monday’s win over Leicester. But the lead was short-lived. David Silva's neat flick was brought under control by Aguero, and he immediately eased the champions' nerves with a clinical finish past Mat Ryan. Sergio Aguero equalises against Brighton The Brighton goalkeeper prevented Bernardo Silva from heading a now-rampant City into the lead on the half-hour mark, but he was helpless seven minutes before the interval as Laporte was given the freedom of the penalty area and completed the turnaround with a header from Mahrez's corner. Aymeric Laporte celebrates after putting Manchester City 2-1 up City laid siege to the Brighton goal early in the second half and got the two-goal cushion they desired as Mahrez shifted the ball away from Lewis Dunk and fired through the despairing dive of Ryan. And City's celebrations were put into motion on 72 minutes when Gundogan left Ryan with no chance as he curled a sumptuous 25-yard free-kick over the Brighton wall and into the top corner. Riyad Mahrez of Manchester City celebrates after scoring his team's third goal Opta stats Manchester City have won their fourth Premier League title - only Manchester United (13) and Chelsea (5) have ever won more in the competition. Overall, Manchester City have won their sixth English top-flight title. They're the first side to retain the title since Manchester United in 2008-09. This was the eighth time the Premier League title has been decided on the final day of the season, with Manchester City winning it on three of those occasions (2011-12, 2013-14 and 2018-19). Manchester City's haul of 98 points is the joint-second highest for any team in English top-flight history (converting to three points for a win) - only the Citizens themselves have ever earned more (100 in 2017-18). Manchester City have won their last 14 Premier League games - only the Citizens themselves (18 in December 2017) have had a longer winning run in the competition. Manchester City have won 32 Premier League games this season - equalling their own record in the competition from last season for most wins in a single campaign in the competition. Sergio Aguero has scored 32 goals in all competitions for Man City this season - only in 2016-17 (33) has he scored more in a single campaign for the Citizens. Glenn Murray has scored 36% of Brighton's overall Premier League goals (25/69), the highest proportion of any team's goals in the competition's history.

Pep Guardiola says the reality of retaining the Premier League title is incredible and praised his side for an amazing season. Pep Guardiola: \"I have to say congratulations to Liverpool of course. Thank you so much. They helped to push us and to increase our standards from last season. To compete against this team pushed us to do what we have done. It's incredible, 198 points in two seasons to go back-to-back. We made the standard higher last season and Liverpool helped us - to win this title we had to win 14 in a row. We couldn't lose one point. It's the toughest title we have won in all my career, by far.\" 1:52 Brighton manager Chris Hughton says he couldn't have asked for more effort from his side as they fell to a 4-1 defeat against Manchester City. Brighton manager Chris Hughton says he couldn't have asked for more effort from his side as they fell to a 4-1 defeat against Manchester City. Chris Hughton: \"For a good period of the game, we were able to give them a good game and that's what I wanted, but the fact their equaliser was so quick after our goal, that really hurt us.\" Man of the Match - Riyad Mahrez Having opened the door to Liverpool in the title race with his missed penalty at Anfield in October, Mahrez made amends with the goal which kick-started the Manchester City titles celebrations on the south coast. It was fitting and just finale to the Algerian's first season with City as he secured his second Premier League winners' medal. What's next? Manchester City can complete an unprecedented domestic treble with victory over Watford in the FA Cup final on Saturday, May 18 (Kick-off 5pm BST)."},{"date": "12/05/2019", "arena": "Turf Moor",

Highlights from Arsenal's win against Burnley in the Premier League. Arsenal finished their Premier League campaign on a high in a frantic 3-1 win over Burnley at Turf Moor on Sunday, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang secured a share in the Golden Boot with a brace. Burnley had the better chances of a frenetic first half that saw Chris Wood hit the post before Matt Lowton's shot was cleared off the line.

Burnley then quickly found their feet, and almost took the lead when Wood struck the post after he was played through on goal by Jack Cork. Moments later, Burnley were three on two when Barnes crossed for Lowton, who skipped past Bernd Leno only to see his shot blocked on the line by Matteo Guendouzi.

Aubameyang then doubled Arsenal's lead and his own goal tally for the afternoon with a well-taken volley after an Alex Iwobi cross, but they were pegged back almost immediately as Barnes met a perfect ball in by Johann Gudmundsson.

And with Palace in full control, they added another a few minutes later with Zaha's shot poorly parried by Travers, which clattered off the unfortunate Simpson. Bournemouth pulled a goal back on the stroke of half-time through Lerma's phenomenal strike from range which arrowed into the top corner off the woodwork. Travers was forced to make two smart stops five minutes into the second-half to deny Townsend and James McArthur. And moments later, Ibe pulled back another Bournemouth goal with a low shot into the bottom corner for his first Premier League goal of the season. Jordon Ibe pulled a goal back for Bournemouth And with Bournemouth looking like they may produce a remarkable comeback, Palace got their fourth through Van Aanholt, who played a neat one-two with Zaha before driving his strike through the legs of Travers. Bournemouth replied again eight minutes later through Josh King, who poked in Chris Mepham's header unmarked at the back post from a corner. But Palace would make it five ten minutes from time through Townsend, who steered his shot into the bottom corner after a mazy run by Zaha. Opta stats Crystal Palace have scored five goals in a Premier League game for just the third time ever and the first time since winning 5-0 v Leicester in April 2018. Bournemouth's Premier League matches this season have seen a total of 126 goals (56 scored, 70 conceded), the most of any side in the competition this season. Roy Hodgson enjoyed his 100th Premier League win, becoming the oldest manager to reach that milestone at 71 years and 276 days. Crystal Palace striker Michy Batshuayi has ended on the winning side in all nine Premier League games he has scored, with only Chris Smalling netting in more games with a 100% win record (Daniel Agger also on 9). Crystal Palace's Michy Batshuayi has scored a brace in each of his two Premier League appearances on the final day of the season, scoring two for Chelsea in May 2017 and a brace today. Andros Townsend has hit double figures for goal involvements in a Premier League season for the first time ever (6 goals, 4 assists). The managers Roy Hodgson: \"It was an incredible attacking performance from both teams I thought. It was a nice way for us to end the season. It was a very entertaining game and its not surprising that eight goals were scored because so many chances were created. It was unlike us but we were down to the bare bones when it came to selecting defenders. We put the attacking players on to try and score more than them and luckily it went our way.\" 1:56 Roy Hodgson reflects on a high-scoring victory for Palace. Roy Hodgson reflects on a high-scoring victory for Palace. Eddie Howe: \"It was not the way we wanted to finish but for the neutral it must've been a great spectacle for the neutral. It was so open, the scoreline could have been higher. We will go away and analyse that one. \"We will but we were poor in the first half at times, very good in the second half, dominated in the game, but we were disappointed to lose.\" 1:36 Eddie Howe was disappointed with how side defended in their final game of the Premier League season.

Man of the Match - Michy Batshuayi Batshuayi capped off the end of his loan spell in style with two goals as he spearheaded the Palace attack in fine fashion. His first goal was very well struck and combined well with Zaha and Townsend on the flanks throughout, with the Bournemouth backline unable to cope with his strength and power."},{"date":

Fulham 0-4 Newcastle Fulham bowed out of the Premier League with a 4-0 defeat to Newcastle at Craven Cottage on the final day of the season. The hosts suffered a double blow inside 11 minutes as Jonjo Shelvey volleyed a superb effort (9) before Ayoze Perez continued his fine scoring form just two minutes later. Fulham were seeing plenty of possession when Fabian Schar had a free header in the 61st minute for Newcastle's third and, although Scott Parker's side had the ball in the back of the net soon afterwards, it was incorrectly ruled out for offside. Salomon Rondon, whose Newcastle future remains uncertain, rounded off the victory in the 89th minute as the Magpies ended the season in 13th place. Fulham ended in 19th place but have long known they will play in the Sky Bet Championship next season.

Subs used: Muto (5), Fernandez (5), Kenedy (n/a). Man of the match: Matt Ritchie. How Fulham ended with a whimper It was a fast start from the visitors as they took the lead in the ninth minute. Matt Ritchie's corner delivery picked out Shelvey at the edge of the area, with the midfielder taking one touch before volleying home into the top, far corner with a sensational finish. Two minutes later, and the visitors added their second. Christian Atsu burst into the area, getting ahead of Cyrus Christie, but his shot was pushed away by Sergio Rico. But Perez - who had scored five goals in his last four Premier League games ahead of Sunday's finale - was lurking to poke the ball home. Jonjo Shelvey celebrates scoring against Fulham Fulham saw the better of the attacking play for much of the half but could not create too much with it. Their best effort came in the 23rd minute, when Aleksandar Mitrovic got just ahead of Paul Dummett to head a corner wide of the post. Team news Scott Parker made two changes with Alfie Mawson and Floyd Ayite coming in for Tim Ream and Ryan Babel. Rafa Benitez also made two switches. Mo Diame and Jonjo Shelvey replaced Sung-Yeung Ki (injured) and Javier Manquillo. Fulham continued to dominate the possession at the start of the second half, but it was Newcastle who were the clinical ones again just after the hour mark. Ritchie put another superb corner into the area and Schar was allowed a free header by the Fulham defence, powering home past Rico. Three minutes later, the hosts finally had the ball in the back of the net - but it was ruled out for offside. Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa had the initial shot, which Floyd Ayite turned into the back of the net with an outstretched foot. However, the linesman had his flag raised and the goal was chalked off. Replays showed that this was an incorrect decision. Newcastle rounded off a wonderful away performance with a fourth goal late on. Rondon was played through and his initial effort smacked into the body of Rico, but he managed to get back to his feet, round Alfie Mawson and poke home to seal an impressive final day victory. Opta stats Newcastle United have won their first league match at Craven Cottage since December 2007 - after a run of six defeats away at Fulham. There were just 124 seconds between Jonjo Shelvey's opener and Ayoze Perez's second for Newcastle in their match against Fulham. Fulham conceded two goals in the first 11 minutes of the match against Newcastle United - the earliest they had conceded twice in a Premier League game since May 2011 vs Liverpool. Matt Ritchie has provided 20 league assists since his Newcastle debut in August 2016; seven more than any other players. The managers Scott Parker: \"It's disappointing really. I don't think the scoreline reflects the game but saying that, I thought in both boxes, we didn't do well enough at times. \"We had our chances or at least we got into those final third areas, but we lacked that cutting edge about us.

Man of the match - Matt Ritchie There were a few Newcastle players who could have been named man of the match, but it is two assists from Ritchie that sees him take the final accolade of the season.

Highlights from Leicester's 0-0 draw with Chelsea in the Premier League. Poor finishing cost Leicester and Chelsea a win, as the two sides played out a 0-0 draw in the final game of the season. Ross Barkley should have opened the scoring early on for Chelsea when Jorginho chipped the ball over the Leicester defence for his fellow midfielder to run onto but his fierce shot was blocked by Kasper Schmeichel's chest. Cesar Azpilicueta slipped not once, but twice, to allow Jamie Vardy a run through on goal but when the crunch moment came he sent a poor pass to Youri Tielemans, who could not fashion a meaningful chance from a poor angle, allowing Willy Caballero the chance to save. The best chance of the opening period fell to Gonzalo Higuain after fine work between Willian and Marcos Alonso allowed the latter to send a pass across the six-yard box but the Argentine bungled the opportunity with the goal gaping. Marc Albrighton is challenged by Marcos Alonso There were fond farewells for Leicester as Shinji Okazaki and Danny Simpson were brought on for their final appearances, much to the appreciation of the home supporters. For Chelsea, Eden Hazard eventually came on in the second half, potentially for the last time as rumours about his future continue. Tielemans had the chance to win the match late on when he found space on the edge of the area but he smashed a wayward shot high and wide.

Highlights from Liverpool's win over Wolves in the Premier League. Sadio Mane scored a double but Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Wolves was in vain as they fell just a point short of Manchester City after a pulsating Premier League title race. City's 4-1 win at Brighton means they retain the title ahead of Liverpool, whose 29-year wait for a top-flight title goes on despite a record tally of 97 points for a second-place side. Needing a win and for City to drop points at Brighton, Liverpool took the lead through Mane's close-range finish (17), before a period of chaos and confusion at Anfield both before and after Glenn Murray put Brighton ahead. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (8), Van Dijk (7), Matip (7), Robertson (7), Wijnaldum (7), Henderson (7), Fabinho (7), Salah (6), Mane (8), Origi (6) Subs: Milner (6), Gomez (5), Oxlade-Chamberlain (5) Wolves: Rui Patricio (5), Doherty (6), Bennett (5), Coady (6), Boly (6), Jonny (6), Moutinho (6), Neves (6), Dendoncker (5), Jota (6), Jimenez (5) Subs: Traore (5), Gibbs-White (5), Vinagre (5) Man of the match: Sadio Mane But goals from Sergio Aguero, Aymeric Laporte, Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan put City in command, while at Anfield, Liverpool were fending off a dogged Wolves, who should have equalised through Matt Doherty and Diogo Jota. Mane celebrates his opener Mane headed home a second late on (81) to wrap up a victory, and the home fans gave Liverpool a huge ovation at full time as attention now turns to the Champions League final against Tottenham on June 1. Wolves finish seventh, meaning they will play in Europa League qualifying from July 26 if Manchester City win the FA Cup final on Saturday against Watford. Liverpool were ahead following an untidy opening quarter of an hour as Trent Alexander-Arnold paced down the right before seeing his deflected cut-back fall into the path of Mane, and the Senegalese forward made no mistake to strike past Rui Patricio. Liverpool were top, and after Andrew Robertson stung the hands of Rui Patricio from range, there was 21 minutes of bedlam at Anfield. First, misinformation of a Brighton goal saw Anfield celebrating prematurely, before Murray did indeed Brighton ahead, prompting pandemonium in the stadium. But it did not last long as Aguero and then Laporte put City in command, and it could have been even worse for Liverpool had Matt Doherty's effort from the right of the box not hit the bar and gone over Alisson's goal. Wolves pushed for a leveller, but Anfield was flattened by a goal elsewhere as Mahrez put City 3-1 up on the south coast, as Divock Origi saw a gilt-edged chance blocked superbly by Conor Coady. Jota saw a one-on-one chance denied by Alisson at the other end, but Liverpool put the game to bed just after City had done the same through Gundogan's free-kick, as Mane got on the end of another Alexander-Arnold delivery to head in from close range. Mane finished the season on 22 goals, sharing the top spot in the Premier League top scorer charts with team-mate Mo Salah and Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, while Alexander-Arnold's 13 assists is the most by a defender in Premier League history. ⚽️ Aubameyang ⚽️ Mane ⚽️ Salah It is a three-way tie for the Premier League Golden Boot — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) May 12, 2019 Virgil van Dijk headed an Alexander-Arnold corner against the bar moments later, but it ended 2-0 as an unforgettable domestic season ended without the ultimate domestic prize for Jurgen Klopp's side.

They couldn't get rid of us and we couldn't get rid of them. Being second in the Premier League is not what I wanted but we have to see it as the first step for this team. We have three weeks to prepare for the Champions League final - let's give it a go.\" Opta stats Liverpool became the first team in top-flight history to win as many as 30 games and 97 points in a season and not win the title. No side has ever previously lost just one game in a top-flight season and not won the title - the previous record was also held by Liverpool in the 2008/09 season (two defeats, finished 2nd). Liverpool's tally of 97 points would have been enough to win the Premier League in all but one of the previous 26 seasons of the competition (2017/18). Wolves have ended the season in 7th position - the highest by a newly-promoted side in the Premier League since Ipswich Town finished 5th in 2000/01. Man of the match - Sadio Mane Mane continued his fantastic finish to the season with both goals, securing a share of the Golden Boot award in the process. He didn't have many other sights of goal but was clinical with the two chances that came his way. What's next?

League Nathaniel Mendez-Laing's double ended Manchester United's wretched season on a sour note with a 2-0 home defeat by relegated Cardiff. Arsenal's win over Burnley guaranteed United would be unable to finish fifth regardless of the scoreline at Old Trafford, but they put in a grimly familiar performance devoid of the intensity, passion or quality required, albeit also lacking luck against a Cardiff side handed a slice of fortune from referee John Moss in opening the scoring. Cardiff winger Mendez-Laing received the slightest of touches from Diogo Dalot's sliding challenge to go down in the area, before picking himself up to beat David De Gea from the spot (23). Striker Mason Greenwood, United's youngest starter in Premier League history, had a number of chances and was inches from scoring when Neil Etheridge turned his close-range effort onto the post, but his bright performance was one of few plus points from a miserable afternoon at Old Trafford. They had other chances to level but could not honestly say they were better than 18th-placed Cardiff, the first relegated side to beat a top-six team this season. Player ratings Manchester United: De Gea (6), Young (4), Jones (5), Smalling (5), Dalot (5), Pereira (7), McTominay (4), Pogba (5), Lingard (6), Rashford (6), Greenwood (7). Subs: Martial (6), Gomes (5), Valencia (6) Cardiff: Etheridge (7), Peltier (7), Manga (6), Morrison (8), Bennett (7), Bacuna (6), Gunnarsson (7), Murphy (8), Mendez-Laing (9), Reid (7), Zohore (7). Subs: Richards (5), Ward (5), Hoilett (n/a) Man of the match: Nathaniel Mendez-Laing And the visitors' second summed up United's season, with some calamitous defending allowing Mendez-Laing to slot in unmarked after half time and double an advantage Cardiff would hold comfortably. How Cardiff embarrassed United The excitement for Greenwood's full debut was nearly rewarded when his early header was kept out by Etheridge, and the 17-year-old went closer still to the perfect start when his shot was brilliantly turned onto the post by the goalkeeper soon after But United, as they have so often this season, drifted from a bright start and let the game ebb and flow around them. Cardiff were already knocking on the door when Moss gave them a glorious chance to open the scoring. The referee harshly adjudged Dalot's brush on Mendez-Laing constituted a foul and awarded a penalty, which the winger duly dispatched. 3:12 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says it was 'embarrassing' to walk off the pitch to the fans applauding the team after their disappointing 2-0 home defeat to Cardiff in the Premier League Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says it was 'embarrassing' to walk off the pitch to the fans applauding the team after their disappointing 2-0 home defeat to Cardiff in the Premier League Cardiff gladly took the momentum to end the half the stronger side, but there was always a chance a half-time team talk from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would see to that. But after a momentary improvement, United crumpled under the slightest pressure. A throw-in from the right caught out stand-in centre-back Scott McTominay, who was busy wrestling Bobby Reid, allowing Josh Murphy a clean run into the area where he squared for Mendez-Laing to tap in. Ole: \"We have a long way to be where we want to be. \"We have to come back with a different mentality and a different attitude of being a Man United team.\" #MUFC pic.twitter.com/0X5SvdDHX7 — Manchester United (@ManUtd) May 12, 2019 The spirit of United's homegrown talent still shone through, but there was little else to encourage the hosts that there was any hope of a comeback, and bar one late turn and shot from Marcus Rashford, they never threatened one. Reid could have put the icing on the cake for Cardiff at the other end, catching the United defence cold when latching on to a long ball forward, and while he bent the ball just wide of De Gea's post, he was still smiling at full time after Cardiff signed off from an ultimately disappointing season in sensational fashion. Opta facts Manchester United have only kept two home clean sheets in the Premier League this season, their fewest at Old Trafford in a top-flight campaign since 1962-63 (2). Cardiff became the first newly promoted team to win away at United in the top-flight by a 2+ goal margin since Nottingham Forest in December 1977 (4-0). Cardiff won an away league match against United at Old Trafford for the first time since April 1954, ending a run of seven games without a win (W0 D2 L5). Cardiff attempted 11 shots in the first half against United - the most by an away team at Old Trafford in the first half of a Premier League game this season. Mason Greenwood (17y 223d) became the youngest ever player to start a Premier League game for Manchester United. Managers Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"We're not a club which should end up sixth, that's where we are at the moment but we're ready for it, the fans, supporters today too, it's near embarrassing when you walk off the pitch clapping them and get the support we have. \"That's the base of this club, the foundation is so great, we'll come back again.\" Neil Warnock: \"I'm meeting up tomorrow with the chairman and the chief executive. I've not personally heard from the owner. I've just heard what he said to the media. So I'll have a good chat tomorrow with the lads. \"When you see this today it makes you really proud to be the manager of a club like this. We're going to be talking about everything. We're going to be losing good players like [Victor] Camarasa, [Harry] Arter, [Oumar] Niasse - we've got one or two injuries as well that will take a few months to clear up. So we're going to need some help. 3:16 Cardiff boss Neil Warnock says he couldn't have asked anymore from his players after his side beat Manchester United 2-0 in the Premier League Cardiff boss Neil Warnock says he couldn't have asked anymore from his players after his side beat Manchester United 2-0 in the Premier League \"But I don't want us to just tick along. We've got to have a go, like Burnley did. I think we're in that situation like Burnley were when they went down first off.\" Man of the match - Nathaniel Mendez-Laing Mendez-Laing doubled his goal tally for the season at Old Trafford, but that alone does not earn him the man-of-the-match award. The tricky winger was fortunate to win the penalty leading to his opener but the manner he got it summed up his eagerness to be direct, and the difficult afternoon he gave the United defence. He went close to another before half-time and was a real pain for both full-backs, drifting across the home backline throughout the match at Old Trafford, and his passion and intensity summed up everything United lacked."},{"date": "12/05/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30367, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Angus Gunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

Highlights from Southampton's 1-1 draw with Huddersfield in the Premier League. Nathan Redmond's wonder-goal was not enough for Southampton as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Huddersfield on the final day of the Premier League season. Redmond put Southampton into the lead (41) with an outstanding curling shot into the top corner after a solo run from the left flank. Debutant goalkeeper Joel Coleman kept Huddersfield on level terms with an outstanding fingertip save to keep out James Ward-Prowse's shot with the help of the crossbar. But Saints 'keeper Angus Gunn gifted the Terriers a goal when he failed to clear, allowing Alex Pritchard to pounce on the ball and slot into an empty net (55). Player ratings Southampton: Gunn (4), Valery (6), Stephens (6), Bednarek (7), Bertrand (7), Hojbjerg (6), Ward-Prowse (7), Romeu (6), Redmond (8), Long (6), Ings (7).

Subs used: Daly (6), Mounie (6). Man of the match: Nathan Redmond. Charlie Austin went close in stoppage time but the Terriers held on to survive a late onslaught from the hosts and bow out of the Premier League with a hard-fought point. How Huddersfield fought back to earn point on final day Both sides made four changes, as Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert handed 23-year-old Coleman his professional debut, replacing outbound Jonas Lossl. Nathan Redmond celebrates the opener against Huddersfield Ralph Hasenhuttl also changed up goalkeepers as Gunn replaced Fraser Forster and Redmond, Ward-Prowse and Oriol Romeu got back in the starting line-up ahead of Mario Lemina, Mohamed Elyounoussi and Stuart Armstrong. Huddersfield made a lively start as Karlan Ahearne-Grant tested Gunn with a fizzing shot while Tommy Smith appealed for a penalty after his shot was seemingly blocked by Jack Stephens with his arm. Aaron Mooy went closest with a curling shot which sailed just over the bar, but it was Redmond who opened the scoring in similar circumstances. The Saints winger picked up the ball on the left flank and beat two opponents before unleashing an outstanding drive into the far corner, giving Coleman no chance. Southampton could have had another shortly after as Redmond fed Danny Ings across the area but the striker's effort was blocked by the sliding Christopher Schindler. Coleman pulled off an outstanding save two minutes into the second half as he tipped Ward Prowse's long-range effort onto the woodwork. Minutes later, Gunn gave away the Huddersfield equaliser as Pritchard dispossessed him in his own box and tapped in an empty net. Alex Pritchard celebrates his equaliser for Huddersfield at Southampton after a bad mistake by Angus Gunn Redmond continued causing problems for the Huddersfield defence by running down the left flank and squaring a ball for Charlie Austin to tap in, but Terence Kongolo made a vital clearance. The former QPR striker posed a danger in added time as his right-footed curler went inches wide, ensuring both sides took a point on the final day. Match stats Huddersfield are just the second side in a 20-team Premier League season to finish with a goal difference of less than -50 after Derby County in 2007-08 (-69). Huddersfield's last away win against Southampton in any competition was a 2-1 top-flight victory in September 1971, with the Terriers drawing two and losing three since then. Southampton have won just one of their last eight final Premier League games of the season (D3 L5), beating Crystal Palace 4-1 in 2015-16. Southampton have never won against a side starting the day bottom this season, winning neither of the previous two (0-0 vs Newcastle in October, 2-3 vs Fulham in November). Southampton and Huddersfield have each used 30 different players in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. No side has had more different goalscorers (excluding own goals) than Saints (16), while only Fulham (10) have had fewer than Huddersfield (11). Managers Jan Siewert: \"I would say it was really positive [end to the season]. \"I knew it was hard after such a tough game we had against Man United to go once more and after such a season which was mentally very hard for players and for us as well, the coaching staff. \"To finish like this and to give everything on the pitch once more is a big, big credit to my players and to the squad because I think we can be proud of how we played today.\" 2:40 Jan Siewert says he's excited about working with the new owners and wants to develop the side ahead of next season. Jan Siewert says he's excited about working with the new owners and wants to develop the side ahead of next season. Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"This game was a picture from the last six months. The first half we had big chances to be two or three up, after the break we had immediately a big chance. \"The players have a lot of things to do better next season. We have a lot to do and we know, it's good that we are safe but the last five games without a win - I don't like it. \"We will do a lot of things this summer to make this not happen next year.\" 2:49 Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl says the hard work starts now and they need to make a big step in their development after they drew 1-1 with Huddersfield. Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl says the hard work starts now and they need to make a big step in their development after they drew 1-1 with Huddersfield. Man of the Match - Nathan Redmond The Southampton winger, who scored in only one of the last 12 games, regained his place in the starting line-up after being benched at West Ham and wasted no time in causing havoc for the Huddersfield defence. His opening goal was a piece of brilliance, showing blistering pace, technical ability and great finishing to dummy two defenders and wrap his foot around the ball to find the far corner. Goal aside, he proved a thorn in the flesh of the Huddersfield back line, racing forward with intent for the whole game with no defender capable of dealing with his constant runs. Ralph Hasenhuttl is right to demand more from Redmond, if this is what he is capable of. What's next? Both sides end their Premier League season with a draw keeping them in their respective positions - Southampton end in 16th place, while Huddersfield finish bottom of the table with 16 points. The Saints will play in the Premier League next season while Huddersfield drop down a tier to the Sky Bet Championship."},{"date": "12/05/2019", "arena": "Tottenham Hotspur Stadium", "attendance":

Highlights from Tottenham's draw against Everton in the Premier League Tottenham confirmed their place in the Champions League for a fourth successive season after playing out an entertaining 2-2 draw with Everton. Eric Dier slammed the hosts in front after three minutes, but Everton responded with two quick-fire goals through Theo Walcott (69) and Cenk Tosun (72) in the second period. Christian Eriksen's low free-kick ensured a share of the spoils as Mauricio Pochettino's side marked their homecoming following their midweek Champions League exploits by earning only a second league draw of the season. Spurs will now turn their focus on overcoming Liverpool in the Madrid final on June 1, having finished in fourth place, while the point ensures Everton finish the season once more in eighth position. Eric Dier lashes Tottenham in front after just three minutes on Sunday Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Davies (6), Walker-Peters (7), Alderweireld (6), Dier (7), Sissoko (6), Alli (6), Eriksen (6), Lamela (6), Moura (6), Llorente (6).

Subs: Gomes (6), Lookman (7) Man of the match: Kyle Walker-Peters. Spurs in need of reinforcements For all the brilliance they have shown in reaching the final of the Champions League, Spurs' domestic season has once again demonstrated they do not have the depth required to sustain a title challenge for a full campaign - and this was not a performance to stir the hearts. Team news Erik Lamela, Kyle Walker-Peters, Ben Davies and Fernando Llorente came in for the suspended Heung-Min Son, Kieran Trippier, Davinson Sanchez and Danny Rose for Spurs. Everton made three changes as Yerry Mina replaced the injured Seamus Coleman in defence while Cenk Tosun and Theo Walcott came in for Dominic Calvert-Lewin up and Richarlison. But Erik Lamela - on his return to the side following a hamstring injury - had an instant impact as his early corner was not dealt with at the near post by Yerry Mina, and Dier was allowed to turn and fire past Jordan Pickford as Everton's weakness at defending set pieces this season came back to bite them. The visitors nearly equalised after 30 minutes when Bernard's shot crept through the legs of Kyle Walker-Peters and was well kept out by Hugo Lloris low to his right, but they were cheering before half-time as news filtered through that Manchester City had gone ahead against Brighton at the Amex Stadium. Theo Walcott celebrates hauling Everton level with a low finish after 69 minutes Marco Silva was less than impressed, however, but his double change shortly after the hour mark cajoled his players into life with two goals in the space of four minutes. Substitutes Andre Gomes and Ademola Lookman combined before Gylfi Sigurdsson laid the ball into Walcott's path for a precise finish into the corner to level matters much to the delight of the former Arsenal winger. Cenk Tosun leaps for joy after turning the game around with Everton's second With Spurs unresponsive to being pegged back, Everton duly went in front moments later as Tottenham's vulnerabilities in defending crosses again became very apparent. After Michael Keane's header from Sigurdsson's corner was kept out by Lloris, Tosun was fastest to react to bundle in his first league goal in 16 appearances. But Eriksen responded immediately with a pinpoint free-kick - aided by Pickford taking a step to his right - as Spurs ended their domestic season with a point. Eriksen holds his nerve to curl Tottenham level in the second half This was an afternoon of ensuring no further injuries for Pochettino, and as his players embarked on a lap of appreciation at the full-time with Jan Vertonghen and Harry Kane in attendance, the biggest test of their season still lies ahead. ⬆ @SpursOfficial have finished above Arsenal for the 3rd successive season. Spurs last achieved this in 1967-68, the last of a run of 9 consecutive seasons in which they finished ahead of the Gunners pic.twitter.com/L6mBDKBpwO — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 12, 2019 Opta stats Tottenham have finished in the top four in each of the last four Premier League seasons; their best such run in the top-flight since a run of five between 1959-60 and 1963-64. Everton's draw saw them seal an eight-placed finish for the second consecutive season in the Premier League, however their goal difference was 22 goals better off this term (+8 in 2018-19, -14 in 2017-18). Tottenham are unbeaten in their last 13 Premier League meetings with Everton (W7 D6), with their last defeat against them in the competition coming in December 2012 (1-2). Excluding penalties, Everton conceded the most goals from set pieces of any team in the Premier League this season (16). Christian Eriksen's goal for Spurs was the 1067th Premier League goal this season; more goals than any other 38-game season of the competition. Since his debut in the Premier League in September 2013, Spurs' Christian Eriksen has scored the most direct free kicks (7) and most goals from outside the box (22). Eric Dier's opener for Spurs (2:49) was the quickest goal Everton have conceded in the Premier League since November 2017, when Crystal Palace's James McArthur netted against them after 51 seconds. Everton's Theo Walcott has been directly involved in 10 goals against Spurs in the Premier League (six goals, four assists); his joint-most against a single opponent in the competition (also 10 v Newcastle). The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"This group of players deserve so much credit. They have put so much unbelievable effort in. There have been many positives this season. \"The players and staff have shown so much character. We broke down all the doors when the circumstances were against us with the new stadium stuff. 2:09 Mauricio Pochettino says he's proud of his players for fighting for a result after coming from behind in their 2-2 draw with Everton Mauricio Pochettino says he's proud of his players for fighting for a result after coming from behind in their 2-2 draw with Everton \"So to see their capacity to fight again makes me so proud. I think this is our best season in our five years. \"I am so happy, so pleased. What we have achieved this season - top four and final of Champions League - it is difficult to assess now but in time the people will realise what we achieve.\" Marco Silva: \"I was satisfied by the end of the match but not with how we started. We were too slow and we made a mistake at the set piece. Afterwards, we started to react. It was different in the second half and we showed more desire to score. \"They scored from another set piece, but we did well and we showed desire to play our offensive game. The last two or three months we've done fantastic.\" 2:56 Everton boss Marco Silva was disappointed at his side's first half performance but was pleased the desire they showed to get themselves back in the game Everton boss Marco Silva was disappointed at his side's first half performance but was pleased the desire they showed to get themselves back in the game Man of the match - Kyle Walker-Peters Pochettino admitted beforehand he had very few options when selecting his side, but one player who looked keen to grab his opportunity from the first whistle was Walker-Peters. Kyle Walker-Peters provided a constant outlet for Tottenham down the right The 22-year-old right-back may feel Kieran Trippier's position is less than assured after a difficult season for the more experienced man in possession of his shirt. But Walker-Peters was full of energy on the wing and aggressive in the tackle, providing urgency where many others were playing with their shades on. What's next?

West Ham were two up against the run of play at the break, after captain Noble capped a fine individual effort by slotting home from the edge of the box on 15 minutes and Manuel Lanzini (38) reacted quickest to nod home after Ben Foster had tipped Michail Antonio's drive onto the bar. Premier League top scorers Premier League table But while the impressive Gerard Deulofeu (46) pounced on a Pablo Zabaleta error immediately after the restart to give Watford hope, Jose Holebas' straight red for tripping Antonio handed the advantage to West Ham - and also means he misses Saturday's FA Cup final with Manchester City. Mark Noble celebrates his opener Despite some brave initial resistance from Watford they were again slowest to the rebound when Marko Arnautovic (72) slid in his 10th of the season after Felipe Anderson had volleyed against a post. Noble then put the result beyond doubt when he coolly slotted in from the spot after Kiko Femenia had tumbled Antonio in the box to secure 10th place for West Ham and drop Watford to 11th.

Subs: Wilshere (6), Zabaleta (5), Sanchez (6) Man of the match: Mark Noble (West Ham) How West Ham snatched 10th Watford dominated much of the opening 45 minutes but were undone by wasteful finishing. They did have the ball in the net inside a minute when Deulofeu had been flagged offside and the attacker tested Lukasz Fabianski from 20 yards moments later. Team news Watford made two changes, with Etienne Capoue back from a groin injury and Christian Kabasele returning, too. Meanwhile, West Ham welcomed back Declan Rice and Felipe Anderson after illness. Will Hughes then saw an overhead kick claimed by the keeper before Noble struck back for West Ham. The midfielder played a one-two around Etienne Capoue before surging forward and dropping a shoulder to wrong-foot Christian Kabasele and slot the ball into the bottom corner. Manuel Lanzini pounced for the second Roberto Pereyra then passed up two fine chances at the other end, tamely shooting at Fabianski before opting to try a pass when the strike looked on - and West Ham made Watford pay again. Lanzini was perfectly placed to head in from close range after Foster had brilliantly diverted Antonio's effort onto the underside of the woodwork. Lukasz Fabianski made a key save from Troy Deeney Fabianski produced a sublime stop just before the break to keep out Troy Deeney but Watford pulled one back from West Ham's kick-off to the second half when Deulofeu raced onto Zabaleta's weak back-pass and rounded Fabianski before rolling the ball into the net. However, hopes of a comeback took a hit just three minutes later when Holebas, who was making his 100th Premier League appearance, tangled legs with Antonio as he surged through at the other end and was shown a straight red which rules him out of Saturday's showpiece clash with champions City. Holebas was sent off for Watford after fouling West Ham's Michail Antonio Watford showed resolve, though, and Deulofeu almost played Abdoulaye Doucoure through before the hosts saw three penalty appeals waved away, first when Antonio controlled the ball onto his arm in the West Ham box, then when Pereyra went down despite no contact from Fabian Balbuena, and finally when sub Andre Gray fell after turning Arthur Masuaku, who won the ball. But eventually West Ham made their extra-man advantage tell and, shortly after Craig Cathcart had produced a stunning tackle to deny Arnautovic, the Austria forward tucked home a third from close range and Noble sent Foster the wrong way from 12 yards after Femenia lost possession and hauled down Antonio in the box. Man of the match: Mark Noble Mark Noble celebrates the opener against Watford Captain fantastic was the key man in the middle of the park for West Ham on Sunday. He took his first goal brilliantly, sparking something out of nothing with a smart one-two and a clever dummy on the edge of the area before slotting in. his second from the spot was expertly dispatched, too. But, by then, the Hammers had taken control against their 10-man opposition - largely thanks to winning the midfield battle. The managers' view Javi Gracia, Watford: \"We have another chance, a final to enjoy with our supporters. The final is the consequence of all the hard work we were doing before and we have to finish as well as possible. 2:48 Watford's Javi Gracia kept silent on the decision to send Jose Holebas off against West Ham as it rules him out of the FA Cup Final. Watford's Javi Gracia kept silent on the decision to send Jose Holebas off against West Ham as it rules him out of the FA Cup Final. \"The season we've done was a good season, good work and now we have the chance, only one team out of the big six have, to play a final. We try to enjoy that moment. Because the season was the best ever in this club, we have to know it, give value and try to enjoy the final.\" Manuel Pellegrini, West Ham: \"To finish the first season in the upper part of the table is realistic, it is what this team is in this moment. We know we have six very strong teams and after that Everton, who over the last two or three years, have strengthened their squad so for the first season, to finish in the first 10 positions is not bad. 2:38 Manuel Pellegrini praises Mark Noble after he scored his 50th league goal for the club in their 4-1 win over Watford. Manuel Pellegrini praises Mark Noble after he scored his 50th league goal for the club in their 4-1 win over Watford. \"I think we improved in points, in goals conceded, in goals scored. If you compare with the last season, when also we saw many troubles and problems inside the pitch, this season the fans enjoyed the games so I think we grow a step.\" Opta stats Despite their defeat today, Watford recorded their highest season finish (11th) in the top-flight of English football since 1986-87 (9th place). West Ham won 15 games and picked up 52 points in the Premier League this season, both their most in a campaign since 2015-16 (16 wins, 62 points). Watford have not kept a clean sheet in any of their last 12 Premier League games - only once previously have they had a longer such streak in the competition (20 games between September 1999 and March 2000). West Ham have won consecutive away games in the Premier League for just the second time under manager Manuel Pellegrini, having previously won three in a row in December 2018. Since their return to the Premier League in 2015-16, Watford have picked up 16 red cards in the competitions, more than any other side. Only Paolo Di Canio (47) has scored more Premier League goals for West Ham United than Mark Noble (42). Gerard Deulofeu's goal for Watford (45:11) was the quickest at the start of the second half in the Premier League since January 2018 (also 45:11 - West Ham's Marko Arnautovic v Huddersfield). Manuel Lanzini scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham since the final day of the 2017-18 season (two goals v Everton on May 13, 2018). What's next?

Leicester in the Premier League Highlights from Manchester City's 1-0 win over Leicester in the Premier League Vincent Kompany's stunning long-range strike moved Manchester City to within one win of the title as a 1-0 victory over Leicester saw the champions return to the top of the Premier League on Monday Night Football. Kompany produced a captain's goal when City needed it most, breaking the stalemate with an unstoppable 30-yard drive into the top corner just as Pep Guardiola's side looked out of ideas. Kelechi Iheanacho spurned a glorious chance to haunt his former club three minutes from time, but he dragged Leicester's best chance wide as Kompany's sensational 70th-minute effort - City's 100th at home in all competitions this season - settled the contest. The result - City's 13th consecutive league victory - means they will become the first side in a decade to retain the title if they win at Brighton on the final day of the season. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (6), Kompany (8), Laporte (7), Zinchenko (6), Foden (6), Gundogan (6), David Silva (6), Sterling (6), Aguero (6), Bernardo Silva (8). Subs: Sane (6), Jesus (n/a), Stones (n/a). Leicester: Schmeichel (8), Pereira (6), Evans (7), Maguire (7), Chilwell (7), Ndidi (6), Choudhury (6), Tielemans (6), Albrighton (6), Maddison (7), Vardy (6). Subs: Barnes (5), Iheanacho (4), Gray (n/a). Man of the Match: Vincent Kompany How City managed to stay just ahead Liverpool's win at Newcastle meant that only three points would do if City were to keep the destiny of the title in their hands. That burden weighed heavy on the champions' shoulders in a first half that would have done their nerves no favours. A desperate block from Kompany, launching himself in the path of Ricardo Pereira's shot after James Maddison's clever through pass had dissected the hosts' midfield, prevented the Foxes from taking the lead on nine minutes. City responded as Phil Foden brought Kyle Walker's long ball down on his chest in the area, but his volley was straight at Kasper Schmeichel. The Leicester goalkeeper then pulled off a stunning reaction save to prevent Sergio Aguero's header from drifting into the goal after cannoning down off the bar on 33 minutes, the Goal Decision System ruling the whole of the ball had not crossed the line. Ilkay Gundogan sent two volleys wide before the break as City ended the half strongly, but their eagerness to take the lead turned into desperation as the half drew to a close. Team news Man City: Phil Foden replaced Leroy Sane in City’s only change from the win at Burnley. Phil Foden replaced Leroy Sane in City’s only change from the win at Burnley. Leicester: Brendan Rodgers named an unchanged side following their emphatic 3-0 win over Arsenal. Raheem Sterling spurned a great opportunity to calm City nerves seven minutes into the second half, but he mistimed his jump as he looked to convert David Silva's knock back and sent the ball looping over. As chance after chance went to waste, the anxiety levels inside the Etihad - not helped by the threat of Maddison and Jamie Vardy on the counter - intensified to near unbearable levels. 1:01 Take a moment to enjoy Vincent Kompany's goal from all the best angles Take a moment to enjoy Vincent Kompany's goal from all the best angles But, in their hour of need, City's captain produced a moment fit to decide any match - and perhaps the title race - as his rasping drive flew beyond Schmeichel. Iheanacho should have done better when he fired wide on 87 minutes, but the evening belonged to City's captain fantastic as he steered the club towards the fourth title of his stewardship. Opta stats Man City have now scored 100 goals in all competitions at the Etihad this season; extending their record for most home goals by an English top-flight team in a single campaign. Man City return to the top of the Premier League; the 32nd lead change this season, with 29 of those involving Liverpool or City. Man City have won each of their last 13 Premier League games - it's the fourth run of a team winning 13+ games in a row in the competition's history, with Man City the only side to have done so twice. Man City have beaten every team they've faced in the league for the second consecutive season; the only other English top-flight team to achieve this were Preston between 1888-89 and 1889-90. Vincent Kompany has scored his 20th goal in all competitions for Man City, with his strike tonight versus Leicester his first from outside the box Leicester have won just one of their last seven away games versus Man City in all competitions (W1 D1 L5). The managers 3:03 Pep Guardiola admitted he was hoping Vincent Kompany would pass the ball rather than shooting as the City captain shaped up to hit the winner Pep Guardiola admitted he was hoping Vincent Kompany would pass the ball rather than shooting as the City captain shaped up to hit the winner Pep Guardiola: \"There are important players in this club, more than a century of history and not a lot in the trophy cabinet, but there are players who helped us to be who we are today. Vincent Kompany is one of them, when he is fit he is an incredible centre-back. Not just for the goal he has been a leader many times.\" 4:04 Brendan Rodgers felt his Leicester players produced an outstanding performance despite losing 1-0 to Manchester City at the Etihad Brendan Rodgers felt his Leicester players produced an outstanding performance despite losing 1-0 to Manchester City at the Etihad Brendan Rodgers: \"I'm proud of the team, it bodes well for the future, the personality we played with. We showed we've got personality to play with our quality against one of the best team's in Europe. It took an incredible goal to stop us getting something from the game. I'm disappointed because we deserved more.\" Man of the Match - Vincent Kompany ⭐️ Man of the Match, @ManCity’s @VincentKompany 90 touches Completed 76/84 passes 1 shot, 5th goal attempt in PL this season 1st goal since April 2018 pic.twitter.com/hIMMlfd2J0 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 6, 2019 In a moment to encapsulate the thrilling drama of this year's title battle, Kompany broke Leicester's dogged resistance with a 30-yard thunderbolt with 20 minutes remaining. Incredibly, it was the Manchester City captain's first shot on target from outside the penalty area since 2013 and the first he had scored from outside the box for City. If this proves to be the Belgian's final season at the club, one cannot think of a more fitting parting gift. What's next?

Highlights from Chelsea's win over Watford in the Premier League. Chelsea secured Champions League football for next season following their 3-0 victory against Watford at Stamford Bridge. Second-half headers from Ruben Loftus-Cheek (48) and David Luiz (51) - both from Eden Hazard crosses - secured three points that for large parts didn't look like coming, before Gonzalo Higuain added a third (78). Watford created Maurizio Sarri's side numerous problems, especially in a one-sided first-half, with Kepa Arrizabalaga making one of the saves of the season to deny Troy Deeney. Champions League qualification was eventually secured after Arsenal were held at home by Brighton later in the day. Chelsea's final game of the season is away at Leicester next Sunday. Player Ratings Chelsea: Kepa (8), Azpilicueta (7), Luiz (7), Christensen (7), Alonso (6), Kante (6), Jorginho (6), Kovacic (6), Hazard (8), Higuain (7), Pedro (7) Subs: Loftus-Cheek (8), Cahill (N/A), Giroud (N/A) Watford: Foster (6), Femenia (6), Mariappa (6), Cathcart (6), Holebas (6), Doucoure (8), Hughes (7), Chalobah (6), Pereyra (6), Deulofeu (7), Deeney (8) Subs: Sucess (6), Gray (6), Cleverley (6) Man of the Match: Kepa Arrizabalaga How Blues leapt above Spurs... It wasn't all rosy for Sarri's men as N'Golo Kante limped off after 10 minutes - a worry ahead of Chelsea's semi-final second leg with Eintracht Frankfurt. Coming into this fixture, Chelsea hadn't won in their last six games after a European tie and they looked ponderous as Watford dominated the early exchanges. Team news Chelsea: Eden Hazard returned in one of four changes made by Maurizio Sarri. Watford: Nathaniel Chalobah started just his third Premier League game since 2017, against his former club. Troy Deeney returned in attack. Only a fantastic one-handed save from Kepa stopped the visitors taking an early lead. Troy Deeney was wheeling away in celebration after looping a header towards the top corner but the Chelsea goalkeeper somehow clawed his effort away. Gerard Deulofeu, Jose Holebas and Abdoulaye Doucoure all had good sightings of goal but let Chelsea off the hook with some wasteful finishing. Chelsea just simply had to improve after the break - and they did. Loftus-Cheek - on for Kante - eased the tension by rising highest to force home a Hazard cross on 48 minutes. That gave everyone inside Stamford Bridge a lift and three minutes later the game was over when Luiz thumped home another Hazard centre. In a blink of an eye, Watford were down and out, although they continued to threaten but lacked quality in the final third. Hazard was in his element now on the counter-attack, and Chelsea struck again when Pedro threaded a ball through to Higuain. With the game won, there was time for Gary Cahill to say his goodbyes to the Stamford Bridge crowd. His contract is up at the end of the season and Sarri brought on the club captain for the final few minutes to the delight of the locals. Gary Cahill was given 'the bumps' by his team-mates Man of the match: Kepa Arrizabalaga It's not a game that will live long in the memory in terms of drama but it'll be hard to forget the Chelsea goalkeeper's miraculous save to keep the score 0-0 early on from Troy Deeney. That in itself was enough to gain the outstanding performance award as he racked up his 14th clean sheet of the season. Kepa Arrizabalaga makes a save during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Watford at Stamford Bridge Opta stats Watford haven't kept a clean sheet in any of their last 40 Premier League games against 'big six' opponents, last recording a shutout in February 2016 against Chelsea at Vicarage Road. Chelsea have named a starting XI with no English players for the 20th time in the Premier League this season - only Arsenal in 2006-07 (33) and 2007-08 (27) have done so more in a single campaign. Hazard has been directly involved in 31 Premier League goals for Chelsea this season (16 goals, 15 assists); only Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (32 - 2000/01), Frank Lampard (36 - 2009/10) and Didier Drogba (39 - 2009/10) have had a hand in more in a single campaign for Chelsea. Hazard has assisted 15 league goals this season - more than any other player in the big five European leagues in 2018-19. Manager reaction.... Maurizio Sarri said: \"I think in the first half we were tired, mentally. We were in trouble. Then they lowered their intensity. We were lucky to score after two minutes - we improved mentally after first goal. We played very well for 35 minutes then. It's not easy to play after 60 hours. After Europa League away games we've only won one match. \"When you are not brilliant physically you have to move the ball, the ball isn't tired, the man is tried. In the second half we did it better as something changed in our minds.\" 4:00 Maurizio Sarri said it was a vital win for his side and they will keep fighting in their attempt to secure a Champions League place.

top-four hopes extinguished as lowly Huddersfield earned a spirited 1-1 draw on Renault Super Sunday. United looked likely to continue their fight for a Champions League spot into the final game of the season after taking an early lead when Jonas Lossl tamely let in Scott McTominay's shot after eight minutes. But Isaac Mbenza equalised on the hour mark when Luke Shaw misjudged Lossl's clearance, and Huddersfield's 10th home goal of the entire league season left the Red Devils four points off a top-four spot with only a game left to play. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's recent problems at United had showed signs of returning soon after their opener and they regularly struggled for intensity and tempo - and although Paul Pogba did strike the woodwork twice in spectacular style, they rarely displayed a cutting edge against a side who have conceded 75 league goals this season. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Durm (6), Schindler (6), Kongolo (7), Lowe (7), Mooy (6), Bacuna (7), Hogg (6), Mbenza (7), Grant (7), Pritchard (7). Subs: Smith (7), Diakhaby (n/a). Manchester United: De Gea (7), Young (6), Jones (5), Lindelof (6), Shaw (5), McTominay (7), Matic (6), Pogba (6), Mata (7), Rashford (6), Sanchez (5). Subs: Herrera (6), Chong (7), Dalot (n/a) Man of the match: Juan Mata Huddersfield were already in party mood as they celebrated their two-year stay in the top flight in their final home game before relegation, and had even more to sing about after Mbenza's goal on the break. But for United, it was more misery as a run of eight points from their last eight games officially ended their outside hopes of Champions League qualification. United's lacklustre side were left despondent after dropping points in another poor performance How United's season officially fizzled out United had been impressive for large parts of their draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford last weekend, and there were signs they had taken confidence from that performance as they started brightly against a Huddersfield side with nothing to lose. Even so, it took a gift from the hosts for them to open the scoring, when the recalled McTominay picked up a loose ball 25 yards out and Lossl let his shot from the edge of the area under his body. Scott McTominay celebrates after putting Manchester United ahead Whether down to complacency or nerves, United treated much of the rest of the opening 45 minutes like a training match, passing the ball around comfortably but with little penetration of a limited Huddersfield defence, and only a moment of Pogba magic, striking the bar on the volley from Mata's right-wing delivery, came anywhere near adding to their early opener. They nearly shot themselves in the foot when a poor pass out of defence from Phil Jones was picked off and Huddersfield top-scorer Karlan Grant played through, but David De Gea kept the visitors ahead by saving well with his feet. Isaac Mbenza's goal was his first for Huddersfield, and just their 10th at home all season After the break things got little better for United, and with an hour gone they were made to pay for their sluggishness when they found themselves behind from their own corner. Lossl gathered Mata's delivery and set Grant away when Shaw missed his interception on the half-way line, and he placed the ball between De Gea's legs with a composed finish. Following a long delay as the corner flag was broken during Huddersfield's goal celebrations, there was finally a hint of a rally from United in the latter stages, with young substitute Tahith Chong particularly lively, but still their quality deserted them as Phil Jones and Marcus Rashford both missed fine chances, and the youngster was denied himself by Lossl. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has won only one of his last eight United games And with two minutes to go when Pogba rattled the woodwork for a second time with a powerful effort, it became clear United's goose was cooked - and that the Europa League now awatis for Solskjaer's men next season. Neville fumes at 'awful' United Co-commentator Gary Neville told Sky Sports: \"This is Huddersfield Town, who have struggled all season. You watch them, they haven't got the quality, but I like watching them a lot more than the ones in the red shirts, to be honest. \"At least you can identify with them. There's nothing I like about this United team at all, it's just awful. Look at them. They're the most despondent group of people. \"It reminds of the team Mauricio Pochettino inherited at Tottenham and he dismantled it bit by bit. Ole will need to do the same, it'd be nice if the club got an experienced sporting director to help him, but the shambles of that recruitment reported in the press this week hasn't helped.\" Fellow Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp added after full-time: \"At times, watching them today was shambolic. The last six, seven, eight games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer there have been a lot of question marks. We all looked at Jose Mourinho and said he was the main problem. Paul Pogba was the poster boy for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's early success - but his form has since faltered again \"I've no doubt they needed to move on from him, you could see he was damaging the club to a certain extent, and everyone's saying if we can bring in more players in the summer that might be the way forward - since Ferguson left they've spent £744m and what they've done is try to buy the Harlem Globetrotters, not necessarily players to make a team. \"Look at what Manchester City and Liverpool have done in that time, they've bought the right players without any egos. It's alright saying sell Paul Pogba, but there's so much more that's wrong with that club.\" Read more of the pundits' damning assessment of United's season here. Managers Jan Siewert: \"I would say that it will take time to get a philosophy integrated and we still need another pre-season to go through it with the players. It wasn't easy to play against Man Utd, which is an incredible team for me, but the way we played, I'm really proud. 3:16 Watch Jan Siewert's proud post-match interview Watch Jan Siewert's proud post-match interview \"Throughout the season, the supporters have supported us so much and we knew we played for Dean Hoyle today and the supporters to give something back. It has been a very tough season and every supporter has been through it with us and it made me proud to show the whole world that Huddersfield Town is alive and we have possibilities to develop.\" Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"Over 90 minutes, we weren't good enough. We couldn't put our chances away when we could have finished the game off early on. We had a bright start with the right attitude and the right approach, created many chances and we didn't let them in our own half really. 3:45 Watch Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's warning to Manchester United after another poor result Watch Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's warning to Manchester United after another poor result \"When you get the first goal, you then think 'OK get the second and then the game is over' because when you go to these places that have stadiums full of energy, it is their last game in the Premier League now and we knew if we gave them an inkling of hope, they'd be up for it and unfortunately, we did so. \"We are where we are for a reason. Over a long season, we haven't been good enough to challenge for the Champions League places and today, we've ended up with the last hope being took away so it's not something that comes like a surprise. Today, we hoped to win the game and show a better performance.\" Opta facts Manchester United have failed to win both of their Premier League visits to the John Smith's Stadium (D1 L1); they are the only side to visit the ground more than once in the Premier League without winning. This draw ended Huddersfield's eight-match losing streak in the league; their joint-longest ever run of defeats in the Football League. Only relegated Fulham and Huddersfield (both five) have kept fewer clean sheets in the Premier League this season than Manchester United (seven). Manchester United have now gone five matches without a win in all competitions (D2 L3), their longest such run since December 2015 (eight games under Louis van Gaal). Huddersfield avoided defeat in a Premier League match in which they fell behind for the first time since drawing 1-1 at Burnley in October 2018, ending a run of 23 straight league losses when trailing at any stage. Manchester United are winless in six away games across all competitions (D1 L5), their poorest streak on their travels since November 2014 (nine games). Scott McTominay has scored in back-to-back starts in the Premier League for Manchester United (two goals), this after having scored none in his first 14 for the club beforehand. Jonas Lossl has assisted two Premier League goals for Huddersfield - both against Manchester United at the John Smith's Stadium. Lossl is one of only four goalkeepers to assist more than one Premier League goal against a particular opponent (also Jussi Jaaskelainen v Fulham, Chris Kirkland v Charlton and Manuel Almunia v Everton). Man of the match - Juan Mata In an otherwise desperately poor United performance, Mata's determination shone through although even his quality was lacking at times. The Spanish playmaker got United going in the final third on the odd occasion they did enjoy sustained possession around it, and could have scored himself but sidefooted wide of the far post before half-time. What's next? Huddersfield finish their Premier League spell with a long trip to the south coast to face Southampton next Sunday at 3pm. Manchester United host relegated Cardiff at the same time."},{"date": "05/05/2019", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59965, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Bernd Leno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephan Lichtsteiner", "yellows": ["64"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["77"]}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": ["84"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sokratis Papastathopoulos", "yellows": ["14"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Torreira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": ["60"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["77"]}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["77"]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["77"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Guendouzi", "yellows": ["83"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["77"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sead Kolasinac", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["77"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Edward Nketiah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": ["63"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Fernandes da Silva Junior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["45"]}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": ["45+2"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["90+2"]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yves Bissouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["78"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["90+2"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jürgen Locadia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Andone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["78"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["45"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Balogun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Button", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:58 Highlights from Arsenal's draw with Brighton in the Premier League. Highlights from Arsenal's draw with Brighton in the Premier League. Arsenal's bid for a top-four finish is all but over after Unai Emery's side were held to a 1-1 draw by Brighton on Renault Super Sunday. Premier League table | Premier League top goalscorers Following Chelsea's win over Watford earlier in the day, Unai Emery's side knew nothing but a win would do in the race to finish in the top four and they took an early lead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's ninth-minute penalty after Nacho Monreal was brought down by Alireza Jahanbakhsh. However, the Gunners were pegged back by Glenn Murray's second-half penalty (61) after Granit Xhaka tripped Solly March, leaving them three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham with one game remaining. Arsenal could still secure a fourth-placed finish but it would require them to win at Burnley and Spurs to lose against Everton with an eight-goal swing. Realistically, Arsenal's only remaining chance of Champions League qualification is through winning the Europa League. \"We wanted to win today and we worked in the Premier League to be with the possibility of getting into the top four but today we lost the chance,\" said boss Unai Emery. \"Now, it's too big [the gap].\" Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (6), Lichtsteiner (6), Mustafi (6), Sokratis (6), Monreal (5), Xhaka (5), Torreira (6), Ozil (6), Mkhitaryan (6), Lacazette (6), Aubameyang (7).

The Gunners hold a 3-1 advantage after the first leg at the Emirates Stadium last Thursday. How Arsenal slipped up Everything looked to be going Arsenal's way when Aubameyang scored from the penalty spot after Monreal went down under seemingly minimal contact from Jahanbakhsh. Referee Anthony Taylor took his time before pointing to the spot Aubameyang made no mistake, sending Ryan the wrong way to score his 20th Premier League goal of the campaign. ⚽️ Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang becomes the 4th player to reach 20 PL goals this season - is only the 3rd player in the last 11 seasons to score 20+ goals in PL for Arsenal 18/19 - Aubameyang (20) 16/17 - Sanchez (24) 11/12 - Van Persie (30) pic.twitter.com/nyBX4Y4WAy — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 5, 2019 However, the Gunners couldn't maintain their bright start as Brighton grew into the game. Brighton dominated the ball early in the second-half and they almost drew level when March forced Bernd Leno into action at his near-post They found an equaliser in the 61st minute, though, when referee Taylor awarding the visitors a penalty after Xhaka tripped March. Just like Aubameyang in the first-half, Murray tucked the spot kick away with minimal fuss for his 200th senior goal. ⚽️ 200 senior club career goals for @OfficialBHAFC’s Glenn Murray - breakdown by competition: 35 PL 67 Championship 54 League 1 31 League 2 8 FA Cup 4 League Cup 1 Football League Trophy pic.twitter.com/YP0pWDHBU7 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 5, 2019 The leveller drew a response from Arsenal and Aubameyang had their best chance to win the game but he fired a volley wide from eight yards Emery made a triple substitution with Alex Iwobi, Matteo Guendouzi and Sead Kolasinac all introduced for the final 15 minutes, but it was March who came close to winning it for Brighton, forcing a brilliant save from Leno before Pascal Gross fired the rebound wide. Arsenal could not find a winner and the performance from the home side saw plenty of their fans head for an early exit, with many of those who remained jeering at full-time despite the post-match lap of honour and farewells for the retiring Petr Cech and Juventus-bound Aaron Ramsey. Man of the Match - Lewis Dunk Nothing was getting past Dunk at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Alongside Shane Duffy, he marshalled the Brighton defence brilliantly and he was equal to anything Arsenal threw at him. Time after time he made crucial interventions to thwart Arsenal's forward line, A real impressive display from the 27-year-old. Pundits on Arsenal's top-four failure Unai Emery admits it was a disappointing result as Arsenal looked to have missed out on a Champions League place following their draw with Brighton in the Premier League. Jamie Redknapp: \"I don't think they have the quality to get into the top four. What will hurt is that they gave themselves the chance and they've given it away today. You can see how disappointed the players are.\" Alex Scott: \"They had the chances at the end, but I sound like a broken record. We know where Arsenal have been vulnerable defensively all season, and they targeted the right-hand side. If Emery lifts the Europa League trophy, you'd say it's been a great season but his hands are tied. You look at Arsenal's season, and they deserve to be where they are.\" Manager reaction Unai Emery: \"We deserved to win. We are very defensively very strong and we had chances to score first half, and in the second half we didn't take our chances but they defended very well. I have to congratulate them for the way they worked. 2:56 Chris Hughton said Brighton's performance was much improved from recent displays and he was pleased with their draw against Arsenal in the Premier League. Chris Hughton said Brighton's performance was much improved from recent displays and he was pleased with their draw against Arsenal in the Premier League. \"We fight and we tried to win but each match in the Premier League is very difficult and today was a prime example. We need new energy and new players to change the performance. Scoring makes all the difference.\" Brighton boss Chris Hughton said of Arsenal's penalty: \"My first impression was that it was soft, but sometimes what happens is you then see it at half-time and at the end of the game and find it was a penalty. Lewis Dunk produced a brilliant display at Arsenal Lewis Dunk produced a brilliant display at Arsenal \"I've seen it since on two or three occasions and for me, absolutely not a penalty. \"It's tough, particularly at that stage of the game when we wanted to get something and put on a performance but credit to our players I thought they played really well. We had to dig deep and I thought we thoroughly deserved the result.\" Opta stats Arsenal are winless in their last four Premier League games (D1 L3), their longest run without a victory in the competition since February 2016 (also four games). The Gunners failed to win both league meetings against Brighton this season (D2), despite opening the scoring in both games - they last did this against an opponent in a Premier League campaign in 2010-11 v Spurs (D1 L1). Brighton avoided defeat away from home against \"big six\" opposition for the first time in the Premier League - they had lost each of their last 11 games before today. Arsenal have conceded 50 or more goals in consecutive top-flight campaigns for the first time since 1982-83 and 1983-84. Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the sixth different player to score 20+ goals in a Premier League season for the club, and the first since Alexis Sánchez in 2016-17. Since making his debut in the competition in February 2018, only Mohamed Salah (35) has scored more Premier League goals than Aubameyang (30). What's next? Arsenal are back in action on Thursday when they travel to Spain to face Valencia for the second leg of their Europa League semi-final. The Gunners hold a 3-1 advantage after the first leg at the Emirates Stadium last Thursday. They are back in Premier League action next Sunday when they travel to Burnley (3pm) on the final day of the season. Brighton have had their say in the race for the top four but they could have a crucial role to play in the destination of the title.

Highlights from Bournemouth's 1-0 win over Tottenham in the Premier League Heung-Min Son and Juan Foyth were sent off for Tottenham as Bournemouth left it late to break their resistance in a 1-0 win on Saturday. Son saw red (43) for an uncharacteristically aggressive reaction to a tackle from Jefferson Lerma. Substitute Foyth was on the pitch for just three minutes before he was dismissed (48) for a high lunge on Jack Simpson. That left Bournemouth with the game at their mercy but Spurs defended resolutely despite a two-man disadvantage until Nathan Ake headed the winning goal in injury-time (90). Juan Foyth was one of two sent off for Tottenham at Bournemouth Before the two red cards, Spurs created ample opportunities but were repelled by an inspired debut performance from 19-year-old goalkeeper Mark Travers, who made four top-class stops on an amazing introduction to senior football. The result leaves Mauricio Pochettino's men just four points ahead of Arsenal in fifth, but a win in their final game with Everton will guarantee a top-four finish. Player Ratings Bournemouth: Travers (9), Ake (7), Cook (7), Simpson (6), Smith (6), Clyne (6), Ibe (5), Lerma (6), Fraser (6), King (5), Wilson (5) Subs: Mousset (N/A) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Trippier (7), Sanchez (7), Alderweireld (5), Rose (7), Sissoko (6), Dier (3), Eriksen (6), Alli (7), Moura (7), Son (3) Subs: Wanyama (7), Foyth (3) Man of the match: Mark Travers How Bournemouth eventually broke Spurs.... Travers was into the action early as he produced a string of saves to show why Eddie Howe was confident of throwing him into Premier League waters for his debut. Dele Alli was denied by a flying parried save before Lucas Moura was thwarted in similar fashion. Bournemouth goalkeeper Mark Travers stole the show Spurs continued to create plenty of openings but Travers stood strong to repel an Alli header from 10 yards and used his feet to divert away a Moura effort. Eric Dier was perhaps lucky to stay on the pitch when, already booked, he tackled Joshua King from behind but the referee deemed it a fair challenge. However, Son was dismissed before the half-time whistle. The South Korean pushed Lerma over after trying to retrieve possession which referee Craig Pawson deemed a piece of dangerous play. Pawson had the red out again just three minutes after the restart as Spurs' afternoon got even worse. Foyth, on the pitch for just three minutes, overran the ball and went through with a foot raised on Simpson. Hugo Lloris was expected to be busy but Bournemouth struggled to break down the well-marshalled nine men. Just as Spurs looked likely to see it out, Ake got his team out of jail to power home a Ryan Fraser corner in stoppage time. Man of the match: Mark Travers They say goalkeepers do not peak until their 30s. Using that theory, Bournemouth have quite a talent on their hands. His first-half display will be one he will not forget in a hurry. ⭐️ Man of the Match, @marktravers40 of @afcbournemouth 5️⃣ saves, 2 inside box, 3 outside box. Aged 1️⃣9️⃣ years, 3️⃣5️⃣1️⃣ days, he is the 5️⃣th different teenage 'keeper to keep a clean sheet on his PL debut pic.twitter.com/XePwktMfxL — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 4, 2019 The 19-year-old made five saves to repel the Spurs strikers with four of them out of the top drawer. Travers is just the fifth different teenager to keep a clean sheet on his Premier League debut, joining Richard Wright, Paul Robinson, Paul Rachubka and Joe Hart in doing so. Opta stats Ake has scored two of Bournemouth's five 90th minute winning goals in the Premier League, also doing so against Liverpool in December 2016. Tottenham Hotspur have lost six consecutive away Premier League matches for the first time since May 2004 under David Pleat. Fraser has registered 14 Premier League assists this season - no player has more in the top five European leagues (also Jadon Sancho on 14). Foyth was sent off 133 seconds after coming on as a substitute for Spurs - the fastest red card for a sub in a Premier League game since Steven Gerrard was red carded after 38 seconds in March 2015 for Liverpool against Man Utd. Spurs became the first team to receive two red cards in a Premier League game since Chelsea vs Burnley in August 2017, and the first to receive two straight red cards since Man City vs Chelsea in December 2016. The managers Eddie Howe: \"I think (survival) is a huge achievement. At the end of the season our biggest challenge is always to keep our best players. We've been able to do that to this point, I think this will be our biggest summer in terms of doing that. I am confident that we can and it's really important that we do.\" 4:19 Bournemouth's Eddie Howe says their biggest challenge is to keep their best players. Bournemouth's Eddie Howe says their biggest challenge is to keep their best players.

ended his 11-game goal drought to give West Ham a 3-0 win over Southampton in their final home game of the season. The Austrian grabbed his first in the 16th minute when latching on to Mark Noble's perfectly-weighted through-ball and slotting past the recalled Fraser Forster. Nathan Redmond's introduction gave Southampton fresh impetus after the break and they threatened an equaliser until the hosts killed the game off with two goals in three minutes. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (7), Balbuena (6), Diop (6), Fredericks (7), Masuaku (7), Lanzini (6), Obiang (6), Noble (8), Antonio (7), Diangana (7), Arnautovic (8). Subs used: Wilshere (6), Sanchez (4), Perez (4) Southampton: Forster (5), Stephens (5), Bertrand (5), Bednarek (5), Valery (5), Elyounoussi (5), Armstrong (6), Lemina (5), Hojbjerg (5), Long (5), Ings (5). Subs used: Redmond (7), Ward-Prowse (5), Romeu (4). Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic. Arnautovic nodded in his second from close range (69) after Forster's attempted clearance hit him and lobbed into the air before defender Ryan Fredericks (72) netted his first goal of the campaign with an angled drive soon after. West Ham remain in 11th place but can still finish in the top half with victory at Watford next weekend while Southampton stayed 16th following their 11th away loss of the campaign. How West Ham ended on a high at home With safety already secured, Southampton boss Ralf Hasenhuttl left regulars Redmond, James Ward-Prowse and Oriol Romeu on the bench and also recalled Forster in goal in place of Angus Gunn. For most of the opening 45 minutes, it showed as Saints failed to manage a single shot on goal. With Noble and Manuel Lanzini pulling the strings for West Ham, the hosts made all the running and showed their intent with England U21 youngster Grady Diangana twice having shots. The pressure told in the 16th minute when a loose ball from Saints defender Yan Valery on the halfway line found its way to Noble and the skipper slotted a precise pass through to Arnautovic, who didn't even have to break strike before steering home a left-foot shot. Redmond's introduction and a half-time talking to from Hassenhuttl changed the momentum after the interval as Southampton pressed for an equaliser. Redmond had one shot blocked and then saw a fierce volley tipped over by Lukasz Fabianski. But it was West Ham who came up with the second goal even though Arnautovic's second after 69 minutes had a big element of fortune. Arthur Masuaku drove into the Southampton boss and crossed into a packed area and, although Forster got to it first, the Saints goalkeeper could only punch the ball onto Arnautovic's shoulder and watch it loop into the air, allowing the striker to nod into an empty net. Three minutes later and the game was well and truly over. Fredericks burst forward, received a clever flicked return pass from substitute Jack Wilshere and powered into the box before firing home. Team news Manuel Pellegrini was without Declan Rice and Felipe Anderson due to illness and gave a return to Manuel Lanzini in midfield.Ralf Hussen shuffled his pack with with Angus Gunn, Nathan Redmond, James Ward-Prowse and Oriol Romeu dropping to the bench. Fraser Forster returned in goal while Mohamed Enyounoussi, Stuart Armstrong and Mario Lemina all started. Match stats West Ham secured a Premier League double over Southampton for the first time since the 2000-01 campaign. Southampton lost by a three-goal margin to West Ham in the Premier League for only the fourth time in 34 meetings (also May 2001, October 2012 and March 2018). West Ham have won 31 points on home soil this season; their highest total in a single season at London Stadium. They last won more at home in their final season at Upton Park (34 in 2015-16). West Ham's Marko Arnautovic has scored four goals in two Premier League games against Southampton at London Stadium. Indeed, Arnautovic has bagged more Premier League goals vs Southampton than he has against any other team (5). Since the start of last season, Marko Arnautovic has been directly involved in 30 Premier League goals (20 goals, 10 assists), 14 more than any other West Ham player. West Ham midfielder Mark Noble has provided more Premier League assists in 2018-19 (5) than he has in any other season in the competition. West Ham's Ryan Fredericks scored his first Premier League goal and his first in league competition since January 2014 for Millwall versus Ipswich in the Championship. Managers Manuel Pellegrini: \"We played a good game, we won the last game here at home with the fans, and we are coming from also a big victory against Tottenham so I think that the fans are happy. \"As a transition season, I think we did well. We had so many injured players during the whole year, I hope that with a normal year we can improve next season.\" 1:59 Manuel Pellegrini says that he thinks the West Ham fans are happy after they beat Southampton in their final home game of the season Manuel Pellegrini says that he thinks the West Ham fans are happy after they beat Southampton in their final home game of the season Ralf Hassenhuttl: \"I think it wasn't our best performance. It seems like the last weeks, the last month cost a lot of energy I think. Also mentally we were not in the power to fight back after the mistake in the first half. \"In the second half, we had more chances to come back but today it looked like we can't score. After this really hard battle the last few weeks it seems like the guys are a little bit tired. A very, very intense last month.\" 2:11 Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl says their efforts over last month have tired the players mentally after they fell to a 3-0 defeat at West Ham Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl says their efforts over last month have tired the players mentally after they fell to a 3-0 defeat at West Ham Man of the Match - Marko Arnautovic The Austrian had gone 11 games without a goal for West Ham, a frustrating run that did not sit right with his obvious talents. But there was a calmness about his opening goal that defied a man in a drought and, despite a slice of luck for his second, he had got himself into the six-yard box and deserved a break. He almost iced the cake with a curling third but, although the hat-trick did not come, Arnautovic is a huge asset to West Ham when in this sort of form. What's next? West Ham round their campaign off with an away trip to Watford while Southampton say farewell with a home game against relegated Huddersfield."},{"date": "04/05/2019", "arena": "Molineux",

strike saw Wolves beat Fulham 1-0 at Molineux to all-but secure a seventh-placed Premier League finish, and with it a chance of European qualification next season. The Belgian's impressive volleyed finish with 15 minutes to go was enough to see off already-relegated Fulham as Nuno Espirito Santo's side moved four points clear of Everton in eighth, although ninth-placed Leicester could still overtake them if they win their final two games.

How Wolves maintained their Euro hopes For some reason, Wolves have struggled against teams in the bottom half of the table this season, in stark contrast to their impressive form against the top-six sides, and it was no different in the first half of this clash. As expected, the hosts dominated both possession and territory before the break, but without really testing Fulham goalkeeper Sergio Rico, who had a relatively quiet first 45 minutes. Leander Dendoncker celebrates after scoring the winner for Wolves The closest Wolves actually came to making a first-half breakthrough was when, just past the half-hour mark, they worked a left-wing corner short to Joao Moutinho. However, Dendoncker was only able to head the playmaker's inviting cross against the bar from six yards out. For long periods of the second half it looked as though Scott Parker's men may actually leave the West Midlands with a remarkable fourth clean sheet in a row, that is until a rare moment of quality in the game. At 16 years & 30 days, Fulham's Harvey Elliott becomes the youngest ever PL player: 16y 30d - Harvey Elliott (May 2019) 16y 68d - Matthew Briggs (May 2007) 16y 117d - Izzy Brown (May 2013) 16y 129d - Aaron Lennon (Aug 2003) pic.twitter.com/RRMXArKua4 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) May 4, 2019 The visitors gave away possession in a dangerous area, allowing Matt Doherty and Moutinho to play a neat one-two down the right. And, from the wing-back's inch-perfect pull back, there was Dendoncker to cushion a brilliant volley past a helpless Rico at his near post for his second league goal of the season. As for Fulham, the most noteworthy moment of their whole afternoon came with just a minute to go when Parker brought on Harvey Elliot, who at 16 years and 30 days old became the youngest player ever in Premier League history. Team news Wolves were unchanged for a third game in a row. However, boss Nuno Espirito Santo did hand third-choice 'keeper Will Norris a place on the bench. Fulham were without full-back Denis Odoi, who suffered concussion in the club's 1-0 win over Cardiff last Saturday, with Cyrus Christie replacing the left-back in their only change from that win. The England U17 international midfielder beat the previous record of 16 years and 65 days set by another former Fulham player, Matthew Briggs, in 2007.

The owners will make the best decision for the club.\" 3:09 Scott Parker says Harvey Elliott deserved to play after the 16 year old became the youngest player to play in the Premier League Scott Parker says Harvey Elliott deserved to play after the 16 year old became the youngest player to play in the Premier League Pundit - Matt Le Tissier \"No more than Wolves deserved, it has been a terrific season. They were not at their best or most fluent today, but they created enough chances to be worthy winners. \"Fulham had a couple of opportunities, but on the balance of play, Wolves deserved the three points.\" 2:06 Matt Le Tissier felt Wolves were the better team as they earned a 2-1 win at Watford in the Premier League Matt Le Tissier felt Wolves were the better team as they earned a 2-1 win at Watford in the Premier League Man of the Match - Joao Moutinho The Portuguese was at his imperious best in the sunshine at Molineux on Saturday afternoon, dictating play from his position in the middle of the park. The 31-year-old nearly created a first-half opener for Dendoncker, only for the midfielder to head his gorgeous centre against the bar from close range. And not surprisingly, the playmaker played a key role in his team's 75th-minute winner as he once again showed just why only Cristiano Ronaldo and Luis Figo have won more Portugal caps than him. 9 - Wolves' Matt Doherty has been involved in nine Premier League goals this season (4 goals, 5 assists), a figure bettered by only two other defenders (Andrew Robertson 11, Trent Alexander-Arnold 10).

Palace's 3-2 win at Cardiff Watch highlights from Crystal Palace's 3-2 win at Cardiff Cardiff's relegation from the Premier League has been confirmed after Neil Warnock's side lost 3-2 to Crystal Palace. It was a game filled with drama as Wilfried Zaha put Crystal Palace ahead in the 28th minute, only for a Martin Kelly own goal (31) to level things up not long after. The visitors retook the lead through Michy Batshuayi (39) just before the break before Andros Townsend (70) added a third via the post. Cardiff had numerous second-half chances but could only find the net once more as Bobby Reid scored a 90th-minute consolation. The Bluebirds will now drop into the Sky Bet Championship next season while Brighton's survival has been confirmed ahead of their game against Arsenal on Renault Super Sunday. The defeat will see Cardiff play in the Sky Bet Championship next season How brave Cardiff were relegated It was a bizarre opening for Cardiff. Josh Murphy hammered an effort against the post inside two minutes before their top scorer Victor Camarasa took a heavy knock and, despite trying to soldier on, he was unable to continue. He was replaced by Leandro Bacuna in the 11th minute. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (6), Peltier (6), Morrison (7), Ecuele Manga (7), Bennett (6), Mendez-Laing (7), Gunnarsson (7), Camarasa (n/a), Murphy (7), Reid (7), D Ward (6). Subs used: Bacuna (6), Zohore (6), Hoilett (6). Crystal Palace: Guaita (7), Wan-Bissaka (7), Dann (7), Kelly (7), J Ward (7), Milivojevic (7), McArthur (7), Townsend (7), Zaha (8), Ayew (6), Batshuyai (7). Subs used: Sako (5), Meyer (4), Kouyate (n/a). Man of the match: Wilfried Zaha. Crystal Palace scored their opener in the 28th minute. It was Zaha who started the move too, slipping the ball to Townsend down the left before receiving it back at the top of the area. He shifted it between his feet before firing into the bottom corner. Despair turned into hope for Cardiff three minutes later when a lack of communication between Kelly and Vicente Guaita saw them back level. Bacuna strode down the right before putting an inviting ball into the area, aiming for Danny Ward. But with the Crystal Palace goalkeeper well off his line, Kelly saw the cross nick off his foot and roll into the back of an open net. Team news Cardiff made three changes from last weekend. Leandro Bacuna, Junior Hoilett and Oumar Niasse dropped out and were replaced by Josh Murphy, Bobby Reid and Danny Ward. Crystal Palace made four changes with Patrick van Aanholt, Cheikhou Kouyate, Max Meyer and Christian Benteke (injured) dropping out and Joel Ward, Andros Townsend, Jordan Ayew and Mitchy Batshuyai coming in. But the scores did not remain level for long as Crystal Palace went back ahead in the 39th minute with a well-worked goal. Zaha drove down the left, terrorising Lee Peltier once again, before popping the ball back for Luka Milivojevic. He in turn picked out Batshuayi, who played a neat one-two with Jordan Ayew in the area - with the ball hitting the legs of Bruno Ecuele Manga on the way through - before firing home. Cardiff saw a number of chances fall their way at the start of the second half. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing whipped a sensational cross towards the back post in the 56th minute, but Murphy could not get his effort on target and sent it agonisingly wide of the post. Michy Batshuayi scored Crystal Palace's second at the Cardiff City Stadium Kelly then made two huge blocks for Crystal Palace. He threw his body in front of a stinging Murphy effort in the 63rd minute before putting a loose Guaita save behind for a corner after Kenneth Zohore tried to send the ball around the goalkeeper. The visitors withstood the pressure well, though, and added a third in the 70th minute, ultimately breaking Cardiff hearts. It was a wonderful solo run from Townsend which Joe Bennett could not stop, with his fierce drive from the top of the area bouncing into the back of the net via the post Crystal Palace's Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Cardiff's Josh Murphy battle for the ball Cardiff's bad luck continued as they had an effort cleared off the line before hitting the upright themselves in the final 15 minutes. The first incident saw James McArthur hack a Mendez-Laing effort away on the goal-line before the winger had another strike pushed onto the crossbar by Guaita. The hosts nabbed a deserved consolation bang on the 90-minute mark with a wonderful strike from Reid, who darted across the top of the area before curling home. But Cardiff could not find another goal to keep their Premier League place alive as their relegation was confirmed. Opta stats Cardiff City have been relegated from the Premier League, becoming the only team to play in more than one Premier League season and be relegated in every single one (also relegated in 2013-14). Crystal Palace have won 29 away Premier League points this season (W9 D2 L8) - only Man City, Liverpool and Spurs have won more. Neil Warnock has suffered his third top-flight relegation, going down with three different teams in three different decades - Notts County in 1991-92, Sheffield United in 2006-07 and Cardiff City in 2018-19. Crystal Palace striker Michy Batshuayi has ended on the winning side in all eight Premier League games in which he's found the net; only Daniel Agger (9) and Chris Smalling (11) have scored in more games with a 100% record. Only Jamie Vardy (10) and Harry Kane (11) have scored more away Premier League goals this season than Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha (9). Crystal Palace defender Martin Kelly has scored each of their last two own-goals in the Premier League, scoring one today and against Chelsea in March 2018. The managers Sean Morrison and Danny Ward applaud the home fans Neil Warnock: \"Everybody is disappointed when you suffer a relegation. It would be wrong not to feel like that, if you're not hurt, but I can't really be much prouder. The lads put a lot of effort in but you can see the limitations there. \"Their front four were just too good for us really, but we created so many chances in the second half. That's the story of the Premier League and you've got to take chances like that and we haven't really had a goalscorer this year so it's been a disappointment. \"As daft as it sounds, this season has probably been the best year I've ever had in management, I'm quite proud of what we've achieved and we got relegated. It is a difficult thing to digest but that's how I feel.\" Andros Townsend celebrates after scoring Crystal Palace's third goal Roy Hodgson: \"It was a clinical performance. There were moments of extremely good play as well but it was an exciting game because although I thought we spurned quite a few chances, Cardiff were never out of it and there was always that risk that they were going to get a strike away and score a goal as we saw right at the end of the game. \"When you play these games, you know you're playing a team that is going to be fighting to the death and Cardiff have fought very hard in every game throughout the season. In this game where they definitely need to win to have any chance of staying up, we knew they would be giving us nothing and we would have to fight and work hard for every opportunity that would come our way and I must congratulate the players on doing that.\" Man of the match - Wilfried Zaha Wilfried Zaha netted the first goal on Saturday It was a wonderful performance from Zaha, particularly in the first half, and was he driving force behind Crystal Palace's goals. He scored the opener after starting off the move and was also involved in the build-up to the second. He was quieter in the second period as Cardiff pushed for the goals that would keep them in the league but still popped up on the break, from which Palace always looked dangerous. What's next? There is just one more Premier League game to go this season. Cardiff travel to Manchester United next Sunday while Crystal Palace sign off with a home game against Bournemouth."},{"date": "04/05/2019", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52206,

over Newcastle in the Premier League Divock Origi rescued Liverpool's Premier League title bid with a 86th-minute winner as a dramatic 3-2 victory over Newcastle shifted the pressure onto Manchester City with moments to spare. Liverpool's title challenge looked set to unravel at St. James' Park as strikes from Christian Atsu (20) and Salomon Rondon (54) saw Newcastle came from behind twice to cancel out first-half strikes from Virgil van Dijk (13) and Mohamed Salah (28). Liverpool's cause was further hampered by the loss of Salah to a nasty head injury midway through the second half, but his replacement Origi headed in late on - just as he did in December's dramatic Merseyside derby - to seal a priceless victory for Jurgen Klopp's side as this season's fascinating title race took another twist. The victory sees Liverpool move two points clear at the top of the table and applies the pressure on champions Manchester City ahead of their clash with Leicester on Monday Night Football - live on Sky Sports Premier League.

Subs: Shaqiri (6), Origi (7), Milner (n/a), Man of the Match: Trent Alexander-Arnold How the St James' drama unfolded Newcastle started brightly, but any hopes they had on capitalising on a post-Barcelona Liverpool hangover were short-lived. Van Dijk was left unmarked six yards out after Jamaal Lascelles lost his footing, and the PFA Player of the Year headed the opener powerfully past Martin Dubravka on the quarter hour. Virgil van Dijk opened the scoring for Liverpool against Newcastle Liverpool's lead lasted just seven minutes, though, and surrendering their advantage was the least of their concern. Matt Ritchie's ball inside was turned towards goal by Rondon and struck Trent Alexander-Arnold's arm on the goal line. Play was allowed to continue as Atsu converted the rebound, with the Liverpool full-back fortunate not to receive a straight red card. Newcastle, buoyed by restoring parity, were a width of the crossbar away from taking the lead on 24 minutes, Ayoze Perez firing high past Alisson at his near post only for his effort to cannon back off the woodwork. Christian Atsu levelled for Newcastle against Liverpool Liverpool took full advantage of their reprieve as Alexander-Arnold - who was fortunate to still be on the pitch - crossed from the right and Salah restored the visitors' lead with the calmest of first-time finishes. 1:07 Should Alexander-Arnold have seen red? Should Alexander-Arnold have seen red? Team news Newcastle made two changes from last week’s draw at Brighton as captain Jamaal Lascelles and Ki Sung-yueng returned. Daniel Sturridge deputised for the injured Roberto Firmino for Liverpool, who also welcomed back Joel Matip, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dejan Lovren and Jordan Henderson following their defeat at Barcelona. Sadio Mane would have doubled the Reds' lead were it not for Dubravka racing off his line to smother the forward's shot on 32 minutes, while Andrew Robertson's whipped cross two minutes after the restart was diverted behind by Lascelles, just as Daniel Sturridge stooped to head home. Rondon's swivel and shot drew a fine low save from Alisson on 50 minutes, but the Liverpool goalkeeper was helpless four minutes later as the Venezuelan lashed an unstoppable drive into the bottom corner after Javier Manquillo recycled play after Liverpool had initially cleared a corner. Rondon wheels away after scoring Newcastle's second equaliser against Liverpool That left Liverpool with just over half an hour to salvage their title challenge, but their cause was hampered by the loss of Salah to injury following an aerial collision with Dubravka on 68 minutes, the Egyptian receiving treatment for several minutes before leaving the field on a stretcher. But just as their title challenge looked set to drift away, Origi beat Lascelles to connect with substitute Xherdan Shaqiri's free-kick from the right, sending a header flashing past Dubravka as Liverpool lived to fight another day. Divock Origi scored Liverpool's winner at Newcastle Opta stats Newcastle have conceded 98 Premier League goals against Liverpool, more than against any other side. Liverpool have scored 18 headed goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. Liverpool have scored 12 Premier League goals via substitutes this season, more than any other team.

Highlights from Everton's 2-0 win over Burnley in the Premier League. Everton remain in the chase for Europa League football after two quickfire goals saw them beat Burnley 2-0 in their final home game of the season. The hosts went ahead in the 17th minute as a Richarlison shot was diverted into the net by the knee of Ben Mee. Soon after, Seamus Coleman (20) headed home after a loose Tom Heaton save to keep them in the hunt for European football next term. Burnley rallied slightly in the second half, having their first shot on target in the 58th minute and Johann Berg Gudmundsson going close a few minutes later, but they were unable to find a breakthrough. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Coleman (7), Zouma (6), Keane (6), Digne (6), Schneiderlin (6), Gueye (6), Richarlison (8), Sigurdsson (7), Bernard (7), Calvert-Lewin (7). Subs used: Walcott (5), Lookman (6), Jagielka (n/a). Burnley: Heaton (6), Lowton (6), Mee (6), Tarkowski (7), Taylor (6), Gudmundsson (7), Cork (6), Westwood (6), Brady (7), Barnes (6), Wood (5). Subs used: McNeil (5), Vydra (4), Hendrick (4). Man of the match: Richarlison. Everton have ended the season strongly at Goodison Park, winning four successive home games and going above Leicester into eighth spot ahead of their game against Manchester City on Monday Night Football. Burnley remain in 15th. How Everton ended on a high at home Much like their last few games, Everton began well and made their pressure count with two goals in the opening 20 minutes. The first saw Richarlison pick up a slotted cross from Gylfi Sigurdsson around 25 yards out and he was given the space to run in to by the Burnley defence before striking. The ball took a nick off Mee's knee on the way through to find the bottom corner. Team news Marco Silva named an unchanged XI for the third game in a row, changing one substitute as Tom Davies was replaced James McCarthy. Burnley made two changes as Robbie Brady and Johann Berg Gudmundsson replaced Dwight McNeil and Jeff Hendrick. Everton added another three minutes later. Lucas Digne's fierce drive was pushed away by Heaton, but he was unable to recover quickly enough as the waiting Coleman nodded home into an empty net for his second Premier League goal of the season. Burnley had the ball in the back of the net in the 33rd minute and thought the comeback was on, but Ashley Barnes' wonderful hooked finish from a Robbie Brady cross was correctly ruled out for offside. Kurt Zouma challenges for a header at Goodison Park Everton suffered a blow at the start of the second half as Richarlison went down clutching his ribs and he was soon replaced by Theo Walcott. It took 58 minutes before Burnley had a shot on target as Chris Wood tried his luck from just outside the area, but Jordan Pickford made an easy save. A few minutes later, Gudmundsson fired over the crossbar from close range, unable to get his feet sorted in time to test the goalkeeper. The game mostly meandered to a conclusion after that, although Ademola Lookman threatened to score a sensational goal in the 88th minute. He found himself some space with a darting run across the top of the area but hammered his effort off the top of the crossbar. Opta stats Everton have kept five consecutive clean sheets at Goodison Park in the Premier League for the first time since September 2013 (a run of seven). Burnley earned 17 points away from home this season, 11 fewer than they managed in 2017-18, despite scoring a goal more. Burnley have lost each of their last five Premier League games in the month of May, shipping 13 goals in total. Burnley defender Ben Mee accounts for four of the Clarets' 11 Premier League own goals, no other player has scored more than once in this manner. Should Westwood have seen red? Ashley Westwood launched into a crunching tackle on Morgan Schneiderlin in the first half and, after seeing the injury to the Everton midfielder, referee Chris Kavanagh gave Westwood a yellow card. But should it have been more? Watch the video below... 0:34 Was Ashley Westwood lucky just to receive a yellow card for this challenge on Morgan Schneiderlin during their 2-0 defeat to the Toffees? Was Ashley Westwood lucky just to receive a yellow card for this challenge on Morgan Schneiderlin during their 2-0 defeat to the Toffees? The managers Marco Silva: \"We deserved the three points, our first 25-30 minutes we did fantastic, we started the game in control, running the game, scored twice but we didn't give chances away. 5:09 Everton manager Marco Silva claims that he has already identified which players he wants to bring to the club over the summer in order to help push the side to another level Everton manager Marco Silva claims that he has already identified which players he wants to bring to the club over the summer in order to help push the side to another level \"We want more next season, our target will be to do more, we have to have ambition, but if you show that attitude and desire, they are behind us. The fans realised after the Liverpool match how important they can be for us, and we have been really strong at Goodison Park since then.\" Sean Dyche: \"From our point of view, it is a game of two halves. We started, not a million miles off it, but not in the detail you need, and were a bit subservient and on the back foot. We go in licking our wounds a bit at half-time but there was a good reaction in the second half, without really opening them up with enough detail. 3:29 Burnley manager Sean Dyche admits his side were off the pace against Everton but is delighted with their efforts in the second half of the season Burnley manager Sean Dyche admits his side were off the pace against Everton but is delighted with their efforts in the second half of the season \"They've climbed a mountain in the second half of the season. 28 points is an incredible return with the goals we've scored. But you want to finish in the right way, and I thought we did in the second half. We've got a really important game to finish 'right', as I'm talking about, against Arsenal.\" The pundits Tim Cahill: \"Everton were fantastic from the off, they pressed, pinned Burnley in and got the goals. After that it was just about maintaining the game and seeing it out. Burnley tried in the second half, but for Silva it's a big result and for Everton too. 2:04 Phil Jagielka says he still hopes to negotiate a new deal at Everton, with his current contract expiring this summer Phil Jagielka says he still hopes to negotiate a new deal at Everton, with his current contract expiring this summer \"I think European football would be a fantastic thing. We shouldn't be sitting here saying 'if' or 'could', some of the points Everton have dropped this year have hindered the season, but maybe they could get to Europe. If we get Europe, then that means it is what this club needs.\" Jonathan Walters: \"It's important to make this place a fortress. They've won four of their last home games and it's important for a team like this to finish their season strongly. With their investment, they need to be looking towards the top six and I think the club are looking to do that. \"Against teams in the top half, Burnley have only won two games all season so that is one thing they need to change. Since the turn of the year, they have been on a great run of form but they'll be disappointed not to get something from here.\" Man of the match - Richarlison Richarlison struck Everton's opener, but went off injured in the second half He only lasted 48 minutes, but Richarlison was wonderful for Everton in attack during the first half and they really missed him in a tepid second period. He should arguably have had a goal too, although his effort was given to Mee after a deflection. The Brazilian received a warm reception from the home fans as he made he way off the field and looked truly sad to have ended his Goodison Park season in such a manner. There is surely more to come from him next term. What's next? There is just one Premier League game left this season - Everton travel to Tottenham while Burnley host Arsenal next Sunday."},{"date": "28/04/2019", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance":

league defeat. Arsenal were indebted to goalkeeper Bernd Leno as Leicester had already enjoyed 72 per cent possession when Ainsley Maitland-Niles was dismissed for a second yellow card (36) following his late tackle on James Maddison. Youri Tielemans made the extra man count by heading the Foxes in front (59) before Jamie Vardy helped himself to a late double (86 & 90+5). Arsenal remain fifth ahead of Manchester United and Chelsea's clash later on Super Sunday. Meanwhile, Leicester are up to eighth place, three points behind Wolves in seventh.

Leno was called into action early, brilliantly flicking clear Wilfried Ndidi's header that was heading towards the top corner - and that was a sign of things to come. However, things could have been different if Alex Iwobi hadn't fired straight at Kasper Schmeichel's legs with just the goalkeeper to beat on 35 minutes. A minute later, Maitland-Niles was dismissed for the first time in his career. Already on a booking for his body check on Ben Chilwell, the wing-back stumbled and then tried to recover by flying into a late challenge on Maddison. A red card followed. 3:11 Unai Emery felt Ainsley Maitland-Niles' sending off was a harsh decision and had a huge impact on the game as Arsenal lost 3-0 at Leicester. Unai Emery felt Ainsley Maitland-Niles' sending off was a harsh decision and had a huge impact on the game as Arsenal lost 3-0 at Leicester. Arsenal resisted the Foxes' surge until 59 minutes when Maddison produced a ball of great quality which Tielemans powered into the net. Leno was called into action again to deny both Ricardo Pereira and Harvey Barnes in quick succession. Somehow Arsenal were still in the game but Vardy quashed any hopes of a recovery with four minutes left. The striker gobbled up a Schmeichel goal kick and headed in from six yards after his lob over Leno hit the bar. Vardy - who was close to signing for Arsenal under Arsene Wenger - then took his career tally against the Gunners to eight goals in nine appearances by tapping home Pereira's cross in injury time. Was Maitland-Niles unlucky? Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness said: \"No complaints on the first booking. He obstructs, he raises his left arm and catches him. \"On the second booking, he's very unlucky. There is not a lot of contact. It's very harsh. Maddison goes down...but holding what? Where's the contact?\" Man of the match: Youri Tielemans This was a close run thing between the Leicester midfielder and Leno, who made nine saves, including three borderline world-class ones, and commanded his box with great authority. ⭐️ Man of the Match, @LCFC's Youri Tielemans 60 touches Completed 38/47 passes, 2 chances created 5 shots, 2 on target 3rd goal in last 7 PL games pic.twitter.com/QYM8HqLMLh — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) April 28, 2019 The Belgian has been a very shrewd acquisition following his loan move from Monaco in January. Tielemans himself has not ruled out extending his stay at Leicester beyond the end of the season and on this showing the club should be putting this potential deal at the top of their summer transfer to-do list. Opta stats Leicester have won back-to-back home league games against Arsenal for the first time since November 1983. Arsenal have lost three consecutive league games, while conceding at least three goals each time for the first time since May 1966. Only Liverpool and Manchester City have earned more Premier League points than Leicester since Brendan Rodgers took charge in March (16). Arsenal have lost four of their last five Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous 29 in the competition. The Gunners have also lost three in a row for the first time under Unai Emery. Only Manchester United (6) have been shown more red cards than Arsenal (5) among Premier League sides in all competitions this season. Youri Tielemans has been directly involved in seven goals in his last nine Premier League games for Leicester (3 goals, 4 assists). All three of Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers' Premier League victories against Arsenal have come at different clubs (Swansea, Liverpool, Leicester). Leicester's Jamie Vardy has scored more Premier League goals against Arsenal than he has against any other side in the competition (8). Manager reaction...

Manchester City's 1-0 win against Burnley in the Premier League Highlights from Manchester City's 1-0 win against Burnley in the Premier League Manchester City inched ahead of Liverpool in the Premier League title race after overcoming a stern test to beat Burnley 1-0. City were frustrated for an hour at Turf Moor, but Sergio Aguero broke the deadlock in the 63rd minute when his shot from close range went just over the line before Matt Lowton could clear. Goal-line technology showed the ball was 25.3 millimetres over the line and it was that fine margin that proved decisive as City held on for a tense win - their 12th in a row in the Premier League - to move one point ahead of Liverpool at the top of the table. Aguero's goal was given with the help of goal-line technology Player ratings Burnley: Heaton (7), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (7), Mee (8), Taylor (6), Hendrick (6), Cork (7), Westwood (7), McNeil (5), Wood (4), Barnes (5) Subs: Vydra (5), Gudmundsson (6). Manchester City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Kompany (6), Laporte (7), Zinchenko (6), Bernardo Silva (7), David Silva (7), Gundogan (6), Sterling (6), Sane (6), Aguero (7) Subs: Jesus (7), Stones (n/a), Otamendi (n/a) Man of the match: Sergio Aguero City, who also had a Gabriel Jesus shot blocked on the line by Ben Mee, will retain the title if they win their final two games against Leicester (H) and Brighton (A). Liverpool travel to Newcastle and then host Wolves on the final day, but former Liverpool captain Graeme Souness and ex-England defender Alex Scott agreed that City have overcome their toughest remaining test. \"Leicester will try to take the game to them and there'll be spaces,\" said Scott. \"Burnley was the potential banana skin, they've overcome that, and I don't see them slipping up now.\" Souness added: \"Leicester will be tailor-made for Man City. They're a young team who like to play on the front foot, I don't see them shutting up shop. It could be a great game, but it should play into City's hands.\" How City moved a step closer After winning at Manchester United in midweek, a trip to Burnley, who had won three of their last four games, was seen as another opportunity for Liverpool to gain the advantage in the title race. Liverpool would have had hope of an upset after a tight first half that saw just two shots on target and neither goalkeeper seriously tested. Five-star Aguero Sergio Aguero is only the second player in Premier League history to score 20 goals in five successive seasons. Burnley had only 31 per cent of the possession, but spurned the best opening in the 22nd minute when Chris Wood was played through on goal and his heavy first touch allowed Ederson to dive at his feet and claim the ball. Bernardo Silva shot at Tom Heaton from 12 yards out shortly afterwards before Sergio Aguero fired narrowly wide from outside the box. City boss Pep Guardiola hugs David Silva after the win City raised the intensity at the start of the second half as Heaton saved powerful shots from Aguero and Bernardo Silva and Aymeric Laporte headed at the goalkeeper. City also had strong penalty appeals turned away when David Silva's shot struck Ashley Barnes on the arm. The pressure eventually told in the 63rd minute when Aguero managed to dig out a shot from close range and Lowton could not keep it out on the line. Lowton made a superb block on the line to prevent Jesus extending City's lead, but the visitors held out in a tense finish to move a step closer to winning the title. Opta stats This is only the second season in English top-flight history where two sides have earned 90+ points, after Arsenal (94) and Leeds (91) in the 1970-71 campaign (adjusted to 3 pts/win). Since losing 1-2 away at Newcastle United in January, Manchester City have won each of their last 12 Premier League games, scoring 27 goals and conceding just three. Burnley have won just one of their last 16 home Premier League games against 'big six' opponents (W1 D2 L13). Burnley recorded just two shots against Manchester City, the fewest they have ever attempted in a single Premier League match. Only against Jose Mourinho (seven) has Burnley manager Sean Dyche faced an opposition manager more often in the Premier League without winning than against Pep Guardiola (six). Man City's Sergio Aguero is only the second player in Premier League history to score 20+ goals in five consecutive campaigns, after Thierry Henry between 2001-02 and 2005-06. Man of the match - Sergio Aguero Aguero provided the decisive moment, as he has so often done for City. He was largely subdued in the first half but became more involved as City upped the pressure after the break. He was denied by Heaton and finished with nine shots, which was four more than any other player. The managers Sean Dyche: \"We had a real go, and that was pleasing from a mentality point of view, because when you're safe you get people wondering how it will affect our performances. \"But we took the game on, against a top side, a very technical side, and we're never going to beat them at their game so we had to make it as awkward as possible, turn it into a cup-tie feel and the game feels completely different. I thought we did that well 3:15 Sean Dyche says his Burnley side did their best to make it difficult for Manchester City Sean Dyche says his Burnley side did their best to make it difficult for Manchester City Pep Guardiola: \"We controlled the first half but the pitch was so dry, the grass was so long, and there was problems moving the ball. It was an idea of theirs but even with that we controlled things. \"In the second half we had another level, and created three, four or five chances which isn't easy against them - but we did it, and now it's two games left.\" 1:19 Pep Guardiola says Manchester City will beat Leicester to ensure they are top of the Premier League going into the final day of the season Pep Guardiola says Manchester City will beat Leicester to ensure they are top of the Premier League going into the final day of the season What's next? Burnley finish the season with a trip to Everton on Friday, May 3, live on Sky Sports, and then a home game against Arsenal on Sunday, May 12.

United came out brightest and took the lead through Juan Mata's close-range finish after a fine team move (11), but De Gea's week went from bad to worse as he fumbled Antonio Rudiger's long-range shot into Marcos Alonso's path, allowing the defender to squeeze home (44). The hosts struggled to break down Chelsea in a turgid second half, and Marcos Rojo was lucky not to see red for a nasty tackle on Willian before the Argentine saw his own header cleared off the line by Pedro late on, but for United it looks like a season outside of Europe's elite competition for only the second time since 1995. The remaining fixtures in the race for the top four The result means that with two games to play, Chelsea sit fourth, two points clear of Arsenal in fifth and three clear of United in sixth.

Marcos Alonso celebrates after equalising for Chelsea How De Gea cost United again After defeats for Tottenham and Arsenal over the weekend, both sides looked to take advantage in the top-four race. In a fast-tempo opening, United went closest as Romelu Lukaku was found in-behind by Luke Shaw's long ball, but the Belgian had to check back while one-on-one and saw his shot saved blocked by Kepa Arrizabalaga. Lukaku was then involved in the opener, chipping a sublime ball over the defence for Luke Shaw to cut back for Mata, who rolled the ball home on the turn from 12 yards for United's first goal in over three games. Team news Man Utd made five changes after the 2-0 defeat by Man City; Bailly returned to centre-back in place of Smalling, while Lukaku, Mata, Herrera and Matic came in for Darmian, Pereira, Fred and Lingard. Chelsea made three changes themselves; Loftus-Cheek, Emerson and the injured Christensen came out, replaced by Kovacic, Alonso and Rudiger. Eric Bailly nearly doubled United's lead as he leapt well from a corner only to head wide, while Nemanja Matic was fortunate not to receive at least a booking after his flailing arm caught Cesar Azpilicueta in the face. Chelsea were level just before the break from another De Gea error; after allowing Leroy Sane's shot through his grasp in Man City's 2-0 win at Old Trafford on Wednesday, the Spaniard this time failed to keep hold of Rudiger's pot-shot from range, leaving Alonso to convert off the post from the follow-up. De Gea looks to the ground after his mistake late in the first half De Gea had also made errors in the previous two defeats by Barcelona and Everton, and the goal meant United have kept just two clean sheets this season, the lowest of any Premier League club. Chances were at a premium second half, but United could have been down to 10 men after sub Rojo lunged in on Willian but only received a booking, before the defender himself saw a header from a corner cleared off the line by Pedro.

Christian Eriksen was then denied by Fabianski after attempting to dink the ball over the West Ham goalkeeper after Son had blocked Issa Diop's clearance. Team news Jan Vertonghen had \"muscle fatigue\" and was rested for Spurs ahead of Tuesday's Champions League semi-final first leg with Ajax. Davinson Sanchez came in to replace him, while Juan Foyth was in for Fernando Llorente, who was on the bench. Ben Davies replaced Kieran Trippier and Eric Dier returned for Victor Wanayama in Spurs' other two changes. West Ham made one change; Ryan Fredericks replaced Pablo Zabaleta at right back. West Ham celebrate in front of their fans Having been a passenger in the first half, Arnautovic sparked West Ham into life in the second period, superbly creating the opener, and the first goal Spurs have conceded at their new ground. Finding himself on the right touchline, Arnautovic dinked a beautiful through ball into the box for Antonio, who took a fine touch on his chest before volleying past Hugo Lloris from an angle eight yards out. West Ham defended superbly throughout, the highlight coming when Ryan Fredericks came from nowhere to slide in and deny Fernando Llorente from 12 yards, but the visitors had their share of chances to double the lead. Antonio was picked out in a similar position to his goal again, but was this time denied by Lloris' foot, before Diop somehow found himself through on goal with a 40 yard run from his own half, only to see his weak shot parried wide by Lloris. Antonio struck from Marko Arnautovic's fine assist in the 67th minute Spurs were within inches of equalising in the fourth and final minute of stoppage time as Janssen's far-post header was brilliantly cleared by Balbuena with Fabianski stranded, as West Ham held on for a fine victory.

When is a race not a race? While Liverpool and Manchester City refuse to blink, the four teams below them continue to sleepwalk their way towards the climax of this Premier League season. Adam Bate takes a closer look at the race no-one wants to win. Opta stats Tottenham have lost 17 games in all competitions this season, last suffering more in a single campaign in 2008/09 (19). West Ham registered an away clean sheet for the first time in their last 10 Premier League away games, since a 2-0 win at Fulham in December. Tottenham have lost six of their last 10 Premier League games (W3 D1), as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 28 in the competition (W22). Only Jose Mourinho (5) has beaten Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino more often in the Premier League than Manuel Pellegrini (4, level with Pep Guardiola). All 26 of West Ham midfielder Michail Antonio's Premier League goals have come from inside the box. What's next? Spurs now host Ajax on Tuesday in their Champions League semi-final first leg, before going to Bournemouth on Saturday, live on Sky Sports Premier League from 11.30am; Kick-off is at 12.30pm.

The hosts picked up a 3-2 away victory at Arsenal on Sunday and Everton thrashed Manchester United 4-0 on the same day, in two thrilling performances, but neither bought the same form to south London. Everton had the better of the chances, twice hitting the post in the second half, with Cenk Tosun forcing a fingertip save from Eagles goalkeeper Vicente Guaita, but they ultimately lacked a cutting edge. Crystal Palace remain in 12th place with their Premier League status already secure for another season, while Everton move up a place into eighth after Watford lost to Wolves. How the sides shared the spoils Everton had the best opportunities in the first half but did not really test Guaita in the home goal. They had a great chance inside six minutes when a long goal-kick from Jordan Pickford found Dominic Calvert-Lewin up front. However, his shot on the angle went straight into the hands of Guaita. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Guaita (7), Wan-Bissaka (7), Kelly (7), Dann (7), Van Aanholt (7), McArthur (7), Milivojevic (7), Kouyate (6), Meyer (6), Zaha (6), Benteke (4). Subs used: Townsend (6). Everton: Pickford (6), Coleman (8), Keane (7), Zouma (6), Digne (7), Gueye (6), Schneiderlin (6), Bernard (6), Sigurdsson (7), Calvert-Lewin (7), Richarlison (7). Subs used: Tosun (6), Lookman (n/a), Walcott (n/a). Man of the match: Seamus Coleman. The visitors had a flurry of chances around the 40-minute mark. Calvert-Lewin was involved again, putting a good header over the bar before Idrissa Gueye had a speculative effort from range, but Guaita got down low to save. Richarlison nearly set up Calvert-Lewin again for another header not long after, but it just evaded the head of the young forward. Everton began the second half well too and were denied by the post inside 10 minutes. A poor clearance from Patrick van Aanholt saw the ball at the feet of an unmarked Bernard in the top left corner of the area, but his thunderous shot could only find the upright. Team news Crystal Palace made one change as Patrick van Aanholt replaced Joel Ward at the back. Everton named an unchanged XI from the side that thrashed Man Utd 4-0, with Richarlison recovering from a rib injury to make the starting line-up. Much like the first period, chances continued to be few and far between but, despite having little to do, Guaita made a sensational save in the 78th minute. Seamus Coleman squared the ball into the area and Tosun tried to send it home with an audacious back-heel. However, the Palace goalkeeper made an instinctive, fingertip save, with Luka Milivojevic clearing the ball as Tosun attempted a bicycle-kick with the rebound. Crystal Palace failed to produce a shot on target during the game, with Cheikhou Kouyate firing well wide of the upright in the 74th minute despite Christian Benteke being open in the middle, before a curling effort from substitute Andros Townsend landed into the hands of Pickford not long after. Kurt Zouma attempts to clear the ball under pressure from James McArthur Everton once again found the upright in the 89th minute. Lucas Digne floated a cross in from the left-hand side - aided by the blustery conditions in south London - and it caught the far post before bouncing away, with neither side then able to find the winning touch in the closing stages. Opta stats Crystal Palace have not beaten Everton in any of their last nine Premier League meetings (W0 D5 L4) since a 3-2 win in September 2014. This was the eighth time Crystal Palace have failed to score in a home Premier League game this season - only Huddersfield have failed to do so more often (9). Everton have won just two of their last 20 away Premier League games in London (W2 D8 L10). Everton had 22 shots in this match - their most in an away Premier League game since May 2017 at Arsenal (also 22). This was Crystal Palace's fourth goalless Premier League draw of the season - no side has done so more often. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"It's a little bit frustrating because we would like to have played better, we would have liked Everton to play worse, we would liked to have had more controlled possession than we were able to get and we would have liked our passing to be better than it was today. 3:58 Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson says his side showed character and determination to earn a point against Everton Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson says his side showed character and determination to earn a point against Everton \"I thought they showed a lot of character, a lot of diligence and a lot of determination to make sure that we came away with at least a point, which is a lot better than the defeat we suffered at Everton with two really late goals. But I believe we played better football than we did today.\" Marco Silva: \"Since the first minute, we dominated all the game in our offensive parts. We created chances, we had two shots off the post, there was a fantastic save from the goalkeeper, maybe 10 or 11 corners also. We did more than enough to win the match, it's just that we were not clinical. 2:35 Marco Silva felt his Everton side created enough chances to win their game against Crystal Palace which ended goalless Marco Silva felt his Everton side created enough chances to win their game against Crystal Palace which ended goalless \"We dominated the game. I told our players that we tried everything and we just didn't put the ball in the net because we did everything well until that moment.\" Man of the match - Seamus Coleman Coleman was a man who led by example for Everton at Selhurst Park. He put in vital work at the back to snuff out the talent of Wilfried Zaha and Max Meyer, while looking rather attack-minded as he got down the right flank on a number of occasions. Indeed, he set up Tosun for his effort in the 78th minute and, with a little bit more care all around, he could have nabbed an assist for his efforts. It was not meant to be for either side, but Coleman should be pleased with his afternoon's work. What's next? Crystal Palace travel to Cardiff next weekend in their penultimate game of the Premier League season before hosting Bournemouth on the final day.

Highlights from Fulham's 1-0 win against Cardiff in the Premier League. Ryan Babel's sensational second-half strike left Cardiff facing an uphill task for Premier League safety following their 1-0 defeat at Fulham. Babel struck a first-time curling effort from 25 yards which gave Neil Etheridge no chance to settle a game of little quality at Craven Cottage. The Dutchman's moment of magic proved a rare bright spark for either side, with Cardiff lacking the intensity expected from Neil Warnock's side, who badly needed a win to keep themselves on Brighton's tail, and an eight-minute, first-half stoppage after Denis Odoi was knocked unconscious did little to aid the tempo. Player ratings Fulham: Rico (7), Odoi (6), Le Marchand (6), Ream (7), Bryan (7), Chambers (6), Anguissa (7), Sessegnon (6), Cairney (8), Babel (8), Mitrovic (6). Subs: Christie (7), Mawson (n/a), Ayite (n/a). Cardiff: Etheridge (7), Peltier (6), Morrison (7), Manga (6), Bennett (6), Mendez-Laing (6), Camarasa (7), Bacuna (5), Gunnarsson (5), Hoilett (6), Niasse (5). Subs: Ward (7), Healey (6), Reid (n/a). Man of the match: Ryan Babel However, having failed to force a save of note out of Fulham goalkeeper Sergio Rico until the final five minutes, when Sean Morrison and Danny Ward both went close, they are now four points adrift of safety with two games remaining after Brighton drew 1-1 with Newcastle, and realistically needing to win both of their final two games against Crystal Palace and Manchester United. How Fulham edged out Cardiff With Fulham enjoying fine wins over Everton and Bournemouth in their last two outings and Cardiff desperate for three points, the scrappy, slow first half which developed may have surprised both benches. It took 12 minutes for either 'keeper to make a save, when Aleksandar Mitrovic's 20-yard shot on the turn was kept out at full-stretch by Etheridge. Odoi was hurt when Maxime Le Marchand's boot struck him in the chest and knocked him clean out midway through the first half, with the defender carried from the pitch with his neck in a support following a lengthy stoppage, after which Fulham continued on the front foot. Odoi 'all good' after injury Junior Hoilett made more key passes than anyone on the pitch - but no Cardiff player could finish them off Whatever words Warnock had for his players at half-time did little to knock some life into them, with Rico a passenger before the break and similarly untroubled once the second half got under way. Four minutes into the second 45, Mitrovic should have scored when Tom Cairney, cutting in from the right, showed excellent composure to pick him out unmarked, but the striker turned his low pass well over from 15 yards. The game continued with the same attritional approach from before the break, until 11 minutes from time when Babel stepped up to finally inject some quality. Team news Fulham welcomed back Tom Cairney after the birth of his child, and dropped Jean Michel Seri to the bench. welcomed back Tom Cairney after the birth of his child, and dropped Jean Michel Seri to the bench. With Joe Ralls out for the season, Cardiff replaced him with Leandro Bacuna. Ryan Christie made a superb 40-yard run out of defence and laid the ball back for the Dutchman, who curled a shot from the right channel away from Etheridge and into the far corner. Late on Morrison and Ward both turned crosses goalwards but made life too easy for Rico, who saved both comfortably, and he was again able to hold on to the ball when Morrison nodded a glorious chance straight into his hands in the final seconds. Opta facts Fulham have won three consecutive Premier League matches for the first time since March 2012. This was Cardiff City's 13th away Premier League defeat of the season - only Huddersfield (14) and Fulham (15) have lost more. Fulham have taken nine points from their last three Premier League games - as many as in their previous 20 games combined (W2 D3 L15). Cardiff had eight shots on target in this match - with all seven coming in the 73rd minute or later. Fulham's Ryan Babel scored his 17th Premier League goal and his first from outside the box. Cardiff manager Neil Warnock has never won an away Premier League match in London in 16 attempts (W0 D3 L13). Cardiff striker Danny Ward made his 14th Premier League appearance in this match - he is yet to end on the winning side (W0 D1 L13), with only Marvin Sordell (17), Emanuel Villa (16) and Oliver Burke (15) playing more times in the competition without winning. Managers Scott Parker: \"It was a tough afternoon, but really pleasing. Another clean sheet was good too against a competitive team, we knew what we were expecting, they're fighting for their lives, and we had to stand up and be counted at times. 1:52 Fulham caretaker manager Scott Parker described Ryan Babel's sensational winner against Cardiff as a 'wonder-strike'. Fulham caretaker manager Scott Parker described Ryan Babel's sensational winner against Cardiff as a 'wonder-strike'. \"From the outset, all I can do is what's in my control, and that's setting up the team to try to win games and be organised. We're ding that and the players have been different class to me and how we're trying to do things - and we're enjoying things at the moment.\" Neil Warnock: \"On reflection, my team selection was wrong but we'll worry about that later on. You can't fault the lads though, they've been wonderful all season and who's to say we're not still in the fight? 2:04 Neil Warnock says he doesn't think Cardiff would have scored if they had played until Christmas after they fell to a 1-0 defeat at Fulham. Neil Warnock says he doesn't think Cardiff would have scored if they had played until Christmas after they fell to a 1-0 defeat at Fulham. \"We had 10 shots in the last 10 minutes alone, there's only one player on the pitch who would have scored their goal, and unfortunately for us he took it. No complaints about that. But we should be scoring some of those chances.\" Man of the match - Ryan Babel Babel and Cairney were both running the show for Fulham prior to the former's goal, but it is difficult to argue he should not take home the fictional champagne after a strike like that. The pair were both lively, and everywhere - left, right, through the middle - as Fulham's attacking play improved after half-time, even if their final ball did not. But Babel's tenacity and quality on the ball, providing two key passes and winning 58-per-cent of his duels during the afternoon, showed his unique importance to Fulham, even if that does prove to be short-lived. What's next? Fulham travel to Wolves next Saturday for a 3pm kick-off, while Cardiff host Crystal Palace on the same day in the late game, which gets under way at 5.30pm."},{"date": "27/04/2019", "arena": " Mary's

Southampton secured their Premier League survival despite being held to a thrilling 3-3 draw by south-coast rivals Bournemouth. Shane Long scored the opener in the 12th minute at St Mary's, only for Dan Gosling to level after a swift counter and Callum Wilson to put Bournemouth ahead in the 32nd minute. Southampton turned the game around after half-time as James Ward-Prowse made it 2-2 with a low shot from outside the box and substitute Matt Targett headed in his first goal for the club in the 67th minute. Player ratings Southampton: Gunn (5), Valery (6), Bednarek (5), Stephens (5), Bertrand (5), Hojbjerg (6), Romeu (5), Ward-Prowse (7), Redmond (6), Ings (6), Long (7) Subs: Targett (7), Armstrong (5), Austin (5) Bournemouth: Boruc (5), Ake (5), Cook (5), Simpson (5), Clyne (5), Gosling (6), Mepham (4), Lerma (6), Brooks (6), King (7), Wilson (8) Subs: Fraser (6), Hyndman (6), Solanke (5) Man of the match: Callum Wilson Wilson snatched a point for Bournemouth with a late equaliser, but the point is enough for Southampton to guarantee they stay in the league thanks to Cardiff's loss at Fulham. Southampton players and staff waited on the pitch after the full-time whistle for confirmation of Cardiff's defeat before celebrating their survival by dancing around the centre-circle. How the six-goal thriller unfolded Southampton, who were 18th in the Premier League when head coach Ralph Hasenhuttl was appointed in December, made a flying start and went close through Nathan Redmond, who saw a shot blocked and then an effort saved, and Jan Bednarek, who had a shot blocked on the line. Saints' pressure paid off in the 12th minute when Redmond squared for Long to finish from around the penalty spot. But Bournemouth levelled completely against the run of play as they scored from a clinical counter-attack that saw Josh King sweep forward and then pass to Wilson, who teed up Gosling to finish from inside the box. Long spurned a glorious chance to restore Saints' lead when he saw a shot saved and then, with goalkeeper Artur Boruc on the floor, hit the post with the follow-up effort from eight yards out. James Ward-Prowse celebrates after scoring Southampton's second goal However, a tactical change from Eddie Howe, who brought on Ryan Fraser for Chris Mepham and switched to a back four, changed the momentum and Wilson made it 2-1 when he scored in the 32nd minute after Angus Gunn could only palm out a shot from David Brooks. Bournemouth controlled the rest of the half, but the game turned again after the break and Ward-Prowse levelled with a low shot from outside the box. Team news Southampton made two changes from their midweek draw at Watford as Danny Ings and Yan Valery replaced Stuart Armstrong and Maya Yoshida. Junior Stanislas missed out for Bournemouth after undergoing hamstring surgery. Jack Simpson, 22, came into the defence to make his second Premier League start of the season and Nathaniel Clyne also made the XI, with Ryan Fraser dropping to the bench after sufferinga slight injury in training. Targett headed in at the back post from Yan Valery's cross in the 67th minute to put Saints ahead, but Bournemouth, who had hardly threatened in the second half, levelled with four minutes remaining with Fraser crossed for Wilson to bundle in from close range. The visitors should have snatched victory in the final minute but Wilson was denied by Gunn after being played through on goal. Opta stats Southampton have lost 27 points from leading positions in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. Bournemouth have taken seven points from their last four away Premier League games (W2 D1), after taking none from the nine before that (L9). Southampton's Matt Targett scored the 1000th Premier League goal of 2018-19; the earliest date the 1000th goal has been scored in a Premier League season since the 1994-95 season (April 1st 1995). Southampton's Shane Long has scored in three successive home Premier League games for the first time ever. Bournemouth's Dan Gosling has netted two goals in his last three Premier League appearances, as many as he managed in his previous 67 combined. Bournemouth's Callum Wilson has scored and assisted in six different Premier League games this season, more than any other player. James Ward-Prowse has scored seven goals in the Premier League this season for Southampton (24 apps), as many as he managed in his two previous seasons combined (60 apps). Ryan Fraser has provided 13 assists in the Premier League this season, a joint-high figure in the competition this season (level with Eden Hazard). Man of the match - Callum Wilson In such a back-and-forth game there weren't too many standout individual displays, but Wilson takes the honours for his two-goal haul. He was disappointed he didn't make it a hat-trick when he spurned a late chance to finish past Gunn. What's next? Southampton finish the season with a trip to West Ham next Saturday and then a home game against Huddersfield on the final day. Bournemouth host Tottenham next Saturday, live on Sky Sports, then finish with a trip to Crystal Palace."},{"date": "27/04/2019", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20323, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["82"]}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": ["62"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": ["90+6"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["74"]}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": ["85"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["82"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Masina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ken Sema", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["74"], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Conor Coady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Boly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Doherty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leander Dendoncker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rúben Neves", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "João Moutinho", "yellows": ["61"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Otto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raúl Jiménez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["87"]}, {"name": "Diogo Jota", "yellows": ["84"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["90+7"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ivan Cavaleiro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["87"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hélder Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Gibbs-White", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["90+7"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romain Saiss", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Vinagre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:57 Watford 1-2 Wolves Watford 1-2 Wolves Wolves strengthened their hold of seventh place in the Premier League by beating rivals Watford 2-1 at Vicarage Road.

As a result, Nuno Espirito Santo's side stay seventh in the table - which will bring European football next season if Man City win the FA Cup - while Watford drop to ninth, four points behind their hosts.

Just as at Wembley, it was Wolves who deservedly led at the break thanks to Jimenez's well-taken goal, the Mexico striker finding himself in the right place to head home Jota's chipped ball to the far post after the home team had failed to clear a corner. Andre Gray celebrates his equaliser Jimenez was unlucky not to have gone in with two goals to his name at half-time, Etienne Capoue denying him a 33rd-minute opener after getting back to make an excellent last-ditch goal-line clearance following another of those now characteristic Wolves counters. Javi Gracia's team hit back at the start of the second half, though, drawing level thanks to Cathcart's poor back pass, which went straight to the feet of all people, Gerard Deulofeu. Team news Watford were still missing skipper Troy Deeney due to suspension, although Jose Holebas did pass a fitness test as the hosts made three changes in defence. The visitors, meanwhile, had no injury problems to contend with, meaning Morgan Gibbs-White and Ivan Cavaleiro both had to settle for a place on the bench. However, despite Rui Patricio's smothering stop thwarting the Spaniard, the ball fell straight to Gray, who thumped it into the unguarded net for his ninth goal of the season. But in a match characterised by silly errors, it was Wolves who got payback for that painful loss earlier this month when the normally reliable Foster misjudged Ruben Neves' deep cross, allowing Jota a simple volleyed finish at the far post. Match stats Watford have won just three of their last nine Premier League home games, drawing three and losing three Wolves ended a run of five Premier League away games without a win (D2 L3), after winning three of the five before that Jimenez has been directly involved in 20 Premier League goals for Wolves this season (13 goals, 7 assists), the fourth-biggest haul in a campaign by a non-British player for a newly-promoted side (Bryan Roy - 24 for Nottingham Forest in 94/95, Niall Quinn - 22 for Sunderland in 99/00 and Peter Odemwingie - 22 for West Brom in 10/11) Jota has had a hand in seven goals in his last eight Premier League games (4 goals, 3 assists), as many as he managed in his previous 23 this season Gray has scored five goals in his last seven home games for Watford in all competitions, having netted just three in his first 23 appearances at Vicarage Road for the Hornets Since the start of 2016/17, Watford's Jose Holebas has picked up 33 yellow cards in the Premier League, more than any other player 5 - The most Premier League assists exclusively for one player: Diogo Jota to Raúl Jiménez - 5 Aki Riihilahti to Andrew Johnson - 4 Geoff Cameron to Peter Crouch - 4 Monogamous. pic.twitter.com/MxePkC1S45 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 27, 2019 Managers Javi Gracia: \"I'm disappointed and sad - we wanted to get a better result, but it was impossible. \"In all the games, whenever we have conceded goals, there have always been mistakes, but in the last few games we have been conceding avoidable goals. \"Before the game, we knew our target was to try and play in Europe - and at this moment, it is the same. \"We have two chances - if we are not able to achieve seventh position, the other way to Europe is to try and win the cup final.\" 1:58 Watford's Javi Gracia bemoans the fact his side have conceded soft goals in recent games following their defeat at home to Wolves.

Pundit - Matt Le Tissier \"It was very sweet and well deserved, a decent performance by Wolves,\" said the Sky Sports pundit. \"The first goal was excellently crafted by Jota, with Jimenez doing the rest at the far post. \"They started the second half sloppily, with Bennett giving the ball away cheaply to Deulofeu, before Gray smashed it into an empty net. \"It was a decent game and Wolves started to press towards the end, and Foster made a poor error of judgement when coming for cross, which he got nowhere near, with Jota volleying home at the far post.\" 2:06 Watford 1-2 Wolves - Le Tissier Watford 1-2 Wolves - Le Tissier Man of the Match: Diogo Jota Diogo Jota makes it 2-1 to Wolves Jota has enjoyed a brilliant season for the newly promoted team, and his impressive form up front continued at Vicarage Road on Saturday. The Portuguese firstly set up Raul Jimenez's first-half opener with an inch-perfect cross to the far post which his strike partner could not miss. And then the 22-year-old was on hand to calmly volley home Ruben Neves's centre to cap off another eye-catching attacking display for his side. What's next?

Brighton 1-1 Newcastle Brighton took a step closer towards Premier League survival after fighting back from a goal down to secure a 1-1 draw with Newcastle on Saturday evening. Following Cardiff's defeat to Fulham earlier in the day, Brighton had the opportunity to all-but secure their top-flight status for next season with a victory at home to Newcastle. However, it was Rafael Benitez's side, who secured their Premier League survival last weekend, who claimed an 18th-minute lead thanks to Ayoze Perez's fifth goal in his last three matches. Chris Hughton's side put a lacklustre first-half performance behind them as Pascal Gross grabbed what could prove to be a valuable equaliser 15 minutes from time to move them four points clear of the relegation zone with two games remaining. The point means Cardiff must now win their final two games against Crystal Palace and Manchester United to have any chance of overhauling Brighton, who also hold a significant goal difference advantage over Neil Warnock's side. Player ratings b>Brighton: Ryan (7), Bruno (6), Duffy (6), Dunk (6), Bernardo (6), Stephens (6), Kayal (5), Gross (7), Izquierdo (5), And one (5), Murray (6).

Subs: Kenedy (6), Ki (6), Muto (n/a) Man of the match: Solly March How Brighton secured a point Ahead of kick-off, there was a sense of optimism around the Amex Stadium as news of Cardiff's defeat at Craven Cottage filtered through. However, Brighton turned in a poor first-half performance and it was Newcastle who went in front thanks to Perez's powerful strike. Ayoze Perez scores for Newcastle to make it 1-0 Fresh from his hat-trick against Southampton last weekend, Perez, who was replaced by Kenedy just before the break due to injury, smashed Salomon Rondon's chest down into the top corner from 15 yards. The introduction of Solly March, who replaced Florian Andone, eventually sparked the hosts into life and with time starting to run out, they grabbed the all-important equaliser. Florin Andone takes on Jonjo Shelvey at the AMEX Stadium Bruno's floated cross was headed on by Glenn Murray and Gross reacted quickest to beat Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka to the ball and nod home for his side's first goal in 735 minutes in all competitions. It could have got even better for Brighton in the final minutes. Murray had a golden chance to grab a dramatic winner and virtually ensure his side's survival but he headed over from close range from Knockaert's cross, leaving Hughton's men to wait a little longer to secure their Premier League status. Man of the Match - Solly March The 24-year-old made a real difference for Brighton coming off the bench at half-time. He drove his side forward at every opportunity and asked questions of the Newcastle defence with a number of testing crosses into the penalty area. The managers Chris Hughton: \"[It's] a step, but probably my responsibility is really not to feel too much until we know that, mathematically, we are safe. We have two games left. The cautious part of me has to think that anything can happen. \"Cardiff are home to [Crystal] Palace in their next game and, if they win that one, then it's momentum going into their last game at [Manchester] United. Certainly it's a better feeling at this moment than it was at half-time. \"Relaxed isn't the word. It's relief from what looked such a poor performance in the first half and coming away from today's game with no points to showing a really spirited second half, better quality performance that allowed us to get something from the game.\" Rafael Benitez on his future: \"Not really. Today was about the game. The day we have any news, we'll let you know. Every day counts because in the end you want to do everything possible to start working. But we will see. \"This morning I saw Lee (Charnley, managing director). We talk every week. I'm relaxed. It's not depending on me. I am waiting. It's very clear: everyone has his own ideas. What do we want to do in the future? That is the key. \"If we have different visions, we'll have to find a point in between that we are happy with, if not we have to talk and try and move forward as soon as possible.\" Opta stats Brighton have won just two of their last 16 Premier League matches (W2 D4 L10), and are winless in their last seven. Newcastle have won four points from their last two Premier League away games (W1 D1), one more than they'd mustered in their previous eight combined (W0 D3 L5). Only Huddersfield (14) have conceded more headed goals in the Premier League this season than Newcastle (13). Ayoze Perez and Salomon Rondon have combined for seven Premier League goals this season - the most by a Newcastle duo in a season since 1999-2000 (Alan Shearer and Nolberto Solano, eight goals). Newcastle's Ayoze Perez has scored seven goals in his last seven Premier League games, as many as he had in his previous 33 in the competition. Rondon has been directly involved in 44% of Newcastle's Premier League goals this season (16/36); only Eden Hazard (49%) has recorded a higher share for his side in 2018-19. Glenn Murray provided his first ever Premier League assist for Brighton and his first since April 2015 for Crystal Palace versus Sunderland, ending a run of 97 apps without one. 44% - Salomon Rondon (9 goals and 7 assists) has been directly involved in 44% of Newcastle's Premier League goals this season (16/36), the highest percentage for the club since Alan Shearer in 2003-04 (50% - 26/52).

Highlights from Liverpool's 5-0 win over Huddersfield in the Premier League. Liverpool maintained the pressure on Premier League title rivals Manchester City with a convincing 5-0 victory over already-relegated Huddersfield on Friday Night Football. Naby Keita scored the hosts' fastest-ever Premier League goal after 15 seconds before Sadio Mane (23) netted his ninth league goal of the season at Anfield and Mohamed Salah lobbed Jonas Lossl shortly before the break. Huddersfield tried to work their way into the game with Steve Mounie and Karlan Grant coming close to applying a decisive touch, but Mane's (66) second header of the game and Salah's 21st league goal of the season in the 83rd minute saw Jurgen Klopp's side sweep to a 10th consecutive win. The result means Liverpool re-establish their two-point lead over Manchester City, who travel to Burnley on Super Sunday and will still secure the league title if they win their remaining three matches. Player Ratings Liverpool: Alisson(8), Alexander-Arnold (8), Lovren (7), Van Dijk (8), Robertson (9), Henderson (7), Wijnaldum (6), Keita (8), Salah (9), Sturridge (6), Mane (9) Subs used: Oxlade-Chamerlain (7), Shaqiri (6), Gomez (N/A) Huddersfield: Lossl (3), Smith (4), Schindler (4), Kongolo (4), Durm (5), Stankovic (3), Hogg (4), Bacuna (5), Mbenza (4), Mounie (5), Grant (4) Subs used: Lowe (5), Pritchard (5), Kachunga (N/A) Man of the match: Andy Robertson Reds show little signs of feeling the pressure Having seen City move top of the league by winning their game in hand over Manchester United in midweek, it took a mere 15 seconds for Liverpool to take the lead against Huddersfield as Keita's pressing of defender Jon Stankovic presented the ball to Salah just outside the box, who then slipped in Keita to finish. Salah could have doubled their lead two minutes later when he raced through on goal, forcing Lossl into a fine save, before the visitors came within a whisker of equalising - Stankovic almost atoning for his error at the opposite end of the pitch when his pass toward the corner of goal was deflected just wide of the post.

After just 15 seconds, Naby Keita's goal for Liverpool was the quickest they have ever scored in a Premier League match. Rather than being daunted having fallen behind early, Huddersfield began to show a threat of their own up front with Isaac Mbenza's pass across the six-yard area just evading Steve Mounie. But, as Liverpool began to exert their authority a powerful drive forward from Virgil van Dijk saw Andy Robertson fed on the left and his exquisite cross was nodded in by Mane - earning the full-back his 10th Premier League assist of the season. Andy Robertson (11) has the most assist for a defenders in the Premier League so far this season, ahead of team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold (9) With the Reds dominating possession, captain Jordan Henderson blazed over from 15 yards out but Salah brought Anfield to its feet just before the break as he latched on to Trent Alexander-Arnold's ball over the top, timing his run perfectly before chipping the ball over the on-rushing Lossl. Jan Siewert's side started the second half brightly, earning two big chances when Grant missed the opportunity to tap the ball into an empty net before Mounie took too long to steady himself after being put through on goal, allowing Liverpool's defenders to recover. 20 - Liverpool have become the first club to have two players score 20+ goals in a single Premier League season (Mane and Salah) since the Reds themselves also did so in 2013-14 (Suarez and Sturridge). Duos. #LIVHUD pic.twitter.com/hRJfbXDeyP — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 26, 2019 Team news Jurgen Klopp shuffled his pack slightly, as a groin strain ruled Roberto Firmino out of the match with Daniel Sturridge coming in to make his first since Premier League start since December 5. Dejan Lovren replaced Joel Matip after missing two games through illness. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was also in the match-day squad for the first time this season, but Fabinho did not even make the bench after suffering a head injury at Cardiff. There were also two changes for Huddersfield with midfielder Aaron Mooy absent after picking up a knock last week, so Karlan Grant came into the side and Jon Stankovic replaced Elias Kachunga. And, when the linesman flagged Daniel Sturridge for offside to keep the score at 3-0, Juninho Bacuna's long-range effort forced Alisson into a fine save. But the home side's superiority showed as the game wore on, Mane adding his second when he directed Henderson's cross to the back post back across goal before Salah tapped-in from Robertson's cross to seal another impressive three points. Opta stats Liverpool have accrued 91 points in the Premier League this season, their second-highest ever total in a single league season (converting to three for a win) in their history, behind only 98 points in 1978-79, which was a 42-game season. Liverpool have won 10 consecutive matches in all competitions, their best winning run since May 2006 when they won 11 on the bounce. Huddersfield have now lost 28 Premier League matches this season - they have never lost more league matches in a single Football League campaign in the club's history (also 28 in 1987-88 in the second tier). Liverpool are now unbeaten in 19 matches across all competitions (W14 D5), their longest such streak since a run of 20 without defeat between December 1995 and March 1996. This victory means Liverpool will end today top of the Premier League - it is the 29th time that the lead has changed hands at the end of a day this season, the outright post-war top-flight record, overtaking 28 times in 2001-02. Huddersfield have now failed to score in each of their last nine meetings with Liverpool in all competitions; this is Liverpool's joint-second longest run of clean sheets against an opponent in their history, behind only a 10-match streak against West Brom in August 2010 (also nine v Everton in April 1976). Liverpool have now earned 50 points at Anfield this season, their best ever tally at home in a Premier League season (previously 49 in 2013-14), with this the first top-flight season they have reached 50 points at home since 1987-88 (also 50). Mohamed Salah has become only the third Liverpool player to score 20+ Premier League goals in consecutive seasons for the club, after Robbie Fowler (1994-95 and 1995-96) and Luis Suarez (2012-13 and 2013-14). The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"All in all it was great, a really brilliant performance. Composure and everything that you need was there. So really happy. 7:48 Klopp estatic with win Klopp estatic with win \"It's a massive strength for Naby Kieta. He's a complete midfielder. Today it was his best game in all defending situations he was so difficult to deal with. He's so quick in small spaces, you can't stop that. And I don't know how many balls he blocked tonight. People were asking me what about Keita and we always thought we signed him for next year. He needed time to adapt but thank God he has done it this season.\" Jan Siewart: \"If you are on the backfoot after only one minute it is incredibly hard against a team with this quality and you saw when the lack of confidence is there it is hard to play. \"We had our own moments and chances to score which surprised them. It could have easy to go out and tell my team now we get our helmets and put 10 men at the back but we didn't and we just as aggressive as they were and I am very proud of that.\" 2:17 Jan Siewert says Huddersfield always knew it would be a tough trip to Anfield but to concede within 15 seconds was not expected, following their 5-0 defeat.

significant blow as Wolves eased past Unai Emery's side 3-1 at Molineux on Wednesday evening. Arsenal stay fifth in the Premier League, a place outside of the Champions League spots, after their second defeat in less than a week. The Gunners needed to avoid defeat to regain fourth place from Chelsea but the hosts ripped them apart with three goals in 19 first-half minutes from Ruben Neves (28), Matt Doherty (37) and Diogo Jota (45+2). Sokratis gave Arsenal hope of a late comeback, heading in from a corner in the 80th minute but it proved to be only a consolation as Emery's team followed Sunday's loss to Crystal Palace with another serious setback.

Ruben Neves celebrates after giving Wolves the lead at home to Arsenal Wolves quickly doubled their advantage in the 37th minute, exploiting Arsenal's frailties when defending set-pieces. With Bernd Leno in no man's land, Doherty headed in Jonny's cross. It then went from bad to worse for Arsenal on the stroke of half-time, with Jota firing through Leno, who should have done better, to make the game all but safe. It could have got even better for Nuno Espirito Santo's side at the start of the second half but the impressive Jota could not control Raul Jimenez's cross when unmarked at the far post. Unai Emery appears in contemplative mood as he walks along the touchline at Molineux Arsenal had 71 per cent of possession but were bereft of a cutting edge in the final third. They eventually managed to get on the scoresheet when Sokratis rose above Neves in the six-yard box to head in Granit Xhaka's corner at the far post, but it proved only to be a consolation, leaving them with it all to do in the top-four battle.

Arsenal manager Unai Emery admits his side's defending was not good enough against Wolves in their 3-1 defeat in the Premier League. Top-four race: Sky Bet odds… Man of the Match - Diogo Jota Jota epitomised Wolves' energetic display. He was a bundle of energy and was a constant threat for the hosts as they looked to counter-attack Arsenal at every opportunity. Jota, who got his reward for his excellent display by scoring Wolves' third on the stroke of half-time, has now been directly involved in seven goals in his last five Premier League appearances for Wolves at Molineux (5 goals, 2 assists). Opta stats Wolves have ended their 20-game winless streak against Arsenal (D4 L16), with this their first victory against the Gunners in all competitions since September 1979. This is Arsenal's heaviest Premier League defeat against a newly promoted team since a 2-0 loss to Newcastle United in May 1994. Wolves are one of three promoted sides to have beaten at least four sides to finish that season in the top six in a single Premier League campaign, after Sunderland in 1996-97 and Blackburn in 1992-93. Wolves are the first newly-promoted team to earn 50 points in a Premier League season since Birmingham in 2009-10. Only Jimenez (23) has been directly involved in more Wolves goals in all competitions this season than Doherty (15; 8 goals and 7 assists). Neves has more goals (4) than he has touches (3) in the opposition's box in the Premier League this season. Only Charlie Mulgrew (10) and Harry Wilson (9) have scored more goals from outside the box since the start of last season in the top four English tiers than Neves (8).

After beating Arsenal 3-1, Nuno Espirito Santo says his Wolves side is just focusing on improving game by game and he also praised the quality of Ruben Neves after his superb free kick. Unai Emery: \"We lost in our hands the opportunity for fourth but we can also recover this opportunity. We have lost opportunities in the last two matches, losing to Crystal Palace and here (at Wolves) but the last three matches we play in the Premier League we have opportunities. \"Generally we are now disappointed but we need to look at all the season. We lost this opportunity today but we need to prepare as best as possible for Leicester. Again it is very difficult but hopefully we can take something. \"We will be doing all we can in Leicester on Sunday to take the three points. Top four is the target, a difficult target, but we have a chance in this competition and also in the Europa League.\" What's next? Arsenal are back in front of the Sky Sports cameras on Sunday when they travel to the King Power Stadium to face Leicester. Kick-off is at 12pm with our coverage getting underway at 11.30am on Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Main Event.

over Manchester United in the Premier League Manchester City overcame a massive hurdle in the Premier League title race with a 2-0 win at rivals Manchester United, leaving them a point clear of Liverpool with three games remaining. After a first half lacking in clear-cut chances, City took the lead through Bernardo Silva on his 100th appearance for the club as his low shot from 15 yards beat David de Gea at his near post (54). It was 2-0 just 12 minutes later as sub Leroy Sane struck a low effort through De Gea, who should have done better, as City scored a record-breaking 157th goal of the season in all competitions. Bernardo Silva celebrates after giving Manchester City a second-half lead City now face Burnley (A), Leicester (H) and Brighton (A) knowing they will retain the Premier League title with three wins, while Liverpool finish with Huddersfield (H), Newcastle (A) and Wolves (H). United stay sixth, three points off fourth-placed Chelsea, who they will face on Super Sunday.

Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (4), Young (6), Darmian (5), Smalling (6), Lindelof (6), Shaw (5), Pereira (5), Fred (4), Pogba (6), Lingard (4), Rashford (5) Subs: Lukaku (4), Sanchez (NA), Martial (NA) Man City: Ederson (8), Walker (6), Kompany (5), Laporte (7), Zinchenko (7), Gundogan (6), Fernandinho (7), David Silva (8), Bernardo Silva (8), Sterling (7), Aguero (7) Subs: Sane (7), Danilo (NA), Jesus (NA) Man of the match: David Silva United stifled City for the opening half hour, restricting the champions to longer balls and efforts from outside the box, while the hosts went closest when Ederson rushed out superbly to block Marcus Rashford. The best chance of the half fell to Raheem Sterling, who danced his way to within eight yards of the United goal, only to see his low shot on the stretch saved and held brilliantly by De Gea. But City upped the ante in the second half and took the lead nine minutes after the restart through Bernardo Silva, shooting through Luke Shaw from 15 yards on the right of the box, and beating De Gea at his near post. It was nearly 2-0 moments later as Sergio Aguero hit the post from the edge of the box with a curling effort, while at the other end Jesse Lingard could not get his feet right to turn home into an open net at the far post from Rashford's looping cross. Jesse Lingard missed a fine chance to equalise for United City did double their lead from a counter-attack as sub Sane, who had been on the pitch just 15 minutes after replacing the injured Fernandinho, struck home from 15 yards despite De Gea getting a touch on the effort with his right foot. David Silva risked an unnecessary red after leaving a high boot on Andreas Pereira, which referee Andre Marriner missed, but City saw the game out comfortably, and took a massive step towards becoming the first team to retain the Premier League title since United in 2009.

Don't read, don't turn on the TV, don't listen to the radio. You cannot imagine how tough it was for all of us to go out of the Champions League when we thought it was there.

Manchester United have now lost seven of their last nine games in all competitions (W2 D0 L7), after losing just one of their first 17 under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (W14 D2 L1). Man City boss Pep Guardiola is the first manager to win three consecutive away Premier League matches at Old Trafford against Man Utd and only the third to win three away matches there, along with Arsene Wenger and Gerard Houllier. Manchester United are without a clean sheet in 12 consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since August 1971. In combining for the second goal, Leroy Sane (10 goals, 10 assists) and Raheem Sterling (17 goals, 10 assists) both reached 10 goals and 10 assists in the Premier League this season; the only other player to do so is Chelsea's Eden Hazard. Man City end the night top of the Premier League, overtaking Liverpool - this is the 28th time the lead has changed hands at the end of a day, the joint-most in a single Premier League season (also 28 times in the 2001-02 season). Man of the match - David Silva Excelled in the biggest game of Man City's season. Composed on the ball, worked hard and kept City ticking over even in a difficult first half.

1-0 Brighton Christian Eriksen struck a late winner to put Tottenham firmly in control of the top-four race as brave Brighton were narrowly denied 1-0 on Tuesday. Eriksen broke Brighton's determined resistance on 89 minutes with a stinging long-range effort - their 21st effort from outside the area - that kept Tottenham's perfect record intact at their new stadium. Following on from weekend defeats for Arsenal and Manchester United and Chelsea's draw with Burnley, Spurs are now three points clear in third place with three games to go. It looked as though Brighton, who now haven't scored for over 11 hours, were holding on for a precious point in their battle for survival after a gritty defensive showing but the gap to Cardiff remains at three points. Player Ratings Tottenham: Lloris (6), Rose (7), Trippier (6), Alderweireld (6), Vertonghen (6), Wanyama (6), Eriksen (7), Alli (6), Moura (6), Son (6), Llorente (4) Subs used: Janssen (6), Davies (6) Brighton: Ryan (7), Bernardo (7), Duffy (7), Dunk (8), Stephens (7), Bissouma (7), Montoya (7), Gross (7), Jahanbakhsh (6), Locadia (6), Andone (6) Subs used: Murray (6) Man of the match: Lewis Dunk How Eriksen saved Spurs This was Tottenham's first home game back since their Champions League heroics at Manchester City and there was a celebratory atmosphere in the stands. Brighton - fresh from a solid point at Wolves - came to frustrate and did just that in a stodgy opening 45 minutes. Lucas Moura was frustrated by Brighton's defenders Last-ditch defending was needed at times, noticeably from Lewis Dunk on 35 minutes to clear a Lucas Moura effort off the line and Shane Duffy just before the break when Dele Alli had beaten goalkeeper Mat Ryan. It wasn't pretty but it was doing the job the visitors. With Brighton defending deep, Spurs' game was all about picking the right final pass, something they struggled to do. Eriksen celebrates with Dele Alli after scoring the winner Eriksen was unusually wasteful while Fernando Llorente offered little as the focal point as the game passed him by. As the game wore on, Brighton rarely emerged from their own half. It was constant Spurs pressure and Alderweireld drilled a low shot from 20 yards that looked in, but cannoned back off the inside of the post. Vincent Janssen - who hasn't featured since August 2017 - was thrown on in the latter stages by Mauricio Pochettino, whose lack of options from the bench was clear to see. His introduction didn't spark Spurs into life though, so it was down to Eriksen to ping one into the corner from 25 yards with just one minute remaining to send the home fans home happy. Man of the match: Lewis Dunk This was a man who didn't deserve to be on the losing side. He was asked question after question by Spurs and he battered everything away, making an amazing 14 clearances - twice as many as any other player on the pitch. With determination on show like this, Brighton surely have enough to beat the drop. Pundit reaction… Liam Rosenior on Sky Sports: \"It is a world class moment from a world class player. It is an incredible shot on his left foot, his supposed weaker foot, and when you're Brighton and you are tired and you're dropping deeper and deeper you are going to give up shots from outside the box. \"It is an absolute arrow into the bottom corner and since Eriksen has come to this new stadium he has flourished in his new environment and you need that when you are playing against a team that defended as well as Brighton did.\" WATCH: Eriksen reacts to stunner 2:45 Tottenham's Christian Eriksen fired in a late winner to boost their top four hopes and the Danish playmaker felt that Spurs' victory was on the cards.

Watford almost responded immediately when Gray found space eight yards out, but his shot was brilliantly saved by Angus Gunn's sprawling leg. ⚽ After only 7️⃣ seconds Shane Long scores the quickest-ever goal in @premierleague history pic.twitter.com/DH6OWsLyRo — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) April 23, 2019 Team news Javi Gracia made three changes to the side that beat Huddersfield, with Mariappa, Femenia and Sema making way for Kabasele, Janmaat and Pereyra. Hasenhuttl made just two changes as Armstrong and Long replaced Sims and Ings. But the Hornets struggled to find their rhythm as Southampton dominated the first half, and the visitors were unlucky not to increase their lead as Long twice headed wide from close range and Redmond twice hit the post. Southampton sat back after the break and risked absorbing everything Watford threw at them, with Maya Yoshida blocking well as Daryl Janmaat fired an effort from distance. Gunn did well to tip over Gerard Deulofeu's free-kick that almost found the corner of the net, but Watford struggled to create any clear-cut chances as Saints set out to stifle them. Andre Gray celebrates his goal for Watford against Southampton But the hosts did not give up and were rewarded after Southampton failed to clear their lines in the final minute, giving Gray the space to fire into the roof of the net. Opta stats Southampton have dropped a league-high 25 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season. This is the first time Watford have accumulated as many as 50 points in a Premier League season, last doing so in the top-flight in 1986-87 (63). Watford have conceded at least once in their last nine Premier League games, the longest current run without a clean sheet in the competition. Southampton have lost just one of their last 10 top-flight away games against Watford, though seven of those have ended level (W2). Southampton striker Shane Long has scored three goals in his last four Premier League games, as many as he had in his previous 60 in the competition. Andre Gray has scored four goals in his last six home games for Watford in all competitions. The managers 3:47 Watford manager Javi Gracia said his side showed ambition to keep fighting and earn a late draw against Southampton Watford manager Javi Gracia said his side showed ambition to keep fighting and earn a late draw against Southampton Javi Gracia: \"Before the game we knew it would a tough game because Southampton are playing, in my opinion, really well, and after the early goal it was even more difficult. \"In the first-half we didn't feel comfortable, we didn't play as usual and in the second-half we improved a little bit. We created chances at the end with the spirit and desire and it is a good point. \"I prefer to play with three at the back and we need to be more offensive which is why I took Craig (Cathcart) off at half-time. 3:02 Ralph Hasenhuttl said he was disappointed that his side didn't hold on for all three points against Watford - but admitted he was pleased to gain an important draw Ralph Hasenhuttl said he was disappointed that his side didn't hold on for all three points against Watford - but admitted he was pleased to gain an important draw Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"I think in the first half we could've been well in the lead. We were much more aggressive than at Newcastle and that's what we wanted to show today, we wanted to win. It's a big point for us. \"I think the message today was to be very aggressive from the first minute, and I think Long listened very well.\" Man of the match: Shane Long Long bullied the Watford defence from the very first seconds, and could have had a hat-trick but for some wayward finishing in the first half. He can be forgiven, though, thanks to that record-breaking goal in the first seven seconds. A very well-taken finish. What's next?

It was a pulsating start at Stamford Bridge as all four goals came in the opening 24 minutes. Jeff Hendrick's spectacular volley put Burnley ahead (8) before N'Golo Kante (12) and Gonzalo Higuain (14) put Chelsea in front with a quickfire double. But a Burnley side high on confidence after three straight wins levelled through Ashley Barnes (24), meaning Chelsea - who later lost Callum Hudson-Odoi to a ruptured Achilles - have now failed to win any of their last six fixtures following a Europa League game. 1:26 There were unsavoury scenes at the end of Chelsea's Premier League draw with Burnley after Maurizio Sarri was sent off late on in the match There were unsavoury scenes at the end of Chelsea's Premier League draw with Burnley after Maurizio Sarri was sent off late on in the match Chelsea's frustrations boiled over as the clock ticked down with Maurizio Sarri being sent to the stands after protesting at Burnley's perceived time-wasting while Antonio Rudiger - not in the matchday squad - was seen arguing with a Burnley member of staff near the tunnel at full-time. The result leaves Chelsea in fourth place in the Premier League having played a game more than their top-four rivals, while Burnley are all-but safe, nine points clear of Cardiff in 18th with three games left.

The hosts started brightly with Higuain having an effort cleared off the line by Ben Mee but fell behind on seven minutes to a cracking strike from Hendrick. There did not look much danger on when the ball dropped out of sky following a Burnley corner but the Republic of Ireland international connected flush with a volley which flew into the net. The Blues were level four minutes later when Hazard tricked and turned Matthew Lowton inside out down the left before rolling a cross to Kante, who spanked a left-footed strike home. With Burnley struggling to get out of their half, Chelsea struck again. Cesar Azpilicueta flicked a ball into Higuain down the right-edge of the box and the 31-year-old fired a powerful effort home to notch his first goal since March 3. That should have been the catalyst to take control of the game but back came Burnley again, to score the fourth goal in a pulsating opening 24 minutes. A free-kick was met Ben Mee who nodded it across the six-yard box. Chris Wood then helped it into the the path of Barnes, who finished from close range. From having just 18 per cent of the ball, Burnley had somehow scored twice. Hudson-Odoi limped off midway through the half - later leaving the ground on crutches - before Kante joined him in the treatment room after being replaced by Mateo Kovacic at the break. Callum Hudson-Odoi was forced off approaching half-time on Monday night Hazard continued to threaten after the break but the Chelsea chances dried up as Burnley began to heavily frustrate Sarri's side, who were restricted to long-range efforts. Olivier Giroud replaced an unhappy Higuain with 15 minutes but despite dominating territory, Chelsea failed to produce a match-winning moment and Sarri's frustration boiled over as he was sent to the stands in stoppage time.

Kante has scored four goals in 34 Premier League games this season, one more than he netted in his previous three campaigns in the competition combined (three goals in 106 apps). Barnes has scored 11 Premier League goals this season, the joint-most by a Burnley player in a single campaign in the competition (also Danny Ings in 2014-15). Higuain has scored 10+ league goals in each of his last 11 seasons in Europe's top five leagues (4 for Chelsea, 6 for Milan in 2018-19). What's next?

Out-fought and out-played by their hosts at Goodison Park, United didn't manage to produce a shot on target until the 85th minute. Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville was outspoken in his criticism of United's display while Jamie Carragher described it as the worst he had seen from United during his time at Sky Sports. Updated Premier League table Analysis: Reality is United are not good enough An acrobatic volley from Richarlison put Everton ahead in the 12th minute and the hosts were two up at half-time courtesy of Gylfi Sigurdsson's 25-yard drive (28). Lucas Digne fired home a third (56) early in the second half, and Theo Walcott raced clear to complete the scoring in the 64th minute. Courtesy of their fine victory, Everton are up to seventh in the league table while United's latest defeat leaves them two points outside the Champions League places with just four games remaining.

The goal came soon enough though as Dominic Calvert-Lewin flicked on Digne's long throw and Richarlison was waiting, six yards out, and connected sweetly on the stretch to send the volley high into the net.

Subs: Young (5), McTominay (5), Pereira (6) Man of the match: Gylfi Sigurdsson The Blues pressed for a second and found it after a rare United attack. Having easily dealt with a corner, Everton countered, the ball was worked to Sigurdsson, and he cut inside and drilled his shot into the bottom corner with De Gea slow to react. Solskjaer made a double change at the break, sending on Ashley Young and Scott McTominay, but it made little difference and Everton extended their lead 11 minutes into the second half. Team news Marco Silva made two changes to the Everton team that lost at Fulham with Michael Keane and Morgan Schneiderlin coming in for Phil Jagielka and the suspended Andre Gomes. Meanwhile, Manchester United brought in Diogo Dalot, Nemanja Matic and Romelu Lukaku for Ashley Young, Scott McTominay and Jesse Lingard. Sigurdsson's corner was punched clear by De Gea, but Digne was waiting on the edge of the box and arrowed a half-volley into the corner of the net. The ball was past the goalkeeper before he could move. The Goodison Park faithful was jubilant and they had more to cheer eight minutes later. Sigurdsson was involved again, sliding a through ball into the path of substitute Walcott with the United defence nowhere to be seen. Despite a heavy touch, Walcott had plenty of time recover and slip the ball past De Gea into the far corner. Solskjaer apologises to the Manchester United fans The result was beyond doubt, and it took until the 85th minute for United to muster a shot on target. Solskjaer and his side have little time to reflect on a fifth successive away defeat before they host Manchester City on Wednesday, while Everton will now be optimistic of finishing seventh and potentially claiming a Europa League spot. Gary Neville: \"I'm furious, to be honest with you. I've often said about clubs in the last seven years, if you've got weeds in the garden then you've got to get rid of them. But there is some Japanese knotweed at that football club and it is attacking the foundations of the house and needs dealing with properly. That performance today was rancid.\" Jamie Carragher: \"That was the worst performance from a Manchester United team I have seen since I have been working for Sky.\" Graeme Souness: \"That was a team in their armchairs - not a team trying to qualify for the Champions League. It was a team that was plodding, drifting, and going through the motions.\" Man of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson The Everton No 10 was involved in everything for Everton, scoring the second with a superb strike was distance and setting up Walcott for the fourth, while it was his corner that was punched out to Digne for the third as well. He enjoys playing United, too. He's now been directly involved in nine Premier League goals against them (five goals, four assists), more than versus any other club. Opta stats This was Everton's biggest margin of victory over Manchester United in any competition since October 1984, when they beat them 5-0 in a top-flight contest. It was also Man Utd's biggest defeat to any opposition since October 2016 against Chelsea in the Premier League (also 0-4). This was Manchester United's fifth consecutive away defeat across all competitions, their longest such run of losses since March 1981 under Dave Sexton (also five). Manchester United have conceded 48 Premier League goals in 2018-19, their highest ever tally in a single season in the competition and their most in a league campaign since 1978-79 (63). Everton have won more Premier League points at home to the \"big-six\" clubs this season (10 - P6 W3 D1 L2) than any other team from outside the top six in the table, with only Man City (15), Liverpool (13) and Chelsea (11) earning more overall at home to such opposition. Manchester United have gone 11 consecutive matches without a clean sheet in all competitions for the first time since December 1998. What's next? Everton travel to Selhurst Park next Saturday to take on Crystal Palace in a 3pm kick-off. Meanwhile, United welcome neighbours Manchester City to Old Trafford on Wednesday, live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event, for a crucial game in the title race.

Palace's 3-2 win at Arsenal in the Premier League Arsenal defensive frailties came back to haunt them as Crystal Palace dented their top four hopes with a 3-2 win at The Emirates. The Gunners had kept back-to-back clean sheets after wins at Watford and Napoli but were all over the place defensively as Christian Benteke (17), Wilfried Zaha (61) and James McArthur (69) punished some lacklustre Arsenal play. Two of the goals came via set-pieces and Zaha's was put on a plate for him by a calamitous defensive error from Shkodran Mustafi. Arsenal had levelled the game at 1-1 through Mesut Ozil (47) before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (77) gave hope of a comeback but it didn't materialise as Palace won away for the eighth time this season and broke through the 40 points barrier. The result leaves Arsenal still in fourth place and means there are only three points now covering the four teams chasing Champions League qualification with four games to go. Player Ratings Arsenal: Leno (6), Koscielny (6), Mustafi (3), Mavropanos (6), Jenkinson (5) Guendouzi (6), Elneny (6), Kolasinac (6), Ozil (6), Aubameyang (7), Lacazette (6) Subs used: Iwobi (6), Maitland-Niles (7), Torreira (6) Crystal Palace: Guaita (7), Wan-Bissaka (8),Dann (8), Kelly (9), Ward (7), Kouyate (7), McArthur (7), Milivojevic (8), Meyer (7), Zaha (8), Benteke (7) Subs used: Ayew (N/A), Townsend (N/A) Man of the match: Martin Kelly Arsenal's defensive capitulation... Scott Dann had already given Arsenal a warning about Palace's set-piece strength when his free header was somehow skewed over the crossbar from close range by Martin Kelly. Team news Unai Emery made seven changes from the win in Napoli with Carl Jenkinson and Mohamed Elneny handed rare starts. Palace made three changes, bringing in Max Meyer, Joel Ward and Cheick Kouyate. Benteke didn't waste the next opportunity on 17 minutes. From a set-piece from the right, he timed his run perfectly and couldn't miss from 10 yards out as the relief on his face was clear to see on ending his goal drought one week short of a year. Arsenal struggled to open up Palace from open play but they nearly replied from a set-piece of their own, however, Mustafi headed over at the back post. Arsenal's remaining fixtures Apr 24: Wolves (A), Apr 29: Leicester (A), May 4: Brighton (H), May 12: Burnley (A) Aaron Wan-Bissaka escaped a strong handball shout inside the area before Bernd Leno made a fantastic double save before the break from Cheick Kouyate. Palace continued to threaten and Benteke blazed over from 10 yards. Unai Emery responded by making a double change at the break, bringing on Alex Iwobi and Ainsley Maitland-Niles. The changes sparked Arsenal into life and Ozil snuck in down the left to level it up two minutes after the break. With the Emirates in full voice, it looked only a matter of time before Arsenal took over but Mustafi gifted Palace a second. A Benteke flick-on was inexplicably left by the centre-back for Leno, who was fully 15 yards away. That mistake allowed Zaha to scamper through and he didn't waste the opportunity. Eight minutes later it was three as Arsenal went to sleep from another set-piece. Dann rose highest from 12 yards and his header was turned home by McArthur - both Palace players were unmarked. Aubameyang netted his 18th Premier League goal of the season with 13 minutes remaining to give Arsenal hope but Palace - led by Kelly and Dann - repelled their late onslaught. Emery frustrated by defeat 5:41 Unai Emery admits Arsenal’s 3-2 home defeat to Crystal Palace was a very frustrating result but says finishing in the top four is still in their hands. Unai Emery admits Arsenal’s 3-2 home defeat to Crystal Palace was a very frustrating result but says finishing in the top four is still in their hands. Man of the match: Martin Kelly With Mamadou Sakho and James Tomkins missing, the former Liverpool man stepped up to the plate with an extraordinary defensive performance. Last-ditch blocks and huge defensive headers culminated in a whopping 11 clearances. Everything Arsenal threw at him and Dann, the pair batted away like their lives depending on it. Opta stats Crystal Palace avoided defeat in both league meetings with Arsenal in a campaign for the first time since 1979-80. Arsenal suffered their first home league defeat in a London derby since January 2016 (0-1 v Chelsea) - they were unbeaten in 13 such games prior to this loss (W10 D3). Crystal Palace have scored 29 goals away from home in the Premier League this season; their most in a single campaign in the competition and joint-most overall in a top-flight season (also 29 in 1991-92). Benteke made his 200th Premier League appearance in this match against Arsenal. He scored 46 goals in his first 100 games in the competition, but has netted just 24 in his second 100 appearances. Benteke scored his first goal for Crystal Palace since April 2018 (vs Leicester), ending a run of 19 appearances, 25 shots and 358 days without netting. Zaha has scored eight away goals for Crystal Palace in the Premier League this season - only Harry Kane (11) and Jamie Vardy (10) have netted more in the competition. Manager reaction Unai Emery: \"It's a big frustration, it was a big opportunity but we can say we had a big opportunity in the matches before today and we took a lot of points in a lot of key moments that give us the opportunity to be now, in our way, with the possibility to achieve our targets. \"Our first target is to get to the Champions League through the Premier League or Europa League. We lost a big opportunity but it doesn't change our idea. \"It's in our hands, we can continue winning and being in the top four.\" Roy Hodgson: \"It was a very satisfying performance. \"If you're going to get a result here you're going to have to give a really good performance. The defending has to be top notch and you have to be certain that when you get the space your two front players do what ours did today. \"We carried that threat with the front players, the midfield four and back four were excellent.\" 5:09 Roy Hodgson praised his side’s counter-attacking performance in the 3-2 win at Arsenal, saying they were good value for their three goals.

Highlights from Liverpool's 2-0 win at Cardiff in the Premier League. Liverpool returned to the top of the Premier League with a hard-fought 2-0 victory away at relegation-threatened Cardiff on Super Sunday. Georginio Wijnaldum's third goal of the season (57) and a late James Milner penalty (81) sealed a ninth-consecutive victory for Jurgen Klopp's side that restores their two-point lead over Manchester City. Things could have been different for Cardiff had captain Sean Morrison converted a gilt-edged close-range header immediately after Wijnaldum's opener, but Liverpool secured a win which takes their points total to 88 - their highest ever in the Premier League. Liverpool's victory piles the pressure on the champions ahead of Wednesday's Manchester derby at Old Trafford - live on Sky Sports - and leaves 18th-placed Cardiff three points from safety with just three games to secure their top-flight status.

Subs: Milner (6), Fabinho (n/a), Gomez (n/a). Man of the Match: Joel Matip How Reds recovered from first-half frustration Junior Hoilett nearly gave Cardiff the lead on the quarter-hour mark but, having opted against heading Joe Bennett's cross from the right first time, Andrew Robertson had just enough time to block his low shot. Liverpool dominated the ball, but that clinical edge in front of goal evaded them, Roberto Firmino ballooning over the bar on 22 minutes after Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane had combined on the edge of the area to release the Brazilian. The pace of Nathaniel Mendez-Laing posed a real threat down Liverpool's right but, having been left trailing in the winger's wake, Trent Alexander-Arnold responded with his own foray forward, crossing to the near post on 31 minutes but Mane deflected over from close range. Cardiff's Nathaniel Mendez-Laing in action against Liverpool When Liverpool did find the target, Neil Etheridge was on hand in the Cardiff goal to keep the Reds at bay, racing off his line to smother Salah's shot after he spun away from Bruno Ecuele Manga. And Cardiff nearly ended the half with a flourish as Joe Ralls kept a corner alive, presenting Everton loanee Oumar Niasse with the chance to fire an acrobatic effort on target, which Alisson brilliantly tipped over. Team news Aron Gunnarsson passes a late fitness test as Neil Warnock named an unchanged after Cardiff win at Brighton. Jordan Henderson, Naby Keita and Roberto Firmino were recalled by Jurgen Klopp as Liverpool made three changes following their midweek Champions League win in Porto. Liverpool maintained the pressure on the Cardiff goal after the interval, Mane whipped a fierce shot on the roof of the net on 51 minutes before Alexander-Arnold flashed a shot wide from distance, but that pressure soon told. Wijnaldum peeled away to the edge of the area to meet Alexander-Arnold's corner and produced a devastating finish, rounding off a brilliantly-executed set-piece move to hand Liverpool the lead on 57 minutes. Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates after scoring for Liverpool against Cardiff Jordan Henderson should have doubled Liverpool's lead shortly after the hour, but the Reds captain blazed over after Mane's cutback found him unmarked six yards out. But that miss paled into insignificance when Morrison somehow failed to find the target after Bennett's in-swinging cross flashed through Alisson hands and found the Cardiff skipper three yards out, the ball cannoning off his back and behind for a goal kick. Mohamed Salah wins a penalty after a challenge from Sean Morrison And things went from bad to worse for Morrison as he hauled Salah to ground in the area, presenting Milner with the chance to seal the victory from the penalty spot with nine minutes remaining. Opta stats Liverpool have now amassed 88 points in the league this season, their best ever total in a Premier League season; adjusting to three points for a win, they have only earned more in a top-flight campaign in 1978-79 (98) and 1987-88 (90). This was Cardiff City's 10th home league defeat of the season, their most in a single season since 1994-95 in the third-tier, when they lost 12 and were relegated. The top six teams have won all 33 of their Premier League matches versus the current bottom three teams in the table this season. This is a top-flight record; surpassing 30 wins in such games in 1891-92, 1978-79, 1985-86, 2001-02, 2011-12 & 2013-14. Liverpool have now won nine consecutive matches in all competitions, their longest winning streak since April 2014 under Brendan Rodgers (also nine games) - a run which also included a victory away at Cardiff. Only Wilfried Zaha (six) has won more Premier League penalties this season than Liverpool forward Mo Salah (five). Cardiff have now lost each of their four Premier League matches against Liverpool, conceding 15 goals in all, more than they have against any other opponent in the competition. Georginio Wijnaldum's goal for Liverpool was just his second to be scored away from home in the Premier League, with the other 19 all coming in home games.

the Premier League Phil Foden scored his first Premier League goal as Manchester City battled to a 1-0 win over their Champions League conquerors Tottenham to return to the top of the table. Four days on from their dramatic quarter-final exit at the hands of Spurs, Foden's fifth-minute header sealed a priceless victory for Pep Guardiola's side on an incredibly tense afternoon at the Etihad Stadium. Heung-Min Son spurned four first-half chances as Spurs threatened to haunt City again, while a handball in his own penalty area from Kyle Walker went unpunished midway through the second half. But City held their nerve, securing a 10th successive league victory that moves them a point clear of title rivals Liverpool. Spurs remain third, a point clear of Arsenal having played a game more. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (8), Walker (6), Stones (6), Laporte (8), Zinchenko (6), Gundogan (6), Foden (7), De Bruyne (6), B. Silva (9), Sterling (6), Aguero (6). Subs: Fernandinho (6), Sane (6), D. Silva (n/a). Tottenham: Gazzaniga (6), Foyth (7), Sanchez (6), Alderweireld (6), Vertonghen (6), Davies (6), Dier (6), Alli (6), Eriksen (7), Moura (6), Son (7). Subs: Rose (5), Wanyama (6), Llorente (5). Man of the Match: Bernardo Silva. How Foden got City back on track Just as they did in Wednesday's Champions League clash, City made a flying start as Bernardo Silva's in-swinging cross from the right was selflessly headed across goal by Sergio Aguero, and Foden had the simple task of nodding the hosts ahead inside five minutes. The City youngster, making only his second Premier League start, celebrated passionately in front of the travelling Spurs fans, the outpouring of emotion a visible sign of the anguish still present among Guardiola's side after their European exit. 3 - Phil Foden is the first player born in the 2000s to score a Premier League goal for Man City, and is their third youngest scorer in the competition overall (18y 327d). Chosen. #MCITOT pic.twitter.com/GM3Tns3h76 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 20, 2019 But that emotion looked set to undermine City as Spurs wasted a host of chances to draw level before the break. Christian Eriksen was thwarted by the feet of Ederson on 14 minutes before the Denmark international turned provider, releasing Son, who was denied by a brilliant Aymeric Laporte challenge. Bernardo Silva had appeals for a penalty turned down on 20 minutes after tangling with Jan Vertonghen, but referee Michael Oliver was unmoved. City then suffered an injury blow as Kevin De Bruyne was forced off seven minutes before the interval with a leg problem. Kevin De Bruyne receives treatment after pulling up with an injury Spurs looked to capitalise on the heightened levels of anxiety inside the Etihad following De Bruyne's departure, but Ederson ensured the champions reached half-time ahead, racing off his line to deny Son after the South Korean charged from his own half into the City area. City had two further penalty appeals waved away early in the second half as referee Oliver chose not to penalise Toby Alderweireld's handball and Juan Foyth's barge on Foden. Team news Phil Foden was handed his second PL start and John Stones and Oleksandr Zinchenko returned as Man City made three changes from the midweek Champions League exit at the hands of Spurs, who made five alterations ahead of their return to the Etihad. But Spurs had the stronger claims as Walker's handball, which prevented a long ball from releasing Dele Alli through on goal, and Son's flick, which appeared to strike John Stones' arm, went unpunished. Raheem Sterling looked to set to exorcise some demons after his midweek VAR heartache with City's second goal on 71 minutes, but his sweeping shot from Leroy Sane's cutback was turned behind by the outstretched leg of Paulo Gazzaniga on 71 minutes. Ederson makes a save to prevent Lucas Moura from equalising Ederson then prevented Lucas Moura from hauling Spurs level after he latched onto Alderweireld's long pass, generating unbearable levels of anxiety among the home faithful, but the champions stood firm to return to the summit. Opta stats Manchester City have won 25 home games in all competitions this season, the most they've ever won in a single campaign and the most by an English top-flight club since Man Utd in 2010-11 (26). Tottenham have lost five successive Premier League away games for the first time since May 2004, a run of six under manager David Pleat. Man City have won their last 10 Premier League games - their longest streak since a run of 18 between August and December 2017, which remains the all-time top-flight record. Tottenham have lost 11 Premier League games this season, as many as they had in their previous two campaigns combined (4 in 2016-17, 7 in 2017-18). Phil Foden scored his first Premier League goal for Man City, becoming the third youngest player to score in the competition for the club (after Micah Richards and Daniel Sturridge). Bernardo Silva was directly involved in seven of Manchester City's 15 shots in this match, having three attempts and creating four. Tottenham have lost a Premier League game without Harry Kane taking part for the first time since October 2017 at Manchester United. The managers 3:30 Guardiola: A very important win Guardiola: A very important win Pep Guardiola: \"It's an important win in the race for the Premier League. If we drop point, we cannot fight until the end.

The already-relegated visitors had lost 15 and drawn the other two of their 17 road trips but changed the script at the Vitality Stadium after weathering an early onslaught from the hosts. The game's key moment came in the 53rd minute when Jack Simpson caught Mitrovic just inside the box, and the Serb striker stepped up to slot home the resulting penalty. It gave caretaker Fulham boss Scott Parker a second straight win following last week's 2-0 victory over Everton, although the London side remain second-bottom, with Bournemouth in 12th. Player Ratings Bournemouth: Boruc (7), Cook (6), Gosling (6), Ake (6), Lerma (6), Wilson (5), Smith (5), King (4), Brooks (6), Fraser (8), Mepham (6). Subs: Mousset (6), Stanislas (4), Solanke (5).

Subs: Christie (6), Ayite (N/A), Nordtveit (N/A) Man of the match: Sergio Rico How Fulham and Mitrovic broke their away drought... Bournemouth went into the match on the back of a 5-0 success at Brighton last weekend and looked set to continue on the goal trail in the early stages after creating a string of chances. Callum Wilson hooked over a decent effort in the opening minute, while Josh King and the lively Ryan Fraser had shots deflected wide with just six minutes on the clock. Fraser continued to look Bournemouth's biggest attacking threat and presented King with a golden opportunity on the quarter-hour mark, but the striker blazed over. Get 2 football channels for the price of 1 Sergio Rico tipped behind a left-footed Fraser effort soon after, but a series of stoppages for injuries appeared to halt Bournemouth's momentum and Fulham got a foothold in the game. The Cottagers started to probe and went close to the opening goal when Ryan Babel's corner was met at the near post by Belgian defender Denis Odoi, only for Artur Boruc to make a smart stop down to his left. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe, taking charge of his 500th match as a manager, went to a back three after the break, but Fulham continued to gain in confidence with Babel sending a header over the bar. And just eight minutes into the second half, they were in front. The Cottagers zipped a series of passes around the edge of the box before Simpson's clumsy challenge caught Mitrovic and referee David Coote pointed to the spot. Mitrovic had failed to score in his last nine Premier League games and was without an away goal since the start of September, but the striker kept his nerve to tuck his penalty into the corner. Bournemouth had further chances via Fraser and Wilson, but Rico held firm in the Fulham goal as the already-relegated visitors finally ended their away-day drought at the 18th time of asking. Opta stats Fulham picked up their first league win over Bournemouth since January 1994, when both sides were in the third tier of English football. Bournemouth suffered their 18th defeat of the Premier League season, equalling their most in a single campaign in the competition (18 in 2015-16). Fulham have won back-to-back games in the Premier League for the first time since April 2014, when they beat Aston Villa and Norwich under Felix Magath. Bournemouth have lost four of their seven Premier League home games against teams starting the day in the relegation zone, with this their first such defeat since losing against Crystal Palace in January 2017. Bournemouth haven't won any of their last five home games in the Premier League - their longest such run since February 2017 (D2 L3). No stadium has seen more penalties awarded this season than the Vitality Stadium (10 - seven for Bournemouth, three for the opposition). Aleksandar Mitrovic's goal for Fulham ended a run of nine Premier League games without scoring - he hadn't netted with any of his previous 36 shots in the competition prior to his penalty. Aleksandar Mitrovic's penalty was the first he has scored in all competitions since April 2016 (for Newcastle v Norwich) - he had failed to score each of his last two penalties before today. Man of the match: Sergio Rico The Fulham goalkeeper made a vital early stop from Fraser and threw himself at the feet of Bournemouth's front men several times to deny the hosts an equaliser. Made five saves and simply refused to be beaten, preserving Fulham's clean sheet and playing a huge part in their first away win of the campaign. Sergio Rico commands his area to keep Bournemouth at bay Manager reaction Eddie Howe: \"Tough one to take. We were so good last week, so clinical in front of goal, some of our passing and movement was of the highest quality. Today that was missing. \"We created the opportunities today, we got into the positions but we didn't quite execute the finish right or the final pass and it'll be a frustration because we felt we could have won that game today.\" 1:29 Bournemouth's Eddie Howe says they created opportunities but weren't clinical enough in their defeat to Fulham. Bournemouth's Eddie Howe says they created opportunities but weren't clinical enough in their defeat to Fulham. Scott Parker: \"We spoke about it at half-time. I felt that, first half, we knew they'd come out quick at us and we knew that we'd have to weather the storm a little and bit and certainly we did that. \"And then at half-time, we changed things a little bit, tried to get a little bit more control of the ball, trying to get players inside the pitch a bit more and try to build into the game that way and, in the second half, on the run of play, we was very good value really, and we had a clear way about us and that was pleasing.\" 2:55 Scott Parker says he's delighted for the players and fans after they won away at Bournemouth.

"report": "2:51 Huddersfield 1-2 Watford Huddersfield 1-2 Watford Watford took a big step to becoming the ‘best of the rest’ in the Premier League as they moved seventh with a 2-1 win at Huddersfield on Saturday. Gerard Deulofeu was at the double (4, 81) for the Hornets as he replaced the suspended Troy Deeney to great effect - the Spaniard has now scored eight goals in his last nine games. Huddersfield's miserable season is ending with a whimper - this was their seventh straight defeat, although Karlan Grant did net a late consolation (90+2). Watford could qualify outright for the Europa League by winning the FA Cup final, but if Manchester City win at Wembley, then the Europa League qualifying spot would be handed to the side that finishes seventh in the league. Player Ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Smith (6), Kongolo (7), Schindler (6), Durm (6), Mooy (7), Bacuna (6), Hogg (4), Mbenza (7), Mounie (5), Kachunga (5) Subs: Daly (7), Lowe (6), Grant (7) Watford: Foster (7), Cathcart (7), Mariappa (8), Masina (7), Doucoure (7), Capoue (7), Femenia (7), Hughes (7), Sema (7), Gray (6), Deulofeu (8) Subs: Success (7) Man of the match: Gerard Deulofeu How Deulofeu inspired Hornets…. Watford started with great intent and were ahead inside four minutes. Jonathan Hogg squandered possession under strong Watford pressure, and after Abdoulaye Doucoure's shot was blocked, Deulofeu was on hand to whip a silky effort into the far corner. It was the same technique he used against Wolves at Wembley. Apart from Isaac Mbenza, who tested Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster with a fierce effort from range, Huddersfield's attacking threat was non-existent. Huddersfield 18-year-old midfielder Matty Daly made his first-team debut just before half-time, in place of Hogg, who had struggled and was on a booking. Watford always seemed in control but were given a scare as Steve Mounie's overhead kick looped just over the crossbar. Deulofeu sealed victory for Watford when he calmly finished from close range after Isaac Success' strike had been palmed away by Jonas Lossl. Grant, a 66th-minute replacement for Mounie, nodded home in injury time to leave the home fans with something to cheer, but in truth, it was another bleak result for Jan Siewert's men. Man of the match: Gerard Deulofeu Who else? Despite struggling with an ankle injury in recent weeks, Deulofeu looked a man still at the top of his game in front of goal. He took just four minutes to whip home a trademark silky finish with his instep and was in the right place at the right time to fire home what was eventually was the crucial second goal. Gerard Deulofeu celebrates scoring his and Watford's second goal Opta stats Huddersfield Town have lost 14 home Premier League games this season, a joint-record in the competition's history (also 14 for Sunderland in 2002-03 and 2005-06). Watford have won six away Premier League games this season, only winning more in a top-flight season in 1983-84 under Graham Taylor (seven). Huddersfield have lost 21 of their last 23 matches in all competitions (W1 D1 L21), losing 11 of their 12 games under manager Jan Siewert (W1 D0 L11). Gerard Deulofeu has scored six goals in his last five Premier League away games for Watford. Huddersfield have won none of the 45 Premier League matches in which they've conceded the first goal (W0 D3 L42), losing all 19 at the John Smith's Stadium when conceding first. In all competitions, Gerard Deulofeu has scored eight goals and assisted two more in his last nine appearances for Watford. Huddersfield midfielder Juninho Bacuna has started 15 matches for the Terriers in all competitions this season and ended on the losing side in all 15. Since his Premier League debut for Huddersfield Town on February 2nd, Karlan Grant has scored four league goals - no other Terriers player has scored more than once in that time. Manager reaction... Jan Siewert: \"It was a big frustration as we were on the back foot after five minutes. We had some big opportunities to score - we had more chances than them but couldn't score. It was hard to take, but it's a learning process for me.\" 3:12 Huddersfield's Jan Siewert says he will stay positive and learn from this season after they fell to a 2-1 defeat to Watford. Huddersfield's Jan Siewert says he will stay positive and learn from this season after they fell to a 2-1 defeat to Watford.

West Ham 2-2 Leicester A 92nd-minute equaliser from Harvey Barnes saw Leicester snatch a 2-2 draw against West Ham, with the 21-year-old scoring his first Premier League goal. Michail Antonio (37) headed West Ham in front during a quiet first half, but Jamie Vardy's equaliser in the 67th minute really sparked the game into life. Just four minutes after coming on, Lucas Perez (82) tapped home to put the Hammers back ahead, but he had a second effort ruled out for offside on the 90-minute mark and, shortly afterwards, Barnes slotted home across the face of goal to see the spoils shared at the London Stadium. West Ham - who had Jack Wilshere return from a long-term ankle injury as a late substitute - remain in 11th place, while Leicester have slipped into eighth, after Watford beat Huddersfield to leapfrog them into seventh. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (7), Balbuena (7), Zabaleta (7), Ogbonna (7), Masuaku (7), Rice (7), Anderson (6), Sndograss (6), Noble (7), Antonio (8), Arnautovic (6). Subs used: Obiang (6), Perez (7), Wilshere (n/a). Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Pereira (7), Evans (6), Maguire (7), Chilwell (7), Ndidi (7), Maddison (7), Albrighton (7), Tielemans (6), Gray (6), Vardy (7). Subs used: Barnes (7), Iheancho (n/a), Mendy (n/a). Man of the match: Michail Antonio. How Leicester fought back - twice West Ham started well, although chances were few and far between. Leicester went close in the 23rd minute when Marc Albrighton pumped a lovely ball into the area, aiming for Vardy, but Lukasz Fabianski was out to collect ahead of the striker. Not long after, Marko Arnautovic's clipped cut-back was fired towards goal by Antonio but some good defending from Ricardo Pereira saw it loop into the hands of Kasper Schmeichel. Team news West Ham made two changes with Manuel Lanzini and Javier Hernandez replaced by Michail Antonio and Marko Arnautovic. Jack Wilshere started on the bench. Leicester also made two changes with Marc Albrighton and Jonny Evans coming in for Harvey Barnes and Wes Morgan. But Antonio did deservedly find the net in the 37th minute. It was a sumptuous cross from Mark Noble on the left-hand side, with Antonio rising above his marker, Ben Chilwell, to power his header past a leaping Schmeichel. His celebration was equally as good, going over to the new claret-coloured astroturf that surrounds the London Stadium pitch and stroking it before being surrounded by his team-mates. Michail Antonio celebrates his goal by stroking West Ham's new claret pitchside carpet It was also a quiet start to the second half and it looked like West Ham would coast to a 1-0 victory, but Leicester had other ideas as Vardy levelled in the 67th minute. Chilwell scooped the ball in from the left-hand side and the striker was waiting ahead of Fabian Balbuena to direct the ball past Fabianski. Lucas Perez scored once but had another goal ruled out for offside The goal really opened the game up and it was an end-to-end encounter from then on, and, four minutes after replacing Arnautovic as a substitute, Perez put West Ham back ahead. It was Pedro Obiang's strike that initially hit the post in the 82nd minute, but Perez was in the right place to hammer home the rebound. The Leicester players were claiming offside, but replays showed the striker was onside and it was a superb decision from the officials to let it stand. What would VAR have changed? For this, all eyes turn to the final 10 minutes and Lucas Perez. VAR would have confirmed that he was onside for his first goal and also for the second, which was subsequently ruled out without the technology. West Ham would then have been in a much better position to see the game out for all three points. Almost immediately after the goal, Wilshere was introduced for Noble, making his first appearance since December 1 when he made another substitute appearance against Newcastle and picked up an ankle injury. He made it through his 10-minute cameo without incident. Jamie Vardy scored the first equaliser for Leicester Just as five minutes of added time was shown, Perez once again had the ball in the net after rounding Schmeichel, but this time, he was flagged for offside. Replays showed he was actually onside again, but the goal was ruled out. Leicester ensured they took a point from their trip to London in the 92nd minute. Youri Tielemans - who had an unusually quiet game - slipped the ball down the left for Barnes who found himself some space before sweeping home into the bottom corner for his first Premier League goal. The managers Manuel Pellegrini: \"It wasn't a tough decision [for Perez's second goal]. Last week was a tough decision [for Felipe Anderson's goal also incorrectly ruled out for offside], now it is in front of the linesman and Lucas is one metre in the legal position. \"When it is a difficult decision, I say it is a difficult decision. Last week against Man Utd, that was very difficult for the linesman because it was just one foot and it was the opposite side of him - that mistake you can understand. 2:06 West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini says he cannot understand how the linesman gave Lucas Perez offside ahead of Leicester's equaliser West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini says he cannot understand how the linesman gave Lucas Perez offside ahead of Leicester's equaliser \"But the mistake today, I cannot understand. With that goal, we would have finished the game.\" Brendan Rodgers: \"The spirit of the team was excellent but we weren't at our level in the first half. Sometimes it happens, we have a lot of youthful players but it was important at half-time that we addressed it. \"We came out and played without any fear in the second half, which is important. I thought we were very good in the second half, more dynamic, quicker in our game and a lot more compact as a team. We scored two very good goals and we were a much better threat in the second half.\" 2:43 Brendan Rodgers says Leicester played without fear in the second half as they came from behind to draw at West Ham Brendan Rodgers says Leicester played without fear in the second half as they came from behind to draw at West Ham Opta stats West Ham are winless in their last four Premier League games (D1 L3), last having a longer such run between October-December 2017 (eight games). Leicester have both scored and conceded in 13 different away Premier League games this season - no other side has seen both teams score in more on the road in 2018-19. Jamie Vardy has scored nine goals in his last 10 Premier League games for Leicester, including seven in his seven appearances under manager Brendan Rodgers. West Ham's Lucas Perez scored his fourth Premier League goal (1 for Arsenal, 3 for West Ham), with all of them coming as a substitute. Man of the match - Michail Antonio Antonio had a busy first half, heading West Ham ahead in the 37th minute Antonio scores the majority of his goals with headers and he added another to his list against the Foxes. Of players to score at least 25 Premier League goals, only John Terry (66 per cent) has scored a higher percentage of his goals via headers than Antonio (15/25, 60 per cent). He had come back into the side for the injured Manuel Lanzini and more than justified his inclusion with a superb attacking performance. This was also epitomised by the number of fouls he received from Leicester in the first half and their double-man defending. What's next? Both teams are live on Sky Sports next weekend. West Ham travel to Tottenham on Saturday for the lunchtime kick-off before Leicester welcome Arsenal on Sunday for a midday game."},{"date": "20/04/2019", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 31096,

Highlights as Wolves are held to a 0-0 draw with Brighton at Molineux Relegation-threatened Brighton ended a four-match losing run to secure a vital point in their quest for Premier League survival, holding Wolves to a 0-0 draw at Molineux. Wolves dominated from start to finish, with Diogo Jota hitting the woodwork twice, but the hosts were unable to break the deadlock as they lost ground on Watford in the race for a potential Europa League place. Rui Patricio was largely untroubled throughout the contest, with substitute Beram Kayal's speculative drive the closest the visitors came to scoring. Davy Propper was forced off with a hamstring injury in the first half Player ratings Wolves: Patricio (6), Doherty (6), Jonny (6), Bennett (6), Coady (7), Boly (6), Moutinho (7), Neves (7), Gibbs-White (6), Jota (7), Jimenez (6) Subs: Vinagre (7), Dendoncker (6), Traore (n/a). Brighton: Ryan (8), Bruno (7), Bong (7), Duffy (8), Dunk (8), Stephens (6), Propper (6), March (6), Gross (6), Izquierdo (5), Murray (5) Subs: Kayal (6), Bernardo (6). Man of the match: Shane Duffy Chris Hughton's side have now failed to score in 570 minutes, but they produced a spirited display following two straight home defeats to move three points clear of the relegation zone ahead of Cardiff's home game with Liverpool on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Diogo Jota saw two efforts hit the woodwork on a frustrating afternoon How Brighton's defensive rock returned Wolves, who remain ninth, enjoyed 66 per cent possession during a one-sided first half, but they failed to have a single shot on target as the Seagulls defended resolutely with Shane Duffy and Lewis Dunk on hand to thwart the numerous crosses from Joao Moutinho. For the Portuguese, it must have felt like picking a lock at the Bank of England, but his compatriot Jota was very nearly the beneficiary of a slice of fortune after Ruben Neves' shot deflected into his path on the stroke of half-time, his looped shot clipped the top of the crossbar. Jota had also been involved in the only other two incidents of note in the opening 45 minutes as Pascal Gross produced a last-ditch challenge inside the box that referee Craig Pawson deemed to be a legal challenge, and it was Jota whose shot from just inside the box was dragged a yard wide of the post after 33 minutes following nice work by Morgan Gibbs-White. Jota heads wide as Wolves were left frustrated by Brighton It took until the 54th minute for Patricio to come close to an involvement as Kayal's 30-yard drive whistled inches over the bar - but that was as good as it got for Brighton as they continued to invite pressure onto their goal. Team news Nuno made two changes to his Wolves side following the 3-1 defeat at Southampton as Morgan Gibbs-White and Ryan Bennett replaced Romain Saiss and Leander Dendoncker. For Brighton, Jose Izquierdo and Gaetan Bong returned to the starting line-up as Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Bernardo dropped to the bench. Moutinho's corner just after the hour-mark saw the ball land kindly for Jota, but his shot was smothered by Ryan, although the Australian goalkeeper should have been given no chance with 17 minutes remaining when Duffy's slip allowed Jota the chance to meet Raul Jimenez's cross, but his header struck the post before Leander Dendoncker's rebound was brilliantly saved. The Belgian was well-placed to meet Willy Boly's knock-down from Moutinho's deep corner with two minutes of normal time remaining but his header was gratefully gathered by Ryan as Brighton completed a fine defensive display to earn a deserved point. The managers Nuno Espirito Santo: \"The performance was good and we had a lot of chances. I saw one team that really wanted to go. We didn't allow anything to Brighton at all but in the end the ball didn't go in. \"We had lots of chances but it's difficult to find the spaces and it requires patience against a side who crowded out the box. The fans supported us throughout and I was proud of our performance. \"I respect each manager has his own ideas and today I have to congratulate Brighton because they were well organised and achieved what they wanted to by not conceding. It was up to us to break them.\" 1:53 Nuno Espirito Santo says he's proud of their performance despite being held to a goalless draw by Brighton. Nuno Espirito Santo says he's proud of their performance despite being held to a goalless draw by Brighton. Chris Hughton: \"When we asked the players for a response, we certainly got that with what they were prepared to give and how hard they were prepared to work. \"It's hard coming here as they've got so many good footballers. You know if you open up too much, they can hurt you. We could've been better with our link play, the times that we broke. \"But we knew it would be difficult and we knew if we could keep a clean sheet we gave ourselves a chance.\" 2:55 Brighton's Chris Hughton says he got a good response from his players after they gained a point at Wolves. Brighton's Chris Hughton says he got a good response from his players after they gained a point at Wolves. Pundit reaction Matt Le Tissier told Soccer Saturday: \"It was quite clear early on what Brighton's intentions were today - and at the end of the season, he'll probably be applauded for it. \"I think it's a huge point as it takes them just out of the distance of Cardiff because the goal difference is so big between them. It means Cardiff have to take points in at least two of their remaining games. 3:05 Matt Le Tissier says Brighton earned a huge point in their fight for survival and looked like their old selves as they drew at Wolves. Matt Le Tissier says Brighton earned a huge point in their fight for survival and looked like their old selves as they drew at Wolves. \"They're pinning all their hopes on getting three points at home to Newcastle. Wolves weren't that impressive, they had a lot of possession without doing too much damage with the ball. \"You felt like they could've taken advantage by throwing a few more men forward, but they didn't have a single attempt on target the whole game. \"They were pretty solid and Mat Ryan didn't really make too many saves where you felt he had to exert himself.\" Man of the match - Shane Duffy This was an off-colour performance from Wolves that left Nuno scratching his head, but on the flip side, Brighton's defiant display was spearheaded by Duffy, whose 12 clearances helped his side earn a first clean sheet in eight outings. With games against Tottenham, Newcastle, Arsenal and Manchester City to come, it was imperative that Brighton took something away from the Midlands, and Duffy's handling of Jimenez played a vital role in helping them over the line. Brighton players congratulate one another after a fine defensive display Wolves had 47 shots against Brighton this season without scoring in both matches; the most shots against a single opponent without finding the net since Tottenham vs West Ham in 2010-11 (51) - and Duffy played a central part to the second of those two clean sheets. It was his block on Jota's goalbound shot in the second half that kept the scores level, and after nightmare displays at the Amex against Bournemouth and Cardiff, this was a real show of character from Brighton's defence as a whole. Opta stats Brighton have lost just one of their last 10 league games against Wolves (W4 D5 L1), unbeaten in their last four (W3 D1 L0). Six of the last eight league games between Wolves and Brighton at Molineux have ended in a draw. Brighton have failed to score in each of their last five Premier League games, their worst run in the league since January 2016 (five successive games). Brighton have kept just their second clean sheet on the road in the Premier League this season, with their other shutout coming against Newcastle in October. No side has failed to have a shot on target in more Premier League games this season than Brighton (3 - versus Liverpool, Watford and Wolves). What's next? Wolves host Arsenal in the Premier League on Wednesday at Molineux, while Brighton travel to face Tottenham on Tuesday, with both games kicking off at 7.45pm."},{"date": "20/04/2019", "arena": "St

3-1 Southampton Ayoze Perez's first Premier League hat-trick left Newcastle on the brink of safety with a 3-1 win over Southampton at St James' Park on Saturday. Perez delivered a lesson in finishing during an end-to-end first half in the north east, making his opener himself by holding off Maya Yoshida before firing through Ryan Bertrand's legs into the far corner, and then notching from close-range from Salomon Rondon's cross. Southampton had plenty of play in the final third but failed to register a shot on target before the break - in fact, their first effort of note was their comeback goal from half-time substitute Mario Lemina, who finished superbly from 25 yards into the far corner a quarter of an hour into the second 45. Much of the rest of the game belonged to the visitors, but Perez sealed his hat-trick courtesy of a touch of fortune late on, diverting Matt Ritchie's header beyond Angus Gunn to secure the match ball four minutes from time. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Manquillo (6), Schar (7), Lascelles (7), Dummett (7), Hayden (7), Ki (7), Ritchie (7), Almiron (8), Perez (9), Rondon (8). Subs: Atsu (7), Fernandez (6), Diame (6). Southampton: Gunn (7), Bednarek (5), Yoshida (5), Stephens (6), Bertrand (6), Hojbjerg (5), Romeu (5), Ward-Prowse (6), Sims (5), Redmond (5), Ings (4). Subs: Armstrong (6), Lemina (7), Long (5). Man of the match: Ayoze Perez A Liverpool win against Cardiff on Sunday will leave Newcastle mathematically safe in the Premier League, while Southampton still have work to do - albeit they are still five points clear of the drop. How Newcastle continued their recent rise Neither Newcastle nor Southampton's form particularly befit that of a side fighting relegation; and neither did the opening stages of an end-to-end encounter feel like a fight to avoid the drop, just lacking quality in the final third. Team news Newcastle named the exact same squad that beat Leicester last weekend. Southampton were without Jan Valery and Jannik Vestergaard, both injured, but welcomed back Mario Lemina to the squad for the first time since December. There was plenty of spark on the half-way line when the energetic Miguel Almiron was bundled over by James Ward-Prowse, denying what appeared a clear run on goal - and the home side were infuriated by Anthony Taylor's decision to issue only a yellow card, so much so that first-team coach Mikel Antia was sent off by the referee. Any worries about rough justice were soon dampened when Perez provided the first moment of quality in the final third all afternoon, holding off Yoshida confidently before angling a low effort just inside the far corner and leaving Gunn with no chance. Ayoze Perez netted his fourth, fifth and six goals in his last six games Four minutes later, Newcastle's in-form striker grabbed his fifth goal in six games in simpler fashion following excellent hold-up play by Rondon. The forward stood up Jan Bednarek on the left flank before beating him for pace and crossing for his Spanish team-mate to dive in at the far post and double the lead. Ralph Hasenhuttl has not been shy to shake things up, and the introduction of Lemina and Stuart Armstrong at the break bore fruit inside 15 minutes. Redmond's whipped pass from the right was laid off by the Scot to his midfield partner and Lemina, playing his first minutes in 2019 after abdominal surgery, bent the ball beyond Martin Dubravka into the far corner. Mario Lemina reduced the deficit at St James' Park in his first appearance of 2019 Southampton should have levelled when Yoshida was given a fine chance six yards out when Redmond recycled the ball from a corner, but he side-footed well over. But for all the Saints' huff and puff, Newcastle continued to be the side creating most of the chances, and hit the post twice through long-range strikes from Ki Sung-Yeung and Isaac Hayden. And they put the gloss on a win with a third goal which proved a little harsh on Southampton, when Perez was well-placed to turn Ritchie's diving header beyond an already diving Gunn in the dying minutes. The one worry for Newcastle will be the loss of Almiron with a suspected hamstring injury in the second half, while Fabian Schar was also withdrawn. Newcastle United's Miguel Almiron was withdrawn shortly after the hour mark Opta facts This was Newcastle's sixth home Premier League win of 2019 - only Man City (8) and Arsenal (7) have won more. Southampton have lost three of their last four away Premier League games (W1 D0 L3), having lost just one of their first four away matches under Ralph Hasenhüttl (W2 D2 L1). Ayoze Perez's hat-trick was Newcastle's first in the Premier League since October 2015, when Georginio Wijnaldum scored four times against Norwich City. Ayoze Perez has scored 10 Premier League goals this season - his best tally in a single top-flight season for Newcastle United. Ayoze Perez has scored seven goals in his last seven Premier League appearances at St. James' Park. Salomón Rondón has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Newcastle player this season (15 - 9 goals, 6 assists). Southampton goalkeeper Angus Gunn conceded a Premier League hat-trick 25 years and 11 days after his father Bryan Gunn conceded one in the Premier League against Southampton in April 1994, with Matt Le Tissier scoring a treble for the Saints that day. Southampton have scored 12 Premier League goals from outside the box this season, a joint high along with Man City and Spurs. Managers Rafa Benitez: \"Our level, I think, has to be between seventh and 10th and we have to compete with these teams in the transfer window, in the wage bill and everything. We need to find a balance. \"[Regarding a new deal] we have to talk because at the end, everything that will happen on June 30 has to be good for everyone. I have to decide if we sign anyone until then, so we have to talk any time.\" Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"Because of the first half, to be honest we didn't deserve to get something here and we must be clear that a little bit of playing football is not enough. \"If we are not aggressive and if we are not working against the ball as a team, then against such an opponent at this stadium, you don't have a chance to get something.\" Man of the match - Ayoze Perez The little Spanish dynamo has often needed to add more goals to his game, but he smashed his way into double figures for the season, the first time in his Newcastle career, with his hat-trick. The goal that sealed it may have had more than a touch of fortune about it, but his opener was entirely self-made, and his second was a perfect striker's goal. Those aside, he played his part as front of a front three alongside Salomon Rondon and Miguel Almiron, who caused Southampton all sorts of problems, and if he can kick on and continue this kind of form more consistently, he will be a huge asset for Rafa Benitez. What's next? Newcastle travel to Brighton, who are still firmly involved in the relegation battle, in next Saturday's 5.30pm kick-off. Southampton host Bournemouth at St Mary's next Saturday at 3pm."},{"date": "16/04/2019", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30226, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Fernandes da Silva Junior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["54"]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["69"]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jürgen Locadia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florin Andone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["54"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Izquierdo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["69"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Button", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Burn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Peltier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": ["79"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aron Gunnarsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["55"]}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Mendez-Laing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["80"]}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oumar Niasse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["85"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kenneth Zohore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["85"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["55"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kadeem Harris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["80"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brian Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rhys Healey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:19 Highlights from Cardiff's 2-0 win at Brighton in the Premier League. Highlights from Cardiff's 2-0 win at Brighton in the Premier League. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and Sean Morrison boosts Cardiff's fight against relegation with a crucial 2-0 win against fellow strugglers Brighton at the Amex Stadium. Mendez-Laing opened the scoring with a brilliant curled strike in the 22nd minute to hand the visitors the initiative. Although Brighton dominated possession for long periods, Morrison extended Cardiff's lead with a header from a free-kick five minutes into the second half against the hosts who lacked an attacking spark. The result means 18th-placed Cardiff, who have four games to play, now move to within two points of their relegation rivals Brighton.

Bruno Manga appeared to drag down Lewis Dunk in the box after a free-kick, but referee Andre Marriner waved away the protests. Twelve minutes later, with Brighton looking the more likely to take the lead, Cardiff broke the deadlock. Team news Pascal Gross, Solly March, Glenn Murray returned to the starting XI. Bruno and Alireza Jahanbakhsh also came into the team. Joe Ralls, Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and Oumar Niasse came into the Cardiff team. On the counter-attack, Mendez-Laing curled his stunning right-footed strike into the top corner from the edge of the box. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing (right) gave Cardiff the lead with a fine strike Alireza Jahanbakhsh flashed a shot on goal that was comfortably saved by Neil Etheridge shortly after the restart, but it was Morrison who put Cardiff two up after he snuck in behind Lewis Dunk and met Victor Camarasa's cross to nod in from close range. Brighton came close to pulling a goal back through Glenn Murray in the 70th minute, but his driven strike rose over the bar. The 35-year-old striker came close again in injury-time, but his close-range header smashed off the crossbar which meant a rare clean sheet for Cardiff in their revitalised push for Premier League safety. Opta stats Cardiff have completed the league double over Brighton for the first time since the 1998-99 season in the fourth tier; having won the reverse fixture 2-1 in November. Cardiff City have won a top-flight away match by more than a single goal for the first time since November 1956 (2-0 at Charlton Athletic). Only already relegated Fulham (6) and Huddersfield (4) have won fewer Premier League points in 2019 than Brighton (8). Brighton have lost three consecutive home league games for the first time since January 2016 in the Championship - they failed to score a single goal in both these losing runs. Cardiff's Nathaniel Mendez-Laing scored just his second Premier League goal of the season with the opener, each of his goals have come away from home on a Tuesday night Cardiff's Sean Morrison has scored his third Premier League goal, his first for the Bluebirds and his first for 2327 days since scoring for Reading against Manchester United in December 2012. Before scoring his goal tonight, Cardiff City's Sean Morrison had the highest Expected Goals (xG) total in the Premier League of all players to not score in the competition in 2018-19 (3.6).

He told The Debate: \"When you're down there and on a poor run of results, you're naturally going to lack confidence, so when something like that goes against you, it's even harder to then go again. But I've got no doubt, that's a strong dressing room with some strong leaders. \"They will go to Wolves, and they will give absolutely everything. I thought that Saturday was a wake-up call for everyone at the club, but this is a huge wake-up call - and there's always one team that gets dragged in, and there's always a team that gets a result out of nowhere to get themselves out of trouble. \"I have no doubt they will head to Wolves hoping it's them on Saturday.\" Man of the Match - Sean Morrison Sean Morrison impressed against Brighton Morrison's goal came at a vital time with Brighton pushing for an equaliser, while he was also instrumental at the back.

Highlights from Arsenal's 1-0 win over Watford in the Premier League Arsenal have gone back into fourth place after edging past Watford, who had captain Troy Deeney sent off 11 minutes into the game. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave Arsenal the lead inside ten minutes after Ben Foster's attempted goal kick came off his leg at close range and ended up in the back of the net. Not long after, Deeney was given his marching orders by referee Craig Pawson after catching Lucas Torreira in the face with an elbow, and despite seeing plenty of chances in an entertaining encounter, Watford were unable to battle back for a point. The result has seen Arsenal keep a clean sheet away from home for the first time this season and puts them back above Chelsea into fourth on goal difference, while the Gunners also have a game in hand over the Blues. Player ratings Watford: Foster (6), Janmaat (6), Cathcart (7), Kabasele (6), Masina (6), Doucoure (6), Capoue (7), Femenia (6), Hughes (7), Gray (6), Deeney (3). Subs used: Success (3), Sema (n/a). Arsenal: Leno (6), Koscielny (6), Mavropanos (6), Mustafi (6), Monreal (6), Ramsey (7), Torreira (7), Xhaka (6), Iwobi (7), Mkhitaryan (5), Aubameyang (7). Subs used: Ozil (6), Guendouzi (6), Maitland-Niles (6). Man of the match: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Watford began well at Vicarage Road but things soon went downhill as Arsenal took the lead inside ten minutes. It was a rare mistake from goalkeeper Foster as he dwelled for too long on the ball with Aubameyang baring down on him and as he went to kick it away, the Arsenal striker got a leg in the way to send the ball ricocheting into the back of the net. A minute later and Watford lost their captain Deeney as he was shown a straight red card for an elbow into the face of Torreira. It took a while for the striker to make his way off the field as he remonstrated with the officials, but the decision was not to be overturned and Deeney will now miss the next three games against Huddersfield, Southampton and Wolves, subject to an appeal. Team news Unai Emery made six changes from the side that beat Napoli in the Europa League last week. Bernd Leno, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Alex Iwobi, Shkodran Mustafi, Konstantinos Mavropanos and Granit Xhaka all came into the XI for the game. Watford also made four changes from their FA Cup semi-final triumph with Ben Foster, Daryl Janmaat, Christian Kabasele and Adam Masina coming into the side. It is sometimes said that teams play better with ten men and this certainly applied to Watford for the remainder of the half. Craig Cathcart went close in the 20th minute with a close range effort, but was denied by the leg of Bernd Leno. The race for the top four: Remaining fixtures Alex Iwobi did test Foster not long after, but the goalkeeper acrobatically parried the Arsenal forward's effort behind before Leno did the same at the other end to keep out a curling Etienne Capoue free kick. Foster atoned for his first-half mistake early in the second period as he denied Arsenal a second. It was a strong counter-attack from the visitors, with Iwobi picking out Mkhitaryan at the back post, but his side-footed volley was saved by the outstretched leg of the goalkeeper. The Arsenal midfielder spurned another glorious chance a few minutes later but powered the ball well wide of the upright. Troy Deeney reacts after being sent off against Arsenal Watford continued to press in an open game and Adam Masina almost equalised in stunning fashion just after the hour mark. He let fly with a fierce drive from 30 yards out, which pinged off the crossbar before going wide. With ten minutes to play, Andre Gray then rounded goalkeeper Leno but a sliding challenge from Ainsley Maitland-Niles saw his effort away at the near post. Despite plenty of late pressure from Watford, they were unable to take a deserved point from the Monday Night Football encounter as Arsenal held out for a vital away victory. The managers Javi Gracia: \"I respect the referee's decision, but I don't agree [about Deeney's red card]. In my opinion it is a yellow card but never a red. I can't explain what the referee saw to make that decision. 3:38 Javi Gracia didn't feel Troy Deeney's red card was anything more than a yellow, but praised his side's performance having played most of their defeat to Arsenal with 10 men Javi Gracia didn't feel Troy Deeney's red card was anything more than a yellow, but praised his side's performance having played most of their defeat to Arsenal with 10 men \"It was an important one. I prefer to speak about my players who today deserve the recognition. We don't get points but we had a good performance and we keep playing with the same ambition and desire.\" Unai Emery: \"Our position in the table is very important. It is in our hands, to take the top four. We were working to push the goalkeeper when he wanted to play like he was playing. It's a very good action from Auba.\" Opta stats Watford suffered their first defeat in six Premier League home games (W3 D2). Since returning to the Premier League in 2015/16, Watford have picked up 15 red cards in the competition, more than any other side. Since his debut in February 2018, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in 37 Premier League goals for Arsenal (28 goals, 9 assists), 11 more than any other player for the Gunners in that time. Watford's Troy Deeney was sent off for the second time in the Premier League and for the first time since December 2017 against Huddersfield. Man of the match - Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang It was Aubameyang's instinct and timing that won the game for Arsenal early on and he was a continuous threat up front - although some of his later finishing can certainly be improved. Speaking to Sky Sports about his goal, he said: \"I was confident, it's a long time that I want to score a goal like this, and tonight it went through, so I was confident, because normally keepers don't know if you're coming back to them, and tonight it was a good goal, for me, I like it.\" He is now joint-second in the Premier League top-scorers chart with 18 goals and is on course for a 20-goal haul in his first full season at Arsenal. What's next? Watford will travel to already-relegated Huddersfield in the Premier League on Saturday, while it is a big week for Arsenal. They travel to Napoli in their Europa League quarter-final second leg on Thursday before hosting Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday."},{"date": "14/04/2019", "arena": "Selhurst Park",

Crystal Palace in the Premier League Highlights of Manchester City's 3-1 win at Crystal Palace in the Premier League Raheem Sterling scored twice as Manchester City survived a late scare to beat Crystal Palace 3-1 and maintain their Premier League title challenge. Sterling struck in the 15th minute, shortly after a glaring miss, and then netted again in the 63rd minute - his 17th of the season in the Premier League - to put City in firm control at Selhurst Park on Super Sunday. It looked like a stroll for City until Luka Milivojevic converted with a low free-kick from the edge of the box in the 81st minute.

Gabriel Jesus scored a late third for City The win was City's ninth in a row in the Premier League and rarely looked in doubt as Palace, who are 11 points clear of the relegation zone, were unable to repeat their shock 3-2 victory at the Etihad in December. How City returned to the top of the table City controlled the game from the first whistle and should have taken the lead in the 10th minute when Sterling dragged a shot wide from eight yards out. Pep Guardiola had his head in his hands after Sterling's miss, but the England international soon made amends as he raced clear in the 15th minute and finished from Kevin De Bruyne's fine pass. Palace struggled to get out of their own half and Sergio Aguero shot wide before Vicente Guaita saved at the near post from Leroy Sane. City's best chance to extend their lead in the first half came in the 45th minute when Ilkay Gundogan's chipped pass into the box fell to De Bruyne and he fired at Guaita from close range. Kevin De Bruyne assisted two goals for City There was no respite from City after the break and it looked like they had put the result beyond doubt when they scored a second in the 63rd minute, with Sane driving across goal and Sterling finishing from 10 yards out. However, Milivojevic set up a tense finish when he fired in a low free-kick from the edge of the box. Team news Palace made two changes from their win at Newcastle as Scott Dann replaced the injured James Tomkins in defence and Christian Benteke came in for Michy Batshuayi to make his first start since February 9. Benjamin Mendy returned from injury for City to make his first league appearance since November 11, replacing Fabian Delph at left-back.Leroy Sane, Kevin De Bruyne and Vincent Kompany also started, but Fernandinho missed out due to an injury described as “short term” by Pep Guardiola. Ederson might feel he should have done better with the free-kick, but City survived without any further scares, and Jesus added a third on the break in the 90th minute to wrap up the win. Opta stats Manchester City have won five away Premier League games against London sides this season, their highest ever number of victories in the capital within a single top-flight campaign. Crystal Palace have only won one of their last 13 Premier League games played on a Sunday (D3 L9), losing five of their last six such matches. Manchester City have scored 150 goals in all competitions this season, only the second time a top-flight side has managed that feat in all competitions in top-flight history, with Man City also doing so in 2013-14 (156 goals). Crystal Palace have lost 17 times in the Premier League this season, the joint-most defeats within a single campaign in the competition for a Roy Hogdson side alongside the 2011-12 season, whilst in charge of West Brom. Crystal Palace midfielder Luka Milivojevic is the first player this season to score both home and away in the Premier League against Manchester City. Sergio Agüero has failed to score in each of his six Premier League appearances at Selhurst Park (15 shots, 0 goals) - only at Anfield (7 apps) has the Argentine visited more often in the competition without finding the net. Raheem Sterling's brace for Manchester City was his first ever double away from home for the Citizens, last scoring more than once on the road in any club competition back in December 2014 for Liverpool against Bournemouth. Kevin De Bruyne's assist for Manchester City's opening goal was his first in the Premier League in 336 days, last doing so before today on the final day of the 2017-18 season against Southampton. Gabriel Jesus has scored 19 goals for Manchester City in all competitions this season, averaging a goal every 112 minutes. Only Sergio Aguero (a goal every 99 mins) is averaging a goal at a quicker rate than the Brazilian for the club this season. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"We gave it our best shot. I can't complain with the way the team tried hard to give Man City a good game and dent their progress but we weren't good enough to do that.\" 3:39 Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace gave it their best shot Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace gave it their best shot Pep Guardiola: \"We played December, January, February, every three days, why should we not trust these guys to do it again?

Premier League Mohamed Salah's goal-of-the-season contender secured a crucial 2-0 victory over Chelsea as Liverpool roared back to the top of the Premier League at a jubilant Anfield. Manchester City laid down the gauntlet to Liverpool with victory at Crystal Palace earlier on Super Sunday, but the Reds produced an emphatic response as Sadio Mane's header (51) and Salah's 25-yard thunderbolt (53) restored Jurgen Klopp's side's two-point lead over the champions. Eden Hazard had two chances to salvage something for Chelsea but was denied by the woodwork and Alisson in quick succession, as Maurizio Sarri's decision to start without a recognised striker backfired. The victory, Klopp's first at home over Chelsea on his 200th game in charge, leaves Liverpool two points clear at the top of the table having played a game more than City, and dents the fourth-placed Blues' hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.

Man of the Match: Jordan Henderson How Reds responded on emotional day Anfield fell silent ahead of kick-off as Liverpool remembered the 96 victims of the Hillsborough 30 years on from the disaster, and the hosts responded to the emotionally-charged atmosphere with a dominant opening spell. Liverpool players observed a minute's silence before the match Salah's first-time volley from Mane's left-wing cross nearly sealed the perfect start inside six minutes, but Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was right behind the effort. After Salah saw appeals for a penalty turned down following a collision with David Luiz on 14 minutes, Hazard registered Chelsea's first attempt on target, jinking away from Joel Matip before unleashing a low shot which Alisson saved comfortably. Luiz deflected a goal-bound Jordan Henderson shot over on 26 minutes after Salah's cushioned header presented the Liverpool skipper with a sight of goal. Anfield then breathed a collective sigh of relief on half hour as Willian sliced a shot wide from the edge of the area after an instinctive David Luiz long passed released the winger in behind the advanced Liverpool defence. Sadio Mane celebrates scoring for Liverpool against Chelsea Mane uncharacteristically curled wide from 18 yards after Salah's cutback found him in space in the area six minutes before the interval, but the breakthrough came on 51 minutes as Henderson's floated ball to the back post found the Senegal international, and he stooped to head the opener beyond the despairing dive of Kepa. But the best was yet to come. Salah cut in off the right and unleashed an unstoppable drive across the Chelsea 'keeper into the top left-hand corner, sparking pandemonium inside Anfield. 1 - Mohamed Salah's strike was his first goal from outside the box in the Premier League since January 2018 (v Manchester City). Laser. #LIVCHE pic.twitter.com/ZCNwreFZfB — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 14, 2019 A shell-shocked Chelsea nearly got back into the game with two chances on the hour, but Hazard fired against the post after racing onto ball over the top before the Belgian was thwarted by Alisson at point-blank range after he turned Willian's cross on target. But Liverpool regained control of their emotions and saw out a sensational victory that may have just swung the momentum in the title race in their favour. Opta stats Chelsea have lost their last six away Premier League matches against fellow 'big six' opponents, conceding 16 goals across those defeats. This was Liverpool's 26th Premier League victory of the season, equalling their record from the 2013-14 campaign under Brendan Rodgers. They last won more in a top-flight season in 1978-79 (30 wins). Sadio Mane has scored 21 goals in all competitions this season - his best tally in a season for an English side. Aged 18 years and 158 days, Callum Hudson-Odoi became the youngest Chelsea player to start three consecutive Premier League games. Since the start of last season, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has scored more goals in all competitions than any other Premier League player (66).

We tried, created, passed and shot - we did pretty much everything. Salah's goal was brilliant, world-class. A really, really, good goal from our side. It was a brilliant goal in all departments.\" 3:44 Speaking after Chelsea’s 2-0 defeat to Liverpool, Maurizio Sarri said he and his players will continue to fight for a place in the top four of the Premier League.

Tottenham's new stadium as Spurs reclaimed third spot in the Premier League for 24 hours at least with a comprehensive 4-0 victory over Huddersfield. With Harry Kane injured and Heung-Min Son rested ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Manchester City, Mauricio Pochettino made seven changes, challenging his fringe players to maintain Spurs' top-four challenge. And Moura delivered, scoring his first in devastating fashion after Victor Wanyama's opener, before completing his treble with clincal strikes in the final three minutes. Relegated Huddersfield mounted a rally before Moura's late double as Juninho Bacuna's free-kick was tipped onto the crossbar by Hugo Lloris, but Spurs' victory was never in doubt as they moved a point and place above Chelsea ahead of the Blues' trip to Liverpool on Super Sunday. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Walker-Peters (7), Sanchez (7), Vertonghen (7), Foyth (7), Davies (6), Sissoko (8), Wanyama (8), Eriksen (8), Moura (9), Llorente (7). Subs: Skipp (6), Rose (n/a), Son (n/a), Huddersfield: Hamer (5), Hadergjonaj (6), Kongolo (6), Schindler (5), Durm (5), Bacuna (6), Stankovic (5), Hogg (5), Lowe (4), Grant (6), Kachunga (5). Subs: Mooy (5), Mounie (5), Williams (n/a). Man of the Match: Lucas Moura. An unnecessary sense of anxiety was generated inside Spurs' new stadium as they failed to convert their early dominance into goals - but two strikes in 144 seconds lifted the mood in an instant. Fernando Llorente had a hand in the opener, occupying two Huddersfield defenders and flicking the ball into the path of Wanyama, who showed great footwork to round Ben Hamer and convert his first goal of the season. Victor Wanyama takes the ball around Ben Hamer to make it 1-0 One quickly became two as Moussa Sissoko burst forward into space vacated by the stretched Huddersfield defence, chipped the ball through to Moura and the Brazilian fired Spurs' second with a devastating finish. Llorente glanced a header inches wide on 39 minutes and came even closer to adding a third in the early stages of the second half when he spun in behind the Huddersfield defence, plucked Juan Foyth's long ball and sent a volley crashing against the crossbar. Team news Heung-min Son dropped to the bench as Spurs made seven changes following the midweek Champions League win over Manchester City. Walker-Peters, Sanchez, Foyth, Davies, Wanyama, Moura and Llorente were all recalled. Huddersfield made three changes as Hadergjonaj, Bacuna and Kachunga replaced Smith, Mooy and Pritchard. Llorente saw another header drift wide on 65 minutes before Karlan Grant, after being released in behind the Spurs defence, failed to find a way past Lloris with Huddersfield's first chance of the game. Llorente was denied from getting in on the act by a brilliantly-timed block from Terence Kongolo on 71 minutes before Steve Mounie headed wide after being left unmarked in the Spurs area. Moura celebrates with Danny Rose after scoring the second of his three goals Bacuna looked to have pulled one back 10 minutes from time with a curling free-kick but Spurs captain Lloris diverted it onto the woodwork, laying the foundations for Moura to have the final word. The Brazilian stroked home his second on the counter after Christian Eriksen found him in space on the edge of the area on 87 minutes, and he saved the best until last, thundering his third in stoppage-time as Spurs issued a statement of intent ahead of their two trips to Manchester. 1:40 Lucas Moura celebrated his hat-trick by bringing his son onto the pitch at full time Lucas Moura celebrated his hat-trick by bringing his son onto the pitch at full time Opta stats Tottenham have won their first four Premier League games against Huddersfield without conceding a goal, something they had only previously done against Cardiff. Huddersfield have lost 26 of their 34 games in the Premier League this season, the joint-most defeats at this stage of the season in the competition (level with Sunderland in 2005-06). Tottenham have won all five of their Premier League games this season without Harry Kane. There were just 144 seconds between Tottenham's first and second goals against Huddersfield Town. With seven goals and five assists in 853 minutes of action, Tottenham's Fernando Llorente has registered the best minutes per goal involvement rate of any Tottenham player this season in all competitions (71.1). Huddersfield's Ben Hamer has conceded 21 goals in seven Premier League appearances this season, at a rate of one every 26.3 minutes, the worst rate of any 'keeper this season to play more than one game. The managers 5:41 Mauricio Pochettino praised his Tottenham side's professionalism Mauricio Pochettino praised his Tottenham side's professionalism Mauricio Pochettino: \"Rather than rest players, it was about providing the team with fresh legs because the effort was big against City. Everyone will have an opinion but after the game we can say it was a right decision.\" 2:45 Huddersfield Town manager Jan Siewert says 4-0 did not reflect their performance Huddersfield Town manager Jan Siewert says 4-0 did not reflect their performance Jan Siewert: \"In the end it was hard for us to take that we conceded another two goals. The result does not reflect it. We had our chances and should have scored twice, this makes me proud, but at the end of the day I do not like the result.\" Poch on injuries Ahead of Spurs crucial Champions League quarter-final second leg on Wednesday against Man City, Pochettino gave an update on both Harry Winks and Dele Alli. On Harry Winks: \"It was the same as the past. He was training yesterday and in the middle of training he started to feel [his groin]. It's a similar situation. We are optimistic. On Dele Alli: \"We'll see. He's doing some training sessions with the protection. He needs to feel comfortable. It all depends on the time.\" Redknapp: It couldn't have gone better Sky Sports' Jamie Redknapp says the atmosphere at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has lifted the club, and praised a perfect performance on Saturday with more huge games to come... Tottenham's remaining games this season \"Pochettino will be delighted. It couldn't have gone any better. However you look at it, Spurs were having a difficult spell, and now they've come here, the whole place is lifted. \"You can feel it, there's a special atmosphere already and the fans feel happy. Sometimes when you move to a new stadium it doesn't feel completely right, but the atmosphere feels right here and it feels like the old White Hart Lane. The way they've done the stadium is spot on. \"It was a perfect performance in many ways, explosive in the right times, and they needed Moura to make an impact like he did. It's a lovely [selection] problem, a problem you want.\" Man of the Match - Lucas Moura There were stand-out performances all over the pitch from a Spurs perspective, but this day belonged to Lucas Moura. His finishes got better and better each time he found the back of the net, capping a fine Spurs performance with his first hat-trick in European football. What's next?

Brighton’s relegation fears intensified after a dismal 5-0 defeat to Bournemouth as Anthony Knockaert saw red on Saturday. Bournemouth were booed off by their home supporters in their recent 3-1 defeat by Burnley, but were already 2-0 up courtesy of Dan Gosling (33) and Ryan Fraser (54) when Knockaert was given his marching orders for a wild lunge on Adam Smith. From then on, Eddie Howe's men were rampant on the break, and David Brooks (74), Callum Wilson (82) and Junior Stanislas (90+2) made it an embarrassing day for Chris Hughton. Brighton remain five points above the drop zone, but welcome Cardiff City to the AMEX on Tuesday night and still have to play Tottenham, Arsenal, and Manchester City this season. Player Ratings Brighton: Ryan (5), Duffy (5), Dunk (4), Montoya (5), Bernardo (5), Stephens (4), Knockaert (3), Propper (5), Bissouma (6), Locadia (4), Andone (4) Subs: Murray (5) Bournemouth: Boruc (7), Cook (8), Mepham (8), Ake (7), Smith (7), Brooks (8), Lerma (7), Gosling (8), Fraser (8), Wilson (8), King (7) Subs: Stanislas (7), Solanke (7), Simpson (N/A) Man of the match: Ryan Fraser How Brighton's day of misery unfolded Steve Cook - returning from two months off for the Cherries with a serious groin infection that almost cost him his career - made a sensational headed clearance to deny Shane Duffy at the back post in a nervy opening quarter. That was as good as it got for Brighton. The first goal was always going to be key in terms of confidence, and Bournemouth got it on 33 minutes when Gosling linked with Brooks and Wilson before sliding home - unchallenged - from 10 yards. Team news Glenn Murray and Alireza Jahanbakhsh dropped out and were replaced by Jurgen Locadia and Florin Andone. Meanwhile, Eddie Howe switched his goalkeepers with Artur Boruc getting the nod. Steve Cook returned from injury. Brighton struggled to find any attacking flow, but the same couldn't be said for the visitors, who were classy and clinical on the break. It was 2-0 on 54 minutes. King raced clear and his pass was lobbed over Mat Ryan by Fraser. Any hope of a comeback - that didn't look likely anyway - was dealt a huge blow when Knockaert lost his head. The Brighton winger, who cut a frustrated figure all afternoon, decided to lunge in as Smith knocked the ball away from his own box. It was high, late and completely reckless. A red card followed. From that moment on, Bournemouth became devastating on the attack as Brighton were pinned back. Brooks made it 3-0 after liking with King and finishing into the bottom corner before Fraser then fed Wilson, who put another one past the helpless Ryan. A fifth looked on the cards, and Stanislas delivered the final nail in Brighton's coffin in injury time. Man of the match: Ryan Fraser This was a tough one as all of Bournemouth's attacking players were on their game, especially when Brighton went down to 10-men. Fraser made four key passes and two of those ended with goals. 🅰 Most PL assists this season 1️⃣2️⃣ C. Eriksen 1️⃣2️⃣ R. FRASER 1️⃣2️⃣ E. Hazard 9️⃣ P. Pogba 9️⃣ A. Robertson 9️⃣ L. Sane 9️⃣ R.

But there was considerable controversy surrounding the result with Cardiff twice denied after strong penalty appeals - with referee Mike Dean originally pointing to the spot after Cardiff's first appeal only to then reverse his decision. Wood broke the deadlock in the first half after nodding past Neil Etheridge from a corner in the 31st minute. Ben Mee appeared to handle the ball in his box Cardiff thought they were awarded a penalty shortly after the break when Dean pointed to the spot for a Ben Mee handball, but the referee changed his mind. And although Cardiff pushed for an equaliser, Burnley sealed the victory in injury-time when Wood headed in from point-blank range following a fine run by Dwight McNeil. Player ratings Burnley: Heaton (6), Lowton (6), Tarkowski (6), Mee (6), Taylor (6), Hendrick (6), Cork (6), Westwood (6), McNeil (8), Wood (9), Barnes (7) Cardiff: Etheridge (8), Peltier (4), Morrison (6), Manga (5), Bennett (5), Gunnarsson (5), Arter (6), Camarasa (6), Hoilett (6), J Murphy (6), Zohore (7) Subs: Mendez-Laing (6), Niasse (N/A), Reid (N/A) Man of the match: Chris Wood The result means Burnley have all-but secured their Premier League status for another season in 14th. For Cardiff in 18th, their third Premier League loss in a row means they remain five points off safety with five games left to play ahead of their trip to Brighton on Tuesday. How Cardiff's painful defeat unfolded After a fast start, with early warning shots from both sides, Burnley had their first clear opportunity to break the deadlock in the 26th minute when a low strike from an unmarked Ashley Westwood was hit straight at Etheridge. Wood celebrates with team-mate Ashley Westwood after scoring Burnley's opening goal Five minutes later and Burnley took the lead through Wood. McNeil's whipped corner - in the windy conditions - was met by the New Zealand international who directed his close-range header into the net. With ten minutes left of the half, Burnley could have gone two up through Westwood once again, but his low shot was expertly parried away by Etheridge. In the 47th minute Dean awarded Cardiff a penalty when Mee appeared to head the ball onto his own arm. But after consulting with linesman Darren Cann, Dean changed his mind to the disdain of Neil Warnock on the touchline. The decision fired the Cardiff players up and their biggest chance in the second half fell to an unmarked Junior Hoilett in the box in the 63rd minute, but he blasted his first-time shot over the bar. 5:41 Paul Merson analyses Cardiff's 2-0 defeat against Burnley, including the controversial decision by Mike Dean to overturn a penalty for Cardiff which left Neil Warnock fuming. Paul Merson analyses Cardiff's 2-0 defeat against Burnley, including the controversial decision by Mike Dean to overturn a penalty for Cardiff which left Neil Warnock fuming. Burnley fought back and Etheridge had to make a string of fine saves. First, he denied Wood from close range in the 74th minute, before he tipped Mee's header from a corner over the bar. Referee Dean waved away appeals for a late Cardiff penalty when Bruno Manga's scuffed appeared to hit James Tarkowski's arm in the 89th minute. And in injury-time Burnley doubled their advantage through Wood, who headed in from close range to capitalise on McNeil's brilliant run and cross down the left flank. Opta facts Burnley have won three consecutive top-flight games by a margin of two goals for the first time since October 1968 (a run of four). Cardiff have lost six of their last seven Premier League games (W1) after losing just three of the eight before that. Burnley have scored in 12 consecutive home league games for the first time since November 2013 (12 in total in that run). Cardiff have lost consecutive matches against Burnley for the first time since the 1999-00 campaign in the third tier. Burnley manager Sean Dyce has never lost against Neil Warnock, winning five of his six matches against the Cardiff boss (D1). Since the start of last season, Chris Wood has scored more Premier League goals for Burnley than any other player (20). Burnley's Chris Wood has been directly involved in four goals in his last two Premier League games (3 goals, 1 assist), as many as he managed in his previous 11. No player has been involved in more Premier League goals this season as a teenager than Burnley's Dwight McNeil (8 - 3 goals and 5 assists, level with Ryan Sessegnon).

Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock claimed he was disappointed that a penalty decision in their favour was reversed by Mike Dean in the Bluebirds 2-0 defeat to Burnley. Neil Warnock: \"I have no view at all [of Dean reversing his penalty decision] thanks. I've already seen the FA three times this week. \"I'm disappointed, I'll be asking the referee obviously. Mike says it hit his head first, I'm sure I'll get the right story from all three of them. We're disappointed Gunnarsson didn't get a penalty for being pulled down. He doesn't dive. Little bit unlucky today. \"There's still a chance. I might be smiling but I'm gutted underneath.\" 1:54 Burnley boss Sean Dyche says his players deserve a huge amount of credit for their 2-0 win against Cardiff and hailed their resilience. Burnley boss Sean Dyche says his players deserve a huge amount of credit for their 2-0 win against Cardiff and hailed their resilience. Sean Dyche: \"A massive result. A lot of noise about this game but going into it with two big wins then going on this run, 27 points from 15 games, is an unbelievable return. \"We made hard work of it because in the first half I thought we should have been out of sight.\" Man of the Match - Chris Wood Wood headed in from point-blank range Although there were fine individual performances from McNeil and Etheridge, the Burnley striker was ultimately the one who made the difference with his two goals. His hold-up play alongside Ashley Barnes also helped significantly to reduce the pressure on the Burnley backline when Cardiff were pushing hard for an equaliser for the majority of the second half.

Tom Cairney opened the scoring just 30 seconds into the second half with his first goal since the Sky Bet Championship play-off final against Aston Villa nearly 12 months ago. Ryan Babel then notched his fourth goal of the season (69) during a team performance that provided plenty of encouragement for the hosts heading into next season and belied Fulham's position as one of the two teams already relegated.

Subs: Walcott (n/a), Tosun (n/a), Lookman (n/a) Man of the match: Aleksandar Mitrovic. With Wolves beaten 3-1 at Southampton, Everton missed the chance to move seventh in the table, but an abject performance means they remain in ninth position, while Fulham - who kept just a third clean sheet of the season - stay 19th. How Fulham's bright start was rewarded In front of the watching Jose Mourinho, Fulham were the brighter side in the first half as Aleksandar Mitrovic tested Jordan Pickford on three occasions. The Serbian enjoyed his battle with Phil Jagielka, bullying the veteran centre-back off the ball after 12 minutes before forcing Pickford into a save low down. The England No 1 had to be alert to tip his header over from Ryan Babel's corner 10 minutes later, but Pickford was rooted to the spot three minutes before the break when Mitrovic took Calum Chambers' pass and curled a brilliant shot that clipped the top of the crossbar. Cairney tucks in the opener after 46 minutes Team news Timothy Fosu-Mensah earned a recall in place of Cyrus Christie at right-back for Fulham as Parker made one change to the side that was beaten 4-1 at Watford. Sixteen-year-old Harvey Elliott was named among the substitutes. Marco Silva named an unchanged side as Michael Keane was made to settle for a place on the substitutes' bench, with Phil Jagielka retaining his place in the side following his goal against Arsenal. Everton had offered very little going forward in the opening 45 minutes, coming closest to edging in front against the run of play on the stroke of half-time when Dominic Calvert-Lewin was just unable to meet Seamus Coleman's cross from the right at full stretch. What would VAR have changed? This wasn't Andre Gomes' type of game, and his frustrations boiled over in second-half stoppage time when he caught Mitrovic with his studs after the ball had gone. Referee Lee Probert appeared to miss the incident, so he may face retrospective action. The Portuguese would surely have walked had VAR been in use this season. Marco Silva ordered his players out early for the second half, but Fulham's show of spirit was instantly rewarded. Babel played a one-two with Mitrovic before putting the ball on a plate for Cairney to slide his first-time shot to Pickford's right. It was his first Premier League goal since scoring for Hull against Everton nine years ago in a 5-1 defeat at Goodison Park. Dominic Calvert-Lewin had a glorious chance to level for Everton The omens were good for Scott Parker's side by this stage, as Everton hadn't won a game this season after conceding the first goal. However, they ought to have levelled when Calvert-Lewin met Gylfi Sigurdsson's pass just shy of the hour-mark, but he could only dink his shot wide via the base of Sergio Rico's left-hand post. In the end, it fell to former Liverpool winger Babel to show him the necessary composure to seal the victory for the Whites. He took Mitrovic's cushioned lay-off to escape Coleman down the left and delicately lifted the ball over Pickford on a day when the waft of European football escaped Everton almost as soon as it had arrived. The managers Scott Parker: \"I thought to a man, the team were fantastic. We've had a long period to work for today, and we realise what we're playing for. \"We had the disappointment of Watford and of relegation, but we had a duty to the fans and to ourselves. The spotlight has been on us, because people will be judging us even after being relegated, but we didn't down tools. \"The finger is constantly being pointed. I asked questions of the team, and the players showed that they're not yet on the beach.\" 3:47 Scott Parker praised how Fulham performed in the win over Everton and claimed his side have a duty to perform for the fans despite already being relegated Scott Parker praised how Fulham performed in the win over Everton and claimed his side have a duty to perform for the fans despite already being relegated Marco Silva: \"It was a disappointing result and a disappointing performance. I didn't expect this because we've been on a good run, and we've been in good confidence also. We knew it would be difficult playing here. \"Fulham played with character to achieve something for them, and they were more aggressive and faster than us. We didn't perform in the way we needed to in order to win the match.\" 2:37 Marco Silva claims he was surprised by Everton's poor performance in the 2-0 defeat to Fulham after they had been on a good run of results Marco Silva claims he was surprised by Everton's poor performance in the 2-0 defeat to Fulham after they had been on a good run of results Man of the match - Aleksandar Mitrovic Silva opted to stick with Phil Jagielka following his goalscoring heroics against Arsenal. But the Everton stalwart will have sleepless nights after being bullied by Mitrovic for 90 minutes on the Thames. Michael Keane, who was replaced last week by Jagielka when he fell ill, would have relished the aerial battle with the Serbian, who was denied twice by Pickford before seeing his fierce shot graze the crossbar. Aleksandar Mitrovic was a constant thorn in the Everton defence Fulham's immediate concern now will be losing their talisman following his return to form with relegation already confirmed. He showed why he should remain a Premier League player as tidy interplay with Babel led to Cairney's opener before he provided the Dutchman with his clincher. Opta stats Fulham recorded their first Premier League win in 10 games, having lost each of the previous nine fixtures. All five of Fulham's Premier League victories this season have come at Craven Cottage, with this their first since beating Brighton in January. Everton lost an away Premier League game against newly promoted opposition for the first time since a 1-2 defeat vs Burnley in October 2016 (W3 D4 before today). Everton have won just one of their last 12 Premier League away games in London (D3 L8). Fulham's Tom Cairney scored his first Premier League goal since netting versus Everton in March 2010 for Hull - 3324 days ago. Since his debut in January, Ryan Babel has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Fulham player (4 goals, 3 assists). In his 103rd appearance in the competition, Ryan Babel both scored and assisted in a Premier League match for the very first time. What's next? Fulham travel to face Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium next Saturday (3pm kick-off). Everton host Manchester United at Goodison Park next weekend, live on Super Sunday (1.30pm kick-off)."},{"date": "13/04/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31708, "home_team": {"name":

Redmond scored twice as Southampton moved eight points clear of the Premier League relegation zone with a 3-1 victory over Wolves.

Wolves remain eighth in the table after failing to bounce back from their painful FA Cup semi-final defeat to Watford. Nuno Espirito Santo's side lacked a cutting edge throughout, with only two of their 17 shots on target, and struggled to contain Southampton when they broke forward. Nathan Redmond lifts the ball over Rui Patricio to make it 2-0 How the Saints' critical victory unfolded Southampton were quickly out of the blocks and took the lead in the second minute as Josh Sims, making his first Premier League start of the season, drove down the right and crossed for Redmond to finish. Wolves went close to a response as Leander Dendoncker headed over from a free-kick and Raul Jimenez saw a low shot saved by Angus Gunn. The equaliser arrived in the 28th minute when Boly attacked a corner and headed into the net. But Saints quickly restored their lead as Sims slipped a pass through for Redmond and he coolly dinked over goalkeeper Rui Patricio as he went to ground. Saints could have scored more as Sims twice missed the target from excellent positions inside the box. Wolves improved after the break and Jota slashed a shot wide from the penalty spot before Jimenez blazed a volley over the bar from 12 yards out. Team news Southampton made two changes as Danny Ings and Josh Sims replaced Shane Long and Oriol Romeu. Rui Patricio returned in goal for Wolves to replace John Ruddy. But the home side got a third when Long flicked past Patricio following excellent recovery work from Maya Yoshida, who passed through to the striker after seeing an overhead kick blocked from a corner. Yoshida almost scored himself shortly afterwards when he was denied at close range by Patricio, and Saints comfortably held out to move a step closer to survival. Opta stats Southampton have won eight of their 18 Premier League games under Ralph Hassenhuttl, as many as they'd won in 52 games under their two previous permanent managers combined (Mark Hughes 3/22, Mauricio Pellegrino 5/30). Wolves are winless in their last five Premier League away games (D2 L3), and have lost back-to-back league games on the road for the first time this season. Southampton have won six of their 13 Premier League games so far in 2019, as many as they'd won in the whole of 2018 (P37 W6 D13 L18). Wolves haven't kept a clean sheet in any of their last 13 Premier League away games - only Arsenal (15) have had, and are currently enduring, a longer such run in the competition this season. Nathan Redmond's opener after 01:34 was Southampton's quickest in a Premier League game since December 2016, when Virgil van Dijk netted after 01:09 against Tottenham. There were just 118 seconds between Willy Boly's equaliser for Wolves and Nathan Redmond restoring Southampton's lead. Southampton's Nathan Redmond scored just his second Premier League brace, and his first since March 2017 against Watford. Southampton's Shane Long has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since May 2016. Man of the match - Nathan Redmond Redmond has been transformed since Ralph Hasenhuttl arrived at the club, and this was another impressive display. He produced composed finishes for both of his goals and remained a threat in the second half as Saints sat deeper and looked to hit on the counter. What's next? Southampton travel to Newcastle next Saturday before going to Watford on Tuesday, April 23. Wolves have back-to-back home games as they host Brighton on Saturday, April 20 and then face Arsenal on Wednesday, April 24."},{"date": "13/04/2019", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74478,

Manchester United as they beat West Ham 2-1 in the Premier League, going above Arsenal into fifth. The first half was defined by contentious refereeing decisions, with Felipe Anderson's 10th-minute goal incorrectly ruled out for offside before Man Utd were awarded a questionable penalty not long after, which Pogba converted (17). Anderson deservedly got West Ham back on level terms four minutes after the break, before Ryan Fredericks brought down Anthony Martial in the 79th minute for United's second penalty of the game, which Pogba also powered home. The win sees Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side go above Arsenal into fifth spot, with the Gunners playing Watford on Monday Night Football, while West Ham have lost their third successive Premier League game and remain in 11th. Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Jones (7), Smalling (7), Rojo (6), Dalot (6), Fred (6), Pogba (8), Mata (6), Lingard (6), Martial (7), Lukaku (7). Subs used: Rashford (7), Pereira (6), Greenwood (5). West Ham: Fabianski (6), Balbuena (6), Zabaleta (6), Ogbonna (7), Masuaku (7), Noble (6), Rice (7), Lanzini (6), Snodgrass (7), Anderson (7), Hernandez (7). Subs used: Diangana (5), Antonio (7), Fredericks (5). Man of the match: Paul Pogba. How United rode their luck West Ham should have gone ahead inside ten minutes. Arthur Masuaku's cross was nodded down by Javier Hernandez, allowing Anderson to hook home from close range. However, the offside flag was raised and the goal was ruled out, but replays showed Anderson was being played onside by Diogo Dalot and it should have stood. Seven minutes later, and it was another slice of bad luck for West Ham as Robert Snodgrass was penalised for a foul on Juan Mata just inside the area, coming in for a loose ball alongside the Man Utd midfielder, although there looked to be little contact. Team news Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made five changes from the midweek loss to Barcelona. Luke Shaw, Ashley Young, Victor Lindelof, Scott McTominay and Marcus Rashford dropped out with Phil Jones, Juan Mata, Anthony Martial, Marcos Rojo and Jesse Lingard coming into the XI. West Ham made three changes, bringing in Pablo Zabaleta, Robert Snodgrass and Arthur Masuaku for Ryan Fredericks, Aaron Cresswell and Marko Arnautovic. But referee Graham Scott emphatically pointed to the spot and Pogba hammered it home without any of the run-up theatrics we have seen previously this season. Both sides had half-chances to score the next goal, and Anderson went close again on the stroke of half-time. He nipped past Fred on the right-hand side before cutting into the area and trying to score on the angle. However, David de Gea was there to save with his feet and see United go into the break in front. 7 - Only Ruud van Nistelrooy (8 in 2002-03) has scored more penalties in a single Premier League campaign for Man Utd than Paul Pogba (7) this season. Slotted. #MUNWHU pic.twitter.com/kSEfOsjB5t — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) April 13, 2019 Anderson finally got his goal four minutes into the second half. West Ham were gifted possession by a poor throw from De Gea, with Manuel Lanzini eventually tricking his way past the Man Utd defence before chipping the ball to the back post. Anderson was there to nod it home, with De Gea seeing the effort slip through his fingers as he was unable to keep it out. It was an even encounter throughout as both sides continued to seek their first win in two games in all competitions, and Michail Antonio had an instant impact when he came on in the 75th minute. He drove towards goal, shaking off Fred before hammering an effort off the crossbar and forced a leaping, close-range save from De Gea with a bullet header not long after. Felipe Anderson celebrates his equaliser after having an earlier goal incorrectly ruled out for offside But United's win was sealed in the 79th minute as Martial's driving run was halted by a tackle from Fredericks, with Graham Scott pointing to the spot for a second time - this time with little debate. Pogba stepped up again and powered home another penalty to give his side a confidence boost ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second leg against Barcelona on Tuesday. What would VAR have changed? Probably quite a bit. Felipe Anderson would have had his early goal given and Man Utd’s first penalty would not have been awarded – and who knows how that would have changed the game. Opta stats Manchester United are unbeaten in 14 Premier League home games (W9 D5) since a 0-3 loss against Spurs in August. Only Liverpool (37) and Arsenal (16) are currently on longer unbeaten runs at home in the competition. West Ham are winless in their last eight Premier League away games (D1 L7), losing the last four in a row. Manchester United have won a league-high 12 Premier League penalties this season. Indeed, it's also the most the Red Devils have ever taken in a single campaign in the competition. West Ham had 18 shots in this match, their most in a Premier League away game since December 2016 (24 vs Leicester). Felipe Anderson scored his first Premier League goal in 14 games, becoming the first West Ham player to score home and away against Man Utd in the same league season since Jermain Defoe in 2001-02. The managers Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"We were lucky to get away with the three points, even a draw at one point we would have taken. Luckily it wasn't Barcelona on the other side, but West Ham played well, played better than us, created chances. \"When you have three games in six days, it is physically tough. But we are looking forward to it, and I feel good about the players for Tuesday, because we cannot get much worse than today.\" Manuel Pellegrini: \"I'm frustrated, of course, because I think we deserved more than this score, but football is not always won by the team that plays better. I think that for me it was a pleasure to see the team play in the manner they did against Manchester United in their own stadium. \"I always say I prefer to play not so well and win the game, but for me it was a pleasure to see the team playing with the personality and mentality of the big team.\" Man of the match - Paul Pogba Pogba makes it 1-0 from the penalty spot It is hard to look past the cool character that was Pogba on Saturday. It is a big ask to step up and take one penalty, let alone two, in front of the Manchester United fans with a top-four race, Champions League and a dip in recent form resting on his shoulders. But he finished clinically and with confidence, adding to his solidity in midfield for Solskjaer's once again as he continues to flourish under the new manager. What's next? It's a big one for Manchester United on Tuesday - heading to the Nou Camp to play Barcelona in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final, in which they trail 1-0. They will then play Everton in the Premier League next Sunday, live on Sky Sports. For West Ham, they will host Leicester next Saturday."},{"date": "12/04/2019", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32108, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name":

Leicester to move 10 points clear of the relegation zone Newcastle halted Leicester's resurgence under Brendan Rodgers and eased any relegation worries with a deserved 1-0 victory on Friday Night Football. The Foxes were looking for a fifth Premier League win in a row but were subdued by Rafa Benitez's well-organised side, who are now 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Ayoze Perez scored the winner in the 32nd minute when he headed in from Matt Ritchie's cross.

With four games left to play, victory should ensure Newcastle's safety in the Premier League for another season while Leicester could slip down to 10th if results go against them over the weekend. Jamie Vardy battles for possession The Foxes had been revitalised since Rodgers' arrival in late February but they were kept quiet by an excellent away performance from Newcastle. The visitors had the better of the first half and went close to taking the lead in the 15th minute when Salomon Rondon curled a free-kick against the bar from 25 yards out. Ben Chilwell tested Martin Dubravka with a low shot in the 22nd minute, but otherwise Leicester were sloppy in possession and created little against an organised defence. Newcastle celebrate taking the lead The visitors broke the deadlock when Ritchie swung in a cross from the left and Perez got ahead of Wes Morgan and headed past Kasper Schmeichel. Leicester struggled for a response and continued to be kept at bay by Newcastle after half-time. When the Foxes tried to raise the intensity they were almost caught on the counter as Perez swiped at a shot in the box and was then denied at close range by Schmeichel after jinking past Ben Chilwell. Team news Harry Maguire replaced Caglar Soyuncu at centre-back for Leicester while Javier Manquillo and Paul Dummett started for Newcastle in place of Florian Lejeune and DeAndre Yedlin. Leicester finally created a clear opening in the 80th minute when Youri Tielemans slid a pass through for Vardy, but he scooped the ball over the bar with only Dubravka to beat. That was to be Leicester's best chance of equalising as Newcastle held out for a vital victory. Opta stats Newcastle have won back-to-back league visits to Leicester in the top-flight for the first time since September 1959 under manager Charlie Mitten. This was Leicester City's eighth home league defeat of the campaign, their most in a Premier League season at the King Power Stadium since it opened in 2002. Only in 1994-95 (10) and 2001-02 (9) have they lost more home Premier League games in a single season. Newcastle have now picked up 16 points away from home in the Premier League this season (P17 W3 D7 L7), as many as they earned in the whole of the 2017-18 campaign on the road. Leicester City completed 649 passes in this match, their highest total in a Premier League game since 2003-04 (when Opta began recording this data); indeed, three of their four highest successful pass tallies in this time in the division have been recorded in their six fixtures under Brendan Rodgers. Ayoze Pérez has been directly involved in four of Newcastle's last six league goals (three goals, one assist), scoring three of their last five. Ayoze Pérez's opener for Newcastle was his seventh Premier League goal of the season, but the first to come away from home. Since his debut for Newcastle at the start of the 2016-17 Championship season, Matt Ritchie has assisted 17 league goals for the club, at least four more than any other player in that time. The managers Brendan Rodgers: \"It was interesting to watch the team because it is the first time I have really seen us in this type of game where we have to break them down, and I think it's an area where the team has struggled but hopefully in time we will get better at that. There are lots of things for us to work on and analyse and we will be better for it.\" 5:15 Brendan Rodgers admits his Leicester side didn't create enough chances Brendan Rodgers admits his Leicester side didn't create enough chances Rafa Benitez: \"It was massive for the team. You have to give credit to the players because we are working so hard. We were playing against a good team, with ability. We needed to do almost everything perfect and we were very close. We had two or three counter-attacks we could have done better but with this commitment from the players and from the fans it's easier.\" 5:41 Rafael Benitez says Newcastle have huge potential as a club, but they need to be 'more competitive' in the transfer window Rafael Benitez says Newcastle have huge potential as a club, but they need to be 'more competitive' in the transfer window Man of the match - Ayoze Perez As well as producing a fine finish to convert Ritchie's cross, Perez was a constant menace to Leicester's defence, particularly in the second half.

the season, to give Chelsea a vital 2-0 win over West Ham that moves them up to third in the Premier League. Hazard showed superb skill to get past three West Ham players before lashing home (24), and got another with a cute touch and finish late on (90) to wrap up the points. West Ham had their share of chances to equalise in the second half, but the result means Chelsea have a three-point cushion over Arsenal in fifth, although they have played a game more. West Ham stay 11th, five points off the top seven. 1:00 Take a look at Eden Hazard's stunning solo goal from Chelsea's 2-0 win over West Ham at Stamford Bridge. Take a look at Eden Hazard's stunning solo goal from Chelsea's 2-0 win over West Ham at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea dominated the ball in the opening period, but had to wait until the 24th minute to cut West Ham open thanks to some Hazard brilliance, hours after it was reported on Sky Sports News that Real Madrid were increasingly confident of signing the Belgian in the summer. Eden Hazard put Chelsea 1-0 up with one of the goals of the season Player ratings Chelsea: Kepa (7), Azpilicueta (7), Rudiger (8), Luiz (8), Emerson (6), Jorginho (6), Kante (7), Loftus-Cheek (7), Hudson-Odoi (7), Hazard (9), Higuain (7) Subs: Barkley (7), Giroud (NA), Pedro (NA) West Ham: Fabianski (6), Fredericks (6), Balbuena (5), Ogbonna (5), Cresswell (5), Noble (6), Rice (5), Anderson (5), Arnautovic (5), Lanzini (5), Chicharito (4) Subs: Snodgrass (6), Obiang (5) Man of the match: Eden Hazard Picking up the ball on the turn 45 yards out, Hazard took on Mark Noble and slalomed past Angelo Ogbonna and Fabian Balbuena with a fine piece of skill before poking past Lukasz Fabianski with his left foot from 15 yards. Moments later, Hazard nearly set up Gonzalo Higuain for a second as the Argentinian hit the post from an angle, and he was then denied by Ryan Fredericks' superb block after the striker had controlled and shot from close range. Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi started for the second straight game in the Premier league Hazard was running the show, and had a strong appeal for a penalty turned down after Marko Arnautovic looked to have barged him to the ground. Team news Hudson-Odoi retained his place in the Chelsea starting line-up, only his second Premier League start for the club. Loftus-Cheek also started again, just his third in the top flight this season, while Chelsea made tow changes. Rudiger came in for Christensen, and Higuain replaced Olivier Giroud, who was on the bench. West Ham made five changes after the 2-0 defeat by Everton last weekend. Pablo Zabaleta, Issa Diop, Robert Snodgrass, Pedro Obiang and Lucas Perez came out, replaced by Ryan Fredericks, Fabian Balbuena, Felipe Anderson, Chicharito and Mark Noble, who missed the last game due to the death of his grandmother. The game opened up after the break as Manuel Lanzini forced a smart save from Kepa Arrizabalaga, while Aaron Cresswell struck just wide from range on the half volley with West Ham pushing hard for a leveller. Hazard celebrates with team-mates after scoring his superb solo goal Barkley was then inches away from converting Callum Hudson-Odoi's centre across the face of goal, and at the other end Emerson produced a vital block as Arnautovic looked to head home sub Robert Snodgrass' wicked cross. It was not entirely comfortable for Chelsea, but they got their two-goal cushion in the last minute as Hazard took down Barkley's cross 10 yards out, before finding the bottom left corner past Fabianski on the half volley. Hazard is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring his second goal The managers Maurizio Sarri: \"When Hazard is able to play like this in matches, we're very lucky as it's easy to win the match. He's able to make the difference. 4:00 Maurizio Sarri: £100m not enough for Hazard Maurizio Sarri: £100m not enough for Hazard \"[£100m] is too cheap in this market. I have no idea but we have seen it's very hard to change Hazard with another player.\" Manuel Pellegrini: \"When a player with the quality of Eden Hazard, you know he can make different things. Going through four players is not easy. But we could have done better in the way we defended that goal and our play. \"We changed things and we had a chance to draw.

West Ham have scored just one goal in their last seven away Premier League games (D1 L6), a Mark Noble penalty in a 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace. Chelsea have lost just one of their last 20 home Premier League matches (W12 D7 L1), a 0-1 defeat to Leicester City in December 2018. Hazard has scored 19 goals in all competitions in 2018/19 - his joint-best tally in a season for Chelsea (level with 2014/15). 3:13 Following Hazard's beautiful solo goal against West Ham, the MNF team look back at some of his best goals for Chelsea in the Premier League Following Hazard's beautiful solo goal against West Ham, the MNF team look back at some of his best goals for Chelsea in the Premier League Hazard has been directly involved in 11 goals in his last 10 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge (6 goals, 5 assists).

On the day his future was questioned again, the Belgian completely ran the show. \"Hazard is too good for Chelsea\" 😬@GNev2 and @Carra23 reflect on Eden Hazard's display v West Ham.

His low centre of gravity will be giving West Ham's defence nightmares for a few weeks. He is so, so good. \"You feel sad in some ways that there is so much talk of Real Madrid,\" said Gary Neville on MNF after the game. \"If this is his last five league games, it's a real problem for the Premier League. Man of the match vote, anyone? 😉#CHEWHU — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) April 8, 2019 Carra: Hazard too good for Chelsea Jamie Carragher has compared Chelsea's fight to retain Eden Hazard to when Barcelona came calling for Luis Suarez. \"I don't think you can ever stop players moving to Real Madrid and Barcelona. I think most players see that as the pinnacle, and it's happened at both Manchester United and Liverpool. \"It's sad as I love watching him week in, week out.

potentially crucial blow in the race for the top four as they were beaten 1-0 at Everton on Super Sunday. Phil Jagielka was a late addition to the starting XI after Michael Keane was taken ill just before kick-off and proved to be the match winner when he tapped home inside 10 minutes. Arsenal improved briefly in the second half with Aaron Ramsey and Henrikh Mkhitaryan going close, but they were unable to take anything from the first of six remaining away games this season. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Jagielka (8), Zouma (7), Digne (7), Coleman (7), Gomes (7), Sigurdsson (7), Gueye (8), Bernard (8), Calvert-Lewin (8), Richarlison (7).

Subs used: Ramsey (6), Aubameyang (4), Iwobi (6). Man of the match: Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The Gunners stay fourth, but missed the chance to leapfrog their rivals Tottenham into third place, and remain on 63 points with Chelsea, who play West Ham on Monday Night Football. Everton moved up one place to ninth with victory. Everton had won their previous two Premier League games and their confidence showed when they took an early lead. Jagielka made the initial flick on from a long throw, allowing Dominic Calvert-Lewin to nod the ball goalwards. Sead Kolasinac blocked the effort but could not stop the ball falling kindly for Jagielka, who tapped home his first league goal in two years. Team news Unai Emery named Mesut Ozil as his captain and made two changes to his XI. Aaron Ramsey and Alex Iwobi started on bench with Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Sead Kolasinac coming in. Everton had named an unchanged squad but 15 minutes before kick-off, Michael Keane was taken ill and replaced by Phil Jagielka. James McCarthy came in on the substitutes bench. Much of the first half was littered with fouls and free kicks, and there was a costly booking from Arsenal in the 25th minute, with Sokratis Papastathopoulous shown his tenth yellow card of the season for a block on Calvert-Lewin, and he will now miss the next two Premier League games against Watford and Crystal Palace. While chances were at a premium, Everton did push for a second as the half came to a close. Gylfi Sigurdsson tried his luck from range, but did not have enough to beat Bernd Leno, before Richarlison's attempted cross was strongly put behind by Sokratis.

Jordan Pickford punched away an initial header from Ramsey, but he could only loop his rebounded volley over the crossbar. Mkhitaryan had a quiet game but was inches away from getting Arsenal level with 20 minutes to play, sending the ball just past the post, before Everton twice went close. Sigurdsson could only direct a powerful, low strike into the hands of Leno before Richarlison sliced wide on a tight angle. Aaron Ramsey in action for Arsenal against Everton The intensity of the game reached boiling point in the 82nd minute as Shokdran Mustafi caught Calvert-Lewin with a foot, sending the England U21 striker rolling to the floor. It happened right by the technical areas which led to a confrontation between the two dugouts and a launched coat from Mesut Ozil on the bench. But Calvert-Lewin was soon back on his feet and Mustafi into the book a Everton saw the game out for their third successive Premier League win.

Aged 36 years and 233 days, Everton defender Phil Jagielka became the oldest player to score a Premier League goal this season. Arsenal are one of only two teams in the top four tiers of English league football this season without an away clean sheet this season, along with Championship side Ipswich Town. Everton's Gylfi Sigurdsson attempted seven shots in this match - as many as the entire Arsenal team combined. Everton have won their last two Premier League games against 'big six' opponents - as many as in their previous 41 league games against them (W2 D14 L25). The managers Marco Silva: \"Congratulations to our players, our fans in our stadium, we fully deserve three points. To play efficient football, to be creative, to create chances to score, we have to be solid as a team. We didn't give them many chances to create problems. The win is fair, but in my opinion more fair with more goals.\" 2:05 Marco Silva says team spirit was key in Everton's 1-0 victory over Arsenal at Goodison Park on Sunday Marco Silva says team spirit was key in Everton's 1-0 victory over Arsenal at Goodison Park on Sunday Unai Emery: \"Today, there were two different halves. In the first half, we were consistent, we didn't concede good chances for them but they scored from one throw in, unfortunately for us, and in the attacking third, we needed more. \"But if the result was like we deserved in the first half - equal - we can continue like that in the second half and use the moment to take a better result and better chances in the attacking third. 3:07 Unai Emery said Arsenal's attack improved in the second half at Goodison Park, but their defence worsened Unai Emery said Arsenal's attack improved in the second half at Goodison Park, but their defence worsened \"But with the half-time result, we needed to change quickly and in the second half, we decided to change the system and defensively, we lost consistency. They created more chances and we created better chances than the first and we didn't score. We need this balance in both halves. We lost a great opportunity today to take three points.\" Man of the match - Dominic Calvert-Lewin It was an impressive performance from the 22-year-old, who did not stop running for the entire game. He had a hand in the opening goal, helping to send the ball towards Jagielka, and could be found driving down the field on numerous occasions - even in the 82nd minute. He showed hunger, desire and determination to make things happen for Everton, gave the Arsenal defence a real hard time - including bookings for Sokratis and Mustafi - and has been a real catalyst in Everton's recent up-turn in form. Sky Sports pundit Alex Scott: \"We have to talk about man of the match Calvert-Lewin, he has added another dimension to this side. Right now for this team, he is a solution because with his energy and pulling out the Arsenal defenders like he was today into the channels. \"If it is another Everton player in a different game, they aren't making those runs and aren't willing, they think the ball is going out of play, but the Everton fans love that, they want to see it from their players.\" What's next?

Highlights from the Premier League as Burnley beat Bournemouth 3-1 at the Vitality Stadium. Ashley Barnes scored at both ends as Burnley's 3-1 comeback win at Bournemouth moved them eight points clear of the bottom three. Barnes headed past his own goalkeeper Tom Heaton for the opener inside four minutes under pressure from Nathan Ake, but once Chris Wood had levelled from close range after a mistake from Asmir Begovic, the visitors never looked back. Ashley Westwood smashed in a second from Chris Mepham's poor clearance within two minutes of the equaliser, and 11 minutes after half-time Barnes went from zero to hero when he finished off following another Begovic error. Burnley's second win in seven days moves them up to 14th - only two points behind their hosts - although three of the teams below the Clarets have games in hand on them. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (4), Clyne (4), Mepham (4), Ake (5), Smith (6), Brooks (6), Lerma (5), Gosling (5), Fraser (6), Wilson (5), King (5). Subs: Rico (6), Solanke (5), Stanislas (5). Burnley: Heaton (6), Lowton (7), Tarkowski (7), Mee (7), Taylor (7), Cork (6), Hendrick (6), Westwood (7), Barnes (8), Wood (7), McNeil (8). Subs: Gudmundsson (6). Man of the match: Ashley Barnes Despite poor recent form, Bournemouth had lost just one of their last 18 home games against teams starting the day below them in the Premier League, and even that defeat had been against Manchester United. Ashley Barnes is denied by Asmir Begovic They looked like using that run to their advantage early on, starting brightly and finding themselves ahead with just three minutes on the clock. Ryan Fraser's free-kick was nodded on by Jefferson Lerma, and after Ake got ahead of Barnes, he tried in vain to divert the ball away from the Bournemouth man but only turned it inside the near post from six yards. Bournemouth continued their bright start but were stunned as Wood levelled out of nowhere, with Begovic firmly to blame after flapping at a corner which allowed the New Zealander a simple finish at the far post. Just 139 seconds later, Burnley had turned the match on its head. This time poor defending from Mepham gifted them an opportunity, when he scuffed the direct and increasingly impressive Dwight McNeil's low cross straight to Westwood, who hammered home from the edge of the area to complete the turnaround. Ashley Westwood slots in for Burnley at Bournemouth Burnley then took full control of the half from then on, without threatening to add to their advantage, and the strength of Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe's anger with his side's performance became apparent when he hauled off Nathaniel Clyne for Diego Rico at the break. That did little to turn the tide back in the hosts' favour, though. Within 30 seconds of the restart Burnley could have been further ahead following a simple long ball and one-two between Wood and Barnes, but the latter's shot arrowed just wide after deflecting off Ake. Team news Both teams made one change from their previous game, with Adam Smith coming in for Bournemouth and Matt Lowton for Burnley. The men they replaced, Charlie Daniels and Phil Bardsley, were both missing from their sides' respective squads. He would soon have better luck from more woeful home defending. With Bournemouth's players protesting that Charlie Taylor had taken the ball out of play, the defender played on. His cross, spilled by Begovic, was turned back for Barnes who plundered a third, becoming the second Premier League player this season to score at both ends in the same game. Still, a Bournemouth response was not forthcoming. Ben Mee came close to putting Burnley further ahead but his bullet header from a corner landed just wide, and more link-up between Wood and Barnes ended with the latter firing wide again. Chris Wood's goal to equalise was his first in seven games Not until the third minute of stoppage time did Bournemouth create their first clear chance of the second half, and the manner of Callum Wilson's wayward volley over the bar rather summed up their afternoon's work. Match facts Burnley completed their first league double over Bournemouth since the 1999-00 season in the third tier. Bournemouth are only the second side in Premier League history to concede 60+ goals in four consecutive seasons in the competition, after Wigan Athletic between 2009-10 and 2012-13. Only Wolves (4) have netted more Premier League own goals this season than Burnley (3). Burnley have scored 40 Premier League goals this season, only in 2009-10 (42) have they netted more in a single campaign in the competition. After losing their first four such games, Burnley are unbeaten in their last six Premier League matches on the south coast, winning four and drawing two. Ashley Barnes is the first Burnley player to both score a goal and an own goal in a Premier League game. Burnley's Ashley Westwood both scored and assisted in a Premier League game for the first time in his career (181st app). Since the start of last season, Chris Wood has scored 22 goals in all competitions, more than any other Burnley player. Managers Eddie Howe: \"There were lots of elements of our performances which weren't great. There were some good bits, we missed some gilt edged chances, on another day if you put them together you think we might have got something from the game but the goals we conceded were very difficult to take. 1:51 Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe admits mistakes cost his side as they suffered a 3-1 defeat at home to Burnley in the Premier League. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe admits mistakes cost his side as they suffered a 3-1 defeat at home to Burnley in the Premier League. \"I don't think motivation is the problem. We pride ourselves on our professionalism and ability to never give up, but today it didn't really look like that. We're struggling with ourselves, we're on a difficult run, confidence is low, but the season isn't over we've got a lot to go.\" Sean Dyche: \"It'd be up there, the mentality of wining games is difficult anyway, but coming from one down to win with control is very pleasing. \"We put in a very good performance here last season and won 2-1, and we brought that mentality into this game too. 2:04 Sean Dyche felt Burnley's 3-1 win at Bournemouth was one of their best away from home this season. Sean Dyche felt Burnley's 3-1 win at Bournemouth was one of their best away from home this season. \"You could look at when we had 12 points from 19 games and saying that run up to Christmas defined our season, but we've turned that mentality around, a very healthy return of 24 points since then.\" Man of the match - Ashley Barnes Barnes did well to pick himself up from his fourth-minute disappointment not only to grab a goal, but also come close to a couple more, only to be denied by slightly wayward finishing and unfortunate deflections. The 29-year-old is into double figures in the top flight for the first time in his career, and will be unlucky if he does not add to that tally in the final five games of the season if he continues in this form. Dwight McNeil's exploits on the left wing deserve an honourable mention too, and the 19-year-old continues to look an exciting prospect. He put in several dangerous crosses throughout the afternoon, won 40 per cent of his 10 duels and was directly responsible for Nathaniel Clyne's withdrawal at the interval. What's next? Bournemouth travel to Brighton next Saturday at 3pm, while Burnley face a massive test in the relegation dogfight as they host Cardiff at the same time."},{"date": "06/04/2019", "arena": "The John

seventh place. Huddersfield's relegation from the Premier League was confirmed last weekend and it showed as Leicester looked comfortable in the first half with Youri Tielemans (24) scoring a delightful opener. Vardy slotted home his first goal just three minutes after the break before Huddersfield were awarded their first penalty of the season, which Aaron Mooy converted (52). But their joy was short-lived as James Maddison curled a superb free-kick home in the 79th minute before the second spot-kick of the afternoon was scored by Vardy (84) to send Leicester into seventh on goal difference, going ahead of Wolves and Watford, who face each other in the FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday. Player ratings Huddersfield: Hamer (6), Smith (6), Kongolo (5), Lowe (6), Schindler (5), Durm (5), Hogg (6), Stankovic (4), Mooy (5), Pritchard (5), Grant (5). Subs used: Mbenza (5), Mounie (5), Bacuna (n/a). Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Chilwell (6), Morgan (6), Soyuncu (7), Gray (7), Maddison (7), Pereira (7), Barnes (7), Tielemans (7), Ndidi (7), Vardy (8). Subs used: Okazaki (4), Choudhury (n/a), Iheanacho (n/a). Man of the match: Jamie Vardy. Leicester had plenty of early chances. In the 10th minute, Maddison just missed a cross from Harvey Barnes, unable to head it home, with both involved again not long after. Another Barnes cross was saved by the legs of Ben Hamer before Maddison's attempt at the rebound was also stopped by the Huddersfield goalkeeper. Tielemans is quickly becoming a Leicester fan favourite and endeared himself further with a beautifully taken goal in the 24th minute. Vardy scuffed a shot from Maddison's corner before Christopher Schindler toe-poked a clearance into the path of Tielemans. He then scooped his shot over the area and into the back of the net. Team news Each team made one change from their games last weekend. Junior Bacuna was replaced by Jan Gorenc Stankovic in the XI while Jonny Evans made way for Caglar Soyuncu. Vardy could have been awarded a penalty not long after the goal. He appeared to be fouled by Terence Kongolo in the area - having already rounded the defender and Schindler on the right - before Demarai Gray fired the loose ball across the face of goal. The half-time team talks certainly worked and it produced a whirlwind second period. Huddersfield had their best effort of the game just minutes after the restart. Karlan Grant tried to turn home from close range but forced an instinctive save from Kasper Schmeichel before Alex Pritchard's attempt on the rebound was also collected by the Leicester goalkeeper. James Maddison celebrates his goal, netting a superb free-kick Leicester then instantly made it two when Gray tapped the ball into the path of Ricardo Pereira down the left, whose cross was tapped home by an unmarked Vardy, although replays showed he was offside in the build-up. Referee David Coote was officiating his 11th Premier League game on Saturday and was yet to award a penalty, but this changed in the 50th minute as Huddersfield received their first spot-kick of the season - although it looked to be an incorrect decision. Calgar Soyuncu and Grant both went for a loose ball and the Leicester defender got his foot onto a big chunk of it before catching the striker. Despite Leicester protests, Coote pointed to the spot and Mooy duly fired home, sending Schmeichel the wrong way. Vardy leapfrogs Lineker Jamie Vardy's two goals against Huddersfield has seen him go into sixth in Leicester's all-time scorers chart, having now scored 104 goals for the club, and going above Gary Lineker (103). But any hope of a Huddersfield comeback was dashed in the 79th minute as Maddison curled a superb free-kick into the far bottom corner after Jonathan Hogg pulled down Vardy just outside the area. There was a confrontation between Hogg and goalkeeper Hamer in the aftermath, with the former substituted not long after. Vardy rounded off the victory when Coote correctly awarded his second penalty of the season - and the game - after the striker was fouled again by Kongolo in the area. His former Leicester team-mate Hamer almost kept it out but the power on the penalty saw the ball slip through the goalkeeper's fingers and into the back of the net. Opta stats Leicester have now matched their points tally from the entire 2017-18 season in their 33 league matches this season (47 points). Huddersfield have lost 19 of their last 21 games in all competitions since the beginning of December 2018 (W1 D1), more than any other side in the top four tiers of English football in that period. Would VAR have made a difference? Very much so! The start of the second half was crying out for replays, with Jamie Vardy offside for his first goal and Soyuncu incorrectly penalised for a foul for Huddersfield's penalty. Vardy should arguably have been booked for kicking the ball away twice - something VAR would have picked up - although he may not have done it were the replays available. This was Huddersfield's 25th Premier League defeat of the season; only in the 1987-88 second-tier season have they ever lost more games in a Football League campaign (28). Huddersfield's penalty was their first in the Premier League this season since they last had one in February 2018, making them the 20th and final club to win a spot-kick in the competition this season. Youri Tielemans is congratulated after opening the scoring against Huddersfield Youri Tielemans has either scored or assisted a goal in five of his last six Premier League games for Leicester, scoring in two and assisting in three. The managers Jan Siewert: \"The players always react to it. Today, after half-time when I told them what we changed, they went for it, then Aaron Mooy scored and it came out of the things which we had spoken about at half-time. So I see that they are reacting but at the end, it is a bit of a disappointment and after such a hard week for us mentally, I think it is also hard to take for the boys. 2:28 Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert admits it was tough to watch his side suffer a 4-1 defeat against Leicester having already had their relegation confirmed Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert admits it was tough to watch his side suffer a 4-1 defeat against Leicester having already had their relegation confirmed \"We had the possibilities to score and they went for it, but in the end, I feel sorry for them that it didn't happen.\" Brendan Rodgers: \"It was a very good attacking performance. When it got to 2-1, we had to show a reaction and it was very, very good. It was always going to be a difficult game for us today with Huddersfield getting relegated and they wanted to have a reaction, of course. 2:00 Brendan Rodgers singled Jamie Vardy out for praise after he scored twice in Leicester's 4-1 win at Huddersfield Brendan Rodgers singled Jamie Vardy out for praise after he scored twice in Leicester's 4-1 win at Huddersfield \"The team worked ever so hard, they were creative and we scored four goals. We could have had one or two more with a better final pass.\" Man of the match - Jamie Vardy Jamie Vardy scored twice against Huddersfield on Saturday It was a vintage Vardy performance at the John Smith's Stadium, scoring twice and generally being a menace for a beleaguered Huddersfield defence. He had the rub of the green with his opener - he was certainly offside - and probably should have been booked twice for kicking the ball away, but he just about kept himself out of trouble. He scored his 14th and 15th goals of the season and is well on course for a second successive 20-goal haul in the Premier League, with the potential to sneak into the Premier League Golden Boot race. He also went above Foxes legend Gary Lineker as Leicester's sixth highest-ever goalscorer having now netted 104 goals for the club. What's next? Both teams are live on Sky Sports next weekend.

Crystal Palace Newcastle 0-1 Crystal Palace Luka Milivojevic's late penalty against the run of play gave Crystal Palace a 1-0 win at Newcastle to all but secure their Premier League survival. Both Salomon Rondon and James Tomkins had goals correctly ruled out for offside in the first half, and although Newcastle camped in Palace's half throughout the game, Palace stole a win with nine minutes remaining. On a rare break, Wilfried Zaha was brought down in the area by DeAndre Yedlin, allowing penalty king Milivojevic to net his 10th from the spot this season. The result means Palace are now 11 points clear of 18th-placed Cardiff, who have six games remaining to Palace's five, while Newcastle are still not safe, sitting seven points clear of the drop zone. Luka Milivojevic netted a late penalty for Palace at Newcastle Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Yedlin (5), Schar (6), Lascelles (6), Lejeune (7), Hayden (6), Ki Sung-yeung (6), Ritchie (6), Perez (6), Almiron (6), Rondon (6) Subs: Dummett (6), Shelvey (NA), Atsu (NA) Crystal Palace: Guaita (6), Wan-Bissaka (7), Tomkins (7), Kelly (8), Van Aanholt (7), Milivojevic (8), McArthur (7), Zaha (7), Townsend (7), Schlupp (7), Batshuayi (6) Subs: Benteke (5), Dann (6), Kouyate (NA) Man of the match: Martin Kelly Palace had the first chance of a goalless first half as Jeffrey Schlupp flashed wide from the corner of the penalty area, before Rondon saw a goal disallowed for offside after Vicente Guaita had spilled Matt Ritchie's header across goal. Guaita then beat away Ritchie's fierce effort from an angle, and was again kept busy as he got behind Rondon's low shot on the stretch. Palace thought they'd taken the lead against the run of play just before half time as Tomkins swept home a Milivojevic corner, but it was correctly adjudged offside with James McArthur behind the last defender and in Martin Dubravka's line of vision. Florian Lejeune's thumping header from a corner was straight at Guaita after the break, before the defender, who missed a large chunk of this season through a knee injury, was stretchered off with a similar-looking issue just after the hour mark. Team news Newcastle made with three changes after their 2-0 defeat at Arsenal; Diame, Ritchie, Dummett came out, replaced by Ki Sung-yeung, Lejeune and Schar. Just one change for Palace after the 2-0 defeat at Spurs; McArthur came in, replacing Kouyate. Luka Milivojevic celebrates his penalty winner against Newcastle Christian Benteke was brought on to change Palace's attacking line, and he missed a fine chance to give them the lead from Andros Townsend's dinked ball over the defence, miscuing into the ground on the stretch. But Palace got their winner as Zaha caused huge problems for Yedlin down the left, checking back onto his right foot before the Newcastle man leant into him, with referee Stuart Attwell pointing to the spot. Milivojevic stepped up and slammed down the left as Dubravka dived the wrong way, leaving the Serb one away from Andrew Johnson's Premier League record of 11 penalties in a season, also with Crystal Palace in 2004/05. Rafa Benitez was in disbelief at the result after the game The managers Rafa Benitez: \"You cannot believe you have lost. Not even drawn, but lost. With the chances that we've had with the control of the game we had. Yes, we know they are dangerous on counter, but we made too many mistakes in the last minutes. We had enough chances to win the game, but for sure not to lose the game.\" 1:59 Rafael Benitez admits his is 'not too close' to agreeing his future with Newcastle Rafael Benitez admits his is 'not too close' to agreeing his future with Newcastle Roy Hodgson: \"My fence has been taken away from me… I've got nothing to sit on any more! Yes I think 39 points with our goal difference, I'd like to think that will see us over the line. It was hard-fought game and I'm pleased with the way we've handled it.\" 4:18 Roy Hodgson believes the win should be enough to keep Palace in the Premier League. Roy Hodgson believes the win should be enough to keep Palace in the Premier League. Opta stats Crystal Palace have won 59 per cent of their Premier League points away from home this season (23/39), the highest such ratio in the division. Newcastle are winless in all 11 of their Premier League games against London sides this season, drawing two and losing nine. Crystal Palace won despite having just three shots on goal in this match - no side has won a Premier League game with fewer attempts this season (Burnley vs Cardiff in September, also three). Newcastle have lost their last two Premier League games, as many as they had in their previous nine in the competition (W5 D2 L2). Crystal Palace's Luka Milivojevic has scored 13 per cent of all the penalty goals in the Premier League this season (10/76). 5:18 Charlie Nicholas says Crystal Palace looked the more dangerous of the two sides Charlie Nicholas says Crystal Palace looked the more dangerous of the two sides Man of the match - Martin Kelly In a match where Palace were forced to defend for near enough 80 minutes, Kelly stood out. He made nine clearances, more than anyone on the pitch, as well as a joint-high three tackles, and his duel success percentage of 67 per cent was higher than any outfield player for Palace.

The result means Liverpool sit two points ahead of champions Manchester City, who have a game in hand with six remaining.

Liverpool would have been level minutes later but for Angus Gunn's point-blank save from Sadio Mane's header, before Keita poked into the side-netting on the rebound. The hosts should have been 2-0 up as Long failed to make a good connection with Bertrand's cross, before former Saints defender Virgil van Dijk, jeered throughout, deflected inches over his own crossbar. Liverpool levelled with nine minutes of the half remaining as Keita ghosted in-between two defenders to force a header past Gunn from Alexander-Arnold's wicked delivery, though Salah was marginally offside from the initial pass that started the move. Team news Saints made two changes from the side that beat Brighton last weekend; Jannik Vestergaard and Shane Long replaced Danny Ings and Stuart Armstrong. Fabinho and Naby Keita came in for James Milner and Jordan Henderson as Liverpool made two changes from the win over Tottenham, with Virgil van Dijk recovering from a slight ankle knock. Virgil van Dijk celebrates the equaliser against his former club Liverpool had a big appeal for a penalty turned down after the break as Keita went down following Maya Yoshida's slide tackle, but Paul Tierney waved play on. There was slight contact, but Keita looked to be falling beforehand. Liverpool, who left it until the 90th minute to beat Tottenham last weekend, completed the turnaround slightly earlier this time. Breaking from a Southampton corner, Henderson fed Salah as Liverpool broke two versus one, but instead of passing to Roberto Firmino to his left, the Egyptian expertly found the bottom corner from 18 yards. Speedy Salah Salah has now scored 50 goals in just 69 appearances for Liverpool in the Premier League; only Alan Shearer (66 - Blackburn) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (68 - Man Utd) reached the milestone in fewer apps for a single club in the competition. He has also beat Fernando Torres' 72-game record to 50 goals for Liverpool. And it was 3-1 shortly after as Joel Matip's long ball found Firmino out wide right; he got the better of Jan Bednarek and squared beautifully for Henderson to sweep home from point-blank range, sending Liverpool fans into raptures. Shane Long put Southampton ahead with a close-range finish Man of the match - Mo Salah Chose a good time to end his scoring drought. A brilliant run and finish from the Egyptian, whose shirtless celebration showed how much it meant.

Manchester United to go fifth with a comfortable 3-0 win over Brighton at Stamford Bridge. With Maurizio Sarri bowing to fan pressure, all eyes were on Hudson-Odoi right from the off, and the youngster did not disappoint, as he brilliantly set up Olivier Giroud for Chelsea's opener in the 38th minute, a goal which took Hudson-Odoi's goal involvement - goals and assists combined - to nine in nine senior starts for the club in all competitions. That opener seemed to deflate Brighton, who never really came out for the second half, with Eden Hazard dancing through their defence before curling home Chelsea's second on the hour mark, before Ruben Loftus-Cheek went one better with a superb curler of his own which flew into the top corner three minutes later to make it 3-0. The rest of the match was a mere procession as Chelsea saw out a second successive win to move level on points with Arsenal in fourth, while Brighton, who managed just one shot on target all match, remain 15th, just five points clear of the relegation zone but with an FA Cup semi-final on Saturday to look forward to.

Man of the match: Callum Hudson-Odoi Hudson-Odoi was immediately in the thick of the action, with his low, drilled cross just deflected over as Brighton's defenders backed off. Other than the vibrant 18-year-old's energy, Chelsea's play remained too ponderous as they struggled to create any real openings of note, with Brighton remaining a threat on the counter. If Brighton were going to be unlocked it was going to be the man Chelsea fans have dubbed the 'Boy Wonder', and sure enough Hudson-Odoi used his pace and trickery to get to the byline on the right, before pulling back for Giroud to break the deadlock from close range with a smart finish, much to the relief of a frustrated Stamford Bridge. Team news Chelsea made seven changes from their win at Cardiff, including handing Callum Hudson-Odoi his first Premier League start. The 18-year-old made the XI along with Andreas Christensen, Emerson, N'Golo Kante, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Eden Hazard and Olivier Giroud. Brighton made four changes from their defeat to Southampton as Gaetan Bong, Bruno, Solly March and Florin Andone came into the team. After the break, Hudson-Odoi almost got his name on the scoresheet, but headed straight at Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan. The Chelsea faithful did not have to wait long for another goal, though, with Hazard brilliantly taking his Premier League tally to 14 goals as he scored from 20 yards after a mazy run, before Loftus-Cheek emulated the Belgium international with a brilliant strike from even further out moments later. Brighton did have their one and only shot on target late on, but they never offered anything in response, with Chelsea seeing out the three points with consummate ease. Ruben Loftus-Cheek celebrates making it 3-0 Opta stats Chelsea have won all eight of their league meetings with Brighton, the joint-best 100% win rate against an opponent in English league history (also 8/8 for Wimbledon v Bournemouth). Brighton have lost all 10 of their Premier League away games against 'big-six' sides, scoring just two goals in those matches. Callum Hudson-Odoi is the youngest player to provide an assist on his first Premier League start for Chelsea (18y 146d). Olivier Giroud has been directly involved in eight goals in his last five starts for Chelsea in all competition, scoring six and assisting two. Eden Hazard has been directly involved in 16 of Chelsea's 32 Premier League goals at Stamford Bridge this season (9 goals, 7 assists), over twice that of any other player at the club. Chelsea's Eden Hazard has been directly involved in six goals in his last three Premier League appearances against Brighton, scoring four and assisting two. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek has both scored and assisted in a game for the first time ever in any competition The managers Maurizio Sarri: \"Callum is ready to play in every match, even the most difficult matches. He improved a lot over the season. I am really happy for him. Not only in attack, but in defence. For this team, the future is could be good with Callum. \"He needs to improve, he can improve, and I want him to improve. He can become one of the best players in Europe.\" 2:49 Maurizio Sarri says he was sure about starting Callum Hudson-Odoi after the performances he has put in earlier this season. Maurizio Sarri says he was sure about starting Callum Hudson-Odoi after the performances he has put in earlier this season. Chris Hughton: \"Everybody is fighting. We did ourselves no favours by not getting any type of result against Southampton. That makes it tougher for us. \"It was always in our hands and that's the way you prefer it. You don't want to rely on other results. We have games that we need to pick up points.\" 3:41 Chris Hughton says he was disappointed by the way Brighton conceded the opening goal to Chelsea during their 3-0 defeat. Chris Hughton says he was disappointed by the way Brighton conceded the opening goal to Chelsea during their 3-0 defeat. Man of the match - Callum Hudson-Odoi It had to be him, didn't it? While Chelsea's football was slow and, at times, tepid, Hudson-Odoi offered them an outlet down the right, and gave Gaetan Bong plenty to ponder all match. Always willing to run at his man, his trickery opened Brighton up for the first goal, and continued to pose a threat all match, creating more chances than anyone else on the Stamford Bridge pitch. What's next? Chelsea welcome West Ham to Stamford Bridge on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports, while Brighton host Bournemouth."},{"date": "03/04/2019", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53559,

City returned to the top of the Premier League with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Cardiff at Etihad Stadium. Kevin De Bruyne opened the scoring inside six minutes before Leroy Sane added a devastating second on the stroke of half-time to wrap up an eighth straight league win for the champions. The margin of victory would have been wider for Manchester City had it not been for the woodwork and the inspired Neil Etheridge, who atoned for his error in De Bruyne's opener with no fewer than nine saves. The victory moves Pep Guardiola's side a point clear of title rivals Liverpool with six games remaining in this season's captivating title race. For Cardiff, they stay five points from safety in 18th place, though their survival bid will hinge on the results they get from the teams around them, rather than the favourites for the title. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Danilo (7), Stones (7), Laporte (7), Zinchenko (6), Fernandinho (7), Foden (7), De Bruyne (8), Mahrez (7), Sane (8), Jesus (7). Subs: Walker (7).

Subs: Cordova-Reid (n/a), Bacuna (n/a), Mendez-Laing (5). Man of the Match: Kevin De Bruyne. Manchester City nearly took the lead with just 33 seconds on the clock, but Gabriel Jesus could not stretch far enough to get a toe on De Bruyne's teasing ball across the face of goal. Riyad Mahrez's deflected drive through bodies drew a fine save from Etheridge inside four minutes, but the Cardiff stopper was at fault two minutes later when he allowed De Bruyne's mis-hit cross from an impossible angle to beat him at his near post. Kevin De Bruyne scores the opener for Manchester City Manchester City's relentless attacking play pushed Cardiff back and forced errors, but Jesus lashed over from eight yards after a defensive mix-up between Etheridge and Bruno Manga cushioned the ball into the Brazilian's path. Cardiff began to halt the frequency of attacks, but they were fortunate not to go two down on 39 minutes, Jesus guilty of going alone and firing wide after being played through on the counter by De Bruyne, who wanted the return pass. Team news Phil Foden was handed his first Premier League start as Man City made seven changes from the win at Fulham. Danilo, Stones, Fernandinho, Mahrez, Sane and Jesus all came in as Walker, Otamendi, Gundogan, David Silva, Bernardo Silva, Aguero and Sterling dropped out. Joe Ralls replaced Harry Arter in Cardiff’s only change from their defeat to Chelsea. But the hosts eventually doubled their lead a minute before the interval as Jesus cushioned Mahrez's cross into the path of Sane, who rifled his 15th goal of the season into the bottom right-hand corner. Phil Foden looked to get in on the act six minutes after the restart, but Etheridge stayed big to thwart the England U21 international and ushered in a half where he single-handedly prevented Manchester City from running riot. Phil Foden sees his shot saved by Neil Etheridge After Sean Morrison narrowly avoided scoring an own after blocking De Bruyne's shot, Aymeric Laporte's header was saved by the Cardiff goalkeeper at point-blank range. Sane then stung his palms before Foden struck the woodwork after cleverly hooking a corner towards goal. Foden drew Etheridge into action at full stretch with a rasping 25-yard drive on 70 minutes but the goalkeeper ensured Cardiff left Manchester with their heads held high, though they could have had more had Oumar Niasse managed to beat Ederson at the end of a late counter. 18 - Phil Foden (18y 310d) is the youngest player to make his first Premier League start for Manchester City since Jose Pozo against Leicester in Dec 2014 (18y 273d), and youngest English player to do so since Daniel Sturridge in Jan 2008 against Derby (18y 151d).

Palace Tottenham 2-0 Crystal Palace It was a case of home sweet home for Tottenham as they celebrated moving into their new stadium with a convincing 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday. Hailstones showered the pitch ahead of the first game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium but it was Heung-Min Son that shone brightest as he created a moment of history (55) to become the first scorer at the £1bn stadium. Christian Eriksen (81) wrapped up the points for a dominant Spurs, who moved back above Arsenal into third with six games remaining. Fireworks explode above the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium during the opening ceremony On their first return to their north London home for 689 days, 59,000 fans enjoyed what they saw as Mauricio Pochettino's team attacked with great authority throughout. 0:37 Son Heung-min scored Tottenham's first goal at their new stadium, as they celebrated with victory over Crystal Palace. Son Heung-min scored Tottenham's first goal at their new stadium, as they celebrated with victory over Crystal Palace.

Any fears of Palace playing the party-poopers were dashed when Son wrote himself into the history books early on in the second half. Eriksen found Son and he cut inside before firing a low strike which took a big deflection off Luka Milivojevic and into the net. Mauricio Pochettino celebrates with Christian Eriksen after the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace Kane looked desperate to make a name for himself on the homecoming but shanked a very presentable chance wide after being put through by Dele Alli. Eriksen stepped up on 80 minutes to seal the deal. Kane drove into the area and looked to have been fouled but Eriksen played to the whistle and bundled the ball home from close range. Man of the match: Heung-Min Son This was the South Korean at his buzzing best. After a spell of 11 goals in 12 games, Son had gone six without a goal as perhaps Spurs' busy schedule was catching up with him. He was on the bench for the defeat at Liverpool and that break looks to have done him a world of good. Playing in a free role off Kane, he set the tone early on with an array of direct running which forced Palace back. He was fully deserving of the slice of luck gained with his opening goal.

Highlights from Watford's 4-1 win over Fulham in the Premier League. Fulham's return to the Championship was confirmed after Watford's second-half blitz consigned them to a 4-1 defeat at Vicarage Road. Abdoulaye Doucoure scored his second goal in as many matches to break the deadlock (23) but Fulham showed good spirit to equalise before the break through Ryan Babel (33). Javi Gracia made two substitutions at the interval, and his tactical alteration paved the way for a dominant second period for the hosts as Will Hughes' superb volley helped them regain the lead (63). Visibly deflated by the setback, Watford substitute Andre Gray took full advantage to set up Troy Deeney for a simple third (69) before laying off for Kiko Femenia to compound Fulham's misery (75). Doucoure has scored more league goals from open play (10) than any other Watford player since the start of last season Player ratings Watford: Foster (7), Femenia (6), Holebas (7), Cathcart (7), Mariappa (6), Capoue (7), Hughes (8), Doucoure (7), Pereyra (6), Deulofeu (6), Deeney (7). Subs: Janmaat (6),Sema (n/a), Gray (8). Fulham: Rico (7), Bryan (6), Christie (7), Ream (5), Le Marchand (5), Chambers (5), Anguissa (5), Cairney (6), Sessegnon (7), Babel (6), Mitrovic (6). Subs: McDonald (n/a), Schurrle (n/a), Seri (6) Man of the match: Will Hughes. The result means the west Londoners cannot escape the bottom three with five games remaining, and despite over £100m worth of investment last summer and three managers, they will return to the second tier next season. Watford are up to eighth and have now earned 46 points this season, their best ever return in a Premier League campaign and the most points they have accrued in the top-flight since 1986-87 (63) - but Doucoure started and finished their one clear opening of the first half. After Deeney had flashed a header wide from Femenia's cross, Fulham contrived to once more concede possession from their own goal-kick as Doucoure dispossessed Tom Cairney and ran onto Hughes' lay-off before driving his left-foot shot beyond Sergio Rico. Ryan Babel runs through to equalise for Fulham at Vicarage Road on Tuesday Team news Watford made four changes: Kiko Femenia, Jose Holebas, Craig Cathcart and Adrian Mariappa came in for Adam Masina, Miguel Britos, Daryl Janmaat and Christian Kabasele. Fulham welcomed back Aleksandar Mitrovic from injury while Tim Ream also started as Timonthy Fosu-Mensah and Floyd Ayite dropped out. The visitors' defence stood off the Frenchman as he found the net, but Watford failed to build on their lead as Parker's side produced a rare show of character to level. Ryan Sessegnon, who was the stand-out player in the first half, escaped Jose Holebas down the right and threaded a fine pass into the path of Babel, who rounded Ben Foster to score his third goal since joining on loan from Besiktas in January. But Gracia has been the season's most underrated manager, and he showed his tactical nous as not for the first time this campaign, Gray was introduced at the break as part of a double substitution, with Holebas more prominent down the left. Troy Deeney strikes to make it 3-1 to Watford to sink Fulham Fulham did have the chance to complete the turnaround when Sessegnon was thwarted at the feet of Foster - but they could do little about Watford's second. Holebas' corner was cleared by Maxime Le Marchand, but Hughes was in the perfect place to arrow a left-foot volley beyond Rico via the underside of the crossbar. Rocked by the moment of brilliance, Fulham were punished for leaving too much space as they duly conceded twice in the space of six minutes. First, Gray combined exquisitely with Deeney for the Watford captain to tap in his ninth league goal of the season. Holebas was denied by a brilliant save from Rico, but Fulham's relief was short-lived as Femenia was soon played in by the lively Gray to seal Fulham's fate. The managers Javi Gracia: \"We can now think about the next game - an important game, a semi-final. All the people are looking forward to the moment. To achieve 46 points is something amazing. \"Fulham played better than us in the first half but the whole team was much better in the second half. We are keeping a good level throughout the season.\" 2:39 Javi Gracia was delighted to reach a Premier League record points total of 46 points but insists his players want to keep going Javi Gracia was delighted to reach a Premier League record points total of 46 points but insists his players want to keep going Scott Parker: \"I think initially, as much as I'm disappointed that we've been relegated, the most frustrating and disappointing thing is the manner in which we've lost tonight. \"There were positives, but I think those 10 minutes, when they scored their second to make it 2-1, it's probably a snapshot of us and of Fulham this year, really. That's why we are where we are. \"We tried to grind it out and weather a storm, but we've struggled to do that at times.\" 3:08 Scott Parker says the manner of the defeat is what disappointed him most and is very sorry for the fans Scott Parker says the manner of the defeat is what disappointed him most and is very sorry for the fans Opta stats Fulham have lost each of their last nine league games, the second longest such run in their history, surpassed only by 11 straight defeats in 1961-62. This season's relegation of Huddersfield and Fulham makes April 2nd the earliest date by which two clubs have been relegated in a single Premier League season. This is just the second occasion in which two clubs have been relegated from the Premier League with five or more games remaining, after 1994-95 (Ipswich and Leicester). Fulham are now winless in their last 19 away games in the Premier League (D2 L17) since beating Aston Villa in April 2014; this is the longest run in the division since Hull City went 26 away games without victory between March 2009 and August 2013. Ryan Babel has been directly involved in five league goals (three goals and two assists) for Fulham since making his debut in January, more than double that of any teammate. Fulham winger Ryan Sessegnon has assisted six Premier League goals; only four players have assisted more goals in the competition before turning 19: Francis Jeffers, Michael Owen (both 11), Cesc Fabregas (10) and Wayne Rooney (8). Man of the match - Will Hughes Fulham were unfortunate not to be leading after an hour in which they had been the better side, but in the end, the visitors were thankful to Sergio Rico that the margin of Watford's victory wasn't bigger than three. Hughes played a major role in alleviating the tension with his first league strike since August capping an energetic display from the 23-year-old. Hughes' brilliant volley left Sergio Rico with no chance to make it 2-1 Gray ran him close as the game's outstanding contributor given his two assists - just the second player to provide two goals in one Premier League games as a substitute this season, after Aaron Ramsey against Tottenham in December. But such was the venom in his strike with the game poised at 1-1, it is hard to look beyond the talented Englishman thriving under Gracia. What's next? Watford face Wolves in the FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday before returning to Premier League action on the Monday Night Football against Arsenal on April 15. Fulham host Everton at Craven Cottage on Saturday, April 13 (kick-off: 3pm)."},{"date": "02/04/2019", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 31302, "home_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Conor Coady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Boly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Doherty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leander Dendoncker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rúben Neves", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["84"]}, {"name": "João Moutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Vinagre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["76"]}, {"name": "Raúl Jiménez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diogo Jota", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["73"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ivan Cavaleiro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["73"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hélder Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Gibbs-White", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Otto", "yellows": ["90+4"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["76"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romain Saiss", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["84"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": ["52"], "reds": ["57"], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": ["77"], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diogo Dalot", "yellows": ["42"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["84"]}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fred", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["65"]}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": ["38"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["73"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["65"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["73"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["84"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:53 Wolves 2-1 Man Utd Wolves 2-1 Man Utd Wolves dented Manchester United's hopes of a top four finish as a Chris Smalling own-goal gave them a 2-1 victory after Ashley Young was dismissed for two yellow cards. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side took an early lead through Scott McTominay (13) but Diogo Jota equalised (25) in an entertaining clash at Molineux. With the game finely balanced Young picked up a second booking for a rash challenge on Jota (56), which was referee Mike Dean's 100th red card in the Premier League. Ashley Young is sent off by Mike Dean The hosts netted the winner 13 minutes from time when Leander Dendoncker forced Smalling into an unfortunate own-goal. United remain in fifth place, one point off a Champions League spot, but have now played a game more than Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea. Player Ratings Wolves: Patricio (6), Bennett (6), Coady (7), Boly (7), Doherty (6), Dendoncker (7), Neves (7), Moutinho (7), Vinagre (7), Jota (8), Jimenez (7) Subs: Cavaleiro (N/A), Jonny (7) Manchester United: De Gea (6), Young (3), Lindelof (5), Smalling (6), Shaw (6), McTominay (8), Fred (5), Pogba (5), Dalot (6), Lukaku (6), Lingard (6). Subs: Martial (6), Jones (6) Man of the match: Diogo Jota Nuno Espirito Santo's men have taken 13 points from 10 games against the 'big six' and head to their FA Cup semi-final with Watford on Sunday full of confidence. United were far too passive in their approach in the FA Cup defeat at Molineux last month but started with plenty of attacking intent in this one as Wolves were pinned back inside their own half. Romelu Lukaku was denied by Rui Patricio from close range before McTominay struck his first ever United goal on 13 minutes. Luke Shaw - playing almost as a left forward at times - drew Wolves out before the play was switched to McTominay, who struck a crisp drive into the far corner from 25 yards. Jesse Lingard fluffed a brilliant chance from eight yards minutes later, which seemingly acted as a wake up call to Wolves. They were level on 25 minutes. Fred's control let him down 35 yards from goal and two passes later Jota was in behind, and he clinically fired past David de Gea. The game continued to ebb and flow as Dendoncker blazed over from 10 yards before Lukaku was inches away with a effort from a tight angle. Young handed the initiative to Wolves just before the hour when, having already been booked for a tug back on Jota, he slid in recklessly on the same player and caught him with a studs-up challenge. It was an easy decision for Dean to make as he took out his red card for the 100th time in the Premier League. United actually coped manfully with 10-men but their resistance was broken on 77 minutes. Jonny's cross from the left was met by Raul Jimenez, who headed back across the six-yard box where Dendoncker pressurised Smalling to turn the ball into his own net. Wolves now head to Wembley full of belief. Man of the match: Diogo Jota The Wolves front man is one of the Premier League's hottest strikers on current form. He's now bagged seven goals and four assists in his last 14 games and gave the United back-line, especially the lacklustre Victor Lindelof, the run around, identified by winning six fouls over the course of the game. Only one chance fell his way but he took it calmly after linking up excellently with his strike partner Jimenez - the pair are quite a double act. Diogo Jota celebrates scoring for Wolves against Manchester United Opta stats Man Utd failed to win home or away against a promoted side in a single Premier League campaign for the first time since 2002-03 vs Man City. United have lost consecutive away games against Wolves in all competitions for the first time since August 1980. Following Young's dismissal, Dean has now handed out 100 red cards in the Premier League, the most by a referee in the competition's history. Both of Young's red cards in the competition have been shown by Dean (also Jan 2009 for Aston Villa vs Sunderland). United have had more different goalscorers (exc. own-goals) than any other Premier League team this season (16). Jiménez has been directly involved in 19 Premier League goals this season (12 goals, 7 assists) - five more than any Wolves player has registered in a single season in the competition. Pundit reaction Former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher on Sky Sports: \"United have gifted the game to Wolves tonight - the red card, the first goal and even the winner. That was all Wolves did in the game really. \"United had the better opportunities but their individual mistakes were punished. Wolves were the best team in the FA Cup game but United were tonight and they've somehow lost the game.\" 0:45 Man Utd have no room for error in the race for the top four after Man Utd have no room for error in the race for the top four after Manager reaction Nuno said: \"United started better than us, controlling the game with too much possession.

Cardiff 1-2 Chelsea Highlights: Cardiff 1-2 Chelsea Ruben Loftus-Cheek headed home in stoppage time as Chelsea escaped South Wales with a controversial 2-1 win over Cardiff. Loftus-Cheek, on as a second-half substitute, steered his header into the corner of the net from Willian's cross (90+1) to seal Chelsea's comeback after Cesar Azpilicueta's header from an offside position had cancelled out Victor Camarasa's fine opener. Cardiff, who also saw two good penalty shouts turned down, had looked set for a precious three points in their fight against relegation when Camarasa clipped a fine first-time effort past Kepa Arrizabalaga on 46 minutes, prompting boos and jeers from the visiting fans towards Maurizio Sarri. Player ratings Cardiff Etheridge (6), Peltier (6), Morrison (8), Manga (7), Bennett (7), Arter (7), Gunnarsson (7), Camarasa (8), Murphy (7), Hoilett (6), Niasse (6) Subs: Mendez-Laing (N/A), Zohore (N/A), Ralls (N/A) Chelsea: Arrizabalaga (6), Azpilicueta (6), Rudiger (6), Luiz (6), Alonso (6), Jorginho (5), Barkley (6), Kovacic (6), Pedro (6), Higuain (5), Willian (6) Subs: Hazard (7), Loftus-Cheek (8) Giroud (N/A) Man of the match: Sean Morrison But Azpilicueta, two yards offside when Marcos Alonso flicked the ball into his path, levelled on 84 minutes and after Antonio Rudiger was fortunate to escape a red card for hauling down Kenneth Zohore, it was left to Loftus-Cheek to leave Cardiff boss Neil Warnock fuming on the touchline. The result lifts Chelsea to within a point of the top four, with Cardiff five points adrift of safety, albeit with a game in hand on Burnley. Víctor Camarasa celebrates scoring for Cardiff against Chelsea A tepid first half saw Chelsea dominate possession but fail to muster a shot on target, with Josh Murphy creating the best chance of the opening 45 when he bent a shot just wide from the angle after working some space in the box. Meanwhile, Sean Morrison should have won a penalty for the hosts when his shirt was tugged by Alonso, with Pedro's fizzed effort over the bar on 10 minutes the closest Chelsea came to threatening Neil Etheridge's goal. But the game sparked to life straight after the break when Chelsea failed to properly clear a set-piece and Harry Arter's low ball into the box was met by Camarasa, leaving Kepa with no chance. Loftus-Cheek steered home a header from Willian's cross to snatch three points for Chelsea Sarri's response was immediate as he threw on Eden Hazard, who started the game on the bench, and the Belgian drew a yellow card from Arter before Morrison should have had a second spot-kick - Rudiger this time hauling him to the ground. At the other end, Morrison was putting in a heroic shift, blocking Pedro's shot before intercepting Hazard's dangerous ball across the six-yard box. Willian then flashed an effort across the face of goal, but with Cardiff looking solid in defence, they were undone by Azpilicueta's offside header. Ross Barkley runs away from Cardiff's Harry Arter Zohore was then set free only to be hauled down by Rudiger, but with the home fans and players baying for a red card, referee Craig Pawson produced a yellow, sending Warnock apoplectic. And his mood would only worsen, as Loftus-Cheek's late intervention left him staring down the officials as they left the pitch to a chorus of boos. 1:54 Ruben Loftus-Cheek spoke to Laura Woods following Chelsea's win over Cardiff and told her they were delighted with the victory, having expected a tough match against Cardiff. Ruben Loftus-Cheek spoke to Laura Woods following Chelsea's win over Cardiff and told her they were delighted with the victory, having expected a tough match against Cardiff. Opta stats Cardiff City are only the third team in Premier League history to lose four consecutive matches against a particular opponent despite opening the scoring each time, after Leeds United v Newcastle (Jan 2002) and West Ham v Arsenal (Apr 2014). Chelsea have now scored 18 goals in the final 15 minutes of Premier League matches this season, no club in the competition has managed more (also Liverpool). Six of the eight Premier League points Chelsea have won from losing positions this season have come home and away versus Cardiff. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek's winner was his fourth Premier League goal of the season on his 17th appearance; one more than he managed in his previous 46 matches in the competition (3). Ruben Loftus Cheek's goal for Chelsea was their first 90th-minute winner in the Premier League since Frank Lampard scored against Everton back in February 2014. Cesar Azpilicueta is the 14th different player to score for Chelsea in the Premier League this season - only Man Utd (15) have had more different scorers in 2018-19. 0:57 An angry Neil Warnock elected not to say anything to the match officials following Cardiff's controversial defeat, instead choosing to stand right in front of them and stare An angry Neil Warnock elected not to say anything to the match officials following Cardiff's controversial defeat, instead choosing to stand right in front of them and stare The managers 5:42 Neil Warnock says they have been let down by the officials and he can't believe the decisions that went against his Cardiff side in their defeat to Chelsea. Neil Warnock says they have been let down by the officials and he can't believe the decisions that went against his Cardiff side in their defeat to Chelsea. Neil Warnock: \"To get let down by the officials - roll on VAR. I might be too old by the time we get VAR, but that's why we need it. \"The offside [for Azpilicueta's goal] is not even close. We've worked three weeks for this, and we get let down by decisions. \"We felt that [Sean] Morrison could've easily had a penalty.\" 2:42 Maurizio Sarri says you have to get some luck sometimes as Chelsea's equaliser appeared to be well offside and Antonio Rudiger avoided red late on. Maurizio Sarri says you have to get some luck sometimes as Chelsea's equaliser appeared to be well offside and Antonio Rudiger avoided red late on. Maurizio Sarri: \"We did not play very well in the first half. In the second half as usual. We conceded a stupid goal but today we reacted better. \"We were lucky for timing but in the end I think we deserved to win.\" Man of the Match - Sean Morrison It might seem odd to have a defender from the losing side as man of the match, but Morrison was superb. He should have had a penalty in each half, was heroic in his defending after Cardiff took the lead, and was helpless for Chelsea's equaliser given Azpilacueta was two yards offside. He made a game-high nine clearances and his threat at the other end was obvious, given the rough treatment he was given by the Chelsea defenders. What's next?

Chelsea, meanwhile, host FA Cup semi-finalists Brighton on the same evening."},{"date": "31/03/2019", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53322, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name":

Liverpool a huge 2-1 victory over Tottenham as they returned to the top of the Premier League on Super Sunday. The Spurs defender nudged the ball over the line after Hugo Lloris had parried Mo Salah's header into his path (90), meaning that with six games remaining Liverpool lead Manchester City by two points, though Pep Guardiola's side do have a game in hand. Liverpool took the lead through Roberto Firmino's glancing header (16) from Andrew Robertson's superb delivery, but Spurs levelled controversially with 20 minutes left through Lucas Moura's tap in, though replays were inconclusive as to whether the ball was in motion from Harry Kane's free-kick to start the move.

Spurs' five-man defence allowed both Liverpool full-backs too much space in the first half, and the hosts' opener came from Robertson's delightful left-wing cross, pinpoint for Firmino's head as he glanced past Lloris unmarked from eight yards. But the nerves were still apparent among Liverpool's players in a first-half littered in loose passes, with Dele Alli striking just over on the half volley from 25 yards to give the hosts a scare. Team news Jurgen Klopp decided to go for energy in midfield as James Milner and Jordan Henderson replaced Adam Lallana and Fabinho. Kieran Trippier and Toby Alderweireld replaced Eric Dier and Kyle Walker-Peters for Spurs. Moussa Sissoko started alongside Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen in midfield. Roberto Firmino celebrates scoring against Tottenham Sadio Mane went within inches of doubling Liverpool's lead at the other end, curling just wide from 20 yards, before Spurs looked to rectify their issues by moving to a back four after the break with Danny Rose pushed into left midfield. Spurs had their first clear opening after the break as Alisson parried Kane's effort into the path of Christian Eriksen, but the midfielder's follow-up shot was brilliantly blocked by Trent Alexander-Arnold. Will the title race go to the wire? Check out The Run In... The title twist seemingly came with 20 minutes remaining as Kane's quick free-kick found Kieran Trippier on the right, though the ball may have been moving as he struck it. Play went on as Trippier found Eriksen, and his mis-hit cross was tapped home by Moura. Alexander-Arnold then saw a cross-shot tipped over by Lloris, but Spurs should have gone ahead with five minutes remaining as Sissoko struck over with Van Dijk concentrated on Heung-Min Son as the visitors broke two versus one. Lucas Moura converted from close range to equalise for Tottenham Alli then curled inches wide again, but Liverpool got their vital winner in dramatic fashion, their 400th goal under Jurgen Klopp and perhaps most vital. Alexander-Arnold's deep to the back post was headed goalwards by Salah, and though Lloris got a touch, it was weakly parried into Alderweireld, who couldn't help it from rolling over the line.

Premier League until Sunday evening at least with a 2-0 victory over Fulham on Saturday. The champions are a point ahead of second-placed Liverpool, who have played the same number of games but host Tottenham on Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League at 4.30pm. City shot 18 times in the first half, the most by any Premier League away team in a first half this season, and were successful with two; man-of-the-match Bernardo Silva's low effort from 20 yards (5) put them ahead, before Sergio Aguero's dinked finish from an angle doubled the advantage (27). There was a slight concern as Aguero was taken off with what looked like a minor knock before the hour mark as City prepare for a heavy run of fixtures, though Pep Guardiola said after the match it was a precaution and he will be assessed on Sunday. It stayed 2-0 as Fulham remain 19th, 13 points off safety with just six games remaining. Aguero squeezes home to make it 2-0 at the Cottage Player ratings Fulham: Rico (5), Bryan (4), Christie (5), Chambers (5), Le Marchand (4), Fosu-Mensah (4), R Sessegnon (5), Anguissa (5), Cairney (5), Ayite (5), Babel (5) Subs: Kebano (5), Schurrle (5), McDonald (NA) Man City: Ederson (6), Zinchenko (7), Walker (6), Laporte (7), Otamendi (7), Gundogan (7), B Silva (8), D Silva (7), De Bruyne (6), Sterling (6), Aguero (8) Subs: Jesus (6), Fernandinho (6), Mahrez (NA) Man of the match: Bernardo Silva Fulham sat deep in the first half with a back five, but were powerless to City's surge as Bernardo Silva put the champions ahead within minutes, striking low into the bottom left corner from 20 yards after Timothy Fosu-Mensah's poor pass allowed Aguero to feed the Portuguese midfielder. Replays showed that Aguero, standing in an offside position from the shot, was in Sergio Rico's line of view, but the goal stood. Team news Pep Guardiola made two changes to his last Premier League line-up against Watford. Vincent Komapny dropped out of the squad while Riyad Mahrez was named among the substitutes. Aymeric Laporte and Kevin de Bruyne were back in the starting XI. There was no Tim Ream for Fulham as Cyrus Christie started in defence. Aleksandar Mitrovic was also absent from the side which lost 2-1 to Liverpool last time out while Jean Michael Seri was also not in the squad. Scott Parker welcomed back Maxime Le Marchand and Ryan Sessegnon as part of three changes. Aguero, in an offside position, was in Sergio Rico's view as Bernardo Silva's shot flew past him for the opener City piled on the pressure and missed half chances as Ilkay Gundogan's long-range shot was punched clear and Fosu-Mensah blocked a Raheem Sterling effort, but it was soon 2-0 as Bernardo Silva capitalised on Joe Bryan's loose pass to feed Aguero, who cheekily squeezed home over Rico from six yards. Sterling wanted a penalty after Fosu-Mensah eventually got a touch on the ball having initially slid in and missed, while Gundogan swept inches wide from 20 yards and Sterling's curling shot from outside the box after the break was tipped away by Rico. Sergio Rico slumps to the floor after Manchester City's opener Aguero, who now has 19 Premier League goals and sits top of the Golden Boot standings, was taken off with 57 minutes gone with what looked to be a slight knock, though Guardiola eased fears of any lay-off after the game. \"Tomorrow we have the real assessment, he says he felt something but not injured. For precaution he decided not to continue, hopefully it's nothing serious.\" To a man, the Man City players celebrated with their fans at Fulham - donning the red and black scarves in honour of for club secretary Bernard Halford 📺 More: https://t.co/qpZn8b3uVX pic.twitter.com/EeQ4CArKy8 — Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) March 30, 2019 City strolled for the remainder of the second half, going closest through Kyle Walker as he found himself in the penalty area, striking the outside of the post on the stretch from 12 yards. Fulham's Premier League status is hanging by a thread Opta stats Fulham failed to direct a single shot on target for the first time in their last 188 home league games, since April 2010 against Wolves in the Premier League. Fulham have lost each of their last seven top-flight meetings with Manchester City, only once before have they suffered more consecutive top-flight defeats against a single opponent (8 v Manchester United between 2005 and 2009). Fulham's caretaker manager Scott Parker has lost his first four games in charge Manchester City have lost on just one of their last 10 Premier League visits to London, winning eight and drawing one. Bernardo Silva has scored in three consecutive appearances in all competitions for Manchester City for the first time. Sergio Aguero has been involved in eight goals in his last five starts against Fulham in the Premier League (5 goals, 3 assists). Redknapp: The best PL side I've seen Speaking after the game on Sky Sports, Jamie Redknapp feels City are already the best Premier League side he's ever seen. \"It's immortality for the players really, if they can do the quadruple. I already feel this is the best Premier League side I've ever seen, and the levels they're attaining right now are absolutely incredible. \"This was a game where he could have rested Aguero, De Bruyne, your Silvas, but he didn't want to take a chance. That is the Premier League. \"It's all there for them. There's no reason why they can't win all four.\" The managers Scott Parker on Sky Sports: \"It was a tough day. From the outset we knew the challenge ahead was against a really good team. We made a nervous start and when you go 1-0 down after five minutes, it was always going to be a tough hill to climb and so it proved. In saying that, I thought we dug in and showed some bits at times against a world-class side.\" 3:22 Fulham boss Scott Parker admits confidence is low Fulham boss Scott Parker admits confidence is low Pep Guardiola on Sky Sports: \"Next game on Wednesday [against Cardiff] we are going to change a few players. It is important for the rhythm, Fernandinho is still far away from his rhythm. Wednesday we have another one, Saturday we have the semi-final, Tuesday is Champions League, so we need everybody. 4:33 Guardiola was very pleased with the win after the international disruption Guardiola was very pleased with the win after the international disruption \"The guys who didn't play today have a big chance on Wednesday to play. We are not going to win the Premier League with just 11 players, or reach the finals or semi-finals of other competitions.\" Man of the match - Bernardo Silva Pep Guardiola said at the start of the season that City were becoming 'Bernardo Silva plus 10 others'. Bernardo Silva was man of the match on Saturday Not quite - City have quality everywhere - but this was yet another deserved Premier League man-of-the-match award for the Portuguese maestro. Clean, crisp and clinical, Bernardo Silva is the perfect long-term replacement for his namesake David.

Hojbjerg scored the only goal of a tense encounter at the Amex Stadium as Southampton beat Brighton 1-0 in the Premier League. Hojbjerg calmly slotted the ball past Mat Ryan in the 53rd minute following a quick Southampton counter-attack. Brighton almost equalised through Martin Montoya in the 72nd minute, but his sweetly-struck effort from the edge of the box smashed off the crossbar to deny him his first goal for the club. Southampton's third win in their last four league matches moves them up into 16th on 33 points, level with 15th-placed Brighton. With Southampton and Burnley both winning and Huddersfield losing, the Terriers have been relegated.

Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg battles for possession with Davy Proepper Two minutes later and Anthony Knockaert floated a pinpoint cross into a static Glenn Murray in the box, only for his header to spin over the bar. With Southampton looking the more likely to score, Nathan Redmond was presented with a good chance in the 43rd minute after being teed up by Danny Ings on the counter-attack, but he fired his low shot wide. Team news Chris Hughton named the same side that beat Crystal Palace before the international break. Danny Ings started ahead of Charlie Austin. Jan Vestergaard (injured) was replaced by Stuart Armstrong in formation switch The second half sparked into life when Hojbjerg broke the deadlock. Armstrong applied heavy pressure on the Brighton backline and laid the ball off to Redmond before he surged forward and teed up Hojbjerg to slot away. Brighton pushed hard for an equaliser with Montoya's shot cracking off the crossbar just before Davy Propper failed to slot past Angus Gunn in the 73rd minute. The Netherlands international failed to cleanly connect with the ball just inside the box with the goal gaping. Brighton's Yves Bissouma and Oriol Romeu of Southampton in action at the AMEX Stadium In that moment there were appeals for a Brighton penalty as Propper claimed he was pulled down by Hojbjerg, but referee Michael Oliver waved play on. Southampton held firm for the remaining quarter-hour with Brighton limited to shooting from range, and the visitors' tireless defensive work resulted in a vital win for Ralph Hasenhuttl's side in their pursuit of Premier League survival. Opta stats Brighton have registered just one victory in their last five home Premier League games (D1 L3), after winning four and losing just one of the seven before that (D2). Southampton are just the second team to beat Brighton twice at the Amex in the same season (EFL Cup and Premier League) after Derby County in 2013-14. Brighton mustered 15 shots without scoring in the game; only twice before in the Premier League have the Seagulls attempted more shots without scoring (21 v Watford in February 2019 and 16 v Watford in August 2017). Southampton have won three of their last seven Premier League away games (D2 L2), after failing to win any of the seven before that (D1 L6). Only Everton (14) have seen more of their games goalless at half-time in the Premier League this season than Southampton (13). Southampton's Pierre-Emile Højbjerg has netted four goals in the Premier League this season, twice as many as he managed in his previous six campaigns in Europe's big five leagues combined (2). The managers 3:08 Brighton manager Chris Hughton says they didn't threaten Southampton's goal or play at the level he expects during their 1-0 defeat. Brighton manager Chris Hughton says they didn't threaten Southampton's goal or play at the level he expects during their 1-0 defeat. Chris Hughton: \"That was probably the tale of the game. The one or two chances they had really good counter-attacking goals and that was the difference between the two teams. \"We never really threatened the goalkeeper enough and can't remember him (Gunn) having to make too many saves. \"We didn't play at a level that was going to win us a game - particularly at home.\" 1:45 Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl says their 1-0 win at Brighton is massive for the club. Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl says their 1-0 win at Brighton is massive for the club. Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"We played with a back four for the first time today in the Premier League and the guys were convinced about that. They felt it was working. \"The last few weeks have been intense (in training) and now we have two shapes when we can switch and that helps us. \"The Montoya chance we were a bit lucky, but they didn't have so many chances so I think it was a deserved win for us.\" Man of the Match - Nathan Redmond Nathan Redmond impressed for Southampton Southampton's danger on the counter-attack mainly stemmed from the endeavour of Redmond, whose pace gave Brighton's backline plenty of problems. His driving run was what created Hojbjerg the space to score Southampton's only goal of the game. What's next? Brighton travel to Chelsea on Wednesday, April 3 for a 7.45pm kick-off.

Notes for Southgate Had the England manager been in attendance at Turf Moor on Saturday, then he cannot have failed to be impressed with both James Tarkowski and Dwight McNeil’s performances at different ends of the pitch. The former barely put a foot wrong at the back, while the latter was the creative spark Burnley needed in attack, creating their first, before scoring the crucial second. And with three goals and four assists to his name so far this campaign, it is no wonder the England U20 international was asked by Southgate to train with the senior squad during the recent international break. Meanwhile, Wolves, who seemed distracted by next weekend's FA Cup semi-final with Watford at Wembley, stay seventh in the table. Just before kick-off, Burnley manager Sean Dyche was given a rousing reception from the home fans to celebrate his 300th game in charge of the club, and minutes later his side were ahead.

Luckily for Burnley, though, the rebound then struck the unfortunate Coady before ending up in the back of the net, the defender's third own goal already this season. 3 - Conor Coady has scored three own-goals in the Premier League this season; only Lewis Dunk (4 - 2017-18) and Martin Skrtel (4 - 2013-14) have scored more in a single campaign. Unlucky. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) March 30, 2019 However, it was a different story after half-time as Wolves stepped up the pace and began to dominate possession, albeit without actually testing Tom Heaton until a quarter of an hour from time when the Burnley No 1 was forced to deal with the first effort on target in the game. Minutes later, though, and the match was over as a contest thanks to McNeil, who picked up possession some 30 yards out, before striding forward and drilling a low shot into the bottom right-hand corner of the goal to cap an eye-catching display. Team news Burnley made one change from their 2-1 loss to Leicester last time out with Jeff Hendrick replacing the benched Johann Berg Gudmundsson in midfield. Wolves boss Nuno made two changes from their 2-1 win over Man Utd in the FA Cup quarter-finals, with Adama Traore and Ivan Cavaleiro coming in for benched duo Matt Doherty and Raul Jimenez. At the full-time whistle Dyche saluted the Turf Moor faithful, seven years on from his first game as manager of the club, which was also a 2-0 home win against Wolves.

There are a lot of things we have to look at. \"We must be clinical and produce better. In the start of the second half we caused them danger but need to do it for the whole game and especially look at our defensive organisation.

The England international won every header, as well as making several important tackles and interceptions to help preserve his team's narrow lead, including one vital block to prevent Diogo Jota from scoring a certain equaliser. Minutes later and McNeil wrapped up the points, but the key victory would not have been possible without Tarkowski, who helped his team end a run of eight matches without a clean sheet. Chris Wood puts Burnley ahead at Turf Moor Pundit - Paul Merson \"I thought Wolves would have played their best team today and then rested players against Man Utd on Tuesday,\" said the Sky Sports pundit. \"They started slowly and paid for that. \"Then it was a pretty easy game, but Burnley were brighter and wanted it more than Wolves.\" 3:52 Paul Merson says Wolves paid the price for not including Raul Jimenez and Matt Doherty in their 2-0 defeat to Burnley Paul Merson says Wolves paid the price for not including Raul Jimenez and Matt Doherty in their 2-0 defeat to Burnley What's next?

Premier League relegation was confirmed after a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace combined with wins for Southampton and Burnley. The Terriers had the better chances in an end-to-end first half, only denied the lead as Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita produced two wonderful saves to deny Chris Lowe. But Palace dominated the second half and after a number of wasted chances, Luka Milivojevic (76) opened the scoring from the spot, before Patrick van Aanholt (88) then secured victory with a fine finish.

As Jeffrey Schlupp and Max Meyer wasted similar opportunities by dithering in the box, Aaron Mooy was a growing creative force for Huddersfield throughout the first half, and his cross found Lowe whose powerful header forced a wonderful diving save from Guaita. Huddersfield had another excellent chance to go ahead as a sloppy back pass from James Tomkins played Karlan Grant through on goal. But with just the keeper to beat, Grant's attempted lob barely left the ground and headed out for a throw in. Karlan Grant gets away from Scott Dann Team news Captain Luka Milivojevic and Patrick van Aanholt returned for Crystal Palace. Jan Siewart made three changes to the Terriers, as captain Christopher Schindler and Peter Hogg came back into the starting XI. Ben Hamer came in for Jonas Lossl. Andros Townsend wasted two wonderful second-half chances, dragging both wide from close range, while Wilfried Zaha also failed to capitalise on a one-on-one. But fine work from Zaha drew a foul from Leandro Bacuna in the box, and Milivojevic dispatched the penalty with ease. Luka Milivojevic is mobbed by team-mates after giving Crystal Palace the lead After Zaha wasted another opportunity when through on goal, Van Aanholt put his side's forwards to shame with a well-taken shot on the angle, sealing victory for the Eagles.

Arguably it was therefore fitting that two players who underpinned the 2015-16 title success under his stewardship proved the difference as Leicester stayed in the race for a European place. Team news One change for Leicester as the suspended Harry Maguire was replaced by match-winner against Burnley Wes Morgan.Bournemouth made two alterations from the 2-2 draw with Newcastle. Asmir Begovic started in goal ahead of Artur Boruc, while Dan Gosling came into the midfield ahead of Jordon Ibe. Having come off the bench to score the winner against Burnley last time out, Morgan was installed from the start in the absence of the suspended Harry Maguire. And once again the Jamaican defender's impact was felt in the final third as he gave Leicester an early lead. James Maddison caught out the Bournemouth defence by floating a corner out towards Chilwell and the full-back's cross-shot fell the way of Morgan who instinctively flicked the ball beyond the returning Begovic. 2 – Wes Morgan has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career. Captain. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) March 30, 2019 Bournemouth did belatedly burst into life and should have drawn level when Ryan Fraser crossed for Wilson, but Schmeichel's reflexes were equal to his close-range effort. Vardy passed up a glorious chance to double the hosts' lead after being found free in the area by Ricardo Pereira, but shot wastefully wide. But such profligate finishing was offset by rare Cherries attacks, with Ryan Fraser's weak effort and Josh King's mistimed half-volley the best they could muster during the remainder of the first half. Wilson thought he had levelled but Schmeichel kept out his close range effort If Bournemouth's forays into their opponents' final third were rare in the opening 45 minutes, after the break they became even less common as Leicester snuffed out any threat. Diego Rico, Dominic Solanke and Junior Stanislas were all introduced in the second period but none of the trio made an impression on an easy afternoon for the home side. Vardy secured the points with a flying header It was therefore little surprise when their 10th away defeat in 11 Premier League games was confirmed as Vardy was given one chance too many, clattering a header in off the crossbar after being found by a delightful Tielemans centre to give Rodgers a third straight win. Opta stats Leicester have won three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since a run of four ending in December 2017. Bournemouth are winless in six away league visits to Leicester (W0 D3 L3), since a 1-0 win on Boxing Day in 1988 under Harry Redknapp. Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers has won all four of his games in all competitions against Bournemouth - the only teams he has a better 100% win record against in his career are Hamilton Academical (9 wins), Fulham (7) and Coventry City (5). Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe is winless in eight away league visits to Leicester City during his managerial career (W0 D4 L4). Bournemouth have lost 10 of their last 11 away Premier League games, winning the other. Jamie Vardy has scored five goals in his last five Premier League appearances, after netting in just one of his previous six. Leicester's Ben Chilwell has provided three assists in the Premier League this season, more than he registered in his previous two campaigns for the Foxes (2). Leicester's Wes Morgan has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career, also netting three goals in his last four. Man of the match - Wes Morgan Once again key in the final third, it was Morgan's influence in the defensive third which set him apart from the rest during a comfortable win at a sun-decked King Power. Callum Wilson and Josh King are among the most elusive strikers in the top flight but they were kept quiet for long periods by the captain, who covered ably for the absent Maguire.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first game in permanent charge of United was far from comfortable as Watford dominated for large periods and had 20 shots compared to eight from the home side. However, Marcus Rashford scored on the counter-attack in the 28th minute and Anthony Martial bundled in a second in the 72nd minute to put United in control. Player ratings Manchester United: De Gea (6), Young (6), Smalling (7), Jones (7), Shaw (8), Herrera (5), Matic (5), Pogba (5), Mata (5), Martial (7), Rashford (7) Subs: Lingard (6), Pereira (5), Rojo (5) Watford: Foster (5), Janmaat (5), Britos (6), Kabasele (6), Masina (5), Capoue (6), Hughes (6), Doucoure (7), Pereyra (6), Deulofeu (7), Deeney (7) Subs: Femenia (5), Success (5), Gray (5) Man of the match: Luke Shaw Abdoulaye Doucoure replied with a slick goal in the 90th minute but United, who had lost to top-four rivals Arsenal last time out, held on to move into fourth place in the Premier League. It was a game that both sides might look to move on from quickly - Watford due to the disappointment of leaving empty-handed and United because it was one of their poorest displays since Solskjaer took caretaker charge in December. Solskjaer's promotion from caretaker manager to permanent boss was greeted with chants of 'Ole, Ole, Ole' as the teams emerged, while a large banner celebrating the Norwegian was unveiled across the Stretford End. A banner celebrating Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was displayed before the match However, it looked like Watford might quickly dampen the atmosphere. The visitors made a bright start and could have taken the lead as Doucoure dragged wide from a good position in the box and then David de Gea pushed away a header from Troy Deeney, who was causing problems for United's defence. United struggled to get into the game and were grateful to see shots from Gerard Deulofeu and Roberto Pereyra go straight at De Gea. However, United struck on the counter in the 28th minute as they won the ball outside their own box and Luke Shaw played an excellent pass through for Rashford, who clipped over a sprawling Ben Foster. Marcus Rashford celebrates after giving United the lead Martial should have added a second as he shot at Foster from 10 yards out, but it was still Watford who created most of the scoring chances. De Gea saved from Pereyra at the start of the second half before Will Hughes curled narrowly wide. Team news Rashford and Martial both started for United, having been doubts, while Lukaku was on the bench following a foot problem. Lindelof, whose wife gave birth this week, was not in the squad. Watford made five change from their last game and they were all at the back. Foster returned in goal and Janmaat, Kabasele, Britos, Masina replaced Femenia, Mariappa, Cathcart and Holebas. United again struck against the run of play for their second goal as Jesse Lingard played into the middle for Martial, who finished from close range after Foster dived at his feet to save his initial flick. Doucoure replied with a neatly-taken goal in the 90th minute after a one-two with Isaac Success, but it was only a consolation for Watford. 0:36 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer received a warm reception from the Manchester United fans as he walked out ahead of their match against Watford. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer received a warm reception from the Manchester United fans as he walked out ahead of their match against Watford. Man of the match - Luke Shaw United's midfield struggled to get any control of the game, which meant the defence came under plenty of pressure. Chris Smalling and Phil Jones were both largely solid in the middle but Shaw was excellent at left-back, both defensively and on the few occasions he was able to get forward. His pass for the opening goal was perfectly-weighted for Rashford. Opta stats Manchester United have won 11 of their 12 Premier League matches against Watford, losing the other in September 2016. Watford are winless in all 12 away league visits to Manchester United (W0 D2 L10). In top-flight history, the only team to play more away matches against Manchester United without winning than Watford (12) are Luton Town (15 matches between 1955 and 1991). Watford have lost each of their last 14 Premier League away games against 'big-six' sides, since a 2-1 win against Arsenal in January 2017. This is the first time since the 1995-96 season (Scholes, Cole, Giggs, Cantona) that Man Utd have had four players score 10+ goals in a single Premier League campaign (Martial, Rashford, Lukaku, Pogba). Since his debut for Manchester United in February 2016, Marcus Rashford has scored 45 goals for the club in all competitions, more than any other player. Man Utd's Anthony Martial has been directly involved in four goals in his last three Premier League starts versus Watford (three goals, one assist). Man Utd goalkeeper David de Gea made seven saves in this match - only versus Spurs in August 2011 (9) and versus Liverpool in December 2014 (8) has he made more in a Premier League game at Old Trafford. Man Utd's Luke Shaw has provided three assists in the Premier League this season, one more than he registered in his previous four campaigns in the competition for the Red Devils combined (2). What's next? Manchester United travel to Wolves in the Premier League on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports, before the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Barcelona at Old Trafford on Wednesday, April 10.

boosted their European qualification hopes with a dominant 2-0 victory against a lacklustre West Ham at the London Stadium. First-half goals from Kurt Zouma and Bernard saw the Toffees continue their revival under Marco Silva as they secured back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since October. West Ham, without captain Mark Noble and talisman Felipe Anderson, lacked leadership and creativity as they relinquished a six-game unbeaten home run. The victory sees Everton climb above West Ham into ninth position, a point behind seventh-placed Wolves, with the Hammers now 11th. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (6), Zabaleta (5), Diop (5), Ogbonna (6), Cresswell (5), Rice (6), Obiang (4), Snodgrass (5), Lanzini (5), Perez (4), Arnautovic (5).

Subs: Davies (n/a), Walcott (n/a), Tosun (n/a). Man of the Match: Bernard Everton picked up from where they left off in their victory over Chelsea before the international break, taking just five minutes to hit the front. Zouma easily outmuscled Issa Diop to meet a Gylfi Sigurdsson corner before diverting it into the ground and lopping into the top corner. Kurt Zouma celebrates scoring the opening goal of the game at the London Stadium With West Ham's defence all at sea, Lukasz Fabianski single-handedly prevented Everton from running riot inside the opening 15 minutes, denying Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Sigurdsson and Bernard with three saves in quick succession. Team news Pedro Obiang, Robert Snodgrass and Lucas Perez returned as West Ham made three changes from the win over Huddersfield. Mark Noble started on the bench while Felipe Anderson missed out with a minor ankle knock. For Everton, Kurt Zouma replaced the injured Yerry Mina in their only change from the win over Chelsea. But Everton got their second on 33 minutes. Seamus Coleman played a neat one-two with Richarlison to get in behind the West Ham defence before squaring for Bernard, who had the simple task of stroking his first Premier League goal home from close range. Manuel Pellegrini brought Javier Hernandez and Michail Antonio on at the break, but the substitutions failed to spark a comeback, the Hammers failing to register a single attempt on target during a dreary second half. Bernard scored the second goal for the Toffees As audible discontent from the home crowd grew, the hosts were fortunate not to lose by a greater margin, Richarlison missing the chance to add further gloss to Everton's victory when he cannoned a free header against the crossbar seven minutes from time. Opta stats West Ham lost for the first time in their last seven Premier League games at London Stadium (W4 D2). Everton have netted 2+ goals in three consecutive away Premier League games for the first time since December 2016. West Ham mustered three shots in the game, their lowest tally in a home Premier League game since 2005-06. Everton secured a victory for the first time in their last 11 Premier League games in London (D3 L7). Everton boss Marco Silva ended a run of nine matches in London without a win in all competitions (W0 D1 L8). Everton's Kurt Zouma has scored two goals in 26 Premier League games this season, as many as he netted in his previous four campaigns in the competition (2 in 81 apps). Everton winger Bernard scored his first Premier League goal in his 28th appearance in the competition, ending a run of 1585 minutes without a goal. The managers 1:03 Manuel Pellegrini described West Ham's 2-0 defeat at home to Everton as their worst performance of the season as they missed out on the chance to go seventh in the Premier League Manuel Pellegrini described West Ham's 2-0 defeat at home to Everton as their worst performance of the season as they missed out on the chance to go seventh in the Premier League Manuel Pellegrini: \"[It's] not only the worst home performance but the worst performance of the year - away or at home. We have lost a lot of games before but not playing the way we did today, without creating chances and conceding so many chances for Everton. Marco Silva: \"I'm very satisfied. We are working to achieve this type of performance. It was 2-0 at half-time but could have been three, four or five. We controlled the second half and had the best chance to score. Since the first minute we were the best team on the pitch, and from the first moment we created problems for them.\" Man of the Match - Bernard This award could quite easily have gone to anyone in an Everton shirt, but Bernard's performance was flawless. The Brazilian ruthlessly exploited the space afforded to him by the West Ham defence, who were baffled by his vision both on and off the ball. When he performs to such a high level, it's a wonder how it's taken this long for him to score his first Premier League goal. What's next?

After Alisson clumsily failed to fully reach a weak Virgil van Dijk header back, former Liverpool man Ryan Babel nipped in and turned the ball into an empty net (74) to stun the visitors, but they were back in front shortly after as Milner scored from 12 yards (80) following Sergio Rico's tug on Mane. The result means Liverpool are two points clear at the top of the Premier League, but second-place Manchester City have played one game less. Fulham have lost their last seven and remain 19th. Sadio Mane celebrates scoring against Fulham Player ratings Fulham: Rico (5), Fosu-Mensah (6), Chambers (6), Ream (6), Bryan (6), Seri (5), Anguissa (6), Babel (6), Cairney (6), Ayite (5), Mitrovic (6) Subs: Sessegnon (6), Christie (5), Kebano (NA) Liverpool: Alisson (6), Alexander-Arnold (6), Van Dijk (6), Matip (7), Robertson (7), Fabinho (7), Wijnaldum (7), Lallana (6), Mane (8), Firmino (7), Salah (6) Subs: Milner (7), Origi (6), Sturridge (NA) Man of the match: Sadio Mane Despite looking resolute early on, Fulham were undone by a fine Reds move. Starting and finishing it, Mane galloped into the box on the left, slipping in Firmino at the byline before latching onto his cut-back to turn home from nine yards for his seventh goal in five games. Andrew Robertson then stung the hands of Rico from a tight angle after a one-two with Adam Lallana, as Fulham struggled to deal with Liverpool's threat down the left. Sadio Mane celebrates with Liverpool team-mates after scoring against Fulham Liverpool continued to dominate after the break as Van Dijk forced a fine save from Rico after heading a Fabinho ball back across goal, but Fulham began to create anxiety for Jurgen Klopp as Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa's long-range volley was well held by Alisson. Team news Liverpool made two changes from the midweek win in Munich as Lallana and Fabinho came in for Milner and Henderson, who was out injured. Scott Parker made four changes after the defeat at Leicester as Fosu-Mensah, Seri, Anguissa and Ayite replaced Odoi, Sessegnon, McDonald and Nordtveit. Mane was denied a second after his near-post header from a corner hit the top of the crossbar, before Liverpool gifted the hosts an equaliser via a horrible defensive mix-up. Attempting to tidy up Milner's miscued clearance, Van Dijk's weak header back was awkward for Alisson, allowing Babel to steal in and then finish off into the empty net. 1:42 Virgil van Dijk offered no excuses for his mistake which led to Fulham's equaliser, and James Milner even took some of the blame! Virgil van Dijk offered no excuses for his mistake which led to Fulham's equaliser, and James Milner even took some of the blame! But Liverpool were back in front six minutes later as Rico clumsily dragged the shoulder of Mane after spilling a routine Mohamed Salah shot, allowing Milner to step up and slam straight down the middle. Liverpool missed two chances to wrap it up late on as Rico stopped Salah's one-on-one effort and Gini Wijnaldum flashed just wide from range, but there was still a sigh of relief at full time as Klopp's side came through a tough second half. Ryan Babel and Aleksandar Mitrovic celebrate Fulham's equaliser The managers Scott Parker: \"Gutted, disappointed, mainly for the players really. I said before the day how hard everyone has been working this week. Even as slow as we were in the first half in the attacking third, I saw things which were part of what we want, and then certainly second half.\" 3:53 Fulham boss Scott Parker says he's 'gutted' his side could not hold on for a draw Fulham boss Scott Parker says he's 'gutted' his side could not hold on for a draw Jurgen Klopp: \"We go for perfection but it is rare that you get it. People will say we need to be more convincing, but we are at the start of a development, not the end. They are cool enough. On our day we are a flying team, that's all there, but the consistency is rare.\" 5:40 Jurgen Klopp was impressed with the way his players responded to conceding Jurgen Klopp was impressed with the way his players responded to conceding Man of the match - Sadio Mane Luckily for Liverpool, while Mohamed Salah struggles to make the impact he had last season, Mane is on fire. He's scored seven in his last five, and looks the sharpest of Klopp's front three going into the final two months of the season.

Everton 2-0 Chelsea Everton ended a two-month wait for a home league win as a spirited second-half display secured a 2-0 victory that dented Chelsea’s top-four hopes at Goodison Park on Renault Super Sunday. The Toffees had to withstand a first-half Chelsea barrage before goals from Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson secured a first win against a top-six side in more than two years for Marco Silva's team. Chelsea struck the post and had no fewer than 10 attempts on goal in a one-sided first half but were left stunned as another abject away performance saw a seven-game unbeaten run in all competitions come to an end on Merseyside. The result means Maurizio Sarri's side miss the chance to move level with fourth-place Arsenal, while Everton climb above Bournemouth into 11th, halting a miserable run of just one win in their last eight home league matches. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (6), Keane (6), Mina (6), Digne (7), Gomes (6), Gueye (8), Richarlison (7), Sigurdsson (7), Bernard (6), Calvert-Lewin (7). Subs: Schneiderlin (5), Walcott (5), Davies (n/a). Chelsea: Kepa (5), Azpilicueta (5), Rudiger (5), Luiz (5), Alonso (4), Jorginho (6), Kante (6), Barkley (5), Pedro (6), Hazard (6), Higuain (5). Subs: Loftus-Cheek (5), Hudson-Odoi (6), Giroud (5). Man of the Match: Idrissa Gueye. Chelsea flew out of the traps and could have scored three times inside the opening seven minutes. Eden Hazard weaved into the area and nearly punished Everton's hesitancy to make a challenge, forcing Jordan Pickford into a save with a low strike at the near post. A minute later the post came to Everton's rescue, Hazard striking the woodwork after cutting in off the flank, and it was a matter of seconds before Pickford was called upon again, this time to deny Gonzalo Higuain from close range before Michael Keane hacked the ball from off the goal-line. Dominic Calvert-Lewin blazed Everton's first attempt over on 16 minutes but Chelsea remained the dominant attacking threat, Jorginho playing a lovely one-two with Higuain on the edge of the hosts' area before firing a low drive straight at Pickford. Calvert Lewin spurned Everton best chance of the half on 37 minutes, sending a free header wide of the target after Sigurdsson's free-kick found him unmarked in the Chelsea area. Team news Marco Silva made two changes following the defeat at Newcastle as Seamus Coleman and Yerry Mina replaced Jonjoe Kenny and the ineligible Chelsea loanee Kurt Zouma. There were no fewer than seven Chelsea changes following their win at Dynamo Kiev, with former Everton midfielder Ross Barkley, Eden Hazard and Gonzalo Higuain the notable returnees. But Chelsea had the final word before the interval, Pedro trickling a shot inches wide from the edge of the area after fending off three Everton defenders, before the Spain international found the back of the net from a narrow angle, only for it to be ruled out for offside. Silva would have demanded a response after such an abject first-half display, and that was exactly what he got as a wicked Calvert-Lewin cross narrowly evaded Bernard and Andre Gomes' drive drew Kepa Arrizabalaga into action within two minutes of the restart. Richarlison celebrates scoring for Everton against Chelsea A rejuvenated Everton soon took the lead, Richarlison reacting quickest to head a rebound into the roof of the Chelsea net after Kepa failed to parry a Calvert-Lewin header away from danger. Marcos Alonso fired into the side-netting and Higuain drew another fine stop from Pickford as Chelsea rallied, but a clumsy trip from Alonso on Richarlison in the area gifted Everton the chance to double their lead from the penalty spot. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates scoring Everton's second goal against Chelsea Sigurdsson's initial effort from 12 yards was saved by Kepa but, as he did with the first goal, the Chelsea goalkeeper could only parry the ball back into danger, and the Iceland international made no mistake in converting the rebound as Everton brought that winning feeling back to Goodison. Opta stats Everton (W1 D1) have avoided defeat against Chelsea within a single Premier League season for the first time since the 2015/16 campaign under manager Roberto Martinez. Chelsea have suffered defeat at Goodison Park without scoring a goal for the first time since September 2013, when they lost 1-0 under manager Jose Mourinho. Everton have kept back-to-back home clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time since doing so against Fulham and Crystal Palace back in September and October earlier this season. Only Fulham (six) have lost more Premier League games away from home in 2019 than Chelsea (P5 W1 D0 L4). Despite scoring the rebound, Gylfi Sigurdsson has now missed three of his five Premier League penalties for Everton (60%). Indeed, 2018/19 is just the second Premier League season to see two different players miss at least three penalties (also Paul Pogba) after 2003/04 (Alan Shearer and Ruud van Nistelrooy). Chelsea's Eden Hazard has now failed to score in each of his seven Premier League games at Goodison Park; his most appearances at a single away venue without finding the net in the competition. Richarlison has scored 12 goals in the Premier League this season; only three players have netted more in the competition in their first season at Everton (15 - Kanchelskis, Yakubu and Lukaku). The managers 4:31 Silva praises Toffees attitude Silva praises Toffees attitude Marco Silva: \"It would be easier for me just to speak about the second half. The first half I didn't like it at all, we were not there from the first minute. What we did in the second half was everything we planned during the week. The players showed great attitude, character and personality second half but we have to do it from the first minute.\" 2:37 Maurizio Sarri labelled Chelsea's loss to Everton as 'strange' after the Blues dominated the first half but two second-half goals condemned them to defeat at Goodison Park.

Maurizio Sarri: \"We played probably the best 45 minutes of the season and then, suddenly at the beginning of the second half, we stopped playing - I don't know why. We were in trouble. The situation was clear, it's clear the problem is not a physical problem, if it was physical you would go down gradually, not in one second.

"report": "2:59 Bournemouth 2-2 Newcastle Bournemouth 2-2 Newcastle Matt Ritchie scored a dramatic late equaliser against his old club as Newcastle drew 2-2 with Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium in the Premier League on Saturday. Salomon Rondon gave the visitors the lead with a fine free-kick on the stroke of half-time (45+5) on a wet and windy afternoon. But Josh King looked to have completed a Bournemouth turnaround as he scored from the spot (48) before grabbing his second nine minutes from time. However, Ritchie's stunning volley in injury-time snatched Newcastle an emphatic late point. The result means Bournemouth move above Everton into 11th. Newcastle remain in 13th, but are seven points clear of the relegation zone. Player ratings Bournemouth Boruc (6), Clyne (5), Mepham (6), Ake (6), Daniels (6), Brooks (6), Lerma (7), Fraser (7), Ibe (7), King (8), Wilson (6) Subs: Solanke (7) Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Yedlin (6), Lejeune (6), Fernandez (6), Dummett (6), Ritchie (7), Hayden (7), Diame (6), Perez (6), Almiron (6), Rondon (7) Subs: Atsu (6), Muto (N/A), Shelvey (N/A) Man of the match: Josh King Both sides found the strong wind a problem in the early stages with neither able to get into a flowing rhythm. But the first chance arrived in the 11th minute when Ryan Fraser's drilled strike beat Martin Dubravka and smashed off the post. With the blustery conditions resulting in ill-timed challenges, Jefferson Lerma picked up his 11th yellow of the season in the 18th minute - more than any other player in the Premier League - for a heavy sliding challenge on Ayoze Perez. Salomon Rondon celebrates after scoring Newcastle's first goal with Miguel Almiron and Mohamed Diame Callum Wilson, who received an England call-up in midweek, had his first look on goal three minutes before half-time, but he fired his shot from a tricky angle wide of the post. However, Rondon gave the visitors the lead in first-half injury-time with a curled free-kick into the top-left corner which Artur Boruc could not reach. Team news Ryan Fraser started after recovering from a knock. Nathaniel Clyne and Jordon Ibe came in for injured duo Adam Smith and Andrew Surman. Federico Fernandez and Paul Dummett came into the backline for Fabian Schar (suspended) and Jamaal Lascelles (injured). Mohamed Diame started his first league game since January 2. Bournemouth won a penalty two minutes after the restart when Federico Fernandez was deemed to have pulled down Nathan Ake in the area. King sent Dubravka the wrong way with his casual spot-kick. Paul Dummett's made an acrobatic goal-line clearance Moments later and Ritchie nearly got the final touch to turn in Rondon's deflected shot - 15 minutes before Paul Dummett acrobatically cleared Wilson's dinked header over the bar - but Bournemouth took the lead through King when he skilfully placed his shot into the bottom corner. With it looking like Bournemouth would secure all three points, Ritchie stole the show with a last-gasp equaliser as he volleyed home DeAndre Yedlin's floated ball to the back post to send the visiting fans home happy. Matt Ritchie celebrates after scoring Newcastle's second goal with his team-mates Opta stats Bournemouth are unbeaten in their last 19 home Premier League games against non 'big six' sides (W10 D9), since losing to Burnley in November 2017. Newcastle have lost just two of their last nine Premier League games (W5 D2), after losing three of the four before that (D1). Only Manchester United (10) have won more penalties than Bournemouth in the Premier League this season (9), while only Crystal Palace (8) have scored more than the Cherries (7). Courtesy of Josh King's 48th minute penalty, Bournemouth ended a run of 138 minutes without a shot on target at the Vitality Stadium in the league. Bournemouth's Jefferson Lerma has picked up 11 yellow cards this season in the Premier League, more than any other player and a joint-high for the Cherries in a single top-flight campaign (level with Harry Arter in 16-17). Against no side has Newcastle's Salomon Rondon scored more Premier League goals than he has against Bournemouth (4, level with Swansea). Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (91) is the only Norwegian player to score more Premier League goals than Bournemouth's Josh King (41). Matt Ritchie is only the second player to score against Bournemouth in the Premier League having previously played for them in the competition, after Glenn Murray for Brighton in January 2018.

Harry Maguire was sent off after just four minutes following a last-man foul on Johann Berg Gudmundsson but Leicester took the lead when James Maddison curled home a superb free-kick on 33 minutes. Dwight McNeil levelled five minutes later (38) for the hosts with a fine finish but although Burnley had pressure, substitute Morgan nodded in Youri Tielemans' deflected cross at the death to give Leicester an unlikely victory. Team news Burnley made one change from the 4-2 loss to Liverpool. Johann Gudmundsson replaced Jeff Hendrick. Otherwise, it was the same 18 which went to Anfield.Brendan Rodgers kept faith with the same side which beat Fulham. In fact, the entire squad was unchanged from that 3-1 success. The result keeps Burnley 17th, two points above the relegation zone, while Leicester remain 10th. With relegation adversaries Cardiff and Southampton not in action, the Clarets had the chance to steal a march on their rivals in the battle to avoid the drop. Wes Morgan celebrates after scoring Leicester's second goal with Ben Chilwell Those attempts were seemingly boosted almost from the outset as England international Maguire was dismissed after a clash of legs with the recalled Gudmundsson. Despite being at a numerical disadvantage it was Leicester who took the lead after Maddison was bundled to the floor by James Tarkowski and then stepped up to impressively bend the resulting free-kick past Tom Heaton. Harry Maguire sent off against Burnley Jamie Vardy was denied by Heaton, who was recalled by England this week, and less than a minute later the Foxes were made to pay for not doubling their lead. Maddison curled home the opener with a fine free-kick Player ratings Burnley: Heaton 7, Bardsley 6, Tarkowski 4, Mee 6, Taylor 7; Gudmundsson 6, Westwood 5, Cork 6, McNeil 7; Barnes 5, Wood 6 Subs: Brady 5, Crouch 6, Vydra 6 Leicester: Schmeichel 6; Pereira 5, Evans 7, Maguire 2, Chilwell 6; Tielemans 7, Ndidi 8, Maddison 7; Gray 3, Vardy 6, Barnes 7 Subs: Morgan 8, Mendy 6, Fuchs 7 Man of the match: Wilfried Ndidi Charlie Taylor got free on the left and picked out England Under-20 newbie McNeil on the edge of the box, who swept the ball beyond Kasper Schmeichel with aplomb. WHAT WOULD VAR HAVE CHANGED? Though referee Michael Oliver thought otherwise, there is little doubt Wilfried Ndidi's trip on Charlie Taylor in the second half should have resulted in a penalty. The start of the second half followed a more predictable pattern, with the home side enjoying much of the ball as they tried to make their man advantage count. Ashley Barnes spurned the best of the opportunities, scooping over the bar after McNeil's teasing cross. Burnley's Dwight McNeil celebrates after scoring his team's first goal with Jack Cork Sean Dyche's side should have had a penalty when Wilfred Ndidi clumsily tripped Charlie Taylor but referee Michael Oliver waves away the appeals. Wes Morgan has marked the 700th appearance of his club career with the 90th minute winner against Burnley. Burnley have conceded a PL high 10 goals in the 90th minute or later this season@Wes5L1nk pic.twitter.com/hpEn9s13HA — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) March 16, 2019 And that decision would prove to be decisive as a late bout of Leicester pressure led to captain Morgan - who had earlier replaced Demarai Gray after Maguire's red card - rising highest to head Tielemans' cross into the corner to spark scenes of delirium among the travelling fans. Barnes had Burnley's best chance in the second half but missed the target While Rodgers is now off the mark with Leicester away from home, defeat is a major blow to Burnley's hopes of avoiding the drop following a record-equalling fourth Premier League defeat in a row. Opta stats Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers has won five of his six league meetings with Burnley (L1), winning against them with four different teams (Watford, Swansea, Liverpool, Leicester); the Clarets are the first team Rodgers has beaten with four different teams. Burnley have conceded a league-high 14 goals from outside the box in the Premier League this season. Burnley's games have seen more 90th minute goals than any other side in the Premier League this season (13), with the Clarets shipping a league-high 10 times in the 90th minute or later. Burnley have kept just two clean sheets in their last 12 Premier League games at Turf Moor. Burnley's Dwight McNeil has had a hand in six Premier League goals this season (2 goals, 4 assists), the second highest total for a teenager this term after Ryan Sessegnon (2 goals, 5 assists). James Maddison is the first Leicester player to score two direct free-kick goals in a single Premier League season. Leicester City have been shown more red cards than any other Premier League team this season (5). Harry Maguire's red card after 3 mins 11 secs is the fastest in the Premier League since Gareth McAuley vs Manchester City in March 2015 (1min 29 secs). Man of the match - Wilfred Ndidi Leicester offered very little in attack for long periods, and it required a heroic effort from the Nigerian at times to stem the Burnley flow. Though perhaps fortunate not to concede a penalty, he was otherwise key to protecting a weakened back four and snuffing out any threat - laying the platform for the late winner. The managers 2:49 Brendan Rodgers praised his side's spirit as they secured a late 2-1 win at Burnley despite playing 86 minutes of the game with ten men. Brendan Rodgers praised his side's spirit as they secured a late 2-1 win at Burnley despite playing 86 minutes of the game with ten men. Brendan Rodgers: \"A real team performance. The guys coming off the bench had to have an impact as well to give us that energy and all-round it was an incredible three points. \"You always fancy it at 1-1 and we got a corner late on. They defend it well, it comes out and then Youri whips a great ball in and the big guy gets up and has done what he's done. A great header. \"You see the spirit in the team. The emotion that they show together and they were worth of it.\" 2:36 Sean Dyche was disappointed that his Burnley side came away with nothing from their Premier League match against ten-man Leicester. Sean Dyche was disappointed that his Burnley side came away with nothing from their Premier League match against ten-man Leicester. Sean Dyche: \"They went to 10 men and I think it was so early it kind of shocked us and we didn't get to grips with it. \"You always fear a set-piece late on. We don't stop the cross, we don't deal with it before that actually. We give away a really poor corner for no reason, we don't stop the cross and they get a bit of fortune with it bouncing off Charlie Taylor's leg and onto Morgan's head. \"He [Ndidi] definitely clips him [Taylor] but a natural fall. You don't get them for natural falls. If he goes rolling around on the floor he's got a chance. I don't think you get them for natural falls. It is a shame because that is the way the game is going.\" What's next?

to a dramatic 4-3 comeback victory over rock-bottom Huddersfield at the London Stadium. Hernandez found the net with headers in the 84th and 91st minute to break Huddersfield hearts after the visitors had raced into an unlikely 3-1 lead. Angelo Ogbonna had pulled one back on 75 minutes to make it 3-2 after Juninho Bacuna (17) and Karlan Grant's double (30, 65) had turned the game on its head following Mark Noble's 15th-minute penalty. The defeat means Huddersfield remain 16 points from safety at the bottom of the table, while West Ham are still ninth, but narrowed the gap to Watford in eighth to one point. Javier Hernandez came off the bench to score twice and give West Ham a 4-3 victory against Huddersfield Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski 6, Zabaleta 6, Ogbonna 5, Diop 5, Creswell 7, Rice 6, Noble 6, Lanzini 6, Antonio 5, Anderson 6, Arnautovic 5. Subs: Nasri 7, Perez 6, Hernandez 9.

Huddersfield responded straight away with Juninho Bacuna powering a header past Lukasz Fabianski from an Aaron Mooy corner for his first goal for the club. They then took the lead before the break from a neatly worked free-kick. Bradley Pritchard fed Chris Lowe down the left and his low cross was scuffed into the bottom corner by Grant. Karlan Grant's double had given Huddersfield an unlikely 3-1 lead Team news Pellegrini was able to welcome Arnautovic back into the starting XI for the first time since late January, he was one of three changes for the Hammers, with Zabaleta and Antonio coming in for Fredericks and Hernandez. There were five Huddersfield changes as 18-year-old Aaron Rowe made his first start, with Lowe, Kongolo, Smith and Grant returning, while Mounie, Jorgensen and Billing dropped to the bench and club captain Schindler (illness) and Kachunga missed out. If his first goal was a mishit, Grant's second was special. The striker turned Issa Diop, shifted the ball onto his right foot to beat Ogbonna and arrowed a strike goalwards from the edge of the box, which Fabianski could only palm into the top corner. But West Ham began their dramatic comeback ten minutes later through Ogbonna, who made the most of poor marking at a corner to give West Ham a lifeline with a bullet header. Hernandez was introduced at half-time in place of Antonio and he got the equaliser, stooping low at the back post to nod Sami Nasri's cross into the bottom corner with a diving header. And Hernandez was the hero in injury-time, marking his 50th Premier League appearance for West Ham in style when he flicked Felipe Anderson's pass into the far corner of the net in added-on time to leave the home faithful jubilant and Jan Siewert's side crestfallen. The managers 2:27 Manuel Pellegrini says West Ham's dramatic 4-3 win against Huddersfield was especially memorable for the fans. Manuel Pellegrini says West Ham's dramatic 4-3 win against Huddersfield was especially memorable for the fans. Manuel Pellegrini: This is a match for the fans. Everyone was disappointed with our performance when we were losing 3-1 but I think that was the biggest merit for our team - we never gave up, we tried to continue, we kept working, playing and we scored three goals. We were a little bit lucky as there was as moment in our box when two of their players missed a chance, or it would have been 4-3 to them. So I think that bit of luck, and our reaction to going 3-1 down, the character of the team was, that was important. 2:13 Jan Siewert expressed his frustration after seeing his Huddersfield side let a 3-1 lead slip to lose 4-3 at West Ham. Jan Siewert expressed his frustration after seeing his Huddersfield side let a 3-1 lead slip to lose 4-3 at West Ham. Jan Siewert: I have thousands of thoughts I would say. Since the last game I worked 24 hours a day to work out a match plan for this game. How we can score and win this game - we came here to win. They showed that they got it at 3-1 and it's hard to describe this result at the end. Opta stats West Ham have won three consecutive Premier League games at the London Stadium for the very first time. This was just the third time in Premier League history West Ham have come from 2+ goals behind to win, also doing so against Bradford in February 2000 (5-4) and Everton in March 2016 (3-2). This was just the eighth time Huddersfield have scored more than one goal in a Premier League game, but the first they've not gone on to win (W7 D0 L1). West Ham are unbeaten in 17 Premier League games in which they've scored a goal (W12 D5) since a 1-3 defeat at Arsenal in August. Huddersfield scored as many goals against West Ham this afternoon as they had in their previous 11 Premier League games combined. All 52 of West Ham striker Javier Hernandez's Premier League goals have been scored from inside the box. Javier Hernandez today became the first West Ham player to score two headed goals in a Premier League match since Michail Antonio against Watford in September 2016. Mark Noble became only the third player to score 40 Premier League goals for West Ham, after Paolo Di Canio (47) and Carlton Cole (41). Mark Noble celebrates the opening goal at the London Stadium Man of the match - Javier Hernandez After being dropped from the starting line-up, Hernandez was given the unenviable task of coming off the bench with his side trailing 2-1. He then saw them go 3-1 down before he had a chance in front of goal, only to end up as the match-winner. Despite being the shortest player on the pitch, Hernandez twice found the back of the net with headers in the 84th and 91st minute to hand West Ham a memorable comeback victory. What's next? West Ham host Everton in a Saturday evening kick off two weeks today, while Huddersfield have another trip to the capital to take on Crystal Palace."},{"date": "10/03/2019", "arena": "Anfield",

Sadio Mane both scored twice as Liverpool recovered from conceding a controversial opener to beat Burnley 4-2 and close the gap on Premier League leaders Manchester City to one point. Burnley took the lead in the sixth minute when Ashley Westwood scored direct from a corner, with the ball flying over goalkeeper Alisson, who appeared to be impeded on the line. Liverpool responded as Firmino scored from close range in the 19th minute and then Mane curled in with a fine first-time finish. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (6), Alexander-Arnold (6), Van Dijk (7), Matip (6), Robertson (7), Fabinho (7), Wijnaldum (7), Lallana (7), Mane (8), Salah (6), Firmino (8) Subs: Henderson (5), Keita (5), Sturridge (5) Burnley: Heaton (5), Taylor (6), Mee (5), Tarkowski (5), Bardsley (6), Westwood (7), Cork (6), McNeil (7), Hendrick (5), Barnes (5), Wood (5) Subs: Crouch (5), Gudmundsson (6), Vydra (5) Man of the match: Sadio Mane Blustery conditions made it difficult for both sides but Firmino's second goal in the 67th minute gave the hosts breathing space. Johann Berg Gudmundsson set up a nervy finish when he struck in injury-time, but Mane replied to make sure of victory. Aside from the final couple of minutes and the opening spell after Westwood's goal, Liverpool were largely in control as they closed the gap on City, who beat Watford on Saturday to move four points clear. Both sides now have eight games left to play as they battle for the title, while Burnley are two points above the relegation zone after a third loss in a row. Burnley took the lead in controversial circumstances as Westwood scored direct from a corner in the sixth minute. Liverpool were furious the goal was allowed to stand as goalkeeper Alisson appeared to be impeded from getting near the ball by two Burnley players. Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson appeared to be blocked off for Burnley's opening goal However, the home side responded in the 19th minute when Tom Heaton and James Tarkowski both missed Mohamed Salah's cross, giving Firmino a tap-in from a few yards out. Mane then curled in with a fine first-time finish from inside the box to put Liverpool ahead. Sadio Mane scored twice for Liverpool With rain, sleet and wind making conditions difficult, there were no further chances before half-time and it remained closely-fought after the break. However, Liverpool scored their third when Heaton's clearance went straight to Salah and, although he was well tackled by Charlie Taylor, the ball fell to Firmino to finish into an empty net. Firmino equalised for Liverpool from close range Mane missed a glorious chance to make it 4-2 when he slid in and turned a cross onto the bar from a few yards out. Burnley had hardly threatened in the second half, but Gudmundsson struck in injury-time to set up a nervy couple of minutes. Team news Firmino and Lallana started for Liverpool in place of Origi and Henderson. Burnley stuck with the same XI that lost to Crystal Palace last time out. However, Liverpool hit back with a fourth goal as Daniel Sturridge played through Mane and he rounded Heaton and tapped in. Opta stats Liverpool's tally of 73 points from their opening 30 league games this season is their joint-best ever total at this stage of a league campaign (adjusting to three points for a win), level with the 1904-05 second tier season and 1987-88 in the top-flight. Liverpool are the first side to win four consecutive home Premier League games in which they conceded the first goal since Chelsea won six in a row between April 2013 and May 2015. Burnley have dropped more points from winning positions in their 30 Premier League games this season (10) than they did in the whole of 2017-18 (nine). Liverpool have now gone 36 Premier League games without a loss at Anfield (W26 D10), the joint-third longest unbeaten home run in the competition's history, behind only Chelsea (86 games between March 2004-October 2008) and Manchester City (37 between December 2010-December 2012). Liverpool have conceded nine goals in their 10 Premier League games in 2019, one more than they had in their 20 league games this season before the turn of the year. Roberto Firmino has now scored 10+ goals in all four of his Premier League seasons with Liverpool, the best 100 per cent record of reaching double figures of any player for the club in the competition. Roberto Firmino has been directly involved in 100 goals in 175 appearances in all competitions for Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp (63 goals, 37 assists), more than any other player in that time. Ashley Westwood has scored his first Premier League goal for Burnley, and his first overall since April 2016 when he scored twice for Aston Villa against Southampton, 1051 days ago. Man of the match - Sadio Mane As he has been over the last couple of months, Mane was again the star man for Liverpool. He looked bright throughout and produced a fine curling finish to put Liverpool ahead. He then scored again in injury-time, making amends for a glaring miss, and has now scored 50 goals for Liverpool in all competitions in 109 appearances. He is also the fifth Liverpool player to score in six consecutive home appearances in the Premier League, after Michael Owen, Fernando Torres, Luis Suarez and Mohamed Salah. What's next? Liverpool travel to Bayern Munich on Wednesday for the second leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with the tie goalless. They then face Fulham next Sunday, live on Sky Sports.

Wolves frustrated Maurizio Sarri's men on a windy afternoon in south west London and Jimenez broke the deadlock, with the visitors' only shot on target, in the 56th minute with a heavily-deflected strike that crept over the line. Chelsea tried to find a way through Wolves' resilient defence, and eventually they found an answer through Hazard's driven shot in injury time (90+2) to steal the hosts a point. The result means Wolves create a one-point lead over Watford in seventh place. Chelsea stay in sixth after seeing their three-game winning streak come to an end and hit a setback in the top-four race.

Gonzalo Higuain struck from a narrow angle in the 18th minute, but Rui Patricio was able to get his body behind it. There were half-hearted appeals for a Chelsea penalty five minutes later when the ball appeared to strike Jimenez's arm in the box as he made a clearance, but referee Michael Oliver waved away the protests. Team news David Luiz, Mateo Kovacic and Pedro came in for Andreas Christensen, Ross Barkley and Willian. For Wolves, John Ruddy, Morgan Gibbs-White, Ruben Vinagre and Adama Traore dropped out for Rui Patricio, Matt Doherty, Ruben Neves and Joao Moutinho. And against the run of play in the second half, the Mexico international scored a surprise opening goal in the 56th minute. Diogo Jota slipped the 27-year-old clean through before his finish deflected off Azpilicueta, looping over Kepa Arrizabalaga, into the net. 🔥 Raul Jimenez in PL since mid-January: 8⃣ appearances 6⃣ goals 2⃣ assists He now has 12 @premierleague goals this season, equalling the club record for most PL goals in a season set by Steven Fletcher in 2011-12@Wolves #CHEWOL pic.twitter.com/JhxvUIEAHZ — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) March 10, 2019 Chelsea knocked on the door for an equaliser and substitute Willian came close with a driven strike which Patricio acrobatically parried over bar. In injury-time, Chelsea got the leveller they were long searching for through their talisman Hazard, whose powerful effort crashed into the bottom corner. What this means for top four race The Blues had beaten Tottenham and Fulham to revive their Champions League qualification hopes, but they failed to take full advantage of Spurs' slip-up at Southampton on Saturday. Maurizio Sarri's side are now four points behind their London rivals in the four-way battle for third and fourth place which includes Arsenal and Manchester United, albeit with a game in hand. Opta stats After a five-game winning run against promoted sides at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea have now failed to win two of their last four such home matches in the Premier League (P4 W2 D2 L0). Wolves are now unbeaten in six league games in London this season (W3 D3), their longest such run in the capital in the top-flight since November 1974 (11 games). Of non-big six sides, Wolves have picked up at least two more points against big-six opposition than any other Premier League team this season (P9 W2 D4 L3 - 10 points). Eden Hazard's equaliser was his 50th Premier League goal at Stamford Bridge for Chelsea, becoming the third player to do so for the club in the competition after Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba. Only Cesc Fabregas (6) has assisted more Premier League goals for Chelsea's Eden Hazard than Willian (5). No player has scored more Premier League goals within a single season for Wolves than current striker Raul Jiménez (12 - also Steven Fletcher in 2011-12). Wolves duo Diogo Jota (one goal, two assists) and Raul Jiménez (two goals, one assist) have direclty combined for each of their sides last three Premier League goals. The managers 3:38 Maurizio Sarri says despite securing a late point against Wolves in his side's 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, his side must do better. Maurizio Sarri says despite securing a late point against Wolves in his side's 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, his side must do better. Maurizio Sarri: \"We were a bit unlucky because we conceded the goal in the first situation they entered our box. \"On the other hand, we have to say that you have to play without spaces you have to move the ball faster. You have to move with one-two touches not five-six. We have to do better against a team who don't want to play.\" 1:50 Nuno Espirito Santo says he is disappointed Wolves conceded a late equaliser at Stamford Bridge but will take lots of positives from the game. Nuno Espirito Santo says he is disappointed Wolves conceded a late equaliser at Stamford Bridge but will take lots of positives from the game. Nuno Espirito Santo: \"We performed well. In the first half we were more organised and not allowed many things to Chelsea. A very good team with possession of the ball. But we closed the gaps and stayed compact. \"In the second half we started really well. The goal came and then we stayed in shape until the last moment, because of the individual quality of a Chelsea player which allowed them to score.\" Man of the Match - Raul Jimenez Raul Jimenez celebrates his 12th Premier League goal of the season Jimenez was starved of service for the majority of the match yet he was clinical to turn his goal into the net when given the chance. His defensive work was also admirable as he made numerous headed clearances from set-pieces. Notes for Gareth Southgate - England squad selected March 13 Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi both came on as substitutes for Chelsea against Wolves, but fellow Englishman Ross Barkley was dropped for this game. The duo both helped turn up the attacking pressure when Wolves went a goal up in the 56th minute, but neither had a significant impact on the match. Conor Coady was the only English player in Wolves’ first team and the 26-year-old is yet to receive an England call-up. He produced a commanding defensive performance in the centre of their back three to contain Chelsea’s attack. What's next? Chelsea travel to Dynamo Kiev for their Europa League last-16 second leg on Thursday night.

Highlights from Arsenal's 2-0 win over Manchester United in the Premier League. Arsenal seized the initiative in the race for the top four with a 2-0 victory over Manchester United that inflicted the first league defeat of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure. Granit Xhaka forced an uncharacteristic goalkeeping error from David de Gea as his swerving shot fired the Gunners in ahead inside 12 minutes before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's penalty made sure of the victory midway through the second half. United hit the woodwork twice in the first half but there was a clear hangover from Wednesday's Champions League heroics in Paris as they suffered their first Premier League defeat December 16. Arsenal leapfrog United into fourth as a result of their ninth-successive home victory and move to within a point of third-place Tottenham as the top-four race intensifies with eight games to play. Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (7), Sokratis (6), Koscielny (6), Monreal (6), Maitland-Niles (6), Xhaka (7), Ramsey (8), Kolasinac (7), Ozil (6), Aubameyang (7), Lacazette (6).

Subs: Martial (5), Greenwood (5). Man of the Match: Aaron Ramsey. Arsenal had United under the cosh early on, registering three attempts, all of which were off target, inside the opening nine minutes, but United's first effort nearly yielded the opener. Luke Shaw strode down the left flank and picked out Romelu Lukaku in the Arsenal area, but the Belgian could only divert the ball onto the crossbar before Paul Pogba's attempted rebound was blocked. Arsenal then took a deserved lead, albeit in bizarre circumstances, as Xhaka swerving shot from 25 yards wrong-footed De Gea on its way into the middle of the United goal. Granit Xhaka celebrates his opener Despite seeing little of the ball, United almost drew themselves level on 19 minutes as Fred took aim from the edge of the area and beat the outstretched arm of Bernd Leno, only to see his effort clip the post. Arsenal continued to pepper the United goal but lacked the killer touch, and they nearly paid the price on 36 minutes when Lukaku tried to round Leno, but the Arsenal goalkeeper made contact with the ball, forcing the striker to swipe at a shot which flashed across the face of goal. Team news Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette and Mesut Ozil all started in an attacking Arsenal line-up. Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Sead Kolasinac also returned alongside Aubameyang and Ozil as Unai Emery made four changes from the draw with Tottenham. Paul Pogba, Diogo Dalot and Nemanja Matic returned for Manchester United as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made three changes from the victory at PSG. United almost drew level on the stroke of half-time as Pogba, Shaw, Lukaku and Dalot combined at pace on the counter and rolled the ball into the path of Rashford in the Arsenal area, but Xhaka intervened with a crucial block to preserve the Gunners' lead. Leno then came to Arsenal's rescue six minutes after the interval, racing off his line to confront Lukaku after Rashford's superb side-rule pass presented the Belgian with the chance to equalise, but the German diverted it onto the roof of the net. Aubameyang converted from the spot just over a week after missing a penalty against Tottenham It looked as though United had settled into a rhythm that would cause Arsenal problems but, instead, the Gunners doubled their lead as Aubameyang - eight days on from his missed north London derby penalty - converted from 12 yards after Fred had bundled Alexandre Lacazette to ground. On a day where Aston Villa's Jack Grealish was attacked by a Birmingham fan running onto the field of play, an Arsenal supporter appeared to run into Chris Smalling as he invaded the pitch after Aubameyang's goal. A steward removes the fan who confronted Smalling off the pitch as he celebrates Aubameyang's penalty with the Arsenal players Lacazette should have put the game out of sight on 71 minutes with Arsenal's third but he fired wide after Victor Lindelof's misreading of the ball presented him with a clear route to goal, though it did not cost the Gunners as they saw out a comfortable victory. Opta stats Arsenal have won 12 points from their 10 games against fellow 'big six' sides in the Premier League this season, double the amount they won in such games last term. Manchester United suffered their first Premier League defeat under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (W10 D2 L1), and also ended a run of nine successive away wins in all competitions. Arsenal have beaten Manchester United 10 times in Premier League games played on Sundays, the most United have lost against an opponent on a specific day of the week in the competition. Arsenal have won their last nine Premier League home games, their joint-longest winning run at the Emirates within a single season (also nine in 2014-15). Manchester United failed to score for the first time in 22 away games in all competitions this season, last failing to find the net on the road in May 2018 at West Ham. Six of Granit Xhaka's seven Premier League goals for Arsenal have come from outside the box, including both of his strikes against Manchester United.

Unai Emery: \"I'm very proud of our supporters, they pushed us a lot and this is a big result and they created a big atmosphere for our players. United were in a good moment after one result against PSG but we had a big performance and we are in a good moment in the Premier League. To take three points and get a good position for our target is very good and I'm happy for the players.\" 2:45 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United created some great chances but did not take them in their 2-0 defeat to Arsenal. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United created some great chances but did not take them in their 2-0 defeat to Arsenal. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"We started slowly, maybe a backlash from Wednesday night, but we created chances and when they get the first goal it becomes a different game. We created so many more chances than when we beat them in the FA Cup. Sometimes it happens, we hit the woodwork twice and had five very big chances ourselves. We just had to go for it towards the end, but we were not really at it and it is one of those days where you have to dust yourselves down from.\" Man of the Match - Aaron Ramsey 👏 Aaron Ramsey is @premierleague Man of the Match: • 8 tackles - most in match • 12 duels won - most in match • 12.7km covered - most in match Attempted 8⃣ tackles in a PL match for the 1st time since September 2013 pic.twitter.com/rzxCPluLxU — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) March 10, 2019 What's next?

Highlights from Brighton's win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League. Anthony Knockaert's second-half wonder strike saw Brighton beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park to move level on points with their rivals. Glenn Murray, who was only playing after Florin Andone was injured in the warm-up, opened the scoring after 19 minutes with his now customary goal against his former club. The home team levelled matters five minutes into the second half after Davy Propper tripped Andros Townsend in the box, with Luka Milivojevic doing the rest from the spot. Player ratings Palace: Guaita (6), Wan-Bissaka (7), Dann (6), Tomkins (6), Van Aanholt (6), Schlupp (6), Milivojevic (7), McArthur(6), Townsend (6), Zaha (7), Batshuayi (6) Subs: Meyer (6), Benteke (6) Brighton: Ryan (6), Montoya (6), Duffy (7), Dunk (9), Bernardo (6), Propper (6), Stephens (6), Knockaert (8), Bissouma (6), Jahanbakhsh (6), Murray (8) Subs: March (6), Locadia (6) Man of the match: Lewis Dunk However, Knockaert's breathtaking effort - just his second league goal of the season - won it for Brighton with 16 minutes to go. Meanwhile, Palace suffered an eighth league defeat at home this campaign. The clash between these two fierce rivals got off to a predictably feisty start when Knockaert was lucky to only be cautioned for cleaning out Palace captain Milivojevic after just 28 seconds, the quickest Premier League booking of the season. Luka Milivojevic celebrates after bringing Crystal Palace level from the penalty spot That early tackle set the tone for the first 45 minutes, a half in which there were few clear-cut openings, but one which saw the visitors go in ahead at the break. James Tomkins made a complete hash of trying to head clear Shane Duffy's long clearance upfield, allowing Murray a sight of goal. Murray still had a lot of work to do, though, to beat Vicente Guaita from a tight angle, however, the striker did brilliantly to find the far corner of the net for his 100th league goal for Brighton. Glenn Murray (obscured) is congratulated by his Brighton team-mates after putting them ahead Palace, who no doubt felt a tad aggrieved to be behind at half-time, stepped up the pace in the second half and were soon back on level terms, albeit with a helping hand from their opponents. Townsend embarked on one of his trademark dribbles that took the forward into the box, only for Propper to dangle out a leg and upend the player, with referee Craig Pawson wasting no time in pointing to the spot. Milivojevic coolly stepped up to convert his eighth successful spot-kick in the top flight this season, but rather than be a springboard for a Palace win, it was the visitors who struck next. Anthony Knockaert curls his shot into the top left corner of Vicente Guaita's goal Brighton boss Chris Hughton was preparing to bring Knockaert off, but before the substitution could be made, the Frenchman put his team back ahead with a goal-of-the-season contender. The winger picked up possession down the right, before cutting inside and curling a sublime left-footed shot into the top corner of the net as Brighton scored from outside the area for the first time in the league this season. Team news Palace made three changes to the side that beat Burnley 3-1 last weekend, with Vicente Guaita, Andros Townsend and James McArthur all recalled. Brighton had intended to make one change from last weekend's win over Huddersfield. However, Florin Andone's injury in the warmup meant a reprieve for Glenn Murray. And it was a fitting way to take the spoils in a match of this importance. Opta stats Palace have won just one of their last seven home Premier League games (D2 L4) and have accrued the lowest proportion of their points in home games in the competition this season (39 per cent - 13/33) Brighton have done the league double over Palace for the first time since 1983-84 in the second tier Since the start of last season, Palace have won 19 penalties in the Premier League; six more than any other side Since their promotion to the Premier League ahead of 2017-18, Brighton have conceded 12 penalties in the competition; a joint-high along with Arsenal Murray has scored in each of his last four appearances against Palace in all competitions for Brighton Murray has scored 35% of Brighton's Premier League goals (23 of 66), the highest proportion of any team's goals by a player in the history of the competition Since his Premier League debut in February 2017, Milivojevic has scored 21 goals in the competition for Crystal Palace, more than any other player ⚽️ Glenn Murray becomes the 2nd player to score 💯 league goals for Brighton (after Tommy Cook, who scored 114 from 1921-29) His 7th goal in this fixture - 4 v Palace & 3 v Brighton pic.twitter.com/dR0zxSNDQa — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) March 9, 2019 Notes for Gareth Southgate - England squad selected March 13 Aaron Wan-Bissaka is a hot contender to be in the the England squad and he produced an energetic display, keeping Alireza Jahanbakhsh quiet throughout the game and made some smart runs down the flank. Lewis Dunk grabbed his first England cap back in November and will surely be in Southgate’s mind again after his Man of the Match display. His goal-saving blocks highlighted his determination to keep Brighton in the game in critical high-pressure moments. The managers 2:59 Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson claimed he was disappointed with the lack of chances his side created despite dominating possession in the 2-1 defeat to Brighton. Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson claimed he was disappointed with the lack of chances his side created despite dominating possession in the 2-1 defeat to Brighton. Roy Hodgson: \"It's a déjà vu situation with the games like we played here and not won - either losing by the odd goal or drawing. \"It's not because the team have been outplayed or come across an opponent who has been too good for us. It's because we've not been able to turn goalscoring opportunities into goals.\" 3:34 Chris Hughton was delighted with the way his Brighton side managed the game against Crystal Palace in their 2-1 away win at Selhurst Park. Chris Hughton was delighted with the way his Brighton side managed the game against Crystal Palace in their 2-1 away win at Selhurst Park. Chris Hughton: \"I always maintained 40 points is the easiest and obvious one to look for. It's something to aim for and every team wants to surpass that. \"We have two wins on the spin and we've not had many back-to-back wins this season. We can try after the cup game, against Southampton, to make that three.\" Man of the Match - Lewis Dunk The centre-back was a rock-solid presence at the heart of the Brighton back line all afternoon long as the visitors returned to something approaching their defensive best. Dunk, 27, made any number of important clearances either with his head or boot as Brighton kept Palace's dangerous forward line at bay for most of the game. And as always, the imposing central defender was also a constant threat in the opposition box. What's next? Palace take on Watford at Vicarage Road in the FA Cup sixth round next Saturday lunchtime, while Brighton travel to Millwall a week on Sunday as they also look to book their place in the semi-finals of the cup."},{"date": "09/03/2019", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 32458, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

West Ham Cardiff 2-0 West Ham Junior Hoilett and Victor Camarasa were on target as Cardiff earned a crucial win in their battle for Premier League survival, beating West Ham 2-0. Hoilett converted Josh Murphy's low cross to open the scoring in the fourth minute as the West Ham defence stood statuesque, and Camarasa (52) doubled the lead from close range after a lovely cushioned header into his path from Murphy. Oumar Niasse had the chance to make sure of the points soon after but shot wide after bursting through on goal, before being denied again when Lukasz Fabianski saved from point-blank range and then reacted to keep out Murphy's follow up. Declan Rice came closest for West Ham when he hit the post with 20 minutes remaining, but the visitors offered little threat across the 90 minutes. Despite claiming an important victory, Cardiff remain in the bottom three, two points from safety, following Southampton's win over Tottenham, while West Ham stay in ninth. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (6), Peltier (7), Morrison (7), Ecuele Manga (7), Bennett (7), Arter (6), Gunnarsson (9), Camarasa (8), Murphy (8), Hoilett (8), Niasse (7). Subs: Bacuna (6), Ralls (6), Paterson (N/A) West Ham: Fabianski (6), Fredericks (4), Diop (6), Ogbonna (6), Cresswell (6), Noble (6), Rice (7), Snodgrass (6), Lanzini (6), Anderson (5), Hernandez (4). Subs: Arnautovic (6), Antonio (6), Nasri (6) Man of the match: Aron Gunnarsson Aiming to bounce back after three straight defeats, Cardiff made a quick start and were rewarded within four minutes. Camarasa slid the ball into the path of Murphy down the right, he crossed first time for Hoilett, who drifted in at the near post, seemingly unnoticed by the four West Ham defenders in the vicinity, and flicked the ball smartly past Fabianski. With the crowd behind them, Cardiff pressed for a second and nearly got it after a mix-up between Fabianski and Issa Diop allowed Niasse to steal in. His touch took him wide and with the angle against him, put his shot just over the bar. West Ham grew into the game as the half went on but despite keeping Cardiff penned inside their own half, goalkeeper Neil Etheridge did not have a save to make before half-time. The visitors sent on Marko Arnautovic at the start of the second half but again it was Cardiff who made the brighter start and again, they made the pressure tell. Ryan Fredericks sliced an attempted clearance back towards his own goal, allowing Hoilett to get to the byline and whip in a superb cross. Murphy unselfishly nodded the ball back across goal into the path of Camarasa, who, having been played onside by Fredericks, forced the ball home at the far post. Team news Cardiff made changes from the side that lost at Wolves as Bruno Ecuele Manga, Harry Arter, Junior Hoilett and Josh Murphy came in for the injured Sol Bamba, Joe Ralls, Bobby Reid and Kenneth Zohore. Meanwhile, Manuel Pellegrini kept faith with the West Ham XI that started in the win over Newcastle. The hosts should have been further ahead before the hour mark when the superb Aron Gunnarsson won the ball back in midfield and found Niasse. The on-loan Everton striker confidently knocked the ball past Diop and surged through on goal, only to put his shot a yard wide. Moments later, Cardiff were in again but Niasse was unable to finish from inside the six-yard box, putting his volley too close to Fabianski, who was up quickly to keep out the rebound from Murphy. Rice came close to getting West Ham back into the game in the 70th minute, ambling up to the edge of the Cardiff box as the defence backed off and firing a shot beyond Etheridge and against the post. Arnautovic forced a smart save from the Cardiff 'keeper five minutes later but that was as good as it got for the visitors; their hopes of sneaking into a Europa League place dented, while Cardiff keep pace in the battle for survival. Opta stats Cardiff secured their first-ever win against West Ham in the Premier League by a 2-0 scoreline, after losing each of the previous three meetings by a two-goal margin. West Ham are without a win in six away Premier League games (D1 L5), after winning each of the three before that. West Ham have only won one of their last nine Premier League away games against sides starting the day in the relegation zone (D4 L4). Cardiff went in ahead at half-time for only the second time this season in the Premier League, still less often than any other side. Cardiff kept their eighth Premier League clean sheet of the season, more the likes of Manchester United (7) and Arsenal (5) have managed. Junior Hoilett has netted 16 goals for Cardiff in all competitions since Neil Warnock took over in October 2016, a haul bettered only by Kenneth Zohore (22). Junior Hoilett's opener for Cardiff was timed at 3 mins 37 secs, the Bluebirds' fastest league goal since February 2018, when Hoilett himself netted against Millwall (3:00). Man of the match - Aron Gunnarsson The Cardiff midfielder was exceptional, stopping West Ham attacks before they had started, making an incredible 14 ball recoveries, and then setting the hosts on the attack. That West Ham's various attacking talents - Felipe Anderson, Manuel Lanzini, Javier Hernandez, Marko Arnautovic - were so ineffective was in no small part, down to Gunnarsson, who often cut things off at source.

at Huddersfield. Making his first start since mid-January, Wilson chested home his 50th league goal for Bournemouth to break the deadlock with just 20 minutes on the clock Then, to further enhance his chances of being in Southgate's squad for England's upcoming European Championship qualifiers, Wilson turned provider for Ryan Fraser, who stroked home Bournemouth's second in the 66th minute. Huddersfield offered very little in resistance, as they remain on just seven league goals at home, with the defeat meaning they are now a colossal 16 points from safety at the foot of the table, while Bournemouth's first away Premier League win since October keeps them in 12th, nine clear of the bottom three. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Durm (6), Bacuna (6), Jorgensen (6), Stankovic (6), Schindler (5), Mooy (6), Billing (4), Pritchard (5), Kachunga (4), Mounie (3). Subs: Lowe (6), Grant (6) Bournemouth: Boruc (7), Lerma (6), Mepham (8), Ake (7), Smith (6), Daniels (6), Surman (7), Brooks (8), Fraser (8), King (7), Wilson (8). Subs used: Mousset (N/A), Solanke (6), Clyne (6) Man of the match: Callum Wilson After a scrappy opening, Wilson brought a smart save from Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl from the angle, before the first move of real quality brought the opening goal of the game. David Brooks, fresh from penning a new Bournemouth deal this week, threaded the ball through for Fraser, who raced clear, fired the ball across for Wilson, who steered the ball home with his chest from underneath the crossbar. Huddersfield looked more than toothless in attack, with the poor final pass again restricting them to half chances while, down the other end, Brooks was picking passes, threading the ball through for Josh King, who dragged his effort wide. Team news Having passed a late fitness, Callum Wilson was one of two changes for the visitors from their defeat to Manchester City, with Jefferson Lerma also returning. Nathaniel Clyne and Jack Simpson missed out. Dominic Solanke was fit to take his place on the bench. Huddersfield also made two changes, with Aaron Mooy and Elias Kachunga replacing Jonathan Hogg and young Karlan Grant. Huddersfield were denied a penalty ten minutes into the second half, but Alex Pritchard's tumble was not deemed a foul. Seven minutes later, Fraser and Wilson - the Premier League's most deadly link-up duo - had combined once more, with Wilson showing great awareness to pull it back for Fraser to finish. Josh King had two good chances to make the win more comfortable, but fluffed his lines both times as Bournemouth brought an end to their barren run on the road with consummate ease. The managers Jan Siewert: \"I can't defend the performance today. The performance in the first half was not good, and the performance in the second half was a bit better but it was not good. I feel sorry for the fans who came here today. \"This was not my kind of football. Everyone saw my style against Wolverhampton, everyone saw my attitude. I fought for the club, and I have fought for the club since I am here, so the way we played today was unacceptable for me.\" 1:43 Jan Siewert says he can't defend Huddersfield's performance and feels sorry for the fans that came to their match against Bournemouth. Jan Siewert says he can't defend Huddersfield's performance and feels sorry for the fans that came to their match against Bournemouth. Eddie Howe: \"Callum was excellent today, as was Josh King - they caused lots of problems today. It is testament to Callum's professionalism that he is able to play 90 minutes, he has worked hard on his comeback. \"We need it [the away win] for a whole host of reasons. To get out supporters to come all this way, and they have supported us week in, week out, there has been no ill feeling from the stands and they deserved that win today.\" 1:36 Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe praised his players after their first away in ten in their 2-0 win over Huddersfield in the Premier League. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe praised his players after their first away in ten in their 2-0 win over Huddersfield in the Premier League. Opta stats Only two teams in top-flight history have scored fewer goals after 30 games than the 15 Huddersfield have this season - Leicester City (13 in 1977-78) and Derby County (14 in 2007-08). Courtesy of their victory against Huddersfield, Bournemouth ended a run of nine consecutive Premier League away defeats. Callum Wilson netted his 50th league goal for Bournemouth in his 128th appearance for the Cherries. Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson has netted seven goals in six games against Huddersfield in the league, his best-return against any side. Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser is the first Scottish player to register 10 assists in a single Premier League season. Only Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard (11 each) have registered more assists in Europe's 'big five' leagues this season than Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser (10, level with Jadon Sancho and Joshua Kimmich). Bournemouth attackers Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser have combined for nine Premier League goals this season (4 assists for Wilson, 5 for Fraser), more than any other duo in the competition in 2018-19. 1:25 Paul Merson expects Callum Wilson to make the England squad following his goal and assist that helped Bournemouth beat Huddersfield. Paul Merson expects Callum Wilson to make the England squad following his goal and assist that helped Bournemouth beat Huddersfield. Man of the match - Callum Wilson Not a bad day to net a goal and an assist with Southgate in attendance. Wilson was the difference between the two sides, showing Huddersfield's strikers how it is done, linking up with his team-mates brilliantly and taking his chance when it came. That is now three successive games that Wilson has found the net, taking his league tally to 11, which, given injuries have restricted his playing time, is a mighty fine return.

Highlights from Leicester's 3-1 win over Fulham in the Premier League. Jamie Vardy reached a century of Leicester goals as relegation-threatened Fulham were beaten 3-1 to give Brendan Rodgers a first win in charge at the King Power Stadium. Youri Tielemans gave the hosts a deserved lead from Vardy's unselfish pass (21), but substitute Floyd Ayite hauled Fulham level in untidy fashion when his shot deflected in off Harry Maguire (51). Leicester re-established their lead when Vardy was found by James Maddison to score his 100th goal for the Foxes (78), and the striker sealed the victory when he stroked in Harvey Barnes' cross with four minutes remaining. The result moves Leicester above Everton into 10th position while Fulham remain 19th, but are now 13 points adrift of safety. Youri Tielemans celebrates with James Maddison after giving Leicester the lead Player ratings Leicester: Schmiechel (6), Chilwell (6), Evans (6), Maguire (6), Ricardo (7), Tielemans (7), Ndidi (7), Barnes (8), Maddison (8), Gray (6), Vardy (8). Subs: Okazaki (6), Mendy (n/a), Ghezzal (6). Fulham: Rico (7), Bryan (7), Ream (6), Nordtveit (6), Odoi (6), Chambers (6), McDonald (6), Cairney (6), Sessegnon (5), Babel (5), Mitrovic (6). Subs: Ayite (7), Vietto (n/a), Seri (5). Man of the match: Harvey Barnes. Leicester had 11 shots on goal in a one-sided opening period with Fulham - who had gained just two points from their previous 15 away league games, failing to register a single attempt before the interval. Vardy missed a glorious chance to break the deadlock when he was released by Barnes, but the striker allowed Havard Nordtveit to make a last-ditch recovery tackle before Sergio Rico could be tested. Two minutes later, Vardy was once again played through on goal after Wilfred Ndidi dispossessed Calum Chambers, but this time he unselfishly teed up Tielemans for a simple finish. Floyd Ayite levelled for Fulham just six minutes after coming off the bench Team news Rodgers moved away from a back three in just his second game in charge as Gray returned to the starting line-up in place of Morgan in the one change from the side beaten 2-1 at Watford. Parker opted to field an unchanged side, meaning Babel, Cairney and Sessegnon played in more advanced positions to support Mitrovic. Barnes, Maddison and Tielemans all fired wide from the edge of the area as a combination of Rodgers' high-pressing tactics and Fulham's flawed attempts to play out from the back contributed to an onslaught on Rico's goal. But Fulham regathered themselves at the break, with Scott Parker introducing Ayite for Ryan Sessegnon - and the move paid instant dividends. Ben Chilwell failed to cut out Nordtveit's raking pass, allowing the Togolese winger to step inside and fire past Kasper Schmeichel via a deflection off Maguire. Vardy restores Leicester's lead with a shot across Sergio Rico Notes for Southgate With Vardy retired from international duty, it was Leicester's impressionable young Englishmen who will hope for a call-up for the European Championship qualifiers against Czech Republic and Montenegro later this month. Vardy may no longer be available for selection, but he still has a big role to play in helping the development of the likes of Barnes and Maddison, and both benefited from the striker's selfless running. Less encouraging was the performance of Sessegnon, who was hooked at half-time after failing to make a meaningful impact. Ben Chilwell was bright from full-back going forward, but his failure to cut out Nordtveit's pass led to Ayite's scrappy equaliser, while Maguire will feel he ought to have blocked the shot. Rico had to produce a stunning save to deny the impressive Barnes, before Joe Bryan's cross was nearly headed in by Aleksandar Mitrovic but for the fingertips of Schmeichel. But Fulham would again be the authors of their own downfall as Maddison pounced on Nordtveit's ill-judged attempt to play out from the back to set up Vardy for a trademark strike across Rico. Eight minutes later, Barnes did brilliantly to escape Denis Odoi to tee up Vardy for his second and seal a first victory for Rodgers. The managers Brendan Rodgers: \"We're asking them to play an intense game and there's still lots of improvements we can make with and without the ball, but I'm delighted for the players. It's a great start for us [at home] because I know these games have been difficult for us this season. \"Vardy's tactically very good. How he presses the game and how he leads the press. As you can see, he doesn't need too many chances. He's one of the top strikers in this division, and he produced two wonderful finishes.\" 2:55 Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers says Jamie Vardy is a top team player who has impressed him tactically following their 3-1 win against Fulham. Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers says Jamie Vardy is a top team player who has impressed him tactically following their 3-1 win against Fulham. Scott Parker: \"Individual errors have cost us the game and have been a massive part of this year. It's going to be really, really tough. I sit here with realism. I understand the situation. I'm not blinded by that. \"The message remains that as long as it's mathematically possible we fight - but we know it's going to be really tough.\" 2:11 Fulham's Scott Parker says defeat is hard to take after they played will in the second half in their match against Leicester. Fulham's Scott Parker says defeat is hard to take after they played will in the second half in their match against Leicester. Man of the match - Harvey Barnes Vardy proved the match-winner with two well-taken strikes, but it was the invention of Barnes alongside Tielemans and Maddison that caught the eye. Leicester brought the attacking midfielder back from his loan spell at West Brom, and here was another demonstration of why it was felt he is ready to play at this level. Vardy celebrates his second with man-of-the-match Harvey Barnes The 21-year-old completed 90.9 per cent of his passes while only Maddison (3) created more chances than his two during the match. When Leicester looked slightly vulnerable after Fulham's shock equaliser, it was Barnes' positivity and class that dragged his team-mates to victory - capped by his unselfish assist for Vardy's second. Opta stats Jamie Vardy scored his 100th goal for Leicester City in all competitions, becoming the first player to achieve that feat for the Foxes since Gary Lineker. Fulham have lost 14 of their 16 Premier League away matches this season (W0 D2 L14), conceding 40 goals. Leicester's Jamie Vardy has scored 74 Premier League goals - since the start of the 2014-15 season, only Harry Kane (122), Sergio Aguero (109) and Romelu Lukaku (81) have scored more. Since the start of the 2014-15 season, only Riyad Mahrez (27) has assisted more Premier League goals for Leicester than Jamie Vardy (24). Three of James Maddison's last four Premier League assists for Leicester have been provided for Jamie Vardy. Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers has won all seven of his Premier League matches against Fulham, the joint-best 100% record in the competition's history for a manager against a single opponent (also Jose Mourinho vs Portsmouth and Roberto Mancini vs Wigan Athletic). Fulham have lost their last 18 away Premier League matches when they've conceded the first goal. Fulham's Floyd Ayité became only the second Togolese player to score a Premier League goal, after Emmanuel Adebayor (97 goals between 2006 and 2016). What's next?

produced a rip-roaring comeback from 2-0 down to bulldoze Everton 3-2 and make it five wins on the spin at St James’ Park. On Rafael Benitez's three-year anniversary as boss, Newcastle fell two behind at the break as Dominic Calvert-Lewin (18) and Richarlison (32) put Everton in control. Richarlison's effort came 71 seconds after Jordan Pickford saved a Matt Ritchie penalty after the goalkeeper hauled down Salomon Rondon with the goal gaping but survived a straight red card. Fuelled by that apparent injustice, Benitez's men staged a remarkable second-half fightback with Rondon (65) and an Ayoze Perez double (81, 84) blitzing a crumbling Everton defence. It takes Newcastle to the brink of Premier League safety as they move six points clear of the drop zone. Everton have now lost 10 of their last 17 games in all competitions as the positivity from last weekend's Merseyside derby performance disappeared with a woeful defensive capitulation. Player Ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Ritchie (6), Schar (6), Lascelles (5), Lejeune (5), Yedlin (5), Hayden (6), Ki (6), Almiron (7), Perez (9), Rondon (8) Subs: Shelvey (7), Dummett (7) Everton: Pickford (4), Kenny (5), Keane (4), Zouma (5), Digne (7), Gueye (6), Gomes (7), Richarlison (7), Sigurdsson (7), Bernard (8), Calvert-Lewin (7) Subs: Mina (5) Man of the match: Ayoze Perez But it was the visitors who took the lead with 18 minutes gone. Bernard - Everton's standout player - linked brilliantly with Lucas Digne and his cross was flicked home by Calvert-Lewin at the near post. Team news Ki Sung-yueng replaced the injured Sean Longstaff for Newcastle while Jonjo Shelvey was on the bench. Meanwhile, Andre Gomes and Richarlison returned for Everton. Newcastle responded when Pickford spilled a cross from the left and rugby tackled Rondon in a desperate attempt to retrieve the situation. Referee Lee Mason awarded the penalty but there was no further punishment despite calls from the home crowd. However, the former Sunderland player made up for his error by saving Ritchie's penalty which kick-started an Everton counter. Andre Gomes powered past Ritchie down the right and his cross was tapped home by Richarlison to leave Everton in a seemingly strong position. Richarlison puts a finger to his lips in celebration after doubling Everton's lead Pickford avoided further embarrassment when Rondon looped a shot over the crossbar when the goalkeeper was caught in no man's land but they did get their goal with 25 minutes left. Perez headed the ball down to Rondon and the pair linked superbly to allow Rondon to strike past Pickford. Everton seemed in control of the situation but lost their focus in the final 10 minutes. Salomon Rondon celebrates with Isaac Hayden after reducing the defecit Pickford could only a parry a fizzing strike from Miguel Almiron which allowed Perez to stroke home before the home fans as Perez grabbed a quickfire double three minutes, prodding home from close range after yet more suspect Everton defending. Man of the match: Ayoze Perez In Benitez's tenure as Toon boss, Perez has made the most appearances of any player in that period (120), so it was fitting he came to the fore with a monstrous second-half display. His assist for Rondon's opener showed his creative talents before his poaching skills came to fore with two smart finishes to stage a miraculous fightback. Opta stats Newcastle United came from two goals down to win a Premier League game for the first time since October 2003 against Fulham under Sir Bobby Robson. Everton lost an away Premier League match having led by two goals for only the second time, also doing so in September 2000 away at Tottenham. Pickford has saved three of the last four penalties he has faced in the Premier League. Rondon has been involved in 13 Premier League goals for Newcastle United this season - five more than any other player (8 goals, 5 assists). Perez both scored and assisted in a Premier League match for the first time since April 2018 against Arsenal. What's next? Everton host Chelsea, live on Super Sunday next weekend, while Newcastle are at Bournemouth next Saturday."},{"date": "09/03/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31890, "home_team":

stunned Tottenham with two quickfire goals in the second half as they won 2-1 at St Mary's to ease their relegation concerns. Having been 1-0 down with 13 minutes remaining, Danny Rose's error allowed Yan Valery to equalise (77), before James Ward-Prowse curled in a fine free-kick to complete the turnaround (81). As it happened at St Mary's Spurs plan April stadium opening After dominating early on and hitting the woodwork twice, Tottenham took the lead through Harry Kane's 200th goal for club and country, a neat finish into the bottom corner from 10 yards after Dele Alli's superb through ball (26), but no win in four in the Premier League means their top-four hopes are under threat. Yan Valery equalises for Southampton at home to Tottenham Player ratings Southampton: Gunn (6), Valery (7), Yoshida (6), Vestegaard (7), Bednarek (6), Bertrand (7), Romeu (5), Hojbjerg (6), Remond (5), Ward-Prowse (8), Austin (5) Subs: Sims (8), Long (6), Armstrong (7) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Walker-Peters (5), Vertonghen (6), Sanchez (6), Rose (4), Sissoko (6), Dier (5), Eriksen (6), Alli (6), Lucas (7), Kane (7) Subs: Son (5), Davies (NA), Llorente (NA) Man of the match: Josh Sims The result means Southampton are 16th, two points clear of the drop zone, while Spurs stay third, just four points ahead of fifth-place Arsenal, who host Manchester United on Super Sunday. Former Saints manager Mauricio Pochettino was in the stands serving the first of a two-match touchline ban, and he'd have liked what he saw in the first half. Saints' three-man defence struggled to deal with Spurs' attack as they were left thin time after time; the visitors hit the post twice in two minutes as Kane's cross hit Maya Yoshida and then the post, before Christian Eriksen hit the bar with a fine curling free-kick. Team news Southampton were unchanged following their 3-2 defeat at Manchester United last Saturday. Spurs made five changes following the 1-0 win in Dortmund in midweek; Walker-Peters, Rose, Dier, Alli and Lucas came in, replacing Alderweireld, Aurier, Winks, Davies and Son. Mauricio Pochettino was in the stands serving the first of a two-match ban But Spurs got their goal on 26 minutes as the returning Alli found Kane at the back post with a deft ball behind the line, and the striker finished off into the bottom left corner. Saints made a double change at the break, bringing on Josh Sims and Shane Long, and instantly looked better for it as Spurs lived to rue their missed chances in the first half. Nathan Redmond missed two clear opportunities, first hitting the side-netting from an angle before turning wide from close range at the near post, but they got a deserved leveller as Spurs fell asleep. Distance stats Southampton Tottenham Distance covered (team) 109km 107.3km Total sprints 104 106 Distance covered (player) Ward-Prowse: 12.03km Eriksen: 11.3km Kane netted his 200th goal for club and country on Saturday Ryan Bertrand slipped sub Stuart Armstrong brilliantly in at the left byline, and his centre was left by Rose, thinking nobody was behind him, only for Valery to arrive and scoop home eight yards out. Saints broke forward minutes later and wanted a red card after Kyle Walker-Peters brought down Armstrong on the edge as he looked to be through on goal. Kevin Friend gave a yellow, but Ward-Prowse curled home the resulting free-kick into the top left corner for a stunning winner. 0:51 One Southampton fan showed off some brilliant moves to The Prodigy's 'Firestarter' after the club played the song in tribute to the late Keith Flint ahead of the game One Southampton fan showed off some brilliant moves to The Prodigy's 'Firestarter' after the club played the song in tribute to the late Keith Flint ahead of the game The managers Ralf Hasenhuttl: \"The second goal was unbelievable. I think maybe closer than last week, maybe more difficult, but his technique is gorgeous. It's not so nice for the 'keeper to stand there while Prowsey steps up to take a free-kick, but he made a fantastic game, he was everywhere fighting for every ball. To decide this game is fantastic for him.\" 5:13 Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl says James Ward-Prowse's technique is 'gorgeous' Southampton's Ralph Hasenhuttl says James Ward-Prowse's technique is 'gorgeous' Mauricio Pochettino: \"We didn't respect too much the opponent, and in football first of all you must first respect, then fight, then play football and show your better quality than the opponent. I am a little bit worried about this change from the first half to the second half - it's only one thing, it's mental. It's about complacency, it's about arrogance in a bad way. \"You can use the first half as an example of [positive] arrogance, playing with intention, focus, concentration, we matched them in everything and we were much better. And in the second half it's the arrogance in a bad way. We need to blame all of us, the club.\" 2:56 Mauricio Pochettino criticised Tottenham for not showing enough respect to Southampton Mauricio Pochettino criticised Tottenham for not showing enough respect to Southampton Opta stats Southampton picked up their first Premier League win over Spurs since May 2016 (2-1 under Ronald Koeman), having failed to win any of the previous five. Spurs have lost three consecutive away games in the Premier League for just the second time under Mauricio Pochettino, previously doing so in November 2017. Southampton have now won twice against 'big six' opposition in the Premier League at home under Ralph Hasenhüttl (three games) - they didn't manage any wins against them under Claude Puel, Mauricio Pellegrino and Mark Hughes combined (14 games). This was Spurs' second defeat in their last four Premier League games when leading at half-time (also 1-3 v Wolves) - they had only lost one of their previous 51 in the competition when ahead at the break. Only Matt Le Tissier (7) has scored more direct free-kick goals for Southampton in the Premier League than James Ward-Prowse (4). Notes for Gareth Southgate - England squad selected March 13 The England manager will be pleased to have Dele Alli back from injury and assisting Harry Kane; his fine, deft ball to the back post made the opener, but he showed his rustiness in the second half as he dwelled on the ball with options either side of him in the final third. He'll be less happy with Danny Rose's poor mistake for Saints' equaliser, letting the ball through his legs before Yan Valery netted, while Kyle Walker-Peters arguably should have been sent off in the incident which led to James Ward-Prowse's winner, hauling down Stuart Armstrong on the edge when he was virtually last man. As far as Saints go, Ward-Prowse's two fine free-kicks in two weekends strengthen his argument for a call-up, but it would still be a shock, while Josh Sims is surely one for the future after his MOTM second-half cameo.

Highlights from Manchester City's 3-1 win over Watford in the Premier League. Raheem Sterling scored a second-half hat-trick, including a controversial opener, as Manchester City beat Watford 3-1 to move four points clear in the title race. Sterling's first goal, 40 seconds after half-time, was initially ruled out for offside but after a long discussion, referee Paul Tierney overturned his own decision, with Daryl Janmaat's attempted block just before Sterling struck ruled as having played the winger onside. There was nothing controversial about his second goal which arrived less than four minutes later, when Riyad Mahrez played the ball across the six-yard box and left it on a plate for him to slot home. He made it three for the second Premier League hat-trick of his career just before the hour mark (59), showing superb composure to take David Silva's pass in his stride before riding two challenges and dinking the ball over Ben Foster. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (6), Kompany (5), Otamendi (6), Zinchenko (7), D Silva (8), B Silva (7), Gundogan (7), Mahrez (7), Aguero (6), Sterling (9). Subs: Sane (7), Jesus (7), Foden (n/a). Watford: Foster (6), Janmaat (7), Britos (7), Kabasele (7), Masina (5), Doucoure (6), Cleverley (5), Capoue (6), Femenia (6), Gray (5), Success (6). Subs: Deulofeu (7), Deeney (7), Cathcart (n/a). Man of the match: Raheem Sterling A much-altered Watford team, who had made seven changes for the game, pulled one back when substitute Gerard Deulofeu slotted the ball under Ederson from Troy Deeney's flick-on, but that was as good as it got for the Hornets as City moved four points clear of Liverpool, who play Burnley on Sunday, with a goal difference now superior by seven. Before Sterling had broken the deadlock, Watford had looked relatively comfortable despite resting the majority of their first team ahead of next weekend's FA Cup quarter-final with Crystal Palace. David Silva came the closest to opening the scoring, firing just wide from a Riyad Mahrez cross, although replays then spared Tierney's blushes after showing he had handled the ball in the process of heading it beyond the far post. Raheem Sterling celebrates his opener with Man City team-mates Watford failed to register a shot on target in the first 45 minutes, but stood strong against wave after wave of City pressure, with the hosts far from their fluid best and lacking the slick movement and passing with which they have become synonymous. That resistance finally broke 40 seconds into the second half, but the Hornets had a strong case for arguing that their defence was breached illegally. Sergio Aguero brought the ball down and played it into Sterling's path, but he was in a clearly offside position when he appeared to lob it into the far corner. Pep Guardiola embraces Raheem Sterling as he comes off in the second half The assistant referee's flag was raised and Tierney decided against giving the goal, but spent several minutes with his official discussing the details before it was decided a sliding tackle from Janmaat, which got a nick on the ball just as Sterling was about to shoot and took it onto his standing leg, had played him onside. Javi Gracia was left incensed on the bench while his players appeared still shell-shocked by the time City doubled their lead four minutes later. David Silva picked out Mahrez on the right of the area, he skipped to the byline and pulled the ball across into the middle and leaving Sterling a simple finish. Team news Man City made two enforced changes, bringing in Riyad Mahrez and Nicolas Otamendi for the injured Kevin De Bruyne and John Stones. There were some seven changes for Watford though, with Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu both benched and three of the back four changed from their win over Leicester last week. Watford still stuck to their gameplan and defended deep, but a third followed just before the hour mark which was all down to Sterling's work. David Silva slipped the ball inside Janmaat, and after racing onto it Sterling could easily have rushed his finish - but stepped through two challenges and beat Foster and take home the match ball. Gracia finally attempted a throw of the dice in the form of Deeney and Deulofeu, who combined within 30 seconds of coming on to blot City's copybook. Deeney's flick found his in-form striking partner and the Spaniard scored his fourth goal in as many games for a glimmer of hope. But City breezed their way to victory, nearly adding a fourth when Gabriel Jesus left Ben Foster on his backside but was denied by a fine sliding challenge from Christian Kabasele, ensuring City will end the weekend top of the Premier League. Match facts Manchester City have won 10 of their last 11 Premier League games (L1), and are on the longest current winning run in the competition (6 games). Watford have lost all 10 of their Premier League games against sides starting the day top of the table, scoring just nine goals and conceding 29. Manchester City have won 45 of the 48 points available to them in home games this season (W15 D0 L1), losing only against Crystal Palace in December. Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez has been directly involved in eight goals in his last seven Premier League appearances against Watford (6 goals, 2 assists). Manchester City's Raheem Sterling scored his hat-trick in 13 minutes and 12 seconds - the fastest in the Premier League since Romelu Lukaku's for Everton v Sunderland in September 2016 (11:37). Manchester City attacker Raheem Sterling has been directly involved in 22 home goals in all competitions this season, more than any other Premier League player. Raheem Sterling has scored in 52 games in all competitions for Manchester City, not losing any of those games (W50 D2) and winning each of the last 34. Gerard Deufoleu's goal for Watford came just 17 seconds after the Spaniard came off the bench, the fastest sub goal in the Premier League since Sammy Ameobi netted for Newcastle against Tottenham in October 2014 (8 seconds). Gerard Deufoleu has had a hand in six goals in his last four Premier League appearances for Watford (4 goals, 2 assists), as many as he managed in his previous 19 games this season for the Hornets. Man of the match - Raheem Sterling Who else? Raheem Sterling showcased the quality and consistency of finishing Pep Guardiola has helped add to his game with his first hat-trick in more than three years, with the third showing the kind of composure he rarely showed in younger years. It showed how high Guardiola views his potential that the Man City boss' first reaction to his hat-trick in his post-match interview was to say \"he can do better\". On this evidence, that would be impressive. What's next? Watford host Crystal Palace in next Saturday's early kick-off (12.15pm) in the FA Cup quarter-finals, while Man City have a Champions League last-16 second leg with Schalke to look forward to on

manager as Watford earned a 2-1 win in the Premier League on Sunday. Rodgers' debut saw him return to the club where got his first managerial job after being appointed at Leicester on Tuesday, but it was a terrible start for the former Celtic boss as Troy Deeney scored inside five minutes. Jamie Vardy looked to have secured the draw when he slotted home in the 75th minute, but a lack of concentration from Leicester's defence saw Gray score the winner in the third minute of four added on. The win sees Watford stay in eighth but go level on points with seventh-placed Wolves, while Leicester remain in 11th with Rodgers yet to win his first game in charge of any team he has managed in English football (D2, L3). Player ratings Watford: Foster (7), Janmaat (7), Mariappa (7), Cathcart (7), Holebas (7), Doucoure (7), Hughes (6), Capoue (7), Pereyra (6), Deulofeu (7), Deeney (8).

Subs used: Demarai Gray (5), Mendy (n/a), Iheanacho (n/a). Man of the match: Troy Deeney. Watford came racing out of the traps at Vicarage Road as they looked to make amends for a 5-0 defeat to Liverpool in midweek. Kasper Schmeichel was forced into a point-blank save inside three minutes after Adrian Mariappa poked a Jose Holebas free-kick towards goal. Gerard Deulofeu also tried his luck with the rebound, but Wes Morgan was there to see it behind. The hosts took the lead two minutes later when Deulofeu's sumptuous free-kick was glanced home by Deeney as Rodgers began his Leicester tenure in the worst of fashions. However, Leicester soon found their feet and began to match Watford, although this made for little goalmouth action. The hosts did go close in the 24th minute as Deeney's cross found Abdoulaye Doucoure in the area but Jonny Evans marked him well and managed to poke the ball from his path before the midfielder could convert. Team news Both sides made one change from their midweek games. Jose Holebas came back into the XI after suspension, replacing Adam Masina, while Brendan Rodgers brought in Wes Morgan for Demarai Gray. Watford could have added a second just seven minutes after the break. Deulofeu beat three Leicester players to find Roberto Pereyra, who found Doucoure and his strong shot was kept out superbly by Schmeichel. Vardy scored the first goal of Rodgers' reign to get Leicester level in the 75th minute. Youri Tielemans' superb through ball found him and had too much for his marker Mariappa as he chipped the ball over the oncoming Foster into the net. Leicester could have nicked a winner as the clock ticked to 90 minutes, but James Maddison's fine cross could only be put wide by returning captain Morgan. However, Watford did take their chance three minutes later to snatch all three points. Jamie Vardy scored the equaliser for Leicester at Vicarage Road The Foxes defence were caught when Etienne Capoue collected a Schmeichel goal-kick and played in Deeney on the right-hand side. With his first touch, the Watford captain hooked the ball forward for Gray, who had acres of space in between Morgan and Harry Maguire, before slotting home past Schmeichel. Opta stats Leicester City have now lost three Premier League matches thanks to a 90th-minute goal this season, more such defeats than any other side (also v Cardiff and Wolves). Leicester City have now conceded five Premier League goals inside the opening five minutes of matches this season, the joint-most in the division alongside Burnley. Only Sergio Aguero (10) has been directly involved in more Premier League goals in 2019 than Watford striker Troy Deeney (eight - five goals, three assists). Jamie Vardy has scored the first Premier League goal under each of Leicester's last four permanent managers (Ranieri, Shakespeare, Puel and Rodgers). Brendan Rodgers is the first Leicester City manager to lose their first Premier League match in charge of the club since Dave Bassett suffered defeat away at Chelsea back in October 2001. The managers Javi Gracia: \"You have the reward at the end of the game. I thought we played well in the first half - better than the second. We started creating very good chances with Gerard [Deulofeu] after we scored and maybe in the second, we lost the possession and we had to defend. We then scored in the last minute and it is something amazing for us. \"There are nine games left and we already have 43 points so who knows what is going to happen in the next games, but what I can feel is the ambition, the character of the group and they always want more and more.\" 2:28 Javi Gracia was delighted with Watford's winner against Leicester and praised Troy Deeney for his ambition and character Javi Gracia was delighted with Watford's winner against Leicester and praised Troy Deeney for his ambition and character Brendan Rodgers: \"I was so pleased with some of the quality in the game today from the players. It's a tough place to come here and we're obviously disappointed to lose the game late on, but there are good signs from today. We'll keep getting better and do some more hard work next week. \"I said to the players today that I didn't have any expectations from them, and I didn't want them to feel the pressure. I just wanted them to go and play because when there is change, sometimes it can be difficult.\" 3:41 Brendan Rodgers praised Leicester's team spirit, despite losing 2-1 at Watford in his first game since joining from Celtic Brendan Rodgers praised Leicester's team spirit, despite losing 2-1 at Watford in his first game since joining from Celtic Man of the match - Troy Deeney There were plenty of laughs and smiles for Deeney's old friend and fellow captain Morgan before the game, but on the field, the Watford striker was nothing but ruthless. He got Watford off to the best start with his glancing header and showed his importance with the number of fouls committed against him. Watford striker Troy Deeney put in a man of the match performance But while the decisions did not always go his way from referee Jon Moss, he showed great composure and leadership to keep pushing Watford forward and it paid off when he set Gray up for the winner. He worked tirelessly, chased down even the most hopeless of balls and was the driving force behind Watford's win on Sunday. After the game, manager Javi Gracia said: \"I think everybody knows how important Troy is for us. On and off the pitch, his personality, ambition and character for the game and out of the game as well. Today, he got the assist for the second [goal] and I think all of them made very good work.\" What's next? Watford will travel to Manchester City on Saturday in the late kick-off while Leicester host Fulham in a 3pm game."},{"date": "03/03/2019", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 24900, "home_team":

over Fulham in the Premier League Scott Parker's first game in charge of Fulham ended in defeat as Chelsea won 2-1 at Craven Cottage to maintain their top-four challenge. Gonzalo Higuain opened the scoring after 16 minutes for Chelsea, who recalled goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga after he was dropped in midweek following his refusal to be substituted in the Carabao Cup final. Calum Chambers took advantage of some poor marking to equalise for the relegation-threatened hosts in the 27th minute, but Chelsea quickly restored their lead with a fine finish from Jorginho.

Chelsea also have a game in hand on United, so hold their destiny in their own hands, while Fulham's fate almost looks sealed despite an encouraging second-half display under Parker, who was appointed in midweek to replace Claudio Ranieri. Fulham are 10 points from safety with nine games left to play, two of which are against Liverpool and Manchester City later this month. 2:56 Maurizio Sarri feels Gonzalo Higuain is not at his peak and is still improving as he adjusts to the Premier League Maurizio Sarri feels Gonzalo Higuain is not at his peak and is still improving as he adjusts to the Premier League They fell behind in the 20th minute against Chelsea when Higuain, who had spurned two earlier chances, finished from Cesar Azpilicueta's right-wing cross. Kepa, who was fortunate to get away with dropping a cross before the opening goal, made a sharp save to tip over a volley from Aleksandar Mitrovic. But Fulham levelled from the subsequent corner as Chambers was left wide open at the back post and volleyed home. Chelsea soon responded as Jorginho produced a fine finish from the edge of the box, and the visitors had chances to extend their lead before the break. Kepa Arrizabalaga produced a solid performance on his return Higuain blazed over from a good position before Sergio Rico saved from Eden Hazard and then made a superb stop to deny Higuain in injury-time. Chelsea continued to threaten at the start of the second half as Rico saved from Hazard and Willian. Team news Scott Parker made just one change from Fulham’s last match as Sessegnon replaced Anguissa. Chelsea made five changes from their midweek win over Tottenham, with Kepa returning in goal to replace Caballero. Emerson, Christensen, Barkley and Willian also started, replacing Alonso, Luiz, Kovacic and Pedro. But Fulham raised their level on the hour mark, with Mitrovic firing wide from outside the box and Kepa pushing away a shot from Tom Cairney. Kepa was called into action again in the 89th minute to save Mitrovic's header, and Fulham then had a goal ruled out for offside when Ryan Sessegnon finished from close range in injury-time. Opta stats Chelsea are unbeaten in 18 Premier League games against Fulham (W11 D7) - only against Spurs (28 games between 1992 and 2006) have they had a longer unbeaten run versus an opponent in the competition. Fulham have become the first side to lose 10 London derbies in the top-flight in a single season. Chelsea scored their first away league goal in 2019 - they were the 91st of the 92 English league clubs to do so, leaving only Huddersfield Town without one. Eden Hazard became the third Chelsea player to both score and assist 50 Premier League goals (81 goals, 50 assists) after Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba. Fulham's Calum Chambers' last four Premier League goals have been scored under four different managers (Arsene Wenger, Steve Agnew, Claudio Ranieri and Scott Parker). Eden Hazard has been involved in at least one goal in all four of his Premier League appearances against newly-promoted sides for Chelsea this season (3 goals, 3 assists). Fulham midfielder Kevin McDonald has ended on the winning side in just three of his 38 Premier League games (7.9%); among players to have played as many as 38 Premier League matches, only Rudy Gestede (3.9%, two wins in 51) has a lower win percentage. Fulham have lost more matches than any other side in the top five European leagues in all competitions during 2019 (9). Man of the match - Jorginho Kepa was solid on his return to the team - aside from a careless dropped cross in the first half - but Jorginho was excellent. His finish for the second goal was composed and he could have had a couple of assists as he twice played balls over the top to expose Fulham's defence. Having been booed by some Chelsea fans a few weeks ago, the midfielder was substituted off to the sound of supporters chanting his name. What's next? Fulham travel to Leicester next Saturday before home games against Liverpool (March 17) and Manchester City (March 30), both of which are live on Sky Sports. Chelsea play Dynamo Kiev at home in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 clash on Thursday. They then face Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday, live on Sky Sports."},{"date": "03/03/2019", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39335, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name":

Seven minutes after the break, Dominic Calvert-Lewin found the target for the first time, but his header was straight at Alisson. Liverpool responded as Trent Alexander-Arnold fired a free-kick straight at Pickford and Divock Origi pulled a shot wide at the near post, before Joel Matip released Salah through at the end of a marauding run, only for Michael Keane to nick the ball off his toes just as he prepared to pull the trigger. Team news Everton welcomed Kurt Zouma back from suspension while Bernard replaced Richarlison as Marco Silva made two changes following the win at Cardiff.

Roberto Firmino was introduced after the hour-mark and he almost had an immediate impact as he combined with Mane and Salah on the counter and lofted a cross to the back post, but Mane failed to find the target with a header. Fabinho spurned a gilt-edged chance to put Liverpool into the lead on 67 minutes when he opted against shooting first time after Virgil van Dijk's knockdown in the Everton area, allowing Seamus Coleman to intervene with a last-gasp challenge.

Both sides pushed for a late winner, Van Dijk unable to stretched far enough to get his head on a cross into the Everton area, but there was no late drama like the reverse fixture in December, a frustrating draw handing City the initiative in the Premier League title race. Opta stats 34 of the 200 league meetings between Everton and Liverpool have finished goalless, 15 more 0-0s than any other fixture in English league history. Liverpool have failed to score in two of their last three Premier League games, having failed to find the net in just one of their previous 27 in the competition. Three of the last five Premier League meetings between Everton and Liverpool at Goodison Park have finished 0-0. This is the first time Liverpool have not finished a day top of the Premier League table having played the same number of games as Manchester City since December 7th. Liverpool didn't record a single shot on target after Trent Alexander-Arnold's effort in the 54th minute of this match. 67% of Everton's three shots on target in this match came via their substitutes (one for Richarlison, one for Cenk Tosun). Mohamed Salah has gone three Premier League games without a goal for the first time as a Liverpool player. The managers 4:00 SILVA Post Match.m2t SILVA Post Match.m2t Marco Silva: \"Both teams wanted to win, both teams had dangerous crosses, but we were the better team in the second half. What I wanted to give the fans was the three points, but we gave them a good performance and desire. We showed a good attitude and they want to see that always. The atmosphere in the stadium was fantastic. The fans can push our team to win, not just this game but any game - they were the 12th player on the pitch.\" 5:43 Jurgen Klopp shared his thoughts after his Liverpool side drew 0-0 with Everton that meant Manchester City remained at the top of the Premier League table. Jurgen Klopp shared his thoughts after his Liverpool side drew 0-0 with Everton that meant Manchester City remained at the top of the Premier League table. Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a difficult game for different reasons and a wild opponent. It was a game that was difficult to control yet we had three or four really big chances with Salah and Fabinho, I don't remember them having any chances. We have to take the situation as it is. We have to show stability and fight for the result.\" Man of the Match - Virgil van Dijk It wasn't the result Liverpool wanted but yet another flawless performance from the Dutchman would have eased any lingering disappointment. Everton were full of effort and energy and up for the battle as their title-chasing neighbours made the trip across Stanley Park, but Van Dijk's calming influence at the back singlehandedly kept them at arm's length as the Reds claimed a 17th league clean sheet of the season.

Highlights from Tottenham's 1-1 draw with Arsenal in the Premier League. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang saw a last-gasp penalty saved as Arsenal drew 1-1 against Tottenham to leave Spurs four points ahead of their north London rivals in the top-four race. Aaron Ramsey, playing in his final north London derby before leaving to join Juventus in the summer, finished on the counter-attack after 16 minutes to put the Gunners ahead. Spurs levelled from the penalty spot in the 74th minute through Harry Kane after he had been barged over by Shkodran Mustafi. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Trippier (5), Alderweireld (6), Sanchez (5), Vertonghen (7), Rose (6), Wanyama (6), Sissoko (6), Eriksen (5), Son (5), Kane (7) Subs: Lamela (5), Llorente (5) Arsenal: Leno (7), Sokratis (8), Mustafi (5), Koscielny (6), Monreal (6), Guendouzi (6), Xhaka (6), Ramsey (7), Mkhitaryan (6), Iwobi (5), Lacazette (5) Subs: Torreira (3), Aubameyang (4), Ozil (5) Man of the match:Sokratis Papastathopoulos Arsenal might have been aggrieved as Kane was offside before he was fouled, but they spurned the chance to snatch victory when Lloris saved Aubameyang's penalty in the 89th minute and Jan Vertonghen blocked the follow-up shot on the line. Lucas Torreira was then shown a straight red card in injury-time for a foul on Danny Rose. The result maintains Tottenham's four-point advantage over Arsenal in the Premier League, but Manchester United moved above Arsenal into fourth with victory over Southampton, while Chelsea face Fulham on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Hugo Lloris saves Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's penalty Spurs, though, should feel they escaped with a point after they looked to be heading for a third straight defeat following a largely flat display. While there was surprise at Arsenal's team selection, the visitors started better and Alexandre Lacazette spurned a glorious chance inside the opening two minutes when he scuffed a volley wide after the ball deflected to him kindly in the box. But Arsenal did take the lead in the 16th minute after catching Tottenham on the break. Lacazette collected the ball on halfway and played through for Ramsey, who was all alone in the Spurs half and coolly finished by taking the ball around Hugo Lloris and then tapping into the empty net. Aaron Ramsey celebrates putting Arsenal 1-0 up Spurs struggled for a response against a compact Arsenal defence. Harry Kane had a goal disallowed for offside but otherwise the hosts enjoyed plenty of possession without seriously threatening until late in the half when Bernd Leno made a stunning double save to deny Christian Eriksen at point-blank range and then tip over the follow-up shot from Moussa Sissoko. Spurs still looked subdued at the start of the second half and could have fallen further behind as Lacazette sliced wide from 12 yards out. Harry Kane celebrates his second-half equaliser Toby Alderweireld volleyed into the side-netting from a free-kick but, just as Spurs' hopes looked to be fading, they won a penalty when Mustafi barged Kane in the back. Kane, who was offside when the free-kick was curled into the box, converted from the spot. There was more drama to follow as Davinson Sanchez fouled Aubameyang in the box in the 89th minute and the referee pointed to the spot. Aubameyang saw his penalty saved and Vertonghen blocked his follow-up attempt on the line, before Torreira was sent off in injury-time for catching Rose late. Opta stats The result ended Tottenham's run of 28 Premier League games without a draw, the third longest run ever without a draw from the start of a top-flight season. Arsenal remain the only side in the Premier League yet to register an away clean sheet this season. Meetings between these sides in the Premier League have seen both teams score on 36 occasions - more than any other fixture in the competition. No fixture in Premier League history has seen more goals from penalties than Arsenal v Spurs (18 - level with Everton v Newcastle). Aaron Ramsey has been directly involved in three of Arsenal's last four Premier League goals against Tottenham (1 goal, 2 assists). Arsenal's Alexandre Lacazette has registered a goal involvement in four consecutive Premier League games for the first time ever (3 goals, 1 assist). Since his Premier League debut in August 2017, Alexandre Lacazette has been directly involved in 36 goals in the competition for Arsenal, more than any other player (26 goals, 10 assists). Tottenham striker Harry Kane has scored nine goals in nine Premier League north London derbies, eclipsing Emmanuel Adebayor (8). Harry Kane has scored nine of Tottenham's last 12 Premier League goals against Arsenal; only Wayne Rooney (12) and Robbie Fowler (10) have scored more Premier League goals against the Gunners. Lucas Torreira is the first player to pick up a red card as a substitute for Arsenal in the Premier League since Robin Van Persie against Stoke in November 2008.

Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was a fantastic game, exciting game with great atmosphere with two teams that wanted to play and win the game.

The adaption to the match was good and our moments in 90 minutes were strong, we could have won this match.\" Man of the match - Sokratis Papastathopoulos The Arsenal centre-back produced an assured display and kept Harry Kane quiet for most of the match. He made a key intervention in the first half to prevent Kane finishing from close range and played an important role in keeping Spurs at bay. What's next? Tottenham face Borussia Dortmund in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on Tuesday, leading 3-0 from the first leg at Wembley.

Bournemouth 0-1 Manchester City Bournemouth 0-1 Manchester City Riyad Mahrez scored the only goal of the game as Manchester City beat Bournemouth to return to the top of the Premier League table. It was a far-from-vintage performance from City, who faced a well-drilled Bournemouth defence, but Mahrez slotted home in the 55th minute to hand the visitors the win. Pep Guardiola was dealt a blow, though, as Kevin De Bruyne was forced to come off just before the break after picking up another injury, with the manager saying after the game that it was \"muscular\". City go two points clear of Liverpool - who play Everton on Sunday, live on Sky Sports - at the top of the Premier League while Bournemouth remain in 12th and winless in five league outings. City dominated possession in the first half, but did not create many clear cut chances. They had their first real sight of goal in the 19th minute as Bernardo Silva slotted the ball to De Bruyne down the right-hand side. He then cut the ball back for David Silva in the area, but he could only pull his shot wide. Player ratings Bournemouth: Boruc (7), Clyne (6), Mepham (7), Ake (7), Smith (6), Simpson (7), Daniels (6), Surman (6), Brooks (6), Fraser (6), King (6). Subs used: Mousset (5), Ibe (n/a), Rico (n/a). Man City: Ederson (5), Walker (7), Stones (6), Otamendi (7), Zinchenko (8), Gundogan (6), De Bruyne (7), D Silva (7), B Silva (6), Sterling (7), Aguero (6). Subs used: Mahrez (7), Kompany (6), Jesus (n/a). Man of the match: Oleksandr Zinchenko. Just after the half an hour mark, Nicolas Otamendi could have put City ahead in style. De Bruyne delivered a corner and with Otamendi having peeled away from his marker, he attempted an audacious bicycle kick but he sent it just over the crossbar. City were dealt a blow on the stroke of half-time as De Bruyne went off injured. As he made a pass, he appeared to pull a muscle and signalled that he needed to be replaced. He looked disappointed as he made his way off, having already missed two spells this season with injuries, and was replaced by Mahrez. Team news Bournemouth made three changes with Charlie Daniels, David Brooks and Jack Simpson coming into the XI. Man City also made four changes from their midweek game, bringing in Kyle Walker, John Stones, Bernardo Silva and Raheem Sterling. And it was the Algeria international who finally put Man City ahead in the 55th minute. After some good inter-link play between David Silva and Oleksandr Zinchenko, the former picked out a waiting Mahrez on the right-hand side. He then hit home on the angle, sending the ball into the bottom, far corner. The remainder of the game continued much like the first half - plenty of Man City possession but few clear cut chances. However, the visitors did go close twice in the final 10 minutes. In the 81st minute, Sergio Aguero floated a dangerous ball into the area that, although appearing to be intended for Mahrez, pinged onto the crossbar before going wide with Boruc getting a fingertip onto it. The Bournemouth goalkeeper made a wonderful save not long after as Mahrez headed in his direction from point-blank range, but Boruc pushed the effort away. Opta stats Manchester City's 100% per cent-win record in eight games against Bournemouth is the best in English top-flight history. Bournemouth failed to record a shot against Manchester City, the first time they've failed to register an attempt in a Premier League game. Man City's David Silva has provided 80 Premier League assists - the joint-eighth best tally in the competition (level with David Beckham). Five of Riyad Mahrez's six Premier League goals for Man City have come away from home. Kevin De Bruyne was injured towards the end of the first half The managers Eddie Howe: \"I think we've got our respectability back after Arsenal. We showed that we can defend, that we are organised and we showed that we've got character and I think if we show those things between now and the end of the season, we'll be fine. \"It was a tough game, we didn't have the ball today as much as that pains me to say because we want the ball, but even the most optimistic among the coaching staff knew we wouldn't have the ball. 1:42 Eddie Howe was proud of the way his Bournemouth players responded to their midweek defeat to Arsenal, despite losing 1-0 to Manchester City Eddie Howe was proud of the way his Bournemouth players responded to their midweek defeat to Arsenal, despite losing 1-0 to Manchester City \"Then it was about how we were going to defend, our ability to withhold pressure and get our organisation right and I think we did that for the majority of the game.\" Pep Guardiola: \"It was incredible, maybe one of the best performances we have ever played in our time together. \"There were ten players behind in every movement, there was the second balls, the set-pieces, the throw-ins - everyone was focused to control all aspects of the football so it's incredible. We played 25 games in 93 days, with one game every three or six days at that level, so it was incredible.

Admittedly, he had little to do in his primarily defensive role, but he produced some marvellous passes for his team-mates and was instrumental in the build-up for the winner, playing some neat stuff with David Silva. Speaking about Zinchenko after the game, Guardiola said: \"He is playing top with the ball and without the ball. Usually players are playing because they deserve it and [he deserves it after] all of this season, and last season as well. When he plays, he is committed, smart, intelligent, he understands everything and with the ball, he has incredible quality.\" What's next?

Brighton's 1-0 home win over Huddersfield in the Premier League Highlights of Brighton's 1-0 home win over Huddersfield in the Premier League Brighton won their first game of 2019 after narrowly overcoming Premier League strugglers Huddersfield 1-0 at the Amex Stadium on Saturday. Substitute Florin Andone's close-range header in the 79th minute proved the difference to end the hosts' seven-game winless streak. Brighton came close to scoring in the first half through Alireza Jahanbakhsh, but his effort cracked off the crossbar. In the second half, Andone was denied by a fine stop from Jonas Lossl seven minutes before he scored the game's only goal. A deserved victory for Chris Hughton's side means they sit in 15th on 30 points. Huddersfield lie in 20th, 13 points off safety with nine games of the season to go. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (7), Montoya (6), Duffy (6), Dunk (6), Bernardo (7), Stephens (6), Propper (6), Knockaert (7), Bissouma (6), Murray (5), Jahanbakhsh (7) Subs: Andone (8), Izquierdo (N/A) Kayal (N/A) Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Bacuna (7), Schindler (6), Kongolo (6), Durm (6), Stankovic (6), Hogg (6), Billing (5), Pritchard (5), Grant (5), Mounie (5) Subs: Mooy (6), Kachunga (6), Hadergjonaj (6) Man of the match: Florin Andone In a cagey opening half, the first shot on target did not arrive until the 30th-minute mark when Alex Pritchard's swerving effort from the edge of the box was fumbled by Mathew Ryan, before he quickly punched away the loose ball to deny a rebound. Brighton and Huddersfield played out a cagey first half Seven minutes later and Jahanbakhsh produced the best chance of the half, but the crossbar denied the Iran international his first Premier League goal after he sweetly struck a dipping effort from a tight angle. Juninho Bacuna, who impressed while playing in an unfamiliar right-back position, had a long-range attempt on goal of his own on the stroke of half-time, but Ryan got down to parry away the 21-year-old's driven shot. Team news Bernardo, Yves Bissouma and Alireza Jahanbakhsh came in for Gaetan Bong, Solly March and Pascal Gross (injured). For Huddersfield, Demeaco Duhaney (injured) dropped out for Juninho Bacuna. Glenn Murray was presented with a good opportunity to break the deadlock in the 52nd minute as Brighton pushed more men forward, but Bacuna slid in to make a vital block before he could get a goal-bound effort away from six-yards out. Six minutes later and Jahanbakhsh came close again, but Lossl denied him at the near post. In the 70th minute, the Swiss goalkeeper was called into action once more to bat away a ferocious effort on goal from Andone with a strong right hand. Finally, 12 minutes from time, Brighton got the goal - and the three points - they deserved through Andone, who nodded in Anthony Knockaert's dangerous cross from point-blank range. Opta stats Brighton's win ended a run of seven Premier League games without a victory (D2 L5). Huddersfield have played seven league matches against Brighton at the Amex Stadium without winning, more than any other side. Brighton are unbeaten in seven home league meetings with Huddersfield Town (W4 D3 L0) since a 2-3 defeat in League One in April 2011. Huddersfield have lost 14 of their last 16 Premier League games (W1 D1). Only Derby in 07/08 (14) scored fewer goals after 29 games of a Premier League season than Huddersfield in 2018-19 (15). Anthony Knockaert has registered two assists in his last three Premier League games for Brighton, after managing just one in his last 15 before that. The managers 2:22 Chris Hughton says every win will feel big given Brighton's recent run of form Chris Hughton says every win will feel big given Brighton's recent run of form Chris Hughton: \"It feels like a big win. Every win we will have from now until the end of the season will feel like one but particularly in the run that we've had. \"We've been unfortunate at times and today was a bit similar to the type of games we've had. You need those moments to go for you. We had that with the goal. \"We should have had the moment with the penalty appeal but I think we got our margins right today.\" 1:27 Jan Siewert felt Brighton's free-kick which led to Florin Andone's goal was what 'killed the game' for his side Jan Siewert felt Brighton's free-kick which led to Florin Andone's goal was what 'killed the game' for his side Jan Siewert: \"We lost the game because of a free-kick. \"Although I knew that it would be hard because of the Wolves game where everybody emptied the tank, everybody was fighting but we lost the game in one situation. \"We were not switched on and the free-kick killed us today.\" Man of the Match - Florin Andone Florin Andone scored the only goal of the game after coming off the bench Andone replaced a largely-disappointing Glenn Murray in the 57th minute and he made a game-changing impact in a short space of time. He forced Lossl into making a great save in the 70th minute; nine minutes before scoring the game-winning goal. In the 83rd minute Brighton arguably should have had a penalty when the Romania international was bundled over in the box by Terence Kongolo as the former Deportivo striker continually caused the Huddersfield backline problems. What's next? Brighton travel to Selhurst Park to take on Crystal Palace on Saturday, March 9 - live on Sky Sports Premier League. Huddersfield host Bournemouth on the same day."},{"date": "02/03/2019", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance": 19223, "home_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [],

at Burnley in the Premier League Crystal Palace moved eight points clear of relegation trouble after an impressive 3-1 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor. Jeff Schlupp's cross was turned in by Phil Bardsley against the run of play on 15 minutes before Michy Batshuayi met Aaron Wan-Bissaka's low ball to flash in a superb second (48) for the visitors. After a run of eight league games unbeaten, Sean Dyche's side have now lost two in succession, with Wilfried Zaha's trademark finish (76) putting the seal on another deserved away success. Ashley Barnes headed in a consolation from Ashley Westwood's cross (90), but the Clarets remain in relegation trouble, five points above 18th-placed Cardiff with Palace sitting in 13th position. Burnley's Phillip Bardsley reacts to scoring his own goal after 15 minutes Player ratings Burnley: Heaton (6), Taylor (5), Mee (5), Tarkowski (6), Bardsley (5), Westwood (7), Cork (6), Hendrick (5), McNeil (5), Barnes (6), Wood (6). Subs: Gudmundsson (6), Brady (5), Crouch (6). Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), van Aanholt (6), Wan-Bissaka (7), Dann (8), Tomkins (8), Kouyate (7), Milivojevic (7), Meyer (6), Schlupp (7), Zaha (8), Batshuayi (6). Subs: Townsend (6), Benteke (n/a), McArthur (6). Man of the match: Wilfried Zaha. Burnley enjoyed plenty of early possession but Wayne Hennessey - on his return to the Palace goal in place of Vincente Guaita for his first Premier League appearance since January 12 - was untroubled from Dwight McNeil's curled free-kick. With Palace's first meaningful foray into the Burnley half, the returning Cheikhou Kouyate found Zaha down the left and after Schlupp was picked out at the far post, Bardsley inadvertently deflected the pull-back past the static Tom Heaton. Such a fortuitous goal did not appear to unsettle Burnley's rhythm as they continued to create chances and dominate proceedings. Scott Dann did well to block Barnes' shot from Westwood's pass before Hennessey was forced to tip the midfielder's swirling corner away from underneath his own crossbar. Ashley Barnes missed a good chance in the second period but Burnley were second best Team news Westwood was back in the Burnley midfield having missed the 2-0 defeat to Newcastle, as Gudmundsson dropped to the bench. It was the one change to the side made by Dyche. Hodgson made five changes to the Palace side that were beaten 3-1 by Manchester United in midweek. Hennessey was back in goal, Dann and Wan-Bissaka started in defence while Meyer and Kouyate came into midfield. The interval came at a good time for Palace, and the second half had barely started when they doubled their advantage in clinical fashion. There was good fortune about their opener, but Batshuayi showed his class for his second strike since joining on loan from Chelsea. Zaha was involved once more as he found the over-lapping Wan-Bissaka, and in front of the watching Gareth Southgate, the youngster's pinpoint cross was crashed past Heaton by the Belgian forward. Michy Batshuayi thunders in Palace's second at Turf Moor Palace were now fully in the mood, but it took a really important block from Dann to deny Barnes an instant response from Chris Wood's knock-down. Batshuayi then missed a glorious chance to double his tally when his touch deserted him with only Heaton to beat, but Zaha soon added to Burnley's misery. The Ivorian scored his fifth goal in as many matches, and this was the pick of the bunch as he collected Kouyate's pass, turned Ben Mee and Charlie Taylor inside out before drilling a low shot beneath Heaton. Barnes rose to meet Westwood's cross as the game entered stoppage time to continue his own good form with a fifth goal in six games - but the hosts' fightback came far too late. The managers Sean Dyche: \"It was a bit of a confusing one today as we've dominated a lot of the first half. We created a lot of chances and had big moments but we weren't clinical enough overall. We got into good positions but we didn't find that last pass and that last bit of quality. \"It was a strange goal to go one down and you come in at half-time scratching your head. They score ever so early in the second half and then it's tough from thereon in. We get done by a really soft third.\" 2:18 Sean Dyche described Burnley's defeat to Palace as 'confusing' and admitted his side are 'still a work in progress' Sean Dyche described Burnley's defeat to Palace as 'confusing' and admitted his side are 'still a work in progress' Roy Hodgson: \"Wilf was good. He's always good. He's in good form at the moment. He's a dangerous player to have to mark if you're a defender when he gets the ball, because he's an extremely good dribbler and he's got not only dribbling skills, he's got strength to add to that. \"I was very happy with the way we defended throughout the game and, of course, at the other end when we were able to get hold of the ball we used it wisely and scored three good goals. Were it not for Tom Heaton making a couple of good saves we might have had another.\" Pundit reaction Phil Thompson: \"There's not so much pressure on Palace when they go away and they play on the counter-attack. In Zaha, Townsend and Batshuayi, they have got pace and they always look like they are going to score. \"Burnley had a lot of possession, but they have only got Plan A which is a diagonal ball and Tomkins dealt with that. They need to find something else, and Palace dealt with them really well. \"Palace were so comfortable it was untrue.\" 3:47 Phil Thompson felt Palace could have won by even more as they enjoyed a 'comfortable' 3-1 win at Burnley Phil Thompson felt Palace could have won by even more as they enjoyed a 'comfortable' 3-1 win at Burnley Opta stats Burnley have lost each of their last two Premier League games, after winning five and drawing three of the eight before that. Crystal Palace have won a league-high share 61 per cent of their Premier League points away from home this season (20/33). Burnley mustered 18 shots, their most in their last 38 Premier League games since managing 21 against Everton in March 2018. Crystal Palace have scored in nine consecutive Premier League games for the first time ever within a single season. Of players to appear in the Premier League this season, only Phil Jagielka (6) and Scott Dann (5) have scored more own-goals in the competition than Burnley's Phil Bardlsey (4). Crystal Palace striker Michy Batshuayi has scored in consecutive away league appearances for the first time since August 2016 (with Chelsea and Marseille). Crystal Palace's Michy Batshuayi has scored five goals in his last seven starts in all competitions for English clubs. Ashley Barnes has been directly involved in six goals in his last six Premier League appearances for Burnley, as many as he managed in his previous 25. Man of the match - Wilfried Zaha Wilfried Zaha scores a wonderful individual goal to extend Palace's lead Burnley were full of good intentions and enjoyed plenty of possession, but they lacked the penetration of their opponents, and in Zaha, Palace had the game's best player. It may have taken his sarcastic applause against Southampton last month to breathe life into the Ivorian's season, but he is making up for lost time and looks back to his best in his favoured wide position now that Batshuayi is at the club. Indeed, Zaha has had a hand in six goals in his last six Premier League games (five goals, one assist) - one more than he managed in his previous 21 (five). Sleepless nights lie in store for Mee and Taylor after they were both brilliantly sold for his superb solo strike. What's next? Burnley face Liverpool at Anfield next Sunday at noon while Crystal Palace host Brighton a day earlier, live on Sky Sports Premier League (kick-off: 12.30pm)."},{"date": "02/03/2019", "arena": "Old

Andreas Pereira celebrates his equaliser Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team move back up to fourth in the table, a point above Arsenal, while the visitors remain in 17th, two points clear of Cardiff, who also lost on Saturday afternoon. United started like a train and could have been ahead inside three minutes were it not for an excellent save from Gunn, who got down well to turn Lukaku's low drive behind for a corner. The increasingly busy Saints goalkeeper also had to be alert to deny Pereira, then Lukaku again, before the visitors stunned the United faithful by opening the scoring after 26 minutes. Yan Valery (centre) is congratulated after putting the Saints ahead There appeared little danger as Charlie Austin rolled the ball out to Valery, striding forward down the right from his wing back position. However, the Frenchman had other ideas as he beat De Gea with a long-range thunderbolt reminiscent of Fabian Schar's stunner for Newcastle against Burnley in midweek. United came out a different team after half-time, though, drawing level through Pereira's impressive 30-yard curler - the Brazilian's first Premier League goal - before Lukaku's tidy finish gave them the lead. Team news United made two changes from the team that won 3-1 at Crystal Palace on Wednesday. Marcus Rashford and Andreas Pereira started, with Diogo Dalot and Fred both dropping to the bench. But this game came too soon for Anthony Martial, who had yet to recover from a groin injury. The Saints were unchanged from the team that beat Fulham 2-0 at St Mary's on Wednesday. So that meant Danny Ings, Michael Obafemia and Mario Lemina were all still missing with injury. However, the Saints would not lie down as Ward-Prowse gave England boss Gareth Southgate another gentle nudge after beating De Gea with a beautifully struck free kick from the edge of the area. But with both sides going in search of a winner in the final quarter of an hour, it was the hosts who claimed the spoils after their Belgian striker beat Gunn with a shot into the corner of the goal, making Pogba's injury-time penalty miss irrelevant. ⚽ @SouthamptonFC have scored 10 PL goals from outside the box this season – only Tottenham (12) & Man City (11) have scored more.

The Belgium international was unfortunate not to open the scoring early on, but was not to de denied against one of his favourite opponents in the second half. The 25-year-old levelled matters with an excellent finish, before winning it late on from outside the box, meaning he now has nine Premier League goals against the Saints. ⚽ Romelu Lukaku scored his 1st PL goal from outside the box in 92 appearances, since for Everton against Crystal Palace in September 2016 pic.twitter.com/LYAW4qQ4OV — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) March 2, 2019 Pundit - Charlie Nicholas Sky Sports pundit Charlie Nicholas says Solskjaer's United benefited from some good fortune in their 3-2 win against Southampton. 5:34 Charlie Nicholas says Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's Manchester United benefited from some good fortune in their 3-2 win against Southampton.

Diogo Jota netted a goal-of-the-season contender in the 16th minute after a flowing move involving Morgan Gibbs-White and Raul Jimenez. Benfica loanee Jimenez doubled the lead on 18 minutes having been teed up by the unselfish Jota, following Sol Bamba's error. The result cements seventh place for Wolves, while Cardiff remain two points from safety in 18th after a third Premier League defeat in a row. 9 - Diogo Jota has been directly involved in nine goals in his last seven games in all competitions at Molineux for Wolves (5 goals, 4 assists). Catalyst. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) March 2, 2019 With Nuno Espirito Santo having admitted Wolves' attention is already on the FA Cup quarter-final against Manchester United in a fortnight, Cardiff had an opportunity to galvanise their survival bid. Team news Five changes for Wolves from the loss to Huddersfield. John Ruddy started as expected, while Matt Doherty, Ruben Neves, Jonny and Joao Moutinho all had to settle for a place on the bench. Four alterations made by Cardiff. Victor Camarasa returned as predicted and Oumar Niasse started after being ineligible against parent club Everton. Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves started on the bench and the volume of changes made by the hosts appeared to affect their nervy start to the game. Cardiff could well have hit the front inside seven minutes when John Ruddy - making his first Premier League appearance in 1,021 days in place of Rui Patricio - almost spilled Aron Gunnarsson's effort into his own net. Diogo Jota celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game What would VAR have changed? Referee Andre Marriner did not even award a foul when Sean Morrison knocked Diogo Jota to the floor in the first half with a forearm smash more fitting of the WWE, and would surely have been cleared up the video technology. But Wolves then took complete control with two goals in a flash, first as Portuguese attacker Jota finished off a flowing move including Jimenez and the elusive Morgan Gibbs-White which cut the visitors apart.

Leander Dendoncker then hit the post from a Gibbs-White corner as Cardiff threatened to cave in. Sean Morrison was fortunate not to be dismissed for a forearm smash on Jota, before Ryan Bennett escaped a second booking before half-time for a lunge on Joe Bennett. Nuno Espirito Santo's side are now comfortably in the top half Cardiff's torment was compounded when they lost defender Bamba to an ankle injury which forced him to be stretchered from the field. After the break, Wolves had numerous opportunities to add to their lead as Cardiff failed to muster a second-half comeback. Adama Traore twice missed the target with efforts from outside the box, while Bluebirds 'keeper Etheridge made a series of fine stops to save the away side's blushes. It was another nightmare afternoon for Neil Warnock and Cardiff The 29-year-old made a fine close-range save to keep out Jimenez after substitute Matt Doherty's tricky run, before Ruben Vinagre forced Etheridge into turning the ball over the bar. Man of the match - Morgan Gibbs-White Already capped at U19 level by England, it is hard to see how the 19-year-old cannot go all the way with his country. His touch in the lead up to Jota's goal was sublime and he was a constant presence in the Wolves attack until he was withdrawn to a standing ovation at Molineux.

Declan Rice headed his second-ever West Ham goal into the net in the seventh minute to give his side a lead they never really looked like relinquishing. Then, after Javier Hernandez had been fouled in the penalty area in the 42nd minute, Mark Noble converted his 22nd Premier League penalty to put the hosts well in command. Newcastle rallied after the break, but rarely threatened until late on, with Salomon Rondon denied by smart Lukasz Fabianski save, as West Ham saw out the win that sees them leapfrog Everton into ninth, having played a game more, while Newcastle drop to 14th after their first defeat in four.

Ayoze Perez then had an equaliser rightly ruled out for offside, before Javier Manquillo's volley was well cleared by Issa Diop. Then West Ham were gifted the opportunity to double their lead after Florian Lejeune tripped Hernandez in the box, with the ever-reliable Noble converting the spot kick with aplomb. Team news Manuel Pellegrini rung the changes from the defeat at Manchester City. After two substitute appearances, Manuel Lanzini made his first start of the season after his serious knee injury. There were also recalls for Mark Noble, Robert Snodgrass, Aaron Cresswell and Chicharito. Rafa Benitez has kept the same team that saw off Burnley. After the break, Perez fired a low cross into the middle which just evaded Rondon in the middle, but otherwise Newcastle were struggling to make inroads. Hernandez then fired into the side netting, before new signing Miguel Almiron dragged his effort wide for Newcastle. The pace of the game slowed right down late on, with Rondon bringing the best out of Fabianski from a free-kick, but West Ham strolled out their fourth home win in their last five London Stadium games in all competitions in comfort.

Newcastle have lost 75 Premier League away games in London, more than any other side. West Ham have lost just one of their last eight home Premier League games, and are unbeaten in their last five at the London Stadium (W3 D2). Newcastle have enjoyed just two wins in their last 17 away Premier League games (D6 L9) are without a victory on the road in six (D2 L4). West Ham's Declan Rice has scored in two of his last four Premier League home games after failing to score in his first 19.

West Ham's Mark Noble has scored 22 penalties in the Premier League since his debut in August 2005 - only Frank Lampard (36), Steven Gerrard (31), Sergio Aguero (24) and Wayne Rooney (23) have scored more in that period. 2:32 West Ham's Declan Rice shares his thoughts on the Hammers' 2-0 win over Newcastle in which the midfielder scored in to give the home side an early lead.

Man of the match - Declan Rice No stopping this young man at the moment. He took his goal brilliantly, and is starting to look at home at both ends of the pitch. Defensively, Rice was superb once again, winning more tackles than anyone else on the pitch, with no player making more passes than Rice.

Ozil, making his first league start in a month, took advantage of a fast start from the hosts to fire them ahead with less than four minutes on the clock before Henrikh Mkhitaryan doubled the lead from the German's cutback just before the half-hour (27). Bournemouth did look dangerous on the break but when they scored a comeback goal it owed everything to Matteo Guendouzi, who was caught in possession by Dan Gosling on the edge of his own box. The Bournemouth midfielder then fed Lys Mousset, who slotted beyond Bernd Leno to half the deficit (30). After half-time, Arsenal turned on the style and restored their two-goal advantage when Laurent Koscielny turned Mkhitaryan's cross after a quickly taken free-kick beyond Artur Boruc (47). Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang then added a fourth with a goal straight from the vintage Arsene Wenger era, racing through from the halfway line before rounding the stranded goalkeeper (59). Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (7), Jenkinson (6), Sokratis (7), Koscielny (7), Monreal (6), Torreira (6), Guendouzi (7), Mkhitaryan (8), Ozil (8), Kolasinac (8), Aubameyang (8). Subs: Iwobi (7), Lacazette (8), Suarez (6). Bournemouth: Boruc (7), Clyne (5), Ake (6), Mepham (5), Smith (3), Fraser (6), Gosling (6), Surman (5), Ibe (4), King (6), Mousset (6). Subs: Daniels (5), Rico (6), Surridge (n/a) Man of the match: Mesut Ozil There was still half an hour to go and the hosts did not let up, adding a fifth with 12 minutes remaining when substitute Alexandre Lacazette curled in a free-kick from 20 yards to cap a perfect night for Unai Emery, whose side kept their place in the top four with ease ahead of Saturday's north London derby with Tottenham. Arsenal had made a habit of early goals at home, having scored inside the first seven minutes of their previous two, and it took just four for Sead Kolasinac to win back possession high up the pitch before feeding Ozil, who lifted the ball over Boruc's dive. Bournemouth looked like they might not recover from the hosts' lightning start but once they had woken up, they nearly got themselves level when Ryan Fraser was set away by Josh King and forced a full-length dive out of Leno. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates scoring the fourth Arsenal goal But they gifted Arsenal a second when Adam Smith's ball across defence was cut out by Mkhitaryan, and after he found Ozil on the right the favour was returned for him to slot into an empty net. If that was bad, Guendouzi's error to allow Bournemouth back into the match was on another level. He received a short pass from Leno with no idea Gosling was closing him down, and after making a robust tackle it left the Bournemouth player the simple task of squaring for Mousset to crown his first league start of the season and finish well. The next goal would be crucial, and within 90 seconds of the restart Arsenal had it. A quickly taken free-kick from Ozil put Mkhitaryan clear on the right and his low cross was fired in via the post by Koscielny. Team news Playing their third game in six days, Arsenal rested six players who had started Sunday’s win over Southampton, giving Mesut Ozil a first league start in a month and Carl Jenkinson his first since November 2016. Bournemouth’s two changes were both enforced, with Jefferson Lerma suspended and Dominic Solanke injured, and Lys Mousset and Andrew Surman replaced them. Both sides hit the woodwork as Bournemouth wrestled for a way back into the game, but it was put beyond doubt in fine style when Mkhitaryan spotted Aubameyang on the shoulder of the last man, and he sprinted from the halfway line before rounding Boruc for a fourth. Emery had said his side could not keep up their intensity during an underwhelming win over Southampton on Sunday but they kept pushing against Bournemouth, and got their reward as substitute Lacazette scored a fifth with a fine free-kick which Boruc should have dealt better with. Laurent Koscielny celebrates scoring Arsenal's third goal with Nacho Monreal The result sets up Saturday's derby perfectly for Arsenal, who can move a point behind Spurs with victory, while Bournemouth are on their worst league run on the road since 1934 on the back of a ninth consecutive away defeat. Opta facts Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 14 Premier League home games (W12 D2), winning each of the last eight in a row. Bournemouth's goal was the 1000th Arsenal have conceded in Premier League history, becoming the eighth team to have shipped that many in the competition. Bournemouth have lost their last nine Premier League away games, conceding at least two goals each time. Arsenal scored five goals in a Premier League home game for the first time since May 2018 (5-0 vs Burnley) in what was Arsene Wenger's final home match in charge of the club. Mesut Ozil's opener for Arsenal was his 50th goal involvement in 85 Premier League appearances at the Emirates Stadium (now 19 goals, 32 assists). Henrikh Mkhitaryan became the first Arsenal player to both score and assist a goal in consecutive Premier League appearances since Santi Cazorla in February 2015. Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored his 26th Premier League goal - only Mohamed Salah (30) has scored more than him since his debut. Alexandre Lacazette is the fifth different player to score in 5+ consecutive home Premier League games for Arsenal, and the first since Robin van Persie in March 2012. Reaction Unai Emery: \"It was a good performance, we can be proud of every player, there have been a lot of matches and we wanted to show a complete performance, with a good result and as many goals as we could. 3:06 Arsenal's Unai Emery praised Mesut Ozil's quality after they beat Bournemouth 5-1. Arsenal's Unai Emery praised Mesut Ozil's quality after they beat Bournemouth 5-1. \"Today we did that, but this match is three points like Saturday, and we are happy now but the most important thing is we are playing with different players but the good performance is still continuing.\" Eddie Howe: \"We felt we were well in the game at half-time and had created some good chances despite not playing well. 1:23 Eddie Howe says Bournemouth were architects of their own downfall as they lost 5-1 at Arsenal. Eddie Howe says Bournemouth were architects of their own downfall as they lost 5-1 at Arsenal. \"We were a goal threat but to concede at the beginning of the second half was hugely disappointing and made it difficult from there-on in. We created opportunities, and it was a strange game in that respect.\" Man of the match - Mesut Ozil If Ozil wanted to show Emery what he has been missing over the last month, he could not have done much more than his performance. A goal, an assist and four key passes put him head and shoulders above anyone on the pitch bar Mkhitaryan, and if he does not start Saturday's north London derby, there will be a few eyebrows raised on the back of this performance. Of course, whether Ozil can carry these kind of performances into big games is still something that worries Emery, but it was his intensity as much as his quality which impressed here - only Guendouzi and Lucas Torreira covered more ground on the night for Arsenal. What's next? Arsenal face Tottenham in the early kick-off on Saturday at Wembley, with kick-off at 12.30pm. Bournemouth will be glad to be back at home, although they host Manchester City at 3pm on Saturday."},{"date": "27/02/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 27597, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Angus Gunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Bednarek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jannik Vestergaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yan Valery", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Austin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["64"]}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["64"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elyounoussi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Gallagher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stuart Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Rico", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Håvard Nordtveit", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Ream", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin McDonald", "yellows": ["62"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["69"]}, {"name": "André-Frank Zambo Anguissa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cairney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["69"]}, {"name": "Ryan Babel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["69"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Floyd Ayité", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Vietto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["69"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lazar Markovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahima Cissé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:53 Southampton 2-0 Fulham Southampton 2-0 Fulham Southampton moved out of the Premier League bottom three with a comfortable 2-0 victory over a beleaguered Fulham at St Mary's on Wednesday. After a cagey opening, Oriol Romeu's first goal of the season put the home side in front in the 23rd minute before James Ward-Prowse's third St Mary's goal in his last four appearances on the south coast made it two five minutes before half time. Ryan Babel hit the crossbar in the second half, but otherwise Fulham offered very little as an attacking force, with Saints seeing the win out with ease. The result sees Fulham slip closer to the drop - 10 points from safety with 10 games to go - having now shipped 62 goals even at this juncture of the campaign, while Saints' first win in five sees them climb up to 17th and out of the bottom three. Player ratings Southampton: Gunn (7), Bednarek (6), Yoshida (6), Vestergaard (6), Valery (6), Hojbjerg (6), Romeu (7), Ward-Prowse (8), Bertrand (7), Austin (6), Redmond (6). Subs: Long (6). Fulham: Rico (4), Odoi (5), McDonald (5), Ream (5), Bryan (4), Nordveit (4), Chambers (5), Anguissa (3), Cairney (4), Babel (6), Mitrovic (5). Subs: Sessegnon (6), Vietto (6). Man of the Match: James Ward-Prowse Charlie Austin had the ball in the net in the opening stages, but not after he had barged Fulham goalkeeper Sergio Rico to the floor, before Rico played a big part in the hosts taking the lead. Ward-Prowse whipped the corner into the middle, Rico came to punch, but could only beat the ball down to Romeu on the edge of the box, with the Saints midfielder drilling into the net, through a sea of legs. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg then fired just wide, before Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa was denied by a smart save by Angus Gunn in the Saints goal. Team news Two changes for Fulham from the side that were beaten 3-1 at West Ham on Friday, with Ryan Sessegnon demoted to the bench, and Jean Michael Seri not in the squad at all. Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Kevin McDonald came in. Three Saints changes from their Arsenal defeat, with Charlie Austin in to lead the line. Ryan Bertrand and Maya Yoshida also started. That save proved vital as Ward-Prowse made it two moments later. A simple header forward opened Fulham up, Austin fed it back for Nathan Redmond, who curled for goal, Rico made a smart save, but could only parry the ball into the path of Ward-Prowse who slid in to make it two. After the break, Fulham did little to up the tempo, with Babel's deflected effort that beat Gunn in the Saints goal, but cannoned out off the crossbar, as close as the visitors came. The travelling Fulham fans vented their anger as boss Claudio Ranieri throughout the match, with even more vitriol greeting the final whistle. With 10 games to go, Fulham are nearing needing a miracle to survive. Opta stats Southampton have won two of their last four Premier League home games (D1 L1), as many wins as they managed in their previous 21 at St Marys (D10 L9). Fulham have lost seven of their last eight Premier League games (W1), conceding at least twice in all eight. Southampton have beaten a newly promoted team for the first time since May 2017 (2-1 against Middlesboro), having failed to do so in their last 10 Premier League games against such teams (D5 L5). Southampton are now unbeaten in their last 20 home league games against Fulham (W14 D6) since a 1-2 loss in October 1935 (second tier). Only against Coventry (22 games) have they ever had a longer unbeaten home run in their league history. Oriol Romeu's opener was his fourth Premier League goal for Southampton, his first in 42 games in the competition. Man of the match - James Ward-Prowse Ward-Prowse's 40th minute strike means he has scored three goals in his last four Premier League home games for Southampton, one more than he netted in his previous 42 combined. No player created more chances for team-mates in the match as he controlled proceedings from the middle of the park, showing £30m Anguissa how it is done.

Chelsea took the lead through Pedro, who cut in from the right and squeezed an effort through Hugo Lloris' legs from an angle (57), before Trippier's backpass caught the Spurs goalkeeper rushing out, only to see the ball roll into the net (85).

Chelsea remain sixth, three points off fourth-place Arsenal, but with a game in hand. Before the game, Sarri described his decision to drop Kepa as a message for the group, and he received a big team performance for a vital win in the race for the top four. During an exhilarating start, Chelsea hit the post as Moussa Sissoko's failed clearance fell to Higuain, only for the forward to slice a half volley against the post from 12 yards. Higuain then curled wide from the edge of the box with Lloris rooted, before a flashpoint at the other end as Harry Kane unsportingly chased down a Spurs pass-back to David Luiz after a drop ball. Luiz and Caballero took umbrage with Kane's actions before an altercation, and though Kane was seen moving his head towards Chelsea's Cesar Azpilicueta, referee Andre Marriner did not punish him. Team news Kepa was dropped for Caballero after Sunday's incident at Wembley, while Alonso came back in for Emerson. Meanwhile, Willian and Barkley came out for Kovacic and Higuain. Spurs made four changes; Sanchez, Trippier, Davies and Lamela came in, replacing Aurier, Foyth, Rose and Vertonghen, who was out of the squad completely with a hip injury. Cesar Azpilicueta and Heung-Min Son in action at Stamford Bridge Spurs began to find their rhythm and were nearly ahead before the break, only for Winks' long-range effort to rebound off the bar after taking the slightest touch off a Chelsea foot. But Chelsea upped the pace after the break and got a deserved opener through man-of-the-match Pedro, beating Ben Davies and Toby Alderweireld on the right flank, cutting onto his left and finding the net through the legs of Lloris from 10 yards. Kane was then found by Davies in a fine position, eight yards out, but couldn't get his feet right, miscuing wide of goal as Spurs struggled to muster up any clear second-half chances. Their misery was compounded with six minutes remaining as Trippier put too much on a simple backpass for Lloris, catching the goalkeeper unaware as they watched the ball roll agonisingly into the net. Willy Caballero warms up prior to the Premier League match against Tottenham The managers Maurizio Sarri: [on dropping Kepa] \"I think it was the right decision, Kepa made a big mistake, he paid with the club, and then he had to pay with the team. \"But now I have to think we have to stop, Kepa from tomorrow will be with us. He is back in the team for the weekend, I don't know in the next match if he will be on the pitch or not, but one of the next two he will [start].\" 1:43 Maurizio Sarri says Kepa Arrizabalaga is still Chelsea's No 1 Maurizio Sarri says Kepa Arrizabalaga is still Chelsea's No 1 Mauricio Pochettino: \"We didn't shoot, and we were not consistent enough. It was an even game, but we didn't create too much. I was disappointed because it was another defeat, but we have to be sure we are ready for Saturday, and another tough London derby.\" Opta stats Chelsea have only lost one of their last 33 home games against Spurs in all competitions (W21 D11). Tottenham have lost successive Premier League away games for the first time since November 2017 when they lost three in a row. Spurs have lost two league games in the space of five days for the first time since August 2007 (vs Sunderland on 11 August 2007 & vs Everton on 14 August 2007). Tottenham have scored two own goals in their last six Premier League games (Trippier vs Chelsea and Llorente vs Fulham); as many as their previous 113 in the competition. Tottenham have won just three of their 23 Premier League away games against 'big six' sides under Mauricio Pochettino (D7 L13). Tottenham have failed to land a shot on target in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2013 against Liverpool. Man of the match - Pedro A manager's dream, Pedro made an impact all over the pitch to give Chelsea a morale-boosting win. His goal aside, the Spaniard made several crucial tackles in his defensive third, and cut off any chance of Spurs rhythm in midfield. He ran more than any Chelsea player (12.28km) and made the second-most sprints of any player on the pitch (17). What's next? Chelsea now go to Fulham on Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League at 2.05pm, while Spurs host Arsenal at Wembley on Saturday at 12.30pm."},{"date": "27/02/2019", "arena": "Selhurst Park",

Utd Highlights: Crystal Palace 1-3 Man Utd Romelu Lukaku scored twice as Manchester United sealed a club-record eighth consecutive away win with a 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Lukaku struck in either half, ending a nine-game goal drought to put United in control, but Joel Ward reduced the arrears midway through the second half to give Palace hope. But that was extinguished seven minutes from time as Ashley Young's second goal of the season extended Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's unbeaten run in the Premier League to 11 games. The victory sees United stay in the hunt for the top four; a point and a place behind fourth-place Arsenal. Palace, who see a six-game unbeaten run come to an end, remain in 14th, five points clear of the relegation zone.

Subs: Bailly (5), Garner (n/a), Rashford (5). Man of the Match: Romelu Lukaku. United started brightly and should have taken the lead inside eight minutes when Luke Shaw's corner found Lukaku unmarked in the Palace area, but the Belgium international volleyed over from close range. It was Palace's turn to squander an early chance three minutes later as Andros Townsend fired wide at the near post after James McArthur had skipped around Scott McTominay and delivered a teasing ball into the box. Romelu Lukaku celebrates with team-mates after making it 1-0 Lukaku atoned for his earlier miss on 33 minutes, curling his first goal since January 5 into the far corner beyond Vicente Guaita after Shaw's marauding run into Palace territory. Palace should have hauled themselves level immediately, but Jeff Schlupp headed wide from Townsend's inch-perfect cross. Team news Martin Kelly replaced Mamadou Sakho in Crystal Palace’s only change from Saturday’s thrashing of Leicester. Alexis Sanchez, Fred and Diogo Dalot were drafted into the Manchester United line-up after Sunday’s goalless draw with Liverpool. Paul Pogba missed a glorious chance to double United's lead within a minute of the restart, heading over from Diogo Dalot's cross from close range. But it was not long before United had their second, Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof keeping a corner alive in the Palace area with two headers before Lukaku outmuscled Schlupp, controlled and hooked his second over Guaita. Romelu Lukaku is mobbed after doubling Manchester United's tally at Selhurst Park Palace were handed a lifeline on 66 minutes through an unlikely source when defender Ward ghosted in behind Shaw to apply the finishing touch to a fine Schlupp cross. But their hopes of staging a comeback were dashed on 83 minutes when Pogba released Young on the overlap, and the United skipper fired a third home through bodies to sealed an impressive victory for Solskjaer's injury-ravaged side. Ashley Young celebrates scoring against Crystal Palace Opta stats Man Utd have won eight consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time in their history. Crystal Palace have played more Premier League games without ever winning against Man Utd (D4 L16) than any side has against another in the competition's history. Manchester United are unbeaten in their last 22 league games against Crystal Palace, since a 0-3 away defeat in May 1991 (W18 D4). Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has lost more Premier League matches against Man Utd (12) than he has against any other side. Eight of Romelu Lukaku's 10 Premier League goals this season have been scored away from home - only Harry Kane (10) has netted more on the road in 2018-19 so far. Man Utd's Romelu Lukaku has scored in seven of his last 10 Premier League appearances against Crystal Palace, including in three of his four games for the Red Devils. James McArthur became just the fourth player to reach 150 appearances for Crystal Palace in the Premier League after Joel Ward, Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Zaha. Crystal Palace's Joel Ward ended a run of 86 Premier League appearances without a goal, since netting versus Chelsea in August 2015.

Mane celebrates after putting Liverpool ahead Watford had conceded 11 goals on their previous two visits to Anfield and they were soon facing an uphill task again as Mane netted twice inside the opening 20 minutes. Starting in a central position in the absence of the injured Roberto Firmino, Mane opened the scoring in the eighth minute when he headed in from Trent Alexander-Arnold's cross. 3 - Trent Alexander-Arnold is the youngest ever player to assist three goals in a single Premier League game (20 years, 143 days). Prodigy. #LIVWAT pic.twitter.com/UGbY50PdRf — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 27, 2019 Alexander-Arnold and Mohamed Salah tormented Watford's left flank and it was no surprise that the former was involved in Liverpool's second goal in the 20th minute. Alexander-Arnold crossed into Mane, whose first touch took him away from goal, but with his second he finished with a superb backheel that bounced over Ben Foster. Mane scores with a backheel to make it 2-0 Liverpool looked rampant against a flimsy defence, with Salah hitting the inside of the post and Fabinho firing a powerful effort over from 25 yards out. Watford did threaten late in the first half but Troy Deeney turned wide from close range after being picked out by Gerard Deulofeu's low cross. Van Dijk celebrates scoring Liverpool's fourth goal with Georginio Wijnaldum Liverpool added a third in the 66th minute when Origi cut in from the left and hit a low shot that beat Foster at the near post. Substitute Andre Gray almost pulled a goal back for Watford as he saw an effort pushed away by Alisson, before the goalkeeper diverted a volley from Gray over the bar from point-blank range. Team news Liverpool made two changes from their draw at Manchester United as Alexander-Arnold and Origi replaced Henderson and Firmino. Watford stuck with the same XI that won 5-1 at Cardiff. But Liverpool had the final say as Van Dijk headed in from Alexander-Arnold's free-kick and then nodded in from Robertson's cross a few minutes later. Opta stats Liverpool's victory means the Reds now have 69 points with just 10 matches remaining in the Premier League; each of the previous seven sides to amass such a tally after 28 matches have gone on to win the title. Watford (D4 L11) have now failed to win any of their 15 Premier League matches played on a Wednesday; the only side in the competition's history to play more games on a particular day without ever winning are West Brom on a Tuesday (27 games). Liverpool (W25 D10) are now unbeaten at Anfield in the Premier League in their last 35 matches, the first side in the competition to reach this number of matches without defeat since Man City back in December 2012 (37 games). Watford have now suffered defeat in each of their nine Premier League games against sides starting the day top of the league, conceding 26 goals, the worst such 100 per cent loss ratio in the competition. Watford have become the first side in Premier League history to concede at least five goals in three successive away matches against a single opponent in the competition (1-6 in November 2016, 0-5 in March 2018, 0-5 tonight). Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has overseen six Premier League victories over Watford, against no other side in the competition has he managed more wins. Sadio Mane's brace for Liverpool were his 13th and 14th Premier League goals of the season, the most he has ever netted within a single campaign in the competition. Divock Origi has had a direct hand in 11 goals in his last 18 Premier League starts for Liverpool (seven goals, four assists). Trent Alexander-Arnold has become just the fourth Liverpool player to register at least three assists in the same Premier League match after Stan Collymore, Vladimir Smicer and Alberto Aquilani. Man of the match - Sadio Mane Alexander-Arnold and Van Dijk were both excellent, but Mane set up the win with two early goals. Playing in a more central position than he normally does, Mane made a good run for the first goal between Watford's centre-backs, and then produced a brilliant backheeled finish to extend Liverpool's lead. What's next? Liverpool make the short trip to Goodison Park to face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. They then host Burnley on Sunday, March 10.

the Premier League Highlights from Manchester City's 1-0 win over West Ham in the Premier League Manchester City remain a point behind Liverpool in the Premier League title race after a Sergio Aguero penalty secured them a 1-0 victory over West Ham at the Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola's side were far from their fluent best against a dogged West Ham team on Manuel Pellegrini's first return to his former club. Andy Carroll came close to breaking the deadlock five minutes into the second half as Ederson made a fine save from point-blank range, before Felipe Anderson was penalised for bringing down substitute Bernardo Silva inside the penalty area just shy of the hour-mark. Aguero stepped up and struck his 18th Premier League goal of the season to the relief of the home fans, and ensure City remain on the coat-tails of Jurgen Klopp's side, who beat Watford 5-0 at Anfield on Wednesday night. West Ham stay in 10th place. Manuel Pellegrini suffered a narrow defeat on his return to the Etihad Player ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Danilo (7), Kompany (6), Otamendi (6), Zinchenko (6), Gundogan (7), De Bruyne (7), D. Silva (6), Mahrez (5), Sane (5), Aguero (7). Subs: Sterling (6), Bernardo (7), Foden (6) West Ham: Fabianski (7), Johnson (7), Fredericks (8), Ogbonna (7), Diop (7), Rice (7), Obiang (6), Antonio (7), Nasri (5), Anderson (6), Carroll (7). Subs: Zabaleta (6), Lanzini (6), Diangana (n/a) Man of the match: Ryan Fredericks City began brightly and might have scored three times in the opening five minutes. Kevin De Bruyne received Aguero's pass 25 yards out and fired a crisp right-footed shot a yard wide of the post before Riyad Mahrez skied David Silva's cross from close range. Moments later, De Bruyne was involved once more as his cut-back found David Silva, but the Spaniard's shot cannoned back off Lukasz Fabianski's right-hand post. At that point, it appeared as though it would be a long night for the Hammers but, with the impressive Ben Johnson making his senior debut at left-back, Pellegrini's side warmed to their task and were rarely troubled for the remainder of the opening period. Bernardo Silva shows his frustration as West Ham defended well Team news Walker, Sterling and Bernardo dropped to the substitutes' bench. Laporte and Fernandinho were sidelined through injury making it five changes. Danilo, Kompany, Gundogan, David Silva, Mahrez and Sane all started. West Ham also made five changes as Carroll captained the side with Noble on the bench, while Nasri was handed a start on his return to City. Zabaleta had to make do with a place on the bench. Guardiola had cut a frustrated figure, with his angst largely directed towards Mahrez on his return to the starting line-up and the mood inside the Etihad was not helped by the news of Liverpool comfortably leading Watford. City had 11 attempts during the first-half but only one came on target - a shot from Mahrez that was straight at Fabianski - and they might have fallen behind when Carroll met substitute Manuel Lanzini's cross but Ederson flew to his right to keep out the striker's shot. Sergio Aguero breaks the deadlock from the spot after 59 minutes Guardiola rolled the dice by introducing Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva, and the latter made the difference as a tired challenge from Felipe Anderson drew the penalty in front of referee Stuart Attwell. Aguero kept his cool to slot home his seventh goal in three home Premier League games as City controlled the final 30 minutes without threatening to stretch their advantage. Man of the match - Ryan Fredericks While City dominated possession, Pellegrini will be delighted with how his West Ham side restricted their opponents to a one-goal victory courtesy of the penalty spot. After withstanding an early onslaught, the performance of Ryan Fredericks at right-back eventually forced Guardiola into a re-think as the dejected Leroy Sane was hauled off in place of Bernardo. Ryan Fredericks, right, contests Stuart Attwell's penalty decision - but impressed Fredericks replaced Zabaleta in the second period against Fulham, and he hasn't looked back. His final ball going forward still requires improvement, but he did everything that was asked of him defensively. With more determined displays like this, he could make the position his own in the final 10 games of the season. The managers Pep Guardiola: \"They made us work hard for the result but we played incredibly well. We created a lot of chances, so it's amazing to understand how it was just 1-0 and in the last minute, anything can happen. \"In the first five minutes, it could've been 2-0 easily. The longer it stays at 0-0 or 1-0 the more impatient you become but in general we defended so well. 2:07 Pep Guardiola says Manchester City played 'incredibly well' in their 1-0 win over West Ham. Pep Guardiola says Manchester City played 'incredibly well' in their 1-0 win over West Ham. \"With the long balls to Carroll and to [Michail] Antonio we applied ourselves very well and created a lot of chances. Unfortunately, we couldn't score more goals, after the 120 minutes against Chelsea, the team showed incredible spirit and we made a really good performance.\" Manuel Pellegrini: \"We lost to a penalty that was not a penalty. In the other box, maybe if Lanzini goes to the floor then maybe he can whistle. They had other chances after the penalty, but we ultimately lost to it so I'm unhappy. \"Apart from the first 10 minutes, we defended well. I think if you review the match, Lukasz Fabianski only made one or two saves. I think the penalty was the first risk that he had on his goal. 2:03 West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini criticised the decision to award Manchester City a penalty in their 1-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League. West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini criticised the decision to award Manchester City a penalty in their 1-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League. \"We defended well but we didn't look after the ball well enough. Considering that we have eight players injured, and four players that we rested, of course I can't be very unhappy with the result.\" Opta stats Manchester City have won each of their last seven games against West Ham in all competitions, netting 23 goals while conceding just three. West Ham are now winless in their last 18 Premier League away games against 'big six' opposition (D6 L12). Manchester City have won 16 of their last 17 home games in all competitions, only losing to Crystal Palace in a league game in December (2-3). Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero has been directly involved in 74 goals (59 goals and 15 assists) in 80 Premier League appearances since Pep Guardiola took over in August 2016 - only Harry Kane has been directly involved in more in that time (87). Manchester City's Oleksandr Zinchenko has been on the winning side in each of his first 13 Premier League appearances (11 starts), the longest run of wins from the start of a player's career in the competition's history. Manuel Pellegrini is winless in his last five away league games as manager, his longest run without a win on the road in a single Premier League season since December 2015 when he was Manchester City manager. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has more top-flight league wins against Manuel Pellegrini (9) than he does any other opposition manager. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has won all seven of his meetings with West Ham in all competitions. The only side he has met more often while maintaining a 100% win rate is Malaga, who he has beaten eight times, including four games while they were managed by Manuel Pellegrini. What's next? Manchester City travel to face Bournemouth on Saturday at 3pm while West Ham host Newcastle later that day (kick-off: 5.30pm)."},{"date": "26/02/2019", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance":

relieved the pressure on Marco Silva with a goal in each half in Everton's 3-0 win at Cardiff. Coming into the game on a run of one win in six, Everton looked nervous but still had the better of the first half and snatched the lead four minutes before the break when Sigurdsson swept home Seamus Coleman's cut-back from the right following a throw-in to become the Premier League's highest-scoring Icelander. Sigurdsson smashed in another midway through the second half once Bernard's shot had been parried into his path. The goal seemed to relax Everton, and they controlled the rest of the game in some style. Calvert-Lewin scored his fifth goal of the season in his 100th league appearance Cardiff did carve out several half-chances but failed to register a single shot on target across the 90 minutes, while Calvert-Lewin netted an injury-time third for Everton on the break to seal a comprehensive and welcome win for Marco Silva ahead of a Merseyside derby showdown with Liverpool live on Sky Sports Premier League on Sunday from 4pm. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (6), Manga (4), Bamba (6), Morrison (6), Bennett (5), Mendez-Laing (6), Bacuna (5), Gunnarsson (5), Hoilett (4), Zohore (6), Reid (5). Subs: Paterson (6), Murphy (5), Ward (n/a). Everton: Pickford (6), Coleman (7), Jagielka (6), Keane (7), Digne (7), Schneiderlin (6), Gueye (7), Walcott (7), Sigurdsson (8), Richarlison (5), Calvert-Lewin (7) Subs: Bernard (7), Lookman (n/a), Gomes (n/a). Man of the match: Gylfi Sigurdsson The game burst into life in the early stages with Cardiff close to a first-minute opener when Phil Jagielka's slip allowed Kenneth Zohore to cross for Nathaniel Mendez-Laing at the far post, but Lucas Digne's smart block put the ball behind before he could reach it. Zohore went for goal himself with Cardiff's next chance from Gunnarsson's lob into the box, chesting the ball down but firing into the side netting under pressure from Michael Keane. Everton had gone close through a dipping Theo Walcott volley from the angle but took a half-time lead four minutes before the break. When Cardiff switched off from a throw-in, Morgan Schneiderlin slid Coleman away down the right and he cut the ball back to Sigurdsson, who slotted the ball into the far corner. Team news Both sides made five changes after losing their previous game to Watford. Cardiff dropped Joe Ralls and Harry Arter, recalling Kenneth Zohore and Bobby Reid. Everton left Andre Gomes on the bench and gave Dominic Calvert-Lewin a start in attack. After half-time Cardiff again came close when Bruno Ecuele Manga spotted Zohore playing on the shoulder of Keane and sent him racing onto his long ball forward. He cut inside from the left but with Bobby Reid and Mendez-Laing in support, Jagielka positioned himself between both and cleared before either could turn in an equaliser. Instead Everton doubled their advantage within minutes. Richarlison cut a frustrated figure as he trudged off for Bernard, but the substitute vindicated Silva's decision to introduce him almost immediately by using some quick feet to beat Manga before seeing his shot parried by Neil Etheridge into Sigurdsson's path, from which the midfielder's powerful drive left the goalkeeper no chance as it flew into the roof of the net. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates his opener with Seamus Coleman, the man who made it A sloppy Cardiff performance was booed off at full-time but not before Everton had put the cherry on a considerable cake when Idrissa Gueye took advantage of some lax defending to slide through Calvert-Lewin, and despite Etheridge's save his powerful drive flew into the bottom corner. Reaction Neil Warnock: \"I didn't think it was bad if I'm honest, it was just individual errors and it took someone who cost £50m to punish us. He took his two goals well but it was mistakes from us and that's what happens at this level, you get punished. That's what happened tonight. 2:10 Neil Warnock blamed individual errors from his Cardiff side as they lost 3-0 to Everton in the Premier League. Neil Warnock blamed individual errors from his Cardiff side as they lost 3-0 to Everton in the Premier League. Marco Silva: \"We deserved three points, we were in command of the whole match, we knew they were strong from set pieces, long throws and winning the second ball, but we did well. In the first minute they had a moment but after that we controlled the match.\" 2:23 Marco Silva praised the way his Everton side dominated the game against Cardiff as the Toffees came away 3-0 winners in the Premier League. Marco Silva praised the way his Everton side dominated the game against Cardiff as the Toffees came away 3-0 winners in the Premier League. Opta facts Cardiff have won just one of their last six home league games (D1 L4), after winning four of the five before that (L1). Everton have done the league double over Cardiff for the first time since 1928-29. Cardiff have never won a midweek Premier League game (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), drawing three and losing seven. They've scored just two goals in those 10 games and have conceded at least twice in each defeat. Cardiff are the only side to fail to direct a single shot on target in more than one home Premier League game this season, doing so against Everton and against Huddersfield in January. Everton scored with their first two shots on target and with three of their four shots on target overall in the game. Everton's Gylfi Sigurdsson has been involved in more Premier League goals in games played in Wales than any other player (35 - 14 goals, 21 assists in 68 appearances). Everton's Gylfi Sigurdsson is now the Premier League's outright top-scoring Icelandic player with 57 goals, eclipsing Eidur Gudjohnsen's haul of 55. Gylfi Sigurdsson has scored 15 Premier League goals for Everton since the start of the 2017-18 season, five more than any other player. Man of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson This was a special night for Everton's number 10 when he became the Premier League's all-time top-scoring Icelander, beating Eidur Gudjohnsen's record of 55 goals which has stood for almost nine years. In a game lacking quality he had more shots on target (2) than anyone else on the pitch, and both ended up as smart finishes which Neil Etheridge could do little about. With one goal in his previous 10 games, this double could not have set up this weekend's showdown with Liverpool much better for the midfielder. What's next?

Steve Mounie scored a dramatic injury-time winner to end Huddersfield's three-month winless run as they beat Wolves 1-0 on Tuesday. The Terriers had not tasted victory in a Premier League match since November 25 when Wolves were dispatched 2-0 at Molineux but Mounie swept home in the 91st minute to notch his second goal of the season. The victory, which was celebrated wildly by boss Jan Siewert on the touchline, still leaves Huddersfield 11 points from safety but offers small hope that a great escape could be on. Wolves, who could have gone seventh by avoiding defeat, were lacklustre throughout and failed to register a single shot on target. Jan Siewert celebrates Steve Mounie's injury-time winner at home to Wolves Siewert rang the changes from the defeat at Newcastle, making eight of them including handing a full Premier League debut to England U20 international Demeaco Duhaney at right-back. Player Ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Durm (7), Duhaney (6), Kongolo (7), Stankovic (7), Schindler (7), Hogg (7), Billing (7), Pritchard (6), Grant (7), Mounie (7) Subs: Bacuna (7), Mooy (7), Kachunga (7) Wolves: Patricio (6), Doherty (6), Bennett (6), Boly (6), Coady (6), Jonny (6), Dendoncker (6), Moutinho (5), Neves (5), Jimenez (5), Jota (5) Subs: Cavalerio (6), Costa (6), Gibbs-White (6) Man of the match: Steve Mounie He was rarely tested, despite his lack of experience, as Wolves started very cautiously but Huddersfield didn't possess the quality in the final third to make their slackness pay. Raul Jimenez headed wide from a free-kick and Matt Doherty fluffed his lines from a tight angle as the opening period passed with little incident. Huddersfield were tenacious in the tackle yet they didn't seem capable of adding to their paltry tally of just six goals at home this season, especially when Mounie headed into the side netting from close range on the hour mark. With Wolves still drifting through the game, Jonathan Hogg almost flicked a cross home from the right but his effort looped inches over the crossbar. The game seemed to be heading for a uneventful stalemate but the hosts mustered one last attack and punished Wolves for their sloppy performance. Aaron Mooy provided the much needed quality down the right and his skiddy cross found Karlan Ahearne-Grant, whose shot was turned home by Mounie. It was just his second goal from his last 47 attempts on goal in the Premier League. The relief and joy for all concerned with Huddersfield was palpable as they recorded just their third win of the season, summed up by Siewert, who couldn't contain his excitement on the bench. Man of the match: Steve Mounie It was looking like one of those days for Mounie as the clock ticked into stoppage time. The striker has missed a golden headed opportunity to put his team in front and his confidence looked shot. However, the French striker kept on believing and kept on getting into those dangerous areas. He got his reward with a moment everyone associated with the club will remember from a season that has delivered little in terms of euphoric moments. Steve Mounie celebrates scoring Huddersfield's injury-time winner Opta stats Seventy nine per cent (11/14) of the Premier League points won by Huddersfield this season have come against newly-promoted teams - six vs Wolves, three vs Fulham and two vs Cardiff. Wolves have lost eight of their last nine away league matches against Huddersfield. Six of Huddersfield's last nine Premier League wins have come against teams beginning with W - two apiece against Watford, West Brom and Wolves. All five of Huddersfield's clean sheets in the Premier League this season have been against newly-promoted teams - two vs Cardiff and Wolves and one vs Fulham. Huddersfield Town are one of four sides that Nuno Espirito Santo has faced more than once as Wolves boss in all competitions without winning, along with Man City, Sunderland and Swansea City. Wolves named an unchanged starting XI for the 12th time in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. Wolves have lost seven of their 12 Premier League matches against teams starting the day bottom. Steve Mounie scored just his second Premier League goal of the season for Huddersfield, with both of his goals coming at the John Smith's Stadium. Manager reaction: Jan Siewert \"You can't believe how much they suffered when they are not winning. \"They deserved everything form the game. They left their hearts on the pitch. \"They showed another face so that's a big thing for the squad today.\" 2:59 Jan Siewert says he is extremely proud of the belief his players showed during their 1-0 win against Wolves and insists they will keep on fighting in the Premier League.

It wasn't one of the best performances. \"It was one moment on the counter-attack where we lost the ball. We cannot, until the referee says it's over, it is not over. \"We must look at the next one.

the stands as Demarai Gray and Jamie Vardy scored to seal Leicester a 2-1 win over Brighton in the Premier League on Tuesday night. Rodgers received a warm welcome from the Leicester support as he took his seat at the King Power Stadium - just an hour after he was officially announced as the new Leicester boss - and Gray gave the hosts the initiative with a tidy finish in the 10th minute. 0:54 Brendan Rodgers was warmly welcomed by the Leicester fans as he took his seat ahead of the Foxes game against Brighton. Brendan Rodgers was warmly welcomed by the Leicester fans as he took his seat ahead of the Foxes game against Brighton. Vardy doubled Leicester's lead in the 63rd minute with a driven strike from close range, moments before Davy Propper pulled a goal back for the visitors (66). Although Brighton attempted to rally back late on, with a Glenn Murray half-volley hitting the side netting, Leicester held on to their narrow lead to move up to 11th. Player ratings Leicester: : Schmeichel (7), Pereira (6), Evans (6), Maguire (7), Chilwell (6), Tielemans (7), Ndidi (6), Barnes (*), Maddison (7), Gray (7), Vardy (7) Subs: Mendy (6), Okazaki (N/A), Iheanacho (N/A) Brighton: Ryan (6), Montoya (6), Duffy (6), Dunk (6), Bong (5), Stephens (6), March (5), Propper (6), Gross (6), Knockaert (5), Murray (5) Subs: Bissouma (6), Locadia (5), Izquierdo (N/A) Man of the match: Harvey Barnes Brighton's wait for their first Premier League win in 2019 continues as they remain in 16th - three points above the relegation zone on 27 points. Leicester started the game brightly with Gray getting his fourth Premier League goal of the season in the 10th minute. Anthony Knockaert sloppily gave the ball away to Harvey Barnes before he laid it off to Youri Tielemans to slip in the unmarked Gray, who calmly slotted the ball past Matt Ryan. Demarai Gray opened the scoring for Leicester Three minutes later and Gray was denied a second after his powerful shot from close range was parried away by Ryan. Brighton grew as the half progressed and they nearly equalised in the 36th minute when Knockaert struck a powerful effort on goal from inside the box, but Schmeichel expertly turned the Frenchman's shot around his right post. Team news Ben Chilwell and Demarai Gray replace Christian Fuchs and Rachid Ghezzal. Anthony Knockaert took the the place of Jurgen Locadia and faced his former club. In the 48th minute, Murray squandered a glorious opportunity to level for Brighton when Pascal Gross smartly backheeled the ball to the 35-year-old with the goal gaping, but he struck his first-time effort high and wide. Shortly after the hour-mark Vardy doubled Leicester's lead. Ricardo Pereira drilled a pass into James Maddison before he poked the ball through to the England international who drilled his shot home. Moments after Shane Duffy's header from a corner skewed wide, Brighton got a consolation as Propper latched onto Dale Stephens' deflected cross and drove his strike past Schmeichel. Davy Propper pulled a goal back for Brighton Harvey Barnes twice came close to making it three. He hit an effort wide following a quick counter-attack, as well as striking a half-volley over the bar, but Murray could have got Brighton a point the 87th minute. However, he struck his close-range half-volley into the side netting before Leicester stood firm to record their first Premier League win since New Year's Day. Opta stats Leicester have won their first Premier League game since beating Everton 1-0 on New Year's Day, ending a run of six matches without a victory in the competition (D1 L5). Brighton and Hove Albion (P7 W0 D2 L5) are the only side across the top four tiers of English Football still yet to win a league game in 2019. Leicester are unbeaten in 15 home matches played on Tuesday in all competitions (W11 D4 L0) since losing 2-4 to Chelsea in the League Cup third round in September 2016. Brighton have conceded two or more goals in five consecutive away league games - the Seagulls last went on a longer such run between December 2005 and February 2006 whilst in the Championship (run of seven away games conceding 2+ goals). Leicester are unbeaten in their last 33 Premier League games at the King Power Stadium in which they've scored the opening goal (W29 D4 L0), since a 2-5 defeat against Arsenal back in September 2015. Leicester's James Maddison is the first English midfielder to reach 10 goal involvements in the Premier League this season (5 goals, 5 assists). Demarai Gray's opener after 9 minutes and 22 seconds was Leicester's fastest Premier League goal of this campaign - he has now scored four goals in the 2018-19 Premier League, his best tally in a single season in the competition and his best return in a league campaign since he netted six in the 2014-15 Championship season with Birmingham. Jamie Vardy has scored in each of his last three Premier League appearances for Leicester against Brighton (3 goals in total).

Mike Stowell: \"He [Brendan Rodgers] just spoke to the lads in the dressing room.

It's exciting times.\" 2:40 Chris Hughton felt Brighton’s performance against Leicester deserved a better result as they did not take the chances they created as they lost 2-1 at the King Power stadium. Chris Hughton felt Brighton’s performance against Leicester deserved a better result as they did not take the chances they created as they lost 2-1 at the King Power stadium. Chris Hughton: \"It was an even game and we had as many chances as they did - certainly in terms of possession and shots. \"But in the moments that mattered they put two away and we didn't. It's probably a reflection of where we are at the moment.\" Man of the Match - Harvey Barnes Harvey Barnes impressed against Brighton Gareth Southgate was watching the game from the stands and he will have been pleased with how involved England U21 winger Barnes was in Leicester's attacks. The 21-year-old, who was recalled from his loan spell at West Brom in January, caused right-back Martin Montoya plenty of problems with his pace and power. He was unfortunate not to get a goal in a game where he was regularly the focal point of Leicester's forward line. What's next? Leicester travel to Watford with Rodgers set to manage the Midlands club for the first time against his old club on Super Sunday, while Brighton host Huddersfield on Saturday afternoon."},{"date":

over Burnley in the Premier League Highlights from Newcastle's win over Burnley in the Premier League Fabian Schar's superb strike and Sean Longstaff's first Premier League goal saw Newcastle beat Burnley 2-0 and move seven points clear of the relegation zone. Schar fired in a stunning long-range goal in the 24th minute to put Newcastle ahead at St James' Park. Academy graduate Longstaff made it 2-0 in the 38th minute and Newcastle held on to move up into 13th place and boost their chances of survival. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (8), Schar (8), Lascelles (7), Lejeune (7), Manquillo (7), Hayden (7), Longstaff (8), Ritchie (7), Almiron (7), Perez (7), Rondon (7) Subs: Dummett (5), Diame (5), Joselu (5) Burnley: Heaton (5), Taylor (5), Tarkowski (5), Mee (5), Bardsley (5), Cork (5), Hendrick (5), Gudmundsson (5), McNeil (4), Wood (5), Barnes (5) Subs: Brady (5), Crouch (5), Vydra (5) Man of the match: Fabian Schar Burnley slip down to 15th, still six points above the relegation zone, having produced a below-par display in their bid to extend their unbeaten league run to nine matches. The Clarets created few clear opportunities against an improving Newcastle, who have won their last four home games in a row to pull away from the bottom three. Newcastle started confidently and took the lead in the 24th minute when Schar fired in a superb shot from distance that hit the inside of the post and flew into the net. Burnley almost responded quickly as Chris Wood saw a volley saved by Martin Dubravka. But the Clarets were otherwise second best and they fell further behind when Matt Ritchie's cross fell to Longstaff and he fired in a low shot to score his first Premier League goal. Burnley had penalty appeals waved away when Ritchie appeared to catch Johann Berg Gudmundsson, before James Tarkowski missed a glorious chance when he volleyed over the bar from six yards out in injury-time. Miguel Almiron looks to play a pass through Tarkowski again threatened at the start of the second half when he headed over the bar from a corner. Newcastle's club-record signing Miguel Almiron, who produced another encouraging showing, was denied by Tom Heaton at the near post, but chances were few and far between at both ends. Team news Both sides made one change from their last match. Manquillo replaced Yedlin for Newcastle while Gudmundsson started for Burnley with Westwood missing out due to illness. Burnley did press late in the game but the closest they came was when substitute Matej Vydra failed to turn in from a corner. Opta stats No side has picked up more Premier League points at home in 2019 so far than Newcastle United's 12 (P5 W4 D0 L1), with only Arsenal and Manchester City matching their tally on home soil. Newcastle have won four consecutive home league games for the first time since last April; they had won just two of their opening 11 home league games of this season prior to this streak (D1 L8). This was the first time Burnley have lost a Premier League game with Tom Heaton in goal since August 2017 against West Brom (0-1), ending a 10-game unbeaten streak for the goalkeeper in the competition. Newcastle have done a league double over Burnley for the first time since the 1954-55 top-flight campaign; they had won just two of their previous 11 league games against the Clarets before this season (D4 L5). Only Fulham (13) have lost more away games in all competitions amongst Premier League clubs this season than Burnley (11). Fabian Schär's goal was Newcastle's first to be scored from outside the box in this season's Premier league from their 121st such attempt from outside the area in 2018-19, with Ayoze Perez the last player to score from outside the penalty area for the Magpies in the competition in April 2018 against Leicester City. Aged 21 years and 119 days, Sean Longstaff is the youngest player to score for Newcastle in the Premier League since Rolando Aarons netted aged 20 years and 181 days against Spurs in May 2016. Newcastle scored with both of their two shots on target in the first half of this match. Man of the match - Fabian Schar Longstaff was excellent and Dubravka produced a solid performance, but Schar takes the honours. Not only did he score a brilliant goal to give Newcastle the lead but he was strong in defence and played some good passes to get his side out. What's next? Newcastle travel to West Ham on Saturday, live on Sky Sports at 5.30pm, before a home game against Everton on Saturday, March 9.

Highlights as Arsenal beat Southampton 2-0 in the Premier League. First-half goals from Alexandre Lacazette and Henrikh Mkhitaryan earned Arsenal a 2-0 win over Southampton which moved them into fourth place in the Premier League table. Lacazette was given one of the simplest chances he could wish for after six minutes when Mkhitaryan's half-volley found him unmarked six yards out and he directed the ball beyond Saints goalkeeper Angus Gunn with a smart flick. Mkhitaryan went from provider to scorer 11 minutes later, turning home Alex Iwobi's deflected cross with a composed finish into the near corner from the right. Southampton occasionally threatened and Matt Targett twice forced Bernd Leno into smart saves, but Arsenal moved back into the top four and above Manchester United with the victory. Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (7), Lichtsteiner (6), Sokratis (7), Mustafi (6), Kolasinac (7), Ramsey (6), Torreira (7), Xhaka (7), Mkhitaryan (8), Lacazette (7), Iwobi (8). Subs: Koscielny, (6), Ozil (6), Aubameyang (6), Southampton: Gunn (7), Valery (6), Stephens (5), Vestergaard (7), Bednarek (7), Targett (6), Hojbjerg (6), Romeu (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Armstrong (5), Redmond (6). Subs: Austin (5), Obafemi (5), Elyounoussi (5) Man of the match: Alex Iwobi Southampton started with the same vigour from their shock win over Arsenal back in December and could have led inside five minutes when Nathan Redmond did excellently to beat the offside trap and cut inside, but his shot was blocked by Leno's legs. Arsenal immediately gave their visitors a lesson in finishing as they got the ball forward in a matter of seconds, with Iwobi's cross reaching Mkhitaryan, whose half-volley back across goal hit Lacazette and the Frenchman's second touch fired the ball past Gunn from six yards. Targett tested Gunners 'keeper Leno again when he burst past Stephan Lichtsteiner down the left, but two strong hands kept out his shot towards the far post. Team news Arsenal welcomed Mesut Ozil back to their league line-up, but only onto the bench, where he joined Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. They made four changes in total, including starts for Aaron Ramsey and Sokratis. Southampton started without a recognised striker with Shane Long injured, but also dropped Alex McCarthy to name Angus Gunn in goal. Matt Targett also replaced Ryan Bertrand, who similarly was relegated to the bench. Arsenal doubled their lead in comical circumstances when Gunn's poor clearance landed perfectly for Iwobi, whose deflected cross fell nicely for Mkhitaryan to slide the ball inside the far post. Lacazette should have put the game out of Southampton's sight when Sead Kolasinac unselfishly played the ball through for him in a good scoring position, but he blazed over from a similar distance to his opener and let Saints off the hook. Two attacking half-time changes from the visitors did little to inspire them back into the game, and Arsenal controlled much of the second 45 minutes like a training match. Henrikh Mkhitaryan's goal was his third against Southampton this season Late on, substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang could have added a third but his cross-shot towards Lacazette was kept out by Gunn's trailing leg. Targett's volley called Leno into action again, but Arsenal's lead was never in great danger as they strolled back into the top four. Opta facts Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 24 home league games against Southampton (W18 D6) since a 0-1 loss in November 1987. Southampton have won none of their 20 away Premier League games against Arsenal (D5 L15) - the most a team has played away at another without ever winning in the competition. Since losing 2-0 against Manchester City on the opening weekend, Arsenal have remained unbeaten in 13 Premier League home games (W11 D2), winning the last seven in a row. Southampton have lost seven of their last nine Premier League away trips to London (W1 D1) and are winless in the last four (D1 L3). Henrikh Mkhitaryan has been directly involved in each of Arsenal's four Premier League goals against Southampton this season (3 goals, 1 assist). Alexandre Lacazette has scored against 18 of the 22 Premier League teams he has faced with Arsenal. Alexandre Lacazette is the first Arsenal player to score in four consecutive Premier League games since Robin van Persie in March 2012 (five games). Man of the match - Alex Iwobi The Arsenal winger has often struggled with his final ball but his all-round game was excellent against Southampton, which was displayed by his involvement in both goals. It was his cross which Mkhitaryan turned goalwards for Lacazette's opener, and another which was finished off by Mkhitaryan to double the lead. He put in more crosses in open play than anyone else (5), and likewise made more key passes (3) than any of his team-mates."},{"date": "24/02/2019", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74519,

Highlights: Manchester Utd 0-0 Liverpool Liverpool reclaimed top spot in the Premier League with a 0-0 draw at Manchester United on Super Sunday. First-half injuries to United trio Ander Herrera, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard and Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino put paid to hopes of a classic between English football's two most successful clubs. The best chance of the game fell to Lingard before he succumbed to injury in the first half, but Alisson Becker was more than a match, stretching out an arm as the midfielder tried to round him. Liverpool were far from their fluid best but had a measure of control throughout, securing a point that lifts them above champions Manchester City. United drop to fifth, a point outside the top four as Arsenal beat Southampton 2-0 in the day's other Premier League game.

With just 20 seconds on the clock, Ashley Young's under-hit backpass was handled by David de Gea before Firmino could pounce. Mata blocked James Milner's indirect free-kick but Liverpool settled sooner. David de Gea manages to clear from Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane United lost Herrera to a hamstring and Mata to hip injury inside 25 minutes, with Andreas Pereira and Lingard stepping into a makeshift midfield line-up - which already included Scott McTominay as Nemanja Matic missed out through injury - that struggled to contain an encouraged Liverpool side. Ander Herrera receives treatment on the pitch after picking up an injury Players continued to drop like flies, with Firmino rolling his ankle and Lingard forced off before the interval, but only after the half's best chance had fallen the way of the England international. Paul Pogba found Romelu Lukaku on the edge of the area and his disguised through-pass released Lingard through on goal where he tried to round Alisson, but the Liverpool goalkeeper's outstretched arm nicked the ball off his toes. Jesse Lingard got injured again vs Liverpool It was Lingard's last involvement before he succumbed to a recurrence of a hamstring injury, the substitute being substituted as the introduction of Alexis Sanchez left Solskjaer with no options from the bench for the second half. A battling second-half display from United ensued and, cheered on by their passionate home crowd, they nearly secured a victory that would have dented Liverpool's title hopes. Jordan Henderson and Alexis Sanchez battle for possession at Old Trafford United had the ball in the back of the net on 75 minutes when Joel Matip turned into his own net from a Chris Smalling cross, but the United defender was correctly ruled offside. Smalling could not stretch far enough to apply the finishing touch to a Lukaku cross in the final minute, but there was to be no winner as both sides settled for a point. Opta stats This was the fifth draw played out by Manchester United and Liverpool in their last seven meetings in all competitions (one win each), as many as their previous 50 encounters combined beforehand. This draw has taken Liverpool top of the Premier League, meaning today will be the 400th day they have finished top of the table in the competition's history. Liverpool have played out back-to-back goalless draws in all competitions for the first time since April 2013 (v West Ham and Reading) under manager Brendan Rodgers. Manchester United have failed to score in back-to-back games at Old Trafford in all competitions for the first time since December 2015 against PSV Eindhoven and West Ham with Louis van Gaal in charge. Liverpool have managed to win just two of their last 18 visits to Old Trafford in all competitions (D3 L13), and only one of their last 13 (D3 L9). Jesse Lingard became the first player to be substituted on and then off in the first half of a Premier League match since Kevin Long for Burnley against Newcastle United in January 2015. Manchester United were the first team to make all three substitutions in the first half of a Premier League game since Burnley in January 2015 vs Newcastle United. Manchester United's David De Gea kept his 100th clean sheet in the Premier League; the seventh goalkeeper to do so for a single club and the second for Man Utd after Peter Schmeichel (112). The managers 1:50 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits he was concerned about Marcus Rashford's injury during the 0-0 draw with Liverpool, but was forced to leave him on because of other injury problems. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admits he was concerned about Marcus Rashford's injury during the 0-0 draw with Liverpool, but was forced to leave him on because of other injury problems. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"Everything that could have gone wrong in the first half went wrong. We had four injuries - we had to keep Marcus Rashford on - it seemed like it was going to be a tough afternoon. But I can't remember Liverpool having a chance. Even though they had possession, I can't remember David de Gea making a save. 3:00 Jurgen Klopp admits his side struggled to find their rhythm in the 0-0 draw with Manchester United, but he was happy with his players' attitude. Jurgen Klopp admits his side struggled to find their rhythm in the 0-0 draw with Manchester United, but he was happy with his players' attitude. Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a strange game. We started really well. All the injuries in the game obviously cost us rhythm. It happened to us with 'Bobby' and that was a catastrophe. United played with a completely new midfield and three up front. We lost our rhythm and couldn't get it back. On days when United are beatable you have to do it and we didn't do it. We have a point more and Wednesday is out next game.\" Man of the Match - Luke Shaw United could have balked when injuries left their pre-match plan in tatters, but a brilliant defensive display from United - at which Shaw was at the heart - left Liverpool lost for ideas. The was only one winner in Shaw's personal duel with Mohamed Salah, the Egyptian hooked midway through the second half despite Liverpool needing a goal to capitalise on United's injury crisis. \"When they need a goal and they take Mohamed Salah off you know Luke Shaw has played a good game,\" United boss Solskjaer said. \"That his best performance since I've been here.\" What's next?

his late winner for Burnley against Tottenham Tottenham's title challenge hit the buffers as they suffered a 2-1 defeat at Burnley, despite Harry Kane scoring on his return from injury on Saturday. Spurs could have closed the gap to leaders Manchester City and Liverpool to two points but fluffed their lines as they were blunted by Sean Dyche's dogged outfit, with Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino clashing with referee Mike Dean at full-time. 1:12 Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino was less than impressed with referee Mike Dean at the full-time whistle Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino was less than impressed with referee Mike Dean at the full-time whistle There was controversy at both ends when Chris Wood headed the hosts in front (57) before Kane - on his first start for six weeks - drew his team level (65). That seemingly set the platform for another late Spurs rally but it was Burnley that notched the decisive goal with seven minutes remaining when Ashley Barnes prodded home from close range. Burnley are now unbeaten in their last eight Premier League games - their longest unbeaten top-division run for 44 years. 4:37 Pochettino said Spurs' defeat to Burnley seriously dents their bid to win the Premier League Pochettino said Spurs' defeat to Burnley seriously dents their bid to win the Premier League Kane looked sharp in the early stages but Burnley sat deep and defended in good numbers to keep Spurs quiet in attacking areas. Barnes curled a sumptuous effort just over from a tight angle just before the break as the teams went in level. Player Ratings Burnley: Heaton (8), Bardsley (6), Tarkowski (7), Mee (8), Taylor (6), Hendrick (6), Westwood (7), Cork (6), McNeil (6), Barnes (8), Wood (7) Subs: Brady (6), Gudmundsson (7) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Vertonghen (6), Alderweireld (5), Foyth (4), Aurier (5), Sissoko (5), Winks (5), Rose (6), Eriksen (6), Son (5), Kane (7) Subs: Llorente (5), Lamela (N/A), Moura (N/A) Man of the match: Ashley Barnes With Spurs continuing to plod along in possession - bar a rasping Kane drive that was spectacularly tipped away by Tom Heaton - Burnley took a shock lead. After a debatable corner was awarded after a tangle of legs between Jan Vertonghen and Jeff Hendrick, Wood out-jumped Juan Foyth and planted a looped header home via the underside of the crossbar. As the Burnley players celebrated, Pochettino was seen arguing with the fourth official at the award of the corner. Pochettino's side were only behind for seven minutes, though, thanks to some incisive quick thinking from Danny Rose and a quite ruthless finish from Kane. 1:15 Alex Scott, Jamie Redknapp and Jonathan Walters discuss whether Tottenham's defeat to Burnley means they are no longer in the title race Alex Scott, Jamie Redknapp and Jonathan Walters discuss whether Tottenham's defeat to Burnley means they are no longer in the title race Rose was quickest to react to a Spurs throw-in and, after advancing around 10 yards beyond where the ball had gone out, launched his throw over the top of the Burnley defence for Kane to chase. The England striker held off the challenge of Ben Mee before finding the far corner with a precise finish. Spurs had scored late goals against Fulham, Newcastle and Leicester in recent weeks but couldn't fashion another salvo as Burnley finished like a train. Harry Kane could not inspire Tottenham to victory Johann Berg Gudmundsson made an instant impact from the bench, creating space down the left and rolling in a clever cross that was finished at the back post by Barnes. Burnley were beaming while Tottenham's title bid was left in tatters. Man of the match: Ashley Barnes The striker gave Spurs a warning in the first half with a testing effort from a tight angle that whistled over the bar. He would get the goal his performance deserved as the clock ticked down and he showed his predatory skills to win the game for his in-form side. His partnership with Wood continues to flourish, in total they've scored 17 goals between in 17 starts together at the club. A deadly duo. Opta stats Burnley are unbeaten in eight Premier League games (W5 D3), their longest top-flight run without defeat since a run of nine in 1966. Tottenham suffered only their second defeat in their last eight away games in the Premier League, after losing two of the four before that. Burnley have accrued 18 points from their last eight Premier League games (W5 D3), after picking up just 14 from their previous 24. Burnley scored their opening goal with their first shot on target of the game on 57 minutes. Burnley striker Wood has netted four goals in his last four Premier League appearances, as many as in his previous 27 in the competition. Kane has scored five goals in his seven Premier League appearances against Burnley, including four in his last three. Barnes has scored in each of his last four Premier League games (4 goals), after netting in just three of his previous 24 in the competition (4 goals). Johann Gudmundsson has registered 15 assists for Burnley in the Premier League, nine more than any other player. 4:09 Sean Dyche praised the effort and relentlessness from his Burnley side Sean Dyche praised the effort and relentlessness from his Burnley side What's next?

King opened the scoring with a 14th-minute penalty, before Jimenez levelled matters with his own successful spot-kick seven minutes from time. However, the hosts passed up the opportunity to take all three points when King missed a late penalty in a feisty contest on the south coast that produced 25 fouls and 10 yellows.

Roger East was a late change as referee at the Vitality, and the official was the centre of attention in the first half after giving one penalty and controversially refusing to award another. The hosts took the lead when Mr East correctly decided that King had been tripped in the box by Joao Moutinho, with the Norway international doing the rest from the spot for his ninth league goal of the season. Josh King celebrates opening the scoring for Bournemouth against Wolves However, Wolves will feel aggrieved they were not given the chance to draw level just six minutes later after the ball appeared to hit Chris Mepham's arm as the defender made a hash of trying to clear the ball for a corner. The man who mattered most disagreed, although the visitors' protests were calmed when Mr East did point to the spot when Adam Smith - already on a yellow but not shown a second card - caught Matt Doherty in the box late on. Jimenez nonchalantly rolled home the penalty for his 10th league goal of the campaign, only for Bournemouth to be given the opportunity to retake the lead just minutes later after Ivan Cavaleiro's trip on Ryan Fraser. Team news Eddie Howe gave first starts at home to January signings Chris Mepham and Dominic Solanke. But the hosts were still without injured duo Callum Wilson and David Brooks. Nuno stuck with the same team that were held 1-1 at home by Newcastle in their most recent league match. And that meant Diogo Jota, Matt Doherty and Ruben Neves were all passed fit. This time, however, King fired against the outside of the right-hand post, although with the foul having actually taken place just outside the box, Wolves will feel justice was done. But they may not feel that was the case with Bournemouth midfielder Jefferson Lerma, who appeared fortunate to only be booked after his flying elbow left a furious Joao Moutinho with a bloodied face 20 minutes from time.

The Netherlands international did not put a foot wrong all afternoon long, making numerous vital interceptions to prevent Wolves' dangerous forward line from scoring. \"Ake was absolutely sensational today, especially in the second half when he put everything on the line. He had big decisions to make and was absolutely man of the match,\" said Sky Sports pundit Charlie Nicholas of the player's performance. Managers Eddie Howe: \"The only danger with VAR, if you're looking at those decisions, maybe Ryan's is outside the box but are any of the others clear-cut? No, probably not. So it's still going to be someone else's interpretation. \"I thought Ryan's one was probably outside the box in all honesty but I haven't seen them again. The first one I saw something, a tangle of legs. The one that I probably have the biggest opinion on is their penalty. \"It's just you rarely see them given. Adam's committed to his challenge, Doherty's got his shot away. I really wasn't expecting a penalty to be given. \"Arguably, if it's outside the box I have seen fouls given for those things but inside the box rarely is a foul given for that, so I was surprised to see that one.\" 3:12 Eddie Howe felt Bournemouth enough chances to win their Premier League game against Wolves and was frustrated at having to settle for a 1-1 draw Eddie Howe felt Bournemouth enough chances to win their Premier League game against Wolves and was frustrated at having to settle for a 1-1 draw Nuno Espirito Santo: \"The result we never know and justice in football is sometimes not so fair if you want. \"But what I saw was a very emotional and competitive game, both teams trying to win the game. First half, I think we played really well, second half not so well. \"But against a very tough team, Bournemouth here in Vitality Stadium is very tough, they have good players and Eddie [Howe] is doing a fantastic job. \"So happy with the performance of the boys in such a difficult space.\" 3:03 Nuno Espirito Santo says referees have a very difficult job following three penalty awards during Wolves' 1-1 draw at Bournemouth Nuno Espirito Santo says referees have a very difficult job following three penalty awards during Wolves' 1-1 draw at Bournemouth Pundit - Charlie Nicholas 5:52 Charlie Nicholas gives his views on Bournemouth's 1-1 draw with Wolves Charlie Nicholas gives his views on Bournemouth's 1-1 draw with Wolves \"I thought the first (penalty) was quite harsh,\" the Scot told Sky Sports. \"The second one was a bit soft in my opinion, for Wolves. Maybe that balanced it up if you like.\" \"The third? Not a penalty for me, I thought he got it wrong. The referee, because he made that decision very early on (booking Adam Smith)... he was very quick in doing so because there was four or five Wolves players who all get round him and so it agitated him a little bit.

his full debut as Newcastle pulled four points clear of the bottom three with a 2-0 win over 10-man Huddersfield at St James' Park. Huddersfield captain Tommy Smith was given a straight red card for a dangerous lunge on Almiron with just 20 minutes on the clock and although the visitors held out until half-time, Salomon Rondon fired home his seventh league goal of the season to break the deadlock less than a minute after the re-start. The striker then turned provider for Ayoze Perez to sweep in a second six minutes later. Newcastle could have added to their tally late on, but substitute Kenedy and Sean Longstaff were both denied by the woodwork. Nonetheless, Newcastle picked up their third home league win in a row - their best such run since April last year - to pull away from the drop zone, while yet another defeat leaves Huddersfield 14 points from safety at the foot of the table.

Almiron really should have opened his account in the 12th minute, racing clear of the Huddersfield backline as Newcastle put together a sumptuous move, he elected to loft the ball over the advancing Lossl, only for the ball to come out off the post, the rebound fell for Rondon, who drilled against the same post and wide. Rondon then had the chance to break the deadlock at the end of the first half, but he could not guide the header, after being brilliantly picked out by Longstaff, on target. Team news There was only one change to the Newcastle side that drew with Wolves last time out, but it is a big one, with record signing Miguel Almiron starting for the first time in black and white. Christian Atsu was the man to make way. Just the one change for Huddersfield, too, with Laurent Depoitre starting in place of Adam Diakhaby. Karlan Grant has to wait for his full debut. The Huddersfield resistance was broken less than a minute into the second half, with Longstaff firing over the long pass, DeAndre Yedlin headed the ball back across goal, Isaac Hayden poked it into the path of Rondon who slammed the ball home. Six minutes later it was two, with Rondon this time cushioning a pass through for Perez, who made up for earlier misses with a fine finish as it looked like Newcastle were going to run riot. They failed to add to their tally however, with Kenedy's brilliant volley and a sublime Longstaff curling effort both coming out off the woodwork, but they saw out an easy victory at an canter. The managers Rafael Benitez: \"We created a lot of chances - I think we hit the crossbar or the post four times. We needed to win, and we won well. \"It does not matter for me whether we pick up three points at home or away, but as we play Burnley next at home, hopefully we can carry our good home run.\" 2:02 Rafael Benitez says Newcastle's match against Huddersfield was one they 'needed to win' and he's called on his players to continue their strong home form Rafael Benitez says Newcastle's match against Huddersfield was one they 'needed to win' and he's called on his players to continue their strong home form Jan Siewert: \"The red card broke us today. Before we had plenty of possession, plenty of chances, but the red card broke us. I have not seen it again, and will need to see it again to make an opinion. \"It was a diagonal ball [that led to opener], and it is very hard to defend a diagonal ball when you have one man less, because the opponent has more width. The ball landed in the box and they scored. It is not easy with one man less. 1:28 Huddersfield's Jan Siewart says that Tommy Smith's first-half red card 'broke them' as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at Newcastle Huddersfield's Jan Siewart says that Tommy Smith's first-half red card 'broke them' as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at Newcastle Opta stats Newcastle have done the league double over Huddersfield for the first time since 1964-65. Only two sides in Premier League history have picked up fewer points after their first 27 games of a season than Huddersfield in 18-19 (11); Derby in 07-08 (9) and Sunderland in 05-06 (10). Newcastle mustered 29 shots, their most in a Premier League game since attempting 32 against Swansea in November 2012. Huddersfield's Jan Siewert is the ninth manager to lose his opening four Premier League matches in charge, and the first since Frank de Boer with Crystal Palace at the start of last season. No side has picked up more red cards in the Premier League this season than Huddersfield (4, along with Everton and Leicester) Salomón Rondón has been directly involved in 46% of Newcastle's 24 Premier League goals this season (7 goals, 4 assists). Man of the match - Miguel Almiron The birth of a new Tyneside hero? Yes the opposition were somewhat substandard, but on debut, in front of 52,000 expectant Geordies, Almiron put in a fine display, and did everything but score. He created six chances for his team-mates throughout the match, two more than anyone else at St James', and worked tirelessly to keep Newcastle in the hunt for more goals.

Crystal Palace beat Leicester 4-1 at the King Power Stadium in the Premier League on Saturday evening. Michy Batshuayi, on loan from Chelsea, scored his first goal in a Palace shirt five minutes from half-time, but Jonny Evans grabbed an equalising Leicester goal in the 64th minute from close range. Zaha gave Palace the lead again with a tidy finish (70) before Evans' evening took a turn for the worse when he tripped up Jeffrey Schlupp in the penalty box, allowing Luka Milivojevic to convert from the spot (81). Zaha scored his second - and Palace's fourth - in injury-time (90+3) to mark a memorable evening for the away support at the King Power Stadium.

Leicester remain in 12th - two clear of the south London club. Leicester won the possession battle early on and created their first goalscoring chance in the ninth minute. Harvey Barnes whipped a cross into the box from the left flank which Jamie Vardy met, but his near-post header flew narrowly over the bar. The half became increasingly scrappy, with Palace committing eight fouls in the opening 45 minutes, but it was the visitors who took the lead against the run of play. Team news Two Leicester changes as Christian Fuchs and Jamie Vardy came in for Ben Chilwell and Demarai Gray. For Palace, Joel Ward and James Tomkins came in for the injured duo Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Martin Kelly, while Christian Benteke dropped to the bench and Michy Batshuayi took his place. Five minutes from half-time, James McArthur attempted an audacious half-volley from around 35 yards out which Batshuayi was able to re-direct with an outstretched leg into the bottom corner. Jonny Evans equalised for Leicester Leicester continued their possession dominance into the second half and it finally paid off when Evans levelled the match in the 64th minute. Christian Fuchs' long throw saw the ball eventually drop to Barnes, who drilled the ball across the goalmouth for Evans to turn in with a poacher's finish. Luka Milivojevic scored from the spot Six minutes later and Palace re-took the lead through Zaha as James McArthur showed great composure to dink a ball into the unmarked Ivory Coast international's path before he slotted the ball home on the volley. Leicester pushed for an equaliser, but Palace created some breathing space when Milivojevic sent Kasper Schmeichel the wrong way from the penalty spot, nine minutes from time, after Evans brought down Schlupp in the box. And as the hosts piled more men forward in added time, Palace punished Leicester on the counter-attack as substitute Jordan Ayew's pace was too much for the Leicester backline. He teed up Zaha who smashed in his second goal of the night. Opta stats Leicester have lost four consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since January 2000.

Cardiff A Gerard Deulofeu hat-trick and a Troy Deeney double lifted Watford into seventh in the Premier League table after the visitors' 5-1 win at Cardiff on Friday night. Deulofeu opened the scoring in the 18th minute in a first half where Cardiff felt they should have had a penalty when Josh Murphy went down in the box under a strong challenge from Daryl Janmaat (42). Watford hit five past Cardiff, moving the Hornets up to seventh in the table The former Barcelona forward grabbed his second with a composed finish in the 61st minute, before he completed a hat-trick two minutes later after coolly lofting the ball over goalkeeper Neil Etheridge. Deeney made it four with a simple tap-in (73) before Sol Bamba scored a consolation eight minutes later. And in added time, Deeney scored Watford's fifth to complete a magnificent victory. The result means Watford move up into seventh while Cardiff remain 17th and just a point above the relegation zone. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (5), Morrison (4), Manga (4), Bamba (4), Paterson (5), Bacuna (5), Ralls (5), Bennett (4), Arter (4), Murphy (5), Niasse (4) Subs: Hoilett (6), Mendez-Laing (4), Zohore (4) Watford: Foster (7), Janmaat (6), Mariappa (6), Cathcart (6), Masina (6), Doucoure (7), Capoue (7), Hughes (7), Pereyra (7), Deeney (9), Deulofeu (10) Subs: Quina (5), Cleverley (N/A), Gray (N/A) Man of the match: Gerard Deulofeu After a slow start, Cardiff came closest to taking the lead in the 15th minute when Oumar Niasse tried to lob Ben Foster from close range, but the 35-year-old goalkeeper sprinted off his line and blocked the first shot before quickly punching away the loose ball to prevent a rebound. Three minutes later and Watford took the lead through Deulofeu. Deeney bundled past Sean Morrison and Joe Bennett before teeing up the Spaniard to stroke the ball into the bottom corner. Team news Sean Morrison, Leandro Bacuna and Josh Murphy came in for Lee Peltier, Aron Gunnarsson and Bobby Reid in the Cardiff side. Adam Masina and Roberto Pereyra took the places of suspended Jose Holebas and Ken Sema in the Watford starting XI. The flashpoint of the half arrived three minutes from half-time when Murphy was wiped out by Janmaat in the box, but referee Simon Hooper did not feel the late sliding tackle merited a spot-kick. The second half began in scrappy fashion as Cardiff pushed for an equaliser, but Deulofeu scored his second of the night just after the hour mark. A poor free-kick from Bennett was headed straight out to the Spaniard, who ran from the halfway line and rounded Etheridge to double the visitors' lead. Within a couple of minutes, Deulofeu had doubled his entire goal tally for the season in just one game. A sloppy Harry Arter pass was intercepted by Etienne Capoue, whose incisive pass was dinked into the bottom corner by Deulofeu for his hat-trick. Deulofeu turned provider 10 minutes later as he broke free into the box and squared to Deeney for a simple tap-in. Gerard Deulofeu dinked in his third goal Bamba scored a consolation in the 81st minute as he stabbed in from close range following a goalmouth scramble, before Deeney made it five with a tidy finish in added time. Opta stats Gerard Deulofeu became the first Watford player to score a top-flight hat-trick since Mark Falco in October 1986. Cardiff manager Neil Warnock has lost his last four home league matches against Watford by an aggregate score of 16-2, with this his 16th league defeat against the Hornets - only against Reading (16) has he lost as many league matches as a manager. Watford scored five goals in a top-flight match for the first time since winning 5-1 against Leicester City in November 1986. Watford's Gerard Deulofeu has had a hand in seven goals in his last three Premier League appearances against Cardiff City (5 goals, 2 assists). Gerard Deulofeu became only the third player to score a Premier League hat-trick on a Friday, after Dean Windass (Bradford v Derby, April 2000) and Thierry Henry (Arsenal v Liverpool and Leeds in April 2004). Troy Deeney's first seven Premier League assists were all for Odion Ighalo - since then, his nine assists have been for eight different players (Capoue twice, Kabasele, Niang, Richarlison, Doucoure, Gray, Sema and Deulofeu). Cardiff have conceded 28 home Premier League goals this season - more than any other side. All four Premier League hat-tricks scored in Wales have been scored by players for English teams - Luis Suarez vs Cardiff (Liverpool, 2014), Riyad Mahrez vs Swansea (Leicester, 2015), Jermain Defoe vs Swansea (Sunderland, 2016) and Deulofeu tonight for Watford. The managers 2:44 Cardiff's Neil Warnock says he's 'never seen his players like that' after they were denied a penalty in their 5-1 loss to Watford Cardiff's Neil Warnock says he's 'never seen his players like that' after they were denied a penalty in their 5-1 loss to Watford Neil Warnock: \"We got mauled in the end. It looks bad in the paper.s I have never seen the players like that at half-time. \"Everyone was talking about the penalty that hasn't been given. Nobody can understand it.

The referee is in a great position so I just can't understand it.

To win here is not easy. To win like we did today was outstanding. I am very proud of all my players. \"Playing away we are getting good results. We knew it would be a hard game. They changed their shape and they tried to do more compact and defend better but we found the spaces and scored different goals - in counter-attack and in possession.\" Man of the Match - Gerard Deulofeu Deulofeu opened the scoring for Watford Deulofeu produced his best display in a Watford shirt as he scored a hat-trick and followed it up with an assist as Cardiff were simply unable to cope with his pace.

Ryan Babel was gifted the opportunity to break the deadlock with less than a minute on the clock, only to be denied by Lukasz Fabianski, but he made amends two minutes later, firing home from close range to score his first goal for Fulham since joining in January. Then came a real moment of controversy, as Hernandez appeared to divert the ball in to equalise with his hand in the 19th minute, with the goal allowed to stand, much to Claudio Ranieri's frustration on the bench, before Issa Diop headed his first Premier League goal to turn the match on its head five minutes before half time. Fulham mixed things up in the second half, but offered little as an attacking threat, with Michail Antonio heading home a third West Ham goal in stoppage time to make sure of their first win in six in all competitions, while Fulham's position looks even more perilous, eight points from safety, having shipped 60 league goals already and winless away from home in the Premier League this season. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (7), Zabaleta (6), Diop (8), Ogbonna (7), Cresswell (7), Noble (7), Rice (8), Antonio (7), Anderson (6), Snodgrass (6), Hernandez (6). Subs: Arnautovic (7), Lanzini (7), Fredericks (6) Fulham: Rico (4), Odoi (4), Sessegnon (5), Ream (5), Bryan (5), Nordveit (4), Chambers (5), Seri (4), Cairney (5), Babel (7), Mitrovic (7). Subs: Markovic (5), Anguissa (4). Man of the Match: Declan Rice Fulham flew out of the traps, with Babel latching onto an underhit back pass from Pablo Zabaleta. Fabianski, though, stood firm to deny Babel, but could do nothing as the same man got on the end of a Ryan Sessegnon cross before slamming the ball home. West Ham struggled to get going, but were gifted a way back into the contest. Sergio Rico firstly failed to deal with a corner, Angelo Ogbonna flicked the ball back towards goal, Hernandez leaned into the ball, but the last touch seemed to come off his hand. Fulham's defensive frailties came to the fore once again in the 40th minute, as Diop was allowed to climb highest to head home from Robert Snodgrass' corner, meaning Fulham have now conceded more than once 21 times this season, including all of the last seven in 2019. Team news Just the one change for West Ham, with Pablo Zabaleta in for Ryan Fredericks. However, the big news was that after missing the entire season so far, Manuel Lanzini was fit enough to take his place on the West Ham bench. Three changes for Fulham, with Ryan Sessegnon, Tom Cairney and former Hammers midfielder Havard Nordtveit coming in. There was no place for Andre Schurrle in the squad. Ranieri made two changes at the interval, introducing Lazar Markovic and Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa, but neither could really have any real effect on the game, as West Ham stood firm. Another substitute, Marko Arnautovic, came within a whisker of adding his name to the scoresheet, but was denied an equaliser by a combination of Rico and post. However, Antonio's bullet header in the 91st minute, on the end of an Arnautovic cross, did put the seal on the three points for West Ham and compounded another miserable night for Fulham. Opta stats Fulham's nine London derby defeats in a row is the longest ever such losing run in Football League history by any London side. West Ham have completed the league double over Fulham for the first time since the 2008-09 campaign, when they were managed by Gianfranco Zola. West Ham's victory means the Hammers have picked up 14 points from London derbies in the top-flight so far this season (P8 W4 D2 L2), only Spurs (15) and Arsenal (16) have managed more. Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri is now winless in his last 22 Premier League games away from home (15 for Leicester City, 7 for Fulham); the longest such run for a manager in the competition since Roy Hodgson back in October 2010 (also 22). Manuel Pellegrini has now won each of his four Premier League encounters against Fulham, only versus West Brom (6/6) does the Chilean have a better 100% winning ratio in the competition. Ryan Babel's strike for Fulham was his first Premier League goal since December 2010 (Liverpool v Aston Villa), 3000 days ago. West Ham striker Javier Hernandez has become the first Mexican player to score 50 Premier League goals; indeed, all 50 have been scored inside the box. Michail Antonio made his 100th Premier League appearance for West Ham in their match against Fulham; only Tottenham Hotspur (24) have now seen more Englishman make at least 100 apps in the competition than the Hammers (21). Fulham have become just the fourth side in the Premier League era to concede at least 60 goals after 27 matches of a single campaign; indeed, only Barnsley (63 in 1997-98) conceded more than Fulham's 61 so far this season. 2:21 Following defeat at West Ham, Ryan Babel says that despite fast starts, cheap goals are breaking Fulham's spirit in games Following defeat at West Ham, Ryan Babel says that despite fast starts, cheap goals are breaking Fulham's spirit in games Man of the match - Declan Rice The stats don't lie. Declan Rice won six tackles at London Stadium, double that of anyone else on the pitch. No player made more interceptions, while he gained possession more than anyone else on the pitch, five more than any team-mate. No player made more interceptions, either. The young midfielder has decided to pledge his allegiances to England, and on this evidence, he could well become a regular starter, not just a squad member, very soon indeed. What's next West Ham face the daunting task of a trip to Manchester City on Wednesday, while Fulham travel to Southampton."},{"date": "11/02/2019", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 30687,

95th-minute equaliser as Wolves denied Newcastle a crucial win with a 1-1 draw on Monday Night Football. It looked as though Newcastle were about to pull away from the relegation zone after Isaac Hayden (56) took advantage of some flimsy goalkeeping from Rui Patricio to score his first goal since October 2017. Wolves were strangely disjointed in their bid for a fourth straight win but staged one final push and Boly rose above Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka to nod home with the last attack of the game. The result leaves Rafa Benitez's side one point above the drop zone in 16th while Wolves remain seventh. Willy Boly scores his dramatic leveller Newcastle gave £21m record signing Miguel Almiron a second-half debut as he saw up close the excitement of Premier League football. Record signing Miguel Almiron comes on for his Newcastle debut at Wolves The visitors carried little threat in attacking areas but Wolves were equally as blunt in a stodgy opening 45 minutes.

Wolves came close to opening the scoring three minutes after the break. Team news Both teams kept the same XI's that started their last Premier League encounter. Rafa Benitez resisted the urge to start new signing Miguel Almiron. Matt Doherty reacted to a knockdown at the back post but hooked an effort over the crossbar under pressure from the tireless Sean Longstaff. But the hosts were then caught cold on 56 minutes. Fabian Schar released Hayden into the box and his strike was straight at Patricio but he could only flap the ball into the net. Wolves created little in response as Newcastle were expertly organised without the ball, although Jimenez did miscue a header from six yards out. But Wolves had claimed seven points with goals in the final 10 minutes of games this season and maintained their staying power as Boly was too strong for Dubravka in the final minute and nodded home to leave Newcastle dumbfounded. Matt Doherty goes down under a challenge from Sean Longstaff Man of the match: Sean Longstaff The Newcastle youngster continues to make his mark in the Premier League. Co-commentator Andy Hinchcliffe said: \"This was such a mature performance in such an important position in front of the back three.

Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (8), Trippier (6), Rose (6), Vertonghen (5), Sanchez (7), Winks (6), Sissoko (6), Skipp (6), Eriksen (8), Son (7), Llorente (6).

Subs: Vardy (6), Iheanacho (5), Okazaki (N/A) Man of the match: Christian Eriksen The result means Tottenham go nine points clear of fourth-placed Manchester United on 60 points. Leicester, meanwhile, remain in 12th on 32 points. Harry Maguire fired the first warning shot in the eighth minute when he escaped his marker, Fernando Llorente, to get his header on goal which forced Lloris to tip over the bar. Just a minute later, Harvey Barnes dragged an effort wide of the French goalkeeper's left post. In the 16th minute, Son was booked in controversial circumstances after going down in the box under a Maguire challenge and Leicester continued to grow in confidence as Rachid Ghezzal went close with a curled left-footed strike in the 28th minute. Barnes was afforded another opportunity just after the half-hour mark, but the 21-year-old could not produce a clean shot on target. Team news Fernando Llorente and Oliver Skipp both started for Tottenham as Lucas Moura dropped to the bench while there was no Erik Lamela. Puel made two changes to his side that were beaten 1-0 by Manchester United. Youri Tielemans made his debut while Rachid Ghezzal replaced Jamie Vardy up front. Barnes was made to rue his chance as Sanchez opened the scoring in the 33rd minute. Kieran Trippier's corner, played short to Eriksen, was swung towards the Colombia international, who dived in to open his Tottenham account in the Premier League. Five minutes into the second half and Demarai Gray squandered a good opportunity to level for the visitors as he met Pereira's cross with a tame free header, from inside the box, which was comfortably caught by Lloris. There was high drama on the hour mark when Vardy came off the bench and took Leicester's penalty seconds after Jan Vertonghen tripped James Maddison up in the box. He elected to strike it to Lloris' right, but the France World Cup winner read the spot-kick and parried it away. Christian Eriksen celebrates scoring against Leicester Tottenham responded quickly through Eriksen, who fired a dipping strike which got the better of Kasper Schmeichel from the edge of the box, but Vardy did bring Leicester back into the game with a simple tap-in 13 minutes later. In injury time, with Leicester pushing players forward, Son sealed the win for Tottenham with an incisive finish from a quick counter-attack for his 11th goal in his last 13 appearances.

continued his fine run of form with yet another hat-trick Sergio Aguero continued his fine run of form with yet another hat-trick Sergio Aguero hit his second hat-trick in eight days as Manchester City thrashed Chelsea 6-0 at the Etihad to return to the top of the Premier League. City were irresistible in the first half and raced into a 4-0 lead after just 25 minutes. Raheem Sterling put them ahead (4), running onto an effort at the far post, before Aguero's 25-yard stunner (13) into the top corner made it 2-0, moments after he had missed a sitter from close range. Aguero turned home his second after a Ross Barkley mistake (19) and Ilkay Gundogan put the game well beyond Chelsea with a low shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the box (25).

Sterling made it 6-0 from close range after fine team move (80), and the result means City go back to the top of the Premier League on goal difference, having played a game more than Liverpool. Pressure grows on Maurizio Sarri and Chelsea, who drop to sixth, a point behind fourth-placed Manchester United. City were looking to cap off a tough week of fixtures with nine points out of nine, and they got the job done before Chelsea could even think about settling. Sterling had them ahead just four minutes in, slamming home from eight yards at the far post after Bernardo Silva's cut-back had deflected into his path. It should have been 2-0 moments later through Aguero, but he uncharacteristically missed an open goal three yards out at the far post, though he did make amends in fine fashion on 13 minutes. Team news City made three changes from the side that won at Everton; Zinchenko, De Bruyne and Sterling came in, replacing Otamendi, Silva and Sane. Chelsea made two changes; Rudiger and Pedro came in for Christensen and Willian. Chelsea look dejected during a torrid show at the Etihad Picking the ball up 30 yards out, Aguero took a touch out of his feet before unleashing an unstoppable effort into the top corner past Kepa Arrizabalaga. Aguero then became City's leading league scorer with 159 goals, capitalising on Barkley's poor header back to his own goal by turning into the bottom right corner from 10 yards. The game was essentially over on 25 minutes as Gundogan's crack from the edge of the box flew past Kepa after Chelsea had failed to clear their lines again. Sarri was exploding on the touchline, but Chelsea did force a couple of chances before the break; Ederson blocked Pedro at his feet, and the City goalkeeper then acrobatically kept out Gonzalo Higuain's fine 25-yard volley.

Aguero hit the bar with a close-range header, but he completed his second hat-trick in three games from the spot after Cesar Azpilicueta's rash challenge on Sterling. Aguero, who is now level at the top of the Premier League scoring charts with Mohamed Salah (17 goals) was brought off for Gabriel Jesus on 65 minutes, and his replacement went close to making it 6-0 as Kepa saved when one-on-one. Sub David Silva then found Oleksandr Zinchenko with a beautiful ball in-behind, before the Ukrainian squared for Sterling to prod home his second from close range. City's PA system played the Madness' 'One Step Beyond' at full-time, a favourite at Stamford Bridge after Chelsea wins, while Sarri claimed he didn't see Guardiola as he headed straight down the tunnel without shaking hands on a horrible afternoon for the Italian.

Chelsea suffered their heaviest defeat in any competition since losing 0-7 to Nottingham Forest in a top-flight match in April 1991. Aguero has scored eight Premier League goals for Man City in 2019 - double that of any other player in the competition and more than 11 other Premier League clubs have managed, including Chelsea (seven). Aguero has scored a hat-trick in his last three Premier League games at the Etihad in the month of February for Man City - four v Leicester in 2018, three v Arsenal in 2019 and three v Chelsea. Chelsea conceded four goals in consecutive away top-flight matches for the first time since December 1990. Only Fulham (15) have conceded more Premier League goals during 2019 than Chelsea (13). City became the first top-flight team since Tottenham in December 1965 to score more than once in 15 consecutive home league matches. Sarri suffered his heaviest ever league defeat as a manager, with this the first time he'd seen one of his teams concede more than four goals in a match. 0:41 Referee Mike Dean teased hat-trick hero Sergio Aguero by hiding the match ball up his shirt at full-time after Manchester City’s 6-0 drubbing of Chelsea Referee Mike Dean teased hat-trick hero Sergio Aguero by hiding the match ball up his shirt at full-time after Manchester City’s 6-0 drubbing of Chelsea Man of the match To think this man was nearly out of the door when Guardiola first arrived is scary. His record against top-six sides is remarkable, and once again on Sunday he was City's main man. If he continues this form, he could be a strong contender for PFA Player of the Year. What more can you say about this man? Jamie Carragher has a go... \"In terms of a goalscorer, he's the greatest we've seen in the Premier League. That's the difference between him and the other greats, he's a goalscorer rather than the greatest all-round player.\" Aguero has scored 11 Premier League hat-tricks What's next Manchester City are at

the Premier League Highlights from Manchester United's 3-0 win over Fulham in the Premier League Paul Pogba scored twice as Manchester United moved into the top four and extended their unbeaten start under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to 11 games with a 3-0 win at Fulham. Pogba rifled United into the lead with a devastating near-post finish on 14 minutes before Anthony Martial got in on the act with a brilliant solo effort, reminiscent of Cristiano Ronaldo's strike at Craven Cottage in 2007. Fulham had started brightly and could have taken the lead through Luciano Vietto and Andre Schurrle, but United's quickfire goals knocked the wind out of their sails, with Pogba adding a third from the penalty spot midway through the second half. United were 11 points off Champions League qualification when Solskjaer took over in December, but the 10th victory of his interim tenure has moved them into the top four for the first time since the opening weekend of the season. Fulham remain second from bottom, seven points from safety with just 12 games remaining. Player ratings Fulham: Rico (4), Odoi (3), Le Marchand (3), Ream (5), Bryan (5), Schurrle (5), Chambers (5), Seri (4), Vietto (5), Babel (4), Mitrovic (5). Subs: Christie (5), Cairney (n/a), Sessegnon (n/a) Man Utd: De Gea (6), Dalot (7), Jones (8), Smalling (8), Shaw (7), Herrera (8), Matic (7), Mata (7), Pogba (9), Martial (9), Lukaku (6). Subs: Sanchez (6), McTominay (6), Bailly (n/a) Man of the Match: Paul Pogba With an eye perhaps on Tuesday's Champions League showdown with PSG, Solskjaer made no fewer than six changes, a decision which almost backfired as United took their time to settle and invited early pressure from Fulham. Vietto should have scored inside two minutes, but he dragged his close-range effort wide from Schurrle's cross, and two minutes later the German blazed over from 12 yards after an Aleksandar Mitrovic header was not sufficiently cleared. Team news United made six changes from the win at Leicester on Sunday; Dalot, Jones, Smalling, Mata, Lukaku and Martial were in, replacing Young, Bailly, Lindelof, Lingard, Rashford and Sanchez. Fulham made two changes from the defeat at Palace last weekend; Cairney and Christie went out, with Vietto and Schurrle coming in. Pogba celebrates his first goal with Martial United took full advantage of their reprieve, though, with Martial threading Pogba, who was kept onside by Joe Bryan, through on goal, and the midfielder emphatically fired past Sergio Rico at his near post, inside the quarter-hour mark. One quickly became two as Martial picked up the ball inside his own half, drove 60 yards to get away from Denis Odoi and Maxime Le Marchand and sent a clinical finish past Rico to put United in control. Martial makes it 2-0 with a stunning solo effort Having provided Martial with the ball for his strike, Phil Jones nearly added a goal to his assist with a thunderous left-footed drive, but Rico denied the centre-back his first goal since March 2014. Calum Chambers' 18-yard drive was thwarted by David de Gea before the break, but Fulham offered little else in terms of an attacking threat before their defensive fragility haunted them once again. Paul Pogba celebrates with team-mates after scoring Manchester United's third goal from the penalty spot Romelu Lukaku squared the ball to Juan Mata at the end of a dart into Fulham territory and Le Marchand bundled the Spaniard to ground in the area, presenting Pogba with the chance to double his tally from the spot. Rico dived the right way but Pogba's effort found the far corner. United will face sterner challenges this season, notably PSG on Tuesday, but yet again Solskjaer has proven he is the man with all the answers for United. Opta stats Fulham have conceded 58 goals in 26 Premier League games this season; only three sides have shipped more at this stage in the history of the competition. Manchester United have won six consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time since May 2009. Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has picked up 25 points in the Premier League since taking over in December (W8 D1), more than any other manager has managed in his first nine games in charge of a single club in the competition. Manchester United's Paul Pogba has reached double figures for goals for the first time ever in a single league campaign (11). 36% of Paul Pogba's Premier League goals for Manchester United have come in his nine games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (8/22). Anthony Martial has now been directly involved in 50 Premier League goals (33 goals, 17 assists), more than any other Manchester United player since his debut in September 2015.

1 West Ham FT Crystal Palace 1 - 1 West Ham Wilfried Zaha scored on his return from suspension as Crystal Palace drew 1-1 with West Ham at Selhurst Park in the Premier League on Saturday. West Ham took the lead in a lively first-half through Mark Noble from the penalty spot (27) after goalkeeper Vicente Guaita clattered into Michail Antonio inside the area. In an entertaining clash where two golden opportunities for Palace to equalise were spurned by James McArthur and Michy Batshuayi, Zaha found the long-awaited leveller in the 76th minute when he sneaked in a deflected strike at Lukasz Fabianski's near post to extend West Ham's winless run to four matches. A point apiece means West Ham move into 10th on 33 points by goal difference. Palace, meanwhile, have moved up to 13th on 27 points. Player ratings Crystal Palace Guaita (5), Wan-Bissaka (6), Kelly (6), Sakho (6), Van Aanholt (6), McArthur (7), Milivojevic (5), Schlupp (6), Townsend (6), Zaha (8), Benteke (6) Subs: Batshuayi (6), Meyer (7) West Ham: Fabianski (8), Fredericks (7), Diop (6), Ogbonna (7), Cresswell (7), Noble (7), Rice (6), Antonio (8), Anderson (7), Snodgrass (6), Hernandez (6) Subs: Arnautovic (5), Obiang (6), Zabaleta (N/A) Man of the Match: Michail Antonio West Ham had two good chances to take the lead in quick succession. In the 13th minute, Ryan Fredericks' close-range attempt was stopped by Guaita moments before Felipe Anderson slipped through Robert Snodgrass, whose shot was blocked by the Spanish goalkeeper. There were three yellow cards in a hotly-contested first half James McArthur unleashed a driven shot from close range in the 16th minute which Fabianski batted away with a strong right hand, but it was West Ham who took the lead in an end-to-end half. West Ham were correctly awarded a penalty when Guaita clattered into Antonio before Noble sent the 32-year-old 'keeper the wrong way from the spot to score his first goal of the season. Christian Benteke came close to equalising on the half-hour mark, but Fabianski was there again to make a fine diving stop. Team news Two changes for Crystal Palace. Wilfried Zaha came in for Jordan Ayew and Martin Kelly took the place of the injured James Tomkins. West Ham named the same team from their 1-1 draw with Liverpool. Palace were reinvigorated in the second half and should have taken the lead in the 52nd minute when Patrick van Aanholt slipped through McArthur, but he smashed his effort wide from six yards out. Batshuayi was introduced midway through the second half and was presented with a glorious chance to send Palace level in the 68th minute, but he swept a similar effort wide of Fabianski's right post. And with the clock winding down, Palace finally got the goal they were searching for through Zaha, who played a neat one-two with McArthur before his smashed shot off Pedro Obiang deflected into the top corner. To round off a game of many missed chances, Zaha then had a great opportunity to win the game for Palace in the 80th minute, but his curled strike from a narrow angle was claimed by Fabianski and the points were shared. Opta stats West Ham are unbeaten in their last eight Premier League meetings with Crystal Palace (W4 D4). Only Southampton (12) and Huddersfield (5) have picked up fewer home points in the Premier League this season than Crystal Palace (13). West Ham didn't manage a single attempt on goal in the second half, while allowing Crystal Palace 17 shots after half-time. Wilfried Zaha scored his first home goal in 11 games in all competitions for Crystal Palace, since netting against West Brom on the final day of the 2017-18 campaign. 55% of West Ham midfielder Mark Noble's Premier League goals have come from the penalty spot (21/38). Of players with at least 30 goals in the competition, only Leighton Baines (63%) and David Unsworth (58%) have scored a higher proportion from the spot. Wilfried Zaha had six shots on goal for Crystal Palace in this game, as many as the entire West Ham team managed. The managers 3:31 Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson says he was disappointed with the result but very pleased with his side's performance in their 1-1 draw with West Ham in the Premier League. Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson says he was disappointed with the result but very pleased with his side's performance in their 1-1 draw with West Ham in the Premier League. Roy Hodgson: \"If you don't miss chances, and we took every chance we got, every game would end 10-8. \"But I was disappointed in them. I really did think with the James McArthur one and the Michy Batshuayi one we were definitely going to score. \"Other chances we created the goalkeeper (Lukasz Fabianski) was very good.\" 2:04 West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini says that the draw was 'the logical result' after his side's game against Crystal Palace ended 1-1 in the Premier League. West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini says that the draw was 'the logical result' after his side's game against Crystal Palace ended 1-1 in the Premier League. Manuel Pellegrini: \"They were a little bit lucky with the goal, but they had other chances and we didn't create one in their own box. \"I thought there was 45 minutes for each team and the draw was a logical result.\" Man of the Match - Michail Antonio Michail Antonio (left) impressed against Crystal Palace Antonio was a constant thorn in the side of the Palace defence with his tireless running and physicality. He was rewarded for his efforts by winning West Ham a penalty in the first-half. The 28-year-old continued to cause Palace problems in the second half and was a useful outlet to help relieve some of the pressure on the visitors' defence. What's next?

Huddersfield 1-2 Arsenal Alex Iwobi and Alexandre Lacazette gave Arsenal an unconvincing 2-1 win at Huddersfield to keep their top-four chase on track. Iwobi opened the scoring against the run of play when his deflected effort from Sead Kolasinac's cross was palmed into the corner of his net by Ben Hamer (16). Huddersfield controlled possession for large periods of the game but nothing would fall for them inside the Arsenal area, and instead Lacazette doubled the lead just before half-time when turning in Ainsley Maitland-Niles' low cross from close range (44). The spirited hosts, who had lost 11 of their last 12, never gave up and finally got their reward in the third minute of added time in the second half when Kolasinac turned Adama Diakhaby's shot into his own goal, but it was not enough to stop Arsenal pulling back within a point of fourth-placed Manchester United. Player ratings Home Team: Hamer (6), Smith (6), Jorgensen (6), Schindler (7), Kongolo (4), Bacuna (6), Hogg (6), Mooy (7), Diakhaby (7), Kachunga (5), Puncheon (6). Subs: Durm (6), Depoitre (5), Grant (n/a). Away Team: Leno (7), Maitland-Niles (7), Mustafi (6), Koscielny (8), Monreal (6), Guendouzi (7), Torreira (6), Kolasinac (6), Mkhitaryan (8), Lacazette (7), Iwobi (6). Subs: Elneny (6), Suarez (6), Willock (n/a). Man of the match: Laurent Kosicleny Arsenal arrived looking to arrest a run of three away defeats in a row, but found Diakhaby's raw pace in behind Kolasinac tough to deal with early on. The familiar problem of a poor final ball still dogged the hosts however, and instead Arsenal went ahead with their first real chance when Kolasinac's excellent cross was met on the half-volley by Iwobi, but a deflection off Kongolo wrong-footed Hamer who could only push the ball inside the side netting. Alex Iwobi equalled his best Premier League scoring season with his goal Huddersfield failed to register a shot on target before half-time but looked like having something to build on with the break approaching, until their hopes were dashed a minute before the interval when Maitland-Niles found space on the right with Kongolo out of position, and his low ball in left Lacazette an easy finish. After the break Huddersfield looked more dangerous but were close to getting caught out again as they committed men forward, with Iwobi denied by the onrushing Hamer and Christopher Schindler's excellent challenge stopping Lacazette from scoring his second. Team news Huddersfield made four changes from the side thrashed at Chelsea, bringing in Jason Puncheon to join Adama Diakhaby and Elias Kachunga up front in a 4-3-3. Illness ruled Mesut Ozil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang out of the Arsenal squad, and Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Alex Iwobi were their two changes. At the other end, Diakhaby forced smart saves from Bernd Leno with two efforts from the edge of the area and substitute Erik Durm's cross was deflected onto the bar. But just as the hosts looked to see their hard work and improvement on recent performances unrewarded, Leno failed to deal with another Diakhaby effort which bounced off him and goalwards, only for Kolasinac to poke it into his own goal under pressure from Laurent Depoitre. Opta facts Arsenal are the only side without an away clean sheet in the Premier League this season. Sead Kolasinac's own goal was Huddersfield's first goal in 597 minutes of football in all competitions, since Steve Mounie scored against Burnley in January. Arsenal won their fifth away Premier League game of the season, one more than they managed on the road in the whole of 2017-18. Huddersfield are the first side to lose seven consecutive home Premier League games since Wolves in April 2012 (a run of nine). Alexandre Lacazette netted his first away goal in 10 games for Arsenal in all competitions, since scoring twice at Fulham back in October. Alex Iwobi has a hand in 10 goals in all competitions for Arsenal this season (4 goals, 6 assists), his best return in a single campaign for the Gunners. Managers Jan Siewert: \"We showed everyone we wanted to give a big fight and we did, until the end of the season I will fight for my life and the supporters to stay in the Premier League. 2:09 Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert was encouraged by the fighting spirit his players showed despite suffering a 2-1 defeat against Arsenal.

Unai Emery felt Arsenal controlled the majority of the game as they beat Huddersfield 2-1 in the Premier League. \"It was a struggle for every minute of the 90, and I think we controlled the match but maybe I want more possession. It's a good result after a lot of matches not winning away.\" Man of the match - Laurent Koscielny Neither side were particularly impressive in the final third but Koscielny won everything in his own area and denied Depoitre a certain goal after Leno had palmed a Diakhaby shot into his path after half-time with a stunning sliding challenge. He made more blocks (two) and clearances (10) than anyone else on the pitch, enjoyed a better passing accuracy than any other starter (90.2 per cent) and made two crucial tackles to keep his side's clean sheet in tact until Kolasinac's bizarre last-minute own goal.

"2:55 Liverpool 3-0 Bournemouth Liverpool 3-0 Bournemouth Liverpool regained the initiative in the Premier League title race as they moved three points clear of Manchester City with a 3-0 win over Bournemouth at Anfield. City had started the day top of the pile on goal difference but Jurgen Klopp's men put on a masterclass of attacking football to ease back to the summit. Sadio Mane netted for the fourth game running (24) and Georginio Wijnaldum lobbed home a delicious second (34) before Mohamed Salah (48) finished sweetly after a sensational assist by Roberto Firmino. It was a timely response from Klopp's men who had been held to back-to-back draws in the Premier League to allow City back into the hunt. Manchester City can, however, move back level on points with the Reds with a win over Chelsea on Super Sunday. Meanwhile, Bournemouth have now suffered eight straight away defeats for the first time since 1984. Player Ratings Liverpool: Alisson (7), Robertson (8), Matip (7), Van Dijk (7), Milner (7), Wijnaldum (8), Keita (7), Fabinho (8), Salah (8), Mane (8), Firmino (8) Subs: Alexander-Arnold (7), Origi (6) Bournemouth: Boruc (6), Cook (6), Ake (6), Rico (5), Smith (5), Lerma (6), Gosling (5), Surman (6), Ibe (6), King (5), Fraser (6) Subs: Solanke (6), Mousset (6) Man of the match: Georginio Wijnaldum Bournemouth made a decent start and Ryan Fraser's effort tested Alisson inside four minutes, but Liverpool were soon in their stride. James Milner provided the ammunition down the right on 24 minutes, delivering a fantastic ball that was thumped home by Mane. Team news Jurgen Klopp had Georginio Wijnaldum back and he replaced Adam Lallana while Eddie Howe made three changes from the defeat at Cardiff. Salah fluffed his lines three minutes later from Wijnaldum's square ball but it was soon to be 2-0. Liverpool's midfield general, Wijnaldum, burst into the box and produced a marvellous finish to lob an effort over Cherries 'keeper Artur Boruc and into the far corner. Bournemouth were finished off just after the break when Firmino produced one of the assists of the season to spot Salah in his wing-mirrors. The Egyptian seized upon the perfect flick and curled a fantastic effort into the corner for his 17th Premier League goal of the season. Mohamed Salah has 17 Premier League goals this season With the points in the bag for the Reds, Trent Alexander-Arnold returned from a lengthy lay-off and almost scored after another sublime Firmino pass, but Boruc stood strong. Job done for Liverpool. Over to you, Manchester City. Man of the match: Georginio Wijnaldum The lack of spark in Liverpool's midfield in the draw at West Ham was clear to see. With Wijnaldum back in the side at Anfield, he showed just how important his influence is in Klopp's engine room. His runs from midfield were a constant threat and his goal was a thing of beauty, not taken like a man who had scored more goals for his country than his club this season. He was pushed very close by Firmino for the outstanding award, as the Brazilian's passing, especially in the second half, was a sheer delight to witness. Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates after scoring Liverpool 's second goal Opta stats Liverpool have only lost one of their 15 competitive matches against Bournemouth, winning 11 (D3). Bournemouth have lost each of their last eight away Premier League games, conceding at least two goals each time. Liverpool have won six and drawn one of their seven home matches against Bournemouth in all competitions, keeping four clean sheets. Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 34 Premier League home games, winning 24 and drawing 10 Milner has provided more assists in this Premier League season (4 in 21 apps) than he did in the 2017-18 campaign (3 in 32 apps). Since his Liverpool debut in August 2017, Andy Robertson has assisted more Premier League goals (11) than any other defender. What's next? Liverpool have a 10-day break now with their next fixture being a home clash with Bayern Munich in the Champions League on February 19.

to give Cardiff a 2-1 victory at Southampton which moved them out of the Premier League's bottom three, on a day when both clubs paid tribute to Emiliano Sala. Cardiff warmed up in shirts featuring an image of their striker, who this week was confirmed to have died in a plane crash, and there was a minute's silence before kick-off. Callum Paterson wears a shirt in tribute to late team-mate Emiliano Sala When the action got underway at St Mary's, the first half was a quiet one, but Sol Bamba (69) slotted home after the break to put Cardiff ahead. It looked like Southampton had snatched a point in the first minute of added time when Jack Stephens netted at the back post, but it was the visitors who had the final say as Zohore managed to sneak the ball into the net and seal all three points for the Bluebirds. Cardiff have now won consecutive top-flight matches for the first time since April 1962 and go above Southampton into 16th place, while Saints drop into the relegation zone after Burnley's 3-1 win at Brighton, now in 18th on goal difference. Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (6), Bednarek (6), Stephens (6), Vestergaard (6), Valery (6), Hojbjerg (6), Romeu (4), Ward-Prowse (5), Bertrand (6), Long (5), Redmond (6).

Man of the match: Sol Bamba. Southampton shaded the few chances in the first half, and went close in the 12th minute. Ryan Bertrand burst down the left-hand side before whipping a cross into the area. Hojbjerg attempted a shot, but could not connect, before the ball was sent just wide by the leg of Lee Peltier. The only shot on target of the opening period came in the 39th minute as Joe Ralls' headed clearance fell to the feet of Hojbjerg, who tried his luck from 20 yards, but it went straight into the hands of Neil Etheridge at the near post. Team news Southampton made four changes with Ryan Bertrand, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Yan Valery and Shane Long coming into the side. Cardiff made just one as Harry Arter came back in for Josh Murphy. Cardiff scored from their first corner of the game in the 69th minute. Ralls delivered the set-piece, which Callum Paterson nodded down towards the back post. Bamba had got away from his marker, Oriol Romeu, to slot home before jumping over the hoardings and celebrating with the away fans. Five minutes later and Cardiff could have had a second. A clearance from Romeu landed to January signing Leandro Bacuna, who powered the ball towards goal and forced a save from Alex McCarthy. Southampton also saw three efforts blocked in quick succession in the 77th minute, with a Yan Valery shot saved by the foot of Etheridge before Charlie Austin was twice denied by Peltier. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg battles for possession in the air with Oumar Niasse As five minutes of added time were shown, Southampton found the back of the net. James Ward-Prowse delivered a corner which whistled across the face of goal and found the incoming Stephens at the back post, and he slotted home past Etheridge. But the result was not yet decided as, two minutes later, Cardiff scored their all-important winner. Harry Arter's lashed effort found the feet of Victor Camarasa, who did well to hold the ball up before laying it off to Zohore. He then fired through the packed box and saw it squeeze into the bottom corner as Cardiff snatched all three points. Match stats Southampton lost for the first time in six Premier League games (W2 D3). Southampton have kept just one clean sheet in their last 16 Premier League games (0-0 v Chelsea in January). Cardiff have netted three 90+ minute winners in the Premier League this season, a joint-high figure along with Wolves. Cardiff's Kenneth Zohore has registered two goal involvements in his last three Premier League appearances (1 goal, 1 assist), after managing just one in his previous 15 league games. The managers 3:15 Ralph Hasenhuttl was left frustrated after Southampton conceded a 93rd-minute goal to lose 2-1 to Cardiff, having equalised themselves just minutes earlier Ralph Hasenhuttl was left frustrated after Southampton conceded a 93rd-minute goal to lose 2-1 to Cardiff, having equalised themselves just minutes earlier Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"It's not about mentality, we tried everything and in the last few weeks, we went five games unbeaten so the last situation was stupid because we were not doing what we planned to do. \"I think the opponent shot three times on our goal and twice it was a goal. We had more chances and more ball possession but we can't talk about tactics today, it's not interesting for me because the main part is that we can't have a clean sheet and if you don't have that, then you have no chance to stay in the league, that is for sure.\" 4:06 Neil Warnock felt Cardiff showed 'tremendous character' after Kenneth Zohore scored a 93rd-minute winner to give them a 2-1 win over Southampton Neil Warnock felt Cardiff showed 'tremendous character' after Kenneth Zohore scored a 93rd-minute winner to give them a 2-1 win over Southampton Neil Warnock: \"You don't concede in the 93rd and score in the 94th very often, it's all the highs and lows. Their [Southampton's] staff were celebrating when they scored, and quite rightly so. I can't describe it really, it all went quiet for me, I was oblivious to all the noise when the winner went in. \"It was one of those times to have a think and I think we did Emiliano proud today for remembering him and that's a pleasing thing for me as well.\" Man of the match - Sol Bamba Cardiff City's Sol Bamba scores his side's first goal of the game Bamba showed pure passion in what was another emotional game for Cardiff. He showed great awareness to be in the right area for his goal and he went straight to the fans to celebrate. He also did his defensive work well, keeping Southampton at bay for much of the game and especially when they were peppering the Cardiff box in the first half. Neil Warnock said after the game: \"Sol has been absolute fantastic since Sean Morrison, our captain, got injured, he's lead the team and everyone has responded to him.\" What's next? Southampton now have a break of over two weeks, with their next game coming in the Premier League against Arsenal on Sunday February 24.

Watford beat Everton 1-0 at Vicarage Road Watford heaped more misery on Everton manager Marco Silva on his return to Vicarage Road as Andre Gray's 65th-minute strike was enough to secure a 1-0 win for the Hornets. After Troy Deeney had appeared to stoke the flames ahead of the encounter at a Watford fans' forum, Gray made the most of the only moment of real quality in the game when he converted Will Hughes' cut-back 20 minutes into the second period, scoring his fourth goal of the season. Everton produced very little throughout the 90 minutes and defender Kurt Zouma was sent off after the end of the match when he picked up two yellow cards for confronting the referee.

Man of the match: Craig Cathcart It is now just 11 points from the last 14 league games for Silva's side, with Watford moving four points clear of their opponents in eighth place. Watford came close to breaking the deadlock after 11 minutes when Daryl Janmaat's cross was chested into the path of Etienne Capoue by Deeney, but the Frenchman's shot hit the head of Jordan Pickford from point-blank range before flying over the crossbar. Zouma and Michael Keane had headers on target for Everton in reply but neither tested Ben Foster, although the former England goalkeeper had to be alert to palm away Cenk Tosun's fierce shot on the turn with 10 minutes of the half remaining. Gray prods in the winner after 65 minutes in Hertfordshire Team news Abdoulaye Doucoure was back having missed the last four matches with a knee injury as the Frenchman replaced former Everton midfielder Tom Cleverley in midfield for the Hornets. Marco Silva picked the same defence and middle three as those who played in the 2-0 reverse in midweek to City, but changed the front line as Cenk Tosun, Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson replaced Bernard, Theo Walcott and Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Lucas Digne blocked Gerard Deulofeu's shot from Hughes' cutback in an opening 45 minutes low on chances and quality. Both sides came close to breaking the deadlock shortly after the restart as Gylfi Sigurdsson's instinctive lob from inside the Watford penalty area thudded against the bar before Jose Holebas fizzed a shot just wide of Pickford's left-hand post. With both teams looking for that moment of class, it was finally provided by the most unlikely of sources as Craig Cathcart produced a wonderful reverse pass into the path of Hughes, whose cross was met by the unmarked substitute Gray to score. Ben Foster dives to save Kurt Zouma's header in the first half Everton had their chances to level as Digne's free-kick clipped the top of the bar, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin could only head wide from the Frenchman's cross. As the jeers rained down on Silva from the terraces at the final whistle, Zouma overstepped the mark in his protests towards referee Lee Probert, and the Frenchman was duly shown two yellow cards followed by a red, to cap another miserable afternoon for the Merseysiders. Richarlison was subdued and replaced shortly after Watford's winning goal The managers Javi Gracia said: \"I'm very happy today, after a very demanding game, to achieve three points. I'm very happy for all the players and the supporters. We knew it would be very equal with some chances for both teams. \"We had one clear chance for Capoue early on which we didn't take, and after then it was very equal. \"At half-time we decided to change the shape and try to go more direct with the second balls and I think it was better for the team.\" 2:42 Javi Gracia was proud of the way his players performed in a 'demanding game' as Watford beat Everton 1-0 in the Premier League.

Opta stats Watford have won their last three home Premier League games against Everton - the first time they've won three in a row against an opponent at Vicarage Road in the competition. Everton have lost three Premier League games in a row for the first time since January 2018 (three games in total). Watford have registered three clean sheets in their last four Premier League games, as many as they managed in their previous 21 in the competition. Everton have lost seven of their last 11 Premier League away games (W3 D1), after losing just one of the six before that (W2 D3). Everton boss Marco Silva has won just three of his 13 Premier League games at Vicarage Road (12 games as Watford manager). Andre Gray's opener for Watford ended a run of 10 Premier League appearances without a goal for the stiker, his longest goal drought in the competiton. Will Hughes registered a goal involvement on home soil for the first time in his last 13 Premier League appearances, since an assist against Bournemouth in March 2018. Man of the match - Craig Cathcart Cathcart is enjoying his best football at Watford and his fine 2019 continued with an impressive display against Everton. Silva changed his entire front-line but Richarlison, Tosun and substitute Calvert-Lewin received no change from the Northern Irishman. Craig Cathcart did not put a foot wrong as Watford kept a blunt Everton at bay This was Watford's second straight clean sheet in the Premier League and, after showing his threat in the opposition penalty area with two goals already this calendar year, the 30-year-old has been instrumental to those shut-outs. Brighton were somewhat unfortunate not to beat Foster last week, but the Watford goalkeeper's quiet afternoon here was largely due to Cathcart's frequent interventions. What's next? Watford travel to face QPR in the FA Cup fifth round next Friday before returning to Premier League action away to Cardiff on February 22. Everton have no match until February 26, when they are also away to Cardiff."},{"date": "09/02/2019", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 29323, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows": ["72"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Montoya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Duffy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Dunk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaëtan Bong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pascal Groß", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["66"]}, {"name": "Dale Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davy Propper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Solly March", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["48"]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jürgen Locadia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["66"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Beram Kayal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yves Bissouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["66"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Knockaert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["48"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alireza Jahanbakhsh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["66"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Button", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Fernandes da Silva Junior", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Burn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Burnley", "lineup": [{"name": "Tom Heaton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tarkowski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Mee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Hendrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": ["76"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight McNeil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Barnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Wood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Matthew Lowton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matej Vydra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:56 Brighton 1-3 Burnley Brighton 1-3 Burnley Chris Wood scored twice as Burnley extended their unbeaten Premier League run to seven matches with a 3-1 victory over Brighton. Wood took advantage of Lewis Dunk's slip to open the scoring in the 26th minute before making it 2-0 on the hour mark. Ashley Barnes converted a penalty in the 74th minute moments after Brighton had been denied a spot-kick of their own for handball. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (5), Bong (5), Duffy (6), Dunk (5), Montoya (5), Propper (5), Stephens (5), March (5), Gross (5), Locadia (5), Murray (5) Subs: Knockaert (6), Jahanbakhsh (5), Bissouma (5) Burnley: Heaton (8), Bardsley (7), Tarkowski (7), Mee (7), Taylor (7), Cork (7), Westwood (6), McNeil (7), Hendrick (6), Barnes (7), Wood (8) Man of the match: Chris Wood Shane Duffy headed home a quick response but it was only a consolation as Brighton's winless run continued. Chris Hughton's side have not won in the league this year and are now level on points with Burnley, with both sides three points above the relegation zone. Brighton made a positive start as Tom Heaton kept out efforts from Solly March and Pascal Gross. Burnley then hit the bar twice in quick succession as Dwight McNeil's cross was deflected onto the woodwork and Barnes headed the rebound onto the top of the bar from eight yards out. Chris Wood scored twice for Burnley Heaton made a sharp one-handed save to keep out a shot from March before Burnley took the lead in the 26th minute. Dunk's slip presented Wood with a one-on-one chance and the striker made no mistake as he finished high into the net. Brighton finished the half strongly as Duffy's header was blocked on the line by Jeff Hendrick. Ashley Barnes celebrates scoring Burnley's third goal The hosts also came out positively after half-time, only for Wood to made it 2-0 when McNeil broke through midfield and teed up the striker to finish into the bottom corner. Mat Ryan was dismayed not to keep out the shot and there was further frustration to come for Brighton. Team news The only change for either side saw Dale Stephens return for Brighton in place of Yves Bissouma. The referee waved away appeals for a Brighton penalty in the 73rd minute when the ball hit Hendrick's arm in the box, but then pointed to the spot as Burnley countered and Barnes was fouled by Ryan. Barnes converted the spot-kick and Burnley held out for victory despite Duffy heading home in the 76th minute. Opta stats Brighton have enjoyed just one win in their last 11 Premier League games (D3 L7), after winning five of the eight before that (D1 L2). Burnley are unbeaten in their last seven Premier League games (W4 D3), their longest run without defeat in the top-flight since February 1975 (also 7). Brighton have conceded eight penalties in the Premier League this season, more than any other side. Burnley's current run of seven games unbeaten in the Premier League is bettered only by Manchester United (9). Only Liverpool (16) have scored more goals from set-piece situations (excluding penalties) than Brighton this season (12). Burnley striker Chris Wood has now scored seven league goals against Brighton; against no other side has he netted more (also 7 v Huddersfield Town). Of players with at least five Premier League goals this season, Burnley's Chris Wood has scored the highest proportion away from home - 83% (5/6). Ashley Barnes has registered four goal involvements in his last three Premier League appearances for Burnley (3 goals, 1 assists), one more than in his previous 16 in the competition (3). Brighton Shane Duffy has scored five goals in the Premier League this season, more than any other defender. Man of the match - Chris Wood Heaton made some important saves in the first half, but Wood got the goals to put Burnley in front. His first was a clinical finish and even though Ryan was frustrated not to keep out the second, it was heading for the bottom corner. What's next? Brighton host Derby in the fifth round of the FA Cup next Saturday before a trip to Leicester in the Premier League on Tuesday, February 26. Burnley are at home against Tottenham next Saturday, live on Sky Sports, and then travel to Newcastle on February 26."},{"date": "06/02/2019", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39322,

Manchester City's 2-0 win at Everton in the Premier League Manchester City returned to the top of the Premier League after late goals in either half from Aymeric Laporte and Gabriel Jesus secured a 2-0 win at Everton on Wednesday night. Laporte made up for planting an early header wide by rising to nod David Silva's free-kick beyond Jordan Pickford from eight yards with the last kick of the first half at Goodison Park. Everton were much improved from their woeful home defeat to Wolves at the weekend but lacked the guile to unlock the City defence and continued to look vulnerable from set pieces, with Leroy Sane also going close from a corner in the first half, while in open play Ilkay Gundogan struck the bar from close range. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Kenny (7), Zouma (7), Keane (6), Digne (7), Gueye (6), Davies (7), Gomes (5), Walcott (5), Calvert-Lewin (6), Bernard (6). Subs: Sigurdsson (5), Richarlison (6), Tosun (5). Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (5), Stones (6), Otamendi (7), Laporte (7), Gundogan (8), Fernandinho (6), David Silva (7), Bernardo Silva (7), Aguero (5), Leroy Sane (5). Subs: Sterling (7), Jesus (7), De Bruyne (n/a). Man of the match: Ilkay Gundogan After half-time, the visitors controlled possession and always looked the more dangerous, with substitute Gabriel Jesus wrapping up victory in the seventh minute of added time from a perfect slide-rule Kevin De Bruyne pass. Having trailed by 10 points barely a month ago, the result allowed Manchester City to take advantage of Liverpool dropping four points in two games to go top of the table on goal difference. Jurgen Klopp side's do have a game in hand, but it is away at the Premier League's in-form side Manchester United on February 24, live on Sky Sports. After Sane had fired wide from the edge of the box when a corner was half-cleared three minutes in, City looked like they were feeling the pressure of the chance to go top and Everton gave as good as they got in the opening stages. Aymeric Laporte heads in his second Premier League goal for Man City since joining last January What City lacked in fluid play, down in part to Everton's compact 4-5-1 out of possession, they did make up for in chances and should have made the most of the hosts' woeful record from dead balls when Laporte headed Gundogan's excellent corner to the back post wide when unmarked. Everton had already conceded a league-high 11 games from set-pieces but City came even closer with their next attack from open play, as David Silva's cutback was turned onto the woodwork by Gundogan, who was no more than eight yards out. For the most part, the hosts frustrated their visitors while sacrificing their own attacking intent, and looked like they would be vindicated by going in level at the break - only for David Silva to deliver a perfect free-kick into the middle in the dying seconds of the half and Laporte made no mistake in firing the ball home. Team news Marco Silva made five changes to the Everton side beaten by Wolves on Saturday, leaving Richarlison and Gylfi Sigurdsson on the bench. There were no such wholesale changes for Manchester City, who brought in Leroy Sane and John Stones for Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne. Gueye finally gave Ederson something to do after half-time, returning a half-cleared corner goalwards minutes after the break, but the Brazilian goalkeeper was equal to it and saved comfortably. At the other end, Pickford was nearly caught out twice - first when caught in no-man's land when his punch landed for Sergio Aguero to volley acrobatically inches wide, before a deflected Raheem Sterling shot dropped no more than a foot over his bar with the goalkeeper rooted to the spot. Everton continued to move the ball well but still struggled to find inroads while Manchester City looked comfortable to see out a 1-0, only to be handed a glorious chance to seal the points in the last minute of seven added on at full-time. Substitutes De Bruyne and Jesus linked up as the Brazilian timed his run behind the Everton defence to perfection and was fed by a fine through-ball. His first effort was saved by Pickford but only ballooned back up into his path, and he nodded over a despairing Kurt Zouma and into the far corner. Gabriel Jesus celebrates his 97th-minute goal for Manchester City at Everton Opta facts Everton have conceded more goals from set pieces than any other Premier League team in all competitions this season (19). Manchester City have scored with their first shot on target in 15 Premier League games this season - six more than any other team. All four of Aymeric Laporte's goals in all competitions for Manchester City this season have been headers from set pieces in away matches. Everton are yet to win a Premier League match when conceding first this season (P12 W0 D2 L10). Marco Silva has now lost five Premier League games against Manchester City - two more than he has against any other opponent. Everton made five line-up changes for this match - their most between Premier League matches under manager Marco Silva. Manchester City have won 10 of their last 11 matches in all competitions (L1), scoring 39 goals and conceding just five. Managers Marco Silva: Everything was different from Wolves. This has to be our image as a team, you have to be consistent in some things and it's an obligation for us - aggressiveness, desire to win, and that's what we need every time. 5:39 Everton manager Marco Silva felt his side lacked aggression during the set-piece that allowed Man City to take the lead. Everton manager Marco Silva felt his side lacked aggression during the set-piece that allowed Man City to take the lead. We needed to be more aggressive [from the free-kick]. They did the fake move and we moved a little bit, but after that the ball in the air, it was a good delivery and header, but we have to at least challenge the ball which we didn't. Pep Guardiola: It's good, sleeping being top of the table, it's much better, but Liverpool have one game extra at Old Trafford. I don't think too much about it really, we have an incredible test next Sunday, the cup and Champions League starts again. 2:55 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said his side were tired but they had a great mentality to secure a crucial win at Everton. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said his side were tired but they had a great mentality to secure a crucial win at Everton. I don't think much about being first or second - but we could have done one month 10 points behind, four or five days ago we could have been seven and now we're top. It's a lesson not to give up, many things are going to happen Man of the match - Ilkay Gundogan On a night where silky football was largely lacking, Gundogan did his best to get City up to the speed of their usual zip, creating several chances and going close to opening the scoring but for the crossbar early on. His deliveries were also excellent all night, including the first-half corner which should have been headed in by Laporte. What's next? Everton visit Marco Silva's former club Watford on Saturday at 3pm, while Manchester City host Chelsea a day later live on Renault Super Sunday from 3.30pm on Sky Sports Premier League."},{"date":

Premier League after a lacklustre performance in their 1-1 draw at West Ham. Sadio Mane gave Jurgen Klopp's side the lead in controversial fashion at the London Stadium as James Milner was in an offside position before he crossed for the forward to score (22). But Liverpool's lead lasted just six minutes as Michail Antonio received Felipe Anderson's disguised free-kick to flash in the equaliser (28). Declan Rice and Mark Noble both had good opportunities to complete the turnaround before Divock Origi wasted a glorious chance to snatch it for Liverpool in stoppage time. Michail Antonio celebrates hauling the Hammers level in the first half The result stretches Liverpool's lead at the top to three points, but City would move top on goal difference if they beat Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (6), Cresswell (7), Fredericks (7), Diop (8), Ogbonna (7), Rice (7), Noble (8), Anderson (8), Snodgrass (7), Hernandez (7), Antonio (7). Subs: Carroll (n/a), Obiang (n/a), Masuaku (n/a) Liverpool: Alisson (6), Robertson (7), Matip (6), van Dijk (6), Milner (7), Lallana (7), Keita (6), Fabinho (6), Salah (5), Mane (6), Firmino (6). Subs: Shaqiri (6), Origi (n/a) Man of the match: Felipe Anderson Javier Hernandez fired the first warning sign three minutes in, as he received Noble's pass before shooting wide of Alisson's left-hand post. Aaron Cresswell was next to go close with a rasping left-foot drive that narrowly missed the target, but Liverpool then broke the deadlock against the run of play. Adam Lallana showed great skill to escape Cresswell, but Milner received his pass a yard offside before his cross evaded Issa Diop to allow Mane to fire beyond Lukasz Fabianski. Sadio Mane slides Liverpool in front after receiving James Milner's cross Team news Arnautovic was not in the matchday squad as Hernandez replaced him up front. Cresswell and Fredericks both returned. There was no Henderson or Wijnaldum in the Liverpool squad as Lallana was handed a first Premier League start since October, while Fabinho and Milner also came in. West Ham's response was immediate. A foul from Fabinho allowed Anderson to find Antonio in the box and the 28-year-old forward flashed in the fourth goal of his career against Liverpool. Three minutes before the interval, Liverpool's defence was again vulnerable from a West Ham free-kick as Anderson found Rice unmarked, but the youngster's header was off target. Mane went close again before the interval with his header saved by Fabianski, but there were few notable openings in a cagey second period. Noble lashed over from Robert Snodgrass' cross with 17 minutes remaining as Liverpool struggled to break down West Ham's dogged defence, but it looked like the visitors would snatch victory when Keita found substitute Origi in the third minute of stoppage time. The Belgian had been the hero with his injury-time winner in the Merseyside derby earlier in the season but could only scuff his shot at Fabianski this time as two points slipped out of Liverpool's grasp. The managers Manuel Pellegrini: \"We returned to the pace we have shown in previous games. You can't play in any games if you don't have high pace. \"After we beat Arsenal, it was similar work that we did today. We created more chances tonight, but having lost those three games, the team we saw tonight is the team we must try to play from now until the end of the season.\" 2:24 West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini says he's disappointed with his side's 1-1 draw against Liverpool after the Reds' goal came from an offside position West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini says he's disappointed with his side's 1-1 draw against Liverpool after the Reds' goal came from an offside position Jurgen Klopp: \"It was not our best performance of course because we came up against difficult opponents. \"We had good moments, coming through the channels and scored the goal, which I've now been told is offside. This explains a little bit the second half, because I think the referee knew at half-time. \"He knew it for sure at half-time, and then you saw a lot of strange situations. They were not decisive but just rhythm breakers. That obviously didn't help us.\" 4:56 Jurgen Klopp reflects on Liverpool's 1-1 draw away at West Ham, which sees them stretch their gap at the top of the Premier League to only three points Jurgen Klopp reflects on Liverpool's 1-1 draw away at West Ham, which sees them stretch their gap at the top of the Premier League to only three points Man of the match - Felipe Anderson Liverpool have struggled at right back in Trent Alexander-Arnold's absence, and West Ham targeted that area with Anderson causing Milner countless problems. In the first half in particular, the Brazilian created three chances, more than any other player on the pitch. Felipe Anderson took the pressure off West Ham's defence with his dribbling His delivery from wide areas instilled fear in the Liverpool defence and he was again at the heart of West Ham's counter-attacks in the second period, retaining the ball to ease the pressure on his defenders. After a recent dip, here was Anderson back to his best. Opta stats West Ham are unbeaten in three consecutive home Premier League games (W1 D2) for the first time since February 2018 (a run of four). Liverpool have won 62 points from their opening 25 Premier League games this season - only during the 1987/88 campaign have they had more points at this stage of a top-flight season (63 - 3pts for a win). Sadio Mané has scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances for Liverpool for only the second time, also doing so in August 2017 (a run of four). Liverpool's Sadio Mané has scored three goals in his last three Premier League appearances, having scored just two in his previous 11 games. Liverpool's James Milner has registered 81 assists in the Premier League, the seventh-highest total in the competition and one more than David Beckham (80). West Ham's Michail Antonio has scored four goals in his five Premier League games against Liverpool, more than he has managed against any other side. Liverpool's Naby Keita has made more Premier League appearances without losing a game than any other player in the competition's history (18 games, 14 wins, 4 draws). What's next? West Ham travel across London to play Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday while Liverpool will host Bournemouth."},{"date": "03/02/2019", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance":

United win 1-0 at Leicester City Watch highlights as Manchester United win 1-0 at Leicester City Marcus Rashford's early goal gave Ole Gunnar Solskjaer a ninth win from 10 games as Manchester United boss with a 1-0 victory at Leicester. Rashford, on his 100th United appearance, rifled Paul Pogba's inviting pass over the top past Kasper Schmeichel with nine minutes gone as United took full advantage of Leicester's run of slow starts this season. But their intensity did not match that of recent games and they created little else before half-time, although Leicester also looked devoid of ideas. After half-time the hosts improved and Rachid Ghezzal's free kick forced a save from David de Gea before Jonny Evans missed a great chance to score against his old club, but United stood firm and move within two points of fourth-placed Chelsea. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Pereira (6), Evans (6), Maguire (6), Chilwell (7), Mendy (5), Ndidi (6), Barnes (7), Maddison (7), Gray (5), Vardy (6). Subs: Ghezzal (6), Okazaki (6), Iheanacho (n/a). Man Utd: De Gea (6), Young (6), Lindelof (6), Bailly (7), Shaw (7), Herrera (6), Matic (7), Pogba (7), Lingard (6), Rashford (7), Sanchez (5). Subs: Martial (7), Lukaku (6), Jones (n/a). Man of the match: Marcus Rashford Leicester have struggled to get out of the traps all season, shipping 10 goals in the first 15 minutes of games, and another false start would ultimately prove their downfall yet again. Rashford should have already put United ahead within five minutes, diverting Luke Shaw's perfect cross wide when it was easier to score. But he soon made amends by bringing down an equally fine lofted pass from Pogba, and firing beyond Schmeichel. Solskjaer has won seven of his eight Premier League games as United manager United's onslaught soon waned but the hosts, despite plenty of territory, could not test De Gea. Harvey Barnes bent a first-time effort beyond the far post from 25 yards and Evans headed wide but, as is becoming a theme, Leicester lacked the ingenuity to even threaten a goal. After half-time it was a different story. De Gea stuck out an arm to ensure Barnes' effort from the angle was going wide within a minute of the restart, before Maddison's deflected free-kick was met acrobatically by Jamie Vardy but clawed off the line by the United goalkeeper. Team news Leicester's one change from their draw at Liverpool was enforced, with Marc Albrighton's injury meaning Harvey Barnes returned to the starting line-up. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer shuffled his Manchester United pack, bringing in Alexis Sanchez as one of four changes. United responded with Rashford firing wide from the edge of the area, but finally there were two teams competing - and substitute Ghezzal tested De Gea before Evans missed his kick from Harry Maguire's header back across goal in their best chance of the afternoon. Nemanja Matic was lucky to avoid a second yellow card late on when he caught Barnes on the thigh but the Leicester winger showed no ill effects moments later to race away down the left and lay the ball back for Vardy - whose shot could not have been closer to De Gea if he tried. Second-half arrivals Romelu Lukaku and Anthony Martial threatened to put the game beyond a revitalised Leicester in the dying moments, but two saves from Schmeichel proved immaterial as the visitors earned their 22nd point from eight league games under Solskjaer. Opta facts Manchester United have won five consecutive away games in all competitions for the first time since October 2012. Leicester City have lost more Premier League games against Man Utd (17) than they have against any other side. Since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first game in charge of Man Utd on December 22, Paul Pogba has had a hand in more Premier League goals than any other player (11 - 6 goals, 5 assists). Leicester have lost four of their last five games in all competitions (D1), as many as they'd lost in their previous 15 matches combined. Marcus Rashford has scored more goals in all competitions since his debut (42) than any other Manchester United player. Manchester United have won four more points than any other Premier League team since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first match in charge (W7 D1 L0 - 22 points). Only Ryan Giggs (21y 74d) has reached 100 Premier League appearances for Manchester United at a younger age than Marcus Rashford (21y 95d). Referee Mike Dean handed out eight yellow cards in this match (four to Leicester, four to Man Utd) - only one Premier League game (Arsenal vs Huddersfield in December) has seen more yellow cards awarded this season (9 yellow cards). Managers Claude Puel: \"I think it's not a fair result but I'm angry about our poor performance at the beginning of the game. To concede another goal early, to have to chase the game is always difficult. 4:07 Claude Puel was frustrated with his Leicester side's poor start to the match Claude Puel was frustrated with his Leicester side's poor start to the match \"I don't understand sometimes, it's crazy. At the beginning we don't believe enough in our quality because after when we play, we play forward with good intention and can hurt a team like United. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"We didn't play particularly well, we could have slowed it down in the second half but we defended well. Eric [Bailly] and Victor [Lindelof] were fantastic, and David de Gea. \"We put our bodies on the line, there were a couple of bruised noses, knees and dead legs but we fought for the three points.\" Man of the match - Marcus Rashford Rashford kept up his sensational scoring run with a sixth goal in eight league games at Leicester, although he could have had another even before that. Rashford has scored almost a quarter of his Premier League goals since Solskjaer's arrival Over the course of the 90 minutes he had more shots than anyone else (5) while also putting in a defensive shift by making more clearances (3) than anyone else outside of United's back five.

City reduced the gap at the top of the Premier League to two points for 24 hours at least as Sergio Aguero's hat-trick helped them to a 3-1 win over Arsenal. The reigning champions took the lead after 46 seconds through Aguero's header as Arsenal nearly crumbled early on, but they were soon level as Laurent Koscielny scored a header of his own from a corner (11). But City went in ahead at half-time as Aguero simply finished off from Raheem Sterling's fine assist (44), and the Argentine completed his hat-trick with a fortuitous close-range touch off the side of his body (61), through there was a suspicion of handball. The result means pressure is back on Liverpool to regain their five-point lead against West Ham on Monday Night Football, live on Sky Sports Premier League, while Arsenal move down to sixth, three points off the top four. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (7), Fernandino (7), Otamendi (7), Laporte (8), Gundogan (7), David Silva (7), De Bruyne (7), Bernardo Silva (7), Sterling (9), Aguero (10) Subs: Jesus (NA), Mahrez (NA) Arsenal: Leno (7), Lichtsteiner (6), Kolasinac (7), Mustafi (6), Monreal (6), Koscielny (7), Torreira (6), Guendouzi (7), Iwobi (5), Aubameyang (6), Lacazette (7) Subs: Ramsey (6), Suarez (6), Mavropanos (NA) Man of the match: Sergio Aguero Pep Guardiola surprised all with his team selection as Fernandinho started at centre-back and Aymeric Laporte at left-back, but it looked to work a treat early on as City dominated. After scoring just 24 seconds in against Newcastle, City fans had to wait 46 seconds for their opener this time courtesy of Aguero again, heading home unmarked six yards out from Laporte's left-wing cross after the Frenchman robbed Alex Iwobi on the edge of the area. City piled forward and threatened a quick-fire second, but Arsenal levelled as Nacho Monreal flicked on Lucas Torreira's corner for Koscielny to nod in at the back post having got away from Sterling. Sergio Aguero celebrates his hat-trick goal - but it was a contentious one Team news Man City made three changes following their surprise midweek loss, John Stones and Danilo dropping to the bench and Nicolas Otamendi and Ilkay Gundogan in the side. Bernardo Silva replaced Leroy Sane. Mesut Ozil reverted to a substitutes' role for Arsenal but was joined on the bench by new signing Denis Suarez. Captain Laurent Koscielny returned. Arsenal grew into the game and looked the happier of the two sides going into the break, but they were stung late in the half via a slick City move. Ilkay Gundogan's deft chip over the Arsenal defence for Sterling still left the England winger with a job to do to find Aguero at the back post, but he did so superbly with a fine first-time volleyed cross for the Argentine to tap in. Sergio Aguero squeezes the ball over the line for his hat-trick City nearly got a third after the break as Bernd Leno blocked Kevin De Bruyne's close-range effort, but Aguero was in the right place to bundle Sterling's low cross from the left over the line just after the hour, though replays show the ball hit his arm. Leno parried away Aguero's deflected effort from the edge of the box to deny him a fourth, and Leno kept the score down again moments later, smartly tipping away David Silva's 20-yard shot. City eased the game out at 3-1, meaning attention turns back to Liverpool and their trip to London on MNF with just over a third of the season remaining. Man of the match - Sergio Aguero When City need their man, he always answers. Yes, you get chances playing in this wonderful side, but Aguero doesn't simply wait for them to fall at his feet. He's optimistic, works hard to force mistakes, and makes teams pay. A man for the big occasion, Aguero has now scored a staggering 40 goals in 63 games against big-six opponents, 19 more than any other player since he arrived in England. Not only is Aguero clinical in front of goal; his passing accuracy was the best of any attacking player on the pitch (92.6 per cent). Opta stats Manchester City have won four consecutive top-flight games against Arsenal for the first time since April 1937. Since the start of 2018, only two teams have lost more away games than Arsenal (12) in the Premier League - Brighton (14) and Huddersfield (13). Manchester City have won eight of their nine games in all competitions in 2019 (L1), scoring 34 goals and conceding just four in return. Only Alan Shearer (11) has scored more hat-tricks in the Premier League than Manchester City's Sergio Aguero (10). Sergio Aguero has been directly involved in 27 goals in his last 15 home starts in the Premier League (22 goals, 5 assists). At the age of 24 years and 57 days, Raheem Sterling has become the seventh youngest player in Premier League history to register 100 goal involvements in the competition (59 goals, 40 assists). Sergio Aguero has scored both of the two quickest goals in the Premier League this season (24 seconds v Newcastle and 46 seconds v Arsenal), with both coming in Manchester City's last two league games. Manchester City's opening goal (0:46) was the quickest that Arsenal have conceded in a Premier League game since December 2014, when Stoke's Peter Crouch scored against them after 19 seconds. Fifty per cent of Manchester City's goals conceded in the Premier League this season have been from set pieces; the highest ratio in the division (10/20). What's next?

Newcastle in the Premier League Heung-Min Son's late goal finally broke down Newcastle's resistance as Tottenham earned a 1-0 win at Wembley in the Premier League on Saturday. The South Korean, who has now scored two in two since returning from the Asia Cup, saw a low effort from the edge of the box creep under the body of Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka (83), who will feel he should have done better. In an entertaining clash, Lucas Moura missed a fine opportunity in the first half, heading wide in space, Erik Lamela hit the woodwork with his own headed effort, while at the other end after half-time Salomon Rondon also nodded against the far post. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Trippier (7), Alderweireld (7), Sanchez (7), Vertonghen (7), Lamela (6), Winks (7), Sissoko (6), Eriksen (8), Son (8), Moura (6) Subs: Llorente (7), Rose (NA), Dier (NA) Newcastle: Dubravka (4), Yedlin (6), Lejeune (6), Schar (6), Lascelles (6), Ritchie (6), Hayden (6), Longstaff (6), Atsu (6), Perez (6), Rondon (7) Subs: Kenedy (NA), Barreca (NA) Man of the match: Heung-Min Son Christian Eriksen saw a cute flick cleared off the line by Fabian Schar, before Son's late winner. The result means Tottenham have gone 29 league games without a draw, breaking a Premier League record, and puts Mauricio Pochettino's side second in the Premier League for 24 hours at least before Manchester City's clash with Arsenal on Super Sunday. Freezing conditions overnight brought concern in the early stages at Wembley, with large ice clumps falling onto the pitch from the famous arch at the national stadium, narrowly avoiding both Dubravka and Spurs' Kieran Trippier. 0:18 Ice falls off the Wembley arch and nearly hits Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka Ice falls off the Wembley arch and nearly hits Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka Wednesday's match-winner Fernando Llorente will have raised an eyebrow from the bench as Spurs went close with two first-half headers. First, Moura headed wide in acres of space from eight yards from Lamela's deft cross, before the Argentine hit the upright with a more difficult headed chance moments later from Jan Vertonghen's bouncing cross. Team news Fernando Llorente was left on the bench despite scoring in his previous two games; Lucas Moura came in, while Trippier replaced Aurier and Lamela came in for Rose. Newcastle were unchanged following the 2-1 win over Manchester City. Heung-min Son in action at Wembley against Newcastle United Despite Spurs dominating the ball, Newcastle did create a nuisance on several occasions. Lone striker Rondon hit the post with a header back across goal from Deandre Yedlin's cross after the restart, as the game opened up at Wembley. Eriksen's flick towards goal from an angle was just cleared off the line by Schar, while Hugo Lloris was then called into action to acrobatically tip away Ayoze Perez's shot from the edge of the box. Christian Eriksen's flicked effort was just cleared off the line by Fabian Schar in the second half, confirmed by the goal decision system (GDS) Llorente was introduced on the hour, and ten minutes later headed over the bar in space from Eriksen's delightful ball, seemingly blaming the sun for his miscued effort. Spurs love a late goal, having left it to the dying stages to beat Watford on Wednesday at Wembley, but this winner was avoidable from a Newcastle point of view. Receiving a knockdown from Llorente on the edge of the box, Son found a yard of space and hit a hopeful low shot at Dubravka, only for the Slovakian to parry it into the net when he should have saved. Tottenham and Newcastle players look on as Salomon Rondon's shot hits the post The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"Our squad deserve massive, massive credit. We are disappointed because of the semi-final of the Carabao Cup, out of the FA Cup to Palace, we arrive at the worst moment for us as it was difficult to rotate and keep the same level in all of the different decisive games.\" 4:13 Mauricio Pochettino believes his Tottenham squad deserves “massive credit” for staying competitive in the Premier League Mauricio Pochettino believes his Tottenham squad deserves “massive credit” for staying competitive in the Premier League Rafa Benitez: \"We did well for a while in the first half, we had the chances in the beginning of the second half. We defended well, but the problem for us is conceding this kind of goal. You could concede another one, but this one we could avoid.\" 3:00 Rafa Benitez insists Newcastle have had a good week despite their late 1-0 defeat Rafa Benitez insists Newcastle have had a good week despite their late 1-0 defeat Opta stats Tottenham have gone 29 games without a draw in the Premier League, a new record, beating Bolton's previous best of 28 set in 2011. Newcastle have lost their last eight visits to Wembley in all competitions since winning the 1955 FA Cup final against Man City - extending their record for worst losing run by a team at the stadium. Tottenham have lost just one of their last 27 home Premier League games in February (W19 D7). Newcastle have lost 13 of their last 14 Premier League games away to 'big six' teams (D1), since beating Tottenham 2-1 in December 2015. Man of the match - Heung-Min Son Son proved once again what Spurs had been missing during his stint at the Asia Cup. His goal may have squirmed under Dubravka, but his touch to set up the shot, away from Sean Longstaff, was superb. He was a constant nuisance for the Newcastle defence - his 16 sprints were the most from any player - and the more we hear from Son, the less Harry Kane is missed. 🍾Man of the Match, @SpursOfficial’s Heung-Min Son🍾 68 touches 42 passes, created 1 chance 16 sprints, most in match 5 shots, 1 on target 10th PL goal this season, all since Nov 24 pic.twitter.com/ZunnCdNCAy — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) February 2, 2019 What's next?

Brighton's 0-0 draw with Watford in the Premier League Highlights from Brighton's 0-0 draw with Watford in the Premier League Ben Foster twice denied Jurgen Locadia in a game of few chances as Watford held Brighton to a 0-0 draw at the Amex Stadium. Foster kept out a looping header from the Dutch forward before half-time and pulled off a superb save to keep the score goalless with time running out as Locadia aimed for the top corner with another aerial chance. Watford defended stoutly but lacked imagination in attack, and failed to register a single shot on target across the 90 minutes. Javi Gracia's side had Foster to thank once again in the final minutes when substitute Florin Andone raced through on goal, but was denied by a strong block from the visiting goalkeeper. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Montoya (6), Duffy (6), Dunk (7), Bong (6), Gross (7), Propper (7), Bissouma (6), March (7), Murray (6), Locadia (7). Subs: Andone (7). Watford: Foster (8), Janmaat (7), Mariappa (7), Cathcart (7), Holebas (6), Hughes (5), Capoue (6), Cleverley (6), Sema (4), Deeney (5), Deulofeu (4). Subs: Gray (5), Quina (n/a) Man of the match: Ben Foster Brighton manager Chris Hughton gave the 11 who had started their 4-2 defeat at Fulham on Tuesday a chance to redeem themselves against Watford, but they rarely looked like clicking into gear on the home soil where they have performed so well. It took some 40 minutes for the first shot on target to arrive from either side, when Pascal Gross' cross from the right was headed back across goal by Locadia, but was palmed behind acrobatically by Foster. Jurgen Locadia was twice denied by Ben Foster After half-time, Watford briefly looked like taking control when Will Hughes' shot, which was going wide, was held by Mat Ryan, before Ken Sema could not keep a header down from six yards out. But Brighton had the better of the final half hour in an attritional performance with Locadia again testing Foster, who leapt to his right to keep out another header which looked to be just creeping in under the bar. Team news Brighton were forced into a late change when Dale Stephens was injured in the warm-up, and Yves Bissouma took his place in midfield. Watford's only change was also down to injury, with Roberto Pereyra ruled out by a knock and Ken Sema starting on the left of midfield. In the final minutes, Brighton nearly forced an opener when Solly March's ball over the top found Andone, but Foster was quick off his line to spread himself and keep out his effort from the edge of the area. Opta facts Brighton have failed to score in three consecutive home games in all competitions (W0 D2 L1) for the first time since January 2016. This was Watford manager Javier Gracia's 39th Premier League game in charge of the Hornets, more than any other manager for the club in the competition. Watford failed to direct a single shot on target for the only the second time in their last 53 Premier League games, and for the first time in 11 in the competition. Brighton have never lost a Premier League game in February (W2 D2), one of just two teams to be unbeaten in a single month in the competition's history (Blackpool W2 D0 L0 in December). Two of Watford's last three Premier League games have finished goalless, as many as in their previous 57 in the competition. Brighton have won just one of their last 10 Premier League games, drawing three and losing six. Man of the match - Ben Foster Foster's performance was one of few to get you off your seat at the Amex Stadium. He became the record holder for all-time Premier League saves during Watford's midweek defeat at Tottenham, and he pulled off three fine ones here. The pick of his stops was arguably his reaction save to keep out Locadia's second-half header, and he can be very pleased with his afternoon's work. Managers 2:10 Chris Hughton was frustrated that Brighton were unable to break the deadlock in their goalless draw at home to Watford Chris Hughton was frustrated that Brighton were unable to break the deadlock in their goalless draw at home to Watford Chris Hughton: \"The only frustration is that it's a game we should have won. I thought we were very good, we asked for a reaction and I probably couldn't have asked for any more. \"We had a lot of shots, the 'keeper has had to make three very good saves, and we can't ask any more than that but it's just that little bit of quality let us down. But with regards to commitment, I thought we were very good. 1:43 Javi Gracia was disappointed with Watford's offensive display as they were held to a goalless draw by Brighton Javi Gracia was disappointed with Watford's offensive display as they were held to a goalless draw by Brighton Javi Gracia: \"You always want to win to get three points, but after the game I think one point is good.

Ings, under pressure by Ben Mee, managed a shot on target but could only poke at the chest of Burnley keeper Tom Heaton. Ings was then forced off on 26 minutes, taking the spring out of Southampton's steps and allowing Burnley the better chances as the first half drew to a close. Nathan Redmond's long-range striker gives Southampton the lead against Burnley Barnes was furious to be denied a penalty when brought down by Alex McCarthy in the box, prompting the striker to scream at the linesman and receive a booking. Team news Southampton made two changes to the side that drew with Crystal palace in midweek, while Burnley named an unchanged side to the one that drew 2-2 at Old Trafford. New signing Peter Crouch started on the bench. Phil Bardsley cleared a Stuart Armstrong header off the line early in the second half, as Saints pushed for an opener. They were rewarded when Jan Bednarek found Redmond 30 yards out who drove at a Burnley defence before striking the ball beyond Heaton from outside the box. ⚽ Ashley Barnes has scored the 1st penalty that Burnley have been awarded in 68 PL games, a run that dates back to April 2017 pic.twitter.com/7Pox4Jaj3n — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) February 2, 2019 Saints sat back following their excellent opener, and Burnley responded by bringing on Deadline Day signing Peter Crouch. Burnley then went close with Barnes firing a shot against the bar before Crouch was influential in winning the late penalty that Barnes duly dispatched. The result means that both sides keep their unbeaten runs, but failed to put more space between themselves and the relegation zone. Peter Crouch won Burnley a late penalty against Southampton at Turf Moor Opta stats Burnley are winless in their last 14 Premier League games played in February (D7 L7) since winning their first ever such game in the month in 2010 (2-1 vs West Ham). Southampton have won eight points in their last four Premier League away games (W2 D2), as many as they managed in their previous 11. Southampton are unbeaten in five Premier League games (W2 D3), their longest run without defeat in the competition since October 2016 (also 5 games). Peter Crouch became the second oldest player to play for Burnley in the Premier League (38y 3d) after Graham Alexander in May 2010 (38y 211d). Burnley's Peter Crouch has played for seven different clubs in the Premier League, with only Marcus Bent appearing for more (8, with Craig Bellamy, Andrew Cole, Wayne Routledge and Tal Ben Haim also managing 7). Ashley Barnes has scored 15 goals for Burnley in the league since the start of last season, more than any other player at the club. Managers Sean Dyche: \"I thought we were excellent throughout, I thought we kept knocking on the door, and at last we get a penalty and it should've been two. 2:51 Sean Dyche says it's 'impossible' that Burnley didn't get given two penalty decisions in their 1-1 draw with Southampton.

Man of the match: Matthew Targett Southampton's best attacking outlet created problems for the Burnley defence all evening, creating three chances for his team-mates and taking two shots himself.

Highlights from Chelsea's 5-0 win over Huddersfield in the Premier League Gonzalo Higuain and Eden Hazard both scored twice as Chelsea returned to winning ways with a much-needed 5-0 victory over Huddersfield. Higuain opened the scoring after 16 minutes with his first goal for Chelsea, who came under scrutiny after they were thrashed 4-0 by Bournemouth on Wednesday. Hazard made it 2-0 with a penalty in first-half injury-time and then added the third in the 66th minute. Player ratings Chelsea: Kepa (6), Alonso (6), Luiz (7), Christensen (7), Azpilicueta (7), Jorginho (6), Kante (7), Barkley (6), Willian (7), Hazard (9), Higuain (8) Subs: Kovacic (5), Hudson-Odoi (5), Loftus-Cheek (5) Huddersfield: Lossl (5), Smith (5), Kongolo (5), Schindler (5), Lowe (5), Bacuna (5), Billing (5), Mooy (5), Mbenza (4), Kachunga (5), Diakhaby (5) Subs: Mounie (5), Grant (5), Pritchard (5) Man of the match: Eden Hazard January signing Higuain curled in his second shortly afterwards (69) before David Luiz headed in from a corner late in the game (86). The win moves Chelsea back into the top four in the Premier League, with Arsenal and Manchester United playing on Sky Sports on Sunday, while Huddersfield stay 13 points adrift of safety at the bottom of the table. Eden Hazard celebrates scoring his second and Chelsea's third goal Chelsea and Maurizio Sarri had faced some tough questions after their worst Premier League defeat in 23 years in midweek, but they made an encouraging start against Huddersfield as Ross Barkley flashed a shot wide and Hazard forced Jonas Lossl into a diving save. Huddersfield had the best chance of the opening 15 minutes, though, as Mooy headed over the bar from Chris Lowe's cross. Higuain's deflected shot made it 4-0 to Chelsea Chelsea took the lead in the 16th minute when N'Golo Kante slipped a well-disguised pass into the box for Higuain, who fired past Lossl at the near post. Higuain then went close to a second as he poked wide from Marcos Alonso's cross. Huddersfield threatened on the break when Philip Billing saw a shot blocked, but Chelsea added to their lead late in the half as Hazard converted from the penalty spot after Cesar Azpilicueta had been fouled right on the edge of the box. Higuain celebrates his second goal with Ross Barkley The visitors were denied a penalty of their own early in the second half when Elias Kachunga went down in the box under a challenge from Andreas Christensen. Two goals in three minutes then put Chelsea in firm control, with Hazard finishing after rounding Lossl and Higuain curling in a shot from 20 yards with the aid of a deflection. Luiz headed in from a corner in the 86th minute to round off the win. Team news Chelsea made four changes from their defeat at Bournemouth as Christensen, Alonso, Barkley and Willian replaced Rudiger, Emerson, Kovacic and Pedro. Huddersfield made five changes as Smith, Lowe, Billing, Mooy and Mbenza came in for Hadergjonaj, Jorgensen, Hogg, Puncheon and Mounie. New signing Karlan Grant started on the bench. Opta stats Chelsea have only lost one of their last 16 home Premier League games (W9 D6). Huddersfield have failed to score in a league-high 13 different Premier League games this season. Chelsea scored five goals in a Premier League game for the first time since December 2017, when they beat Stoke 5-0 at Stamford Bridge. After winning their first ever Premier League game in London (3-0 vs Crystal Palace), Huddersfield have won none of their last seven trips to the capital in the competition (D1 L6), netting just one goal in that time. Chelsea striker Gonzalo Higuain has scored 38 goals in 37 league appearances under manager Maurizio Sarri. Eden Hazard registered his 200th and 201st goal involvements in his top-flight league career (117 goals, 84 assists), with 130 of those coming at Chelsea. Gonzalo Higuain became the first Chelsea player to score twice on their home league debut for the club since Mario Stanic vs West Ham in August 2000. Chelsea's N'Golo Kante provided two assists in a single league match for the first time in his top-flight career. Man of the match - Eden Hazard After reportedly being singled out for criticism by Sarri after Chelsea's defeat to Bournemouth, Hazard responded with a fabulous individual display. He was always a threat on the ball, even managing to stay on his feet after two players tried to bring him down in the second half. Sarri has said that Hazard can sometimes be \"an individual player more than a leader\", but this was him leading by example. What would VAR have changed? This would have been a busy game for the Video Assistant Referee. There was a penalty decision at the end of the first half that went Chelsea’s way when Azpilicueta appeared to be fouled right on the edge of the box. Chelsea were then denied a second penalty after Hazard went down in the area. Huddersfield might have had a penalty in the second half when Christensen clipped Kachunga’s ankles. All the decisions appeared to be close calls, so VAR might not have satisfied everyone anyway. The managers Maurizio Sarri: \"We need consistency, so we have to continue. I am very happy with the match and I hope in the future we will not need a lost match to play with the right mentality.\" 2:33 Maurizio Sarri says he was pleased by the partnership between Eden Hazard and Gonzalo Higuain Maurizio Sarri says he was pleased by the partnership between Eden Hazard and Gonzalo Higuain Jan Siewert: \"I don't feel good because we lost 5-0 and we can't compete with Chelsea. We can't compare our clubs at the moment. We tried everything to beat them but they showed they are also very hungry because of their defeat against Bournemouth.\" 2:49 Huddersfield manager Jan Siewert gives his reaction to the defeat to Chelsea Huddersfield manager Jan Siewert gives his reaction to the defeat to Chelsea What's next?

Crystal Palace eased their relegation worries at the expense of Fulham with a comfortable 2-0 victory at Selhurst Park on Saturday. Luka Milivojevic opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 25th minute after Cyrus Christie handled in the area under pressure from Christian Benteke. Fulham failed to test the hosts throughout and their misery was complete when Jeffrey Schlupp doubled Palace's lead in the 87th minute, after Michy Batshuayi's effort was parried into his path. The result means Fulham are now seven points from safety, while the win sees Palace pull seven points clear from the relegation zone. Team News Christian Benteke replaced the suspended Wilfried Zaha for Palace while new signing Michy Batshuayi started on the bench. Meanwhile, Andre Schurrle missed out with a knock for Fulham and new signing Lazar Markovic was not match fit. Fulham came into the encounter hoping to build on their impressive 4-2 midweek victory at home to Brighton, but they were disappointing throughout and, other than Aleksandar Mitrovic's header in the 10th minute, failed to fashion a single effort on target - despite having 63 per cent possession. Palace's opening goal was of Fulham's own undoing as Christie led with his arm as he challenged Benteke in the box for a header; Milivojevic duly stepped up to convert his 13th Premier League penalty since the start of last season. Christian Benteke goes up for a header against Calum Chambers Benteke could then have doubled Palace's lead before the interval as his acrobatic bicycle-kick came off the post after an inviting cross from Andros Townsend. The second half saw Fulham continue to toil in the final third, with Mitrovic cutting a lonely figure and his frustration was clearly evident when he fired well wide in the 76th minute. Palace substitute Batshuayi played a part in Palace's second, as his parried effort fell into the path of Schlupp who converted.

"report": "2:56 Highlights from Wolves' 3-1 win at Everton in the Premier League Highlights from Wolves' 3-1 win at Everton in the Premier League Wolves maintained their recent good form by beating a lacklustre Everton 3-1 at Goodison Park on Saturday. The visitors made it three Premier League wins in a row thanks to first-half strikes from Ruben Neves (7) - via the penalty spot - and Raul Jimenez (45), separated by Andre Gomes' (27) first-ever goal for Everton. However, Leander Dendoncker restored Wolves' two-goal advantage with his first goal for the club midway through the second half as Nuno Espirito Santo's side stayed seventh after an eighth win in their last 12 matches. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Baines (5), Keane (5), Zouma (6), Coleman (6), Gomes (6), Sigurdsson (6), Davies (5), Walcott (5), Richarlison (5), Tosun (5) Subs: Calvert-Lewin (6), Lookman (6), Kenny (6) Wolves: Patricio (6), Doherty (7), Bennett (6), Boly (7), Coady (7), Jonny (7), Neves (7), Moutinho (7), Dendoncker (7), Jimenez (8), Jota (9) Subs: Saiss (6), Traore (6), Costa (6) Man of the match: Diogo Jota Everton, though, drop to ninth after a fourth league defeat at home this season as the pressure mounts on boss Marco Silva. There was a nervousness among the home faithful in the early stages after Everton's recent struggles in front of their own fans - the Toffees had won just one of their previous five league games. Andre Gomes celebrates scoring Everton's equaliser All of which was not helped by Leighton Baines' early concession of a penalty after a clear foul on Matt Doherty, with Neves calmly stroking home the resulting spot kick, just the second time the Portuguese has scored for Wolves from inside the box. Twenty minutes later and totally out of the blue, Everton drew level thanks to a goal to remember from Gomes, who collected Cenk Tosun's pass, before striding forward and hammering an unstoppable drive into the roof of the net. 1:55 Check out the moment a black cat invaded the Goodison Park pitch, causing a lengthy delay to the match between Everton and Wolves! Check out the moment a black cat invaded the Goodison Park pitch, causing a lengthy delay to the match between Everton and Wolves! The home team, who lost captain Baines to injury before the break, would have got through to half-time on level terms, but for a needless foul by Michael Keane on Diogo Jota. That allowed Joao Moutinho the opportunity to curl an inviting ball into the area, from which the unmarked Jimenez placed a header past a helpless Pickford for his 11th goal of the season. If Goodison was muted at the start of the second period, then it was silent when Wolves all but confirmed their win after 66 minutes as the home team were again made to pay for giving away possession near halfway. Team news Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye (groin) and defender Yerry Mina (foot) were injured, while Leighton Baines replaced the suspended Lucas Digne at left back and Theo Walcott came in for the benched Bernard. Meanwhile, Wolves made one change from their 3-0 home win over West Ham in midweek, with centre-back Willy Boly back from a three-match ban in place of Romain Saiss, who dropped to the bench. Within the blink of an eye, the outstanding Jota was bearing down on goal and despite the forward's effort being blocked, the rebound fell straight to Dendoncker, who thumped home a volley as the visitors confirmed a first win at Goodison in 40 years. Everton's miserable afternoon was then summed up by a stray black cat who held up play for a full five minutes as ground staff tried, and failed, to catch and remove it from the field of play. ⚽️ Andre Gomes scores his 1st goal in 64 apps for club and country, since scoring twice for Barcelona in a 7-1 La Liga win v Osasuna in April 2017 pic.twitter.com/n1hdJ3xpXQ — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) February 2, 2019 Opta stats Wolves have won 11 Premier League games this season - their joint-highest tally in a single Premier League campaign, alongside the 2010-11 season Wolves have scored 3+ goals in three consecutive top-flight matches for the first time since March 1980 Everton have lost three of their last four Premier League games at Goodison Park, as many as they'd lost in their previous 23 Everton have won just one of their nine Premier League games this season against teams starting the day higher than them in the table (W1 D2 L6), losing the last five in a row Raul Jiminez has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other Wolves player this season (9 goals, 5 assists) Wolves' Joao Moutinho has provided an assist in three consecutive games in the top five European leagues for the first time in his career (5 assists in his last 3 apps) Managers Marco Silva: \"I understand why they are like they are, of course they expect a good afternoon again after our last good win at Goodison, they expect to come here and we win again and achieve the position we want in the table. \"It was an important game for us, and of course when they saw our performance, they were not happy.

The diminutive forward ran the Everton back line ragged all match long and while he did not get his name on the scoresheet, he still played a key role in two of his side's goals. It was the 22-year-old's direct run into box that led to the visitors' early penalty, while it was from his powerful shot that Wolves added a third midway through the second period. Pundit - Charlie Nicholas \"There is no balance. Defensively they occasionally play well, but where are the days where we have full backs overlapping with energy and good crossing of the ball from Everton? \"But when you do not have the ball, you have to have that balance right. They do not protect the two centre backs or full backs and if you do nit get the balance of the team right, then it becomes easy to break down and predictable. \"And it is going nowhere fast at Everton.\" 2:50 Charlie Nicholas believes Everton boss Marco Silva is under real pressure after the Toffees lost 3-1 at home to Wolves Charlie Nicholas believes Everton boss Marco Silva is under real pressure after the Toffees lost 3-1 at home to Wolves What's next?

the Premier League An early goal in each half from Bobby Reid gave Cardiff a 2-0 win against Bournemouth on Saturday, boosting their chances of avoiding relegation. There were emotional tributes to missing striker Emiliano Sala before kick-off, in what was Cardiff's first home game since a plane carrying the Argentine and pilot David Ibbotson went missing on January 21, with players and fans from both sides wearing daffodils among other commemorations. On the field, Cardiff were awarded a penalty inside four minutes after a handball from Steve Cook, which Reid converted on what was also his 26th birthday. He added a second 15 seconds after the restart, slotting home into an empty net. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (7), Peltier (7), Manga (7), Bamba (7), Bennett (7), Murphy (7), Paterson (7), Gunnarsson (7), Reid (8), Ralls (7), Niasse (7). Subs used: Hoilett (5), Zohore (n/a), Bacuna (n/a). Bournemouth: Boruc (6), Cook (5), Clyne (6), Ake (6), Smith (6), Stanislas (6), Gosling (6), Surman (6), King (6), Fraser (6), Solanke (6). Subs used: Ibe (5), Mousset (4), Lerma (4). Man of the match: Bobby Reid. It is a vital three points for the hosts, who are now just two points from Premier League safety, while Bournemouth have now lost each of their last seven away league games, conceding at least twice in each. After a moment of silence before the game got under way, Cardiff were awarded a penalty with just four minutes on the clock after Josh Murphy's cross hit the raised arm of Cook. Reid coolly dispatched the spot-kick and celebrated by holding up a shirt with a picture of Sala on it. Team news Cardiff made one change from the midweek Premier League fixture with Harry Arter (ineligable) replaced by Josh Murphy. Dominic Solanke made his Bournemouth debut, replacing David Brookes in one change. Nine minutes later, and Cardiff could have doubled their tally. Callum Paterson slid a lovely ball down the right for Oumar Niasse, who then fired a cross into the area for the waiting Murphy. However, it did not quite have the reach as Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc raced out to smother the pass. Bournemouth's best chance of the half came just before the half-an-hour mark. Andrew Surman set up the ball from a Junior Stanislas pass before hitting a thunderous strike from just outside the area. However, Neil Etheridge made a wonderful, leaping save to push the ball onto the crossbar and send Cardiff into the break in front. Neil Warnock and Cardiff City backroom staff observe a minute's silence in honour of Emiliano Sala Fifteen seconds into the second half, and the hosts doubled their lead. After a few passes from the Cardiff kick-off, Aron Gunnarsson slipped a ball through for Reid, who shook off a challenge from Cook, rounded the oncoming Boruc at the top corner before rolling the ball into an empty net for his second of the evening. Neither side particularly threatened for the remainder of the half, although Bournemouth had another good chance to score in the 79th minute. Jordon Ibe swung in a free-kick, which met the head of Nathan Ake at the back post, but he put the effort just wide as Bournemouth's poor away run continued. Bobby Reid gives Cardiff an early lead from the penalty spot Opta stats Cardiff picked up their first Premier League victory in five games (D1 L3), with this their first win by more than one goal since October (4-2 vs Fulham). Cardiff have kept back-to-back home clean sheets in the Premier League for the first time. Scored just 15 seconds into the second half, Bobby Reid's second goal for Cardiff was the fastest scored after half-time in the Premier League since Marko Arnautovic for West Ham vs Huddersfield in January 2018 (11 seconds). Cardiff's Bobby Reid became the third player to score a Premier League goal on his birthday this season, after Ricardo Pereira (Leicester v Everton) and Anthony Martial (Man Utd v Arsenal). The managers Neil Warnock: \"I thought the whole club was amazing... I think I was the proudest man to be the manager of the whole club today because the fans were just amazing. \"I felt immensely proud and I had pride in everybody. It was as if we had to show everybody our support for him. Coming back to the main stand to see my wife and kids up there, it just hit home that we had done him proud today.\" Eddie Howe: \"We've been searching for consistency all season and we've never felt like we have fully broken that. We feel like we've really disappointed today. There is a lot of time to reflect now and focus on Liverpool, but we have to sort out our inconsistencies. That is going to be our biggest challenge.\" Man of the match - Bobby Reid Reid had a birthday to remember as he scored twice - his first goals since the middle of December - and took both with confidence that oozed through Cardiff on Saturday. He took his penalty well before capitalising on some ragged Bournemouth defending to cap off a great performance. Credit must also go to Oumar Niasse who ran himself all over and is really starting to find his feet at Cardiff, as well as Callum Paterson and Josh Murphy. What's next? Cardiff are next in action on Saturday when they travel to Southampton in the Premier League.

Subs: Loftus-Cheek (5), Giroud (5), Willian (6) Man of the match: Joshua King In the 300th game of his second spell in charge of the Cherries, Howe was forced to do without midfielder Jefferson Lerma and talisman Callum Wilson - ruled out for three weeks following a minor knee operation - and Chelsea were the dominant side in the opening exchanges. Mateo Kovacic forced Artur Boruc into a brilliant save as the Croatian met Pedro's cross but saw his header tipped onto the crossbar before the veteran Boruc was alert again to smother Eden Hazard's right-foot shot from the edge of the penalty area. Team news There was no Wilson for Bournemouth, who failed to shake off a knee injury in time, meaning King was the lone striker this evening. Stanislas started while Surman came in for Lerma. Solanke and Mepham made the substitutes' bench. Hudson-Odoi was absent from the Chelsea squad as Higuain made his Premier League debut for Chelsea while Emerson replaced Alonso at left-back and Pedro replaced Willian. It took until the 35th minute for Bournemouth to test Kepa Arrizabalaga as King directed his header from Steve Cook's pull-back into the path of Brooks, but the Welshman's effort from close range was straight at the Chelsea keeper. Cesar Azpilicueta forced Boruc into another fine save to his right before the interval, but it was only after half-time that the game really came alive. Chelsea were still easing their way into the half when the lively Brooks showed great composure to set up King for a fierce shot into the roof of the net and the pair combined once more for Bournemouth's second as David Luiz sold himself far too easily to allow Brooks to flash the ball past Kepa at his near post. Bournemouth's Steve Cook and Chelsea's Gonzalo Higuain battle for the ball Things got worse for the visitors when Stanislas unselfishly slid the ball across for King to lift his shot over Kepa for his second, as Chelsea supporters headed for the exits. The closest Sarri's side came to reducing the deficit fell to Azpilicueta as Boruc saved the Spaniard's header from close range with his feet - and Chelsea have now failed to score in three successive away league games for the first time since under Claudio Ranieri back in 2002. Bournemouth made it back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since the end of October in style as Jordon Ibe's free-kick was flicked into the net by Daniels to complete a miserable night for Chelsea. The managers Eddie Howe: \"We hoped to give the best account of ourselves possible, and one aspect of our play was very good. Our counter-attacking was superb tonight in both the first half and second half - the first half without any reward, the second half we got the goals. \"It was a brilliant defensive display. So many players throughout the team really excelled in that discipline, so it's been a good night. 3:06 Eddie Howe says Bournemouth’s counter-attacking was superb and also hailed the team’s defensive display during their 4-0 win against Chelsea in the Premier League. Eddie Howe says Bournemouth’s counter-attacking was superb and also hailed the team’s defensive display during their 4-0 win against Chelsea in the Premier League. Maurizio Sarri: \"I am not able to explain because we played very well in the first half. We conceded the goal very early in the second half but we had 43 minutes so all we needed to do was to continue to play. \"Maybe it's my fault because maybe I'm not able to motivate this group and these players. I don't know why. But I need to understand and we need to understand very soon because we have to play in three days.\" 2:07 Maurizio Sarri says he cannot understand how Chelsea suffered a 4-0 defeat to Bournemouth but he must work out why very soon.

Man of the match - Joshua King In Wilson's absence, there was pressure on King to fill the England striker's boots, but after a quiet opening 45 minutes, he came to the fore and flourished as Chelsea chased the game in the second period. 38 - Josh King has drawn level with John Carew and Tore Andre Flo as the joint-third highest Norwegian goalscorer in the Premier League, with only Steffen Iversen (40) and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (91) netting more.

Chelsea played a high line and played into Bournemouth's hands and King has now scored three goals in his two games against the Blues at the Vitality Stadium. Opta stats Bournemouth secured only their second ever competitive home win against Chelsea and first since September 1988 (L5). This is just the second time in Premier League history that Chelsea have lost a game by a four-goal margin, after losing 1-5 versus Liverpool in September 1996. Chelsea have lost consecutive Premier League games for the first time since March 2018, when they lost to both Manchester clubs. Both of Bournemouth's Premier League wins on a Wednesday have come against Chelsea. Chelsea have won 47 points after 24 games this season - three fewer than at this stage in 2017-18 (50). Bournemouth's David Brooks both scored and assisted in an English league game for the first time in his career. King has been directly involved in 48 Premier League goals for Bournemouth (38 goals, 10 assists), 12 more than any other Cherries player in the competition. What's next? Bournemouth travel to face Cardiff City on Saturday evening (kick-off 5.30pm) while Chelsea host Huddersfield earlier on the same day (3pm)."},{"date": "30/01/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 28339, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Bednarek", "yellows": ["59"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Stephens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jannik Vestergaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["75"]}, {"name": "Yan Valery", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["62"]}, {"name": "Pierre-Emile Højbjerg", "yellows": ["37"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["84"]}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elyounoussi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["75"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Gallagher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stuart Armstrong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["62"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angus Gunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Slattery", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["84"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kayne Ramsay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Vicente Guaita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Wan-Bissaka", "yellows": ["47"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["90+1"]}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["71"]}, {"name": "Luka Milivojevic", "yellows": ["35"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": ["87"], "reds": ["87"], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["90+1"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Max Meyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["71"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:52 Highlights from Southampton's win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League. Highlights from Southampton's win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League. Wilfried Zaha went from hero to zero as Southampton grabbed a late equaliser to draw 1-1 with 10-man Crystal Palace at St Mary's. The Ivorian's first goal for over four months looked set to send the Eagles six points clear of the Premier League drop zone at the expense of their relegation rivals. But James Ward-Prowse arrived on cue to level with 13 minutes left, netting his third goal in as many games, before Zaha was sent off for dissent in the closing stages. The result lifts both sides one place higher in the table, leaving Palace 15th and Saints 16th, four points above the relegation zone. Zaha had earlier hammered in what looked to be the winner Despite bidding to avoid a third straight league defeat, the Eagles carried decent momentum into the game after dumping Tottenham out of the FA Cup. Southampton were looking to win three on the trot for the first time in over three years after picking up more points in eight games under Ralph Hasenhuttl than from the 15 prior to his arrival. Team news No changes for Southampton. They kept the same 11 that started the 2-1 win over Everton.There were seven alterations for Palace from the win over Spurs. Van Aanholt, Kouyate, Townsend and Zaha were the only players retained from the 2-0 fourth round win. But it was the visitors who started the better, although wayward efforts from Luka Milivojevic and James McArthur failed to cement their dominance. The hosts looked nervy from the outset and should have been reduced to 10 men when Jack Stephens left a high boot in on Andros Townsend after miscontrolling the ball inside his own half. Four minutes from the break Palace finally hit the front as referee Andre Marriner played advantage following a clear foul on Townsend, allowing Zaha to cut onto his right foot and batter the ball past Alex McCarthy from 12 yards. Palace came within inches of doubling their lead after the interval when McCarthy flapped at a corner and Bakary Sako's stab towards goal was cleared off the line by Jan Bednarek. Zaha applauded referee Marriner after his first booking - leading to the second caution They were made to pay with 13 minutes remaining as Saints cut them open down the left and Matt Targett found England international Ward-Prowse, who kept his cool to beat Vicente Guaita. Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy 4; Valery 6, Vestergaard 6, Stephens 4, Bednarek 6, Targett 7; Hojbjerg 6, Romeu 5, Ward-Prowse 7; Redmond 5; Ings 6 Subs: Elyounoussi 6, Armstrong 7, Slattery 6 Crystal Palace: Guaita 6; Wan-Bissaka 6, Tomkins 7, Sako 6, Van Aanholt 5; Milivojevic 6, Kouyate 6, McArthur 5; Townsend 6, Ayew 4, Zaha 5 Subs: Dann N/A, Schlupp 6 Man of the match: Matt Targett Sako could have won it but somehow missed the target from point-blank range, heading off from six yards when it looked easier to score. In the closing minutes came the game's major flashpoint, as Zaha was booked twice in a matter of seconds, having been aggrieved at Marriner for not being awarded a foul after a tackle by Ward-Prowse. It compounded an evening of disappointment for Roy Hodgson who, after watching his side dominate for long periods, will now be without his star man against Burnley. What would VAR have changed? Jack Stephens should have seen red in the first half for a high lunge on Andros Townsend - an incident that went unpunished by referee Andre Marriner. Marriner showed a yellow card for the incident but Zaha sarcastically clapped the decision leading to his dismissal - and continued to show his disapproval as he trudged towards the touchline. Man of the match - Matt Targett That most of Palace's attacks came from the right rather than Targett's left tells you all you need to know about his display. The 23-year-old was dependable at the back and laid on the defence-splitting pass for Ward-Prowse to equalise when all hope appeared to be lost. What the managers said Ralph Hassenhuttl \"It was an important point for us. In the first half it was very difficult. That is what I was told before the game, against this team you don't get many chances. \"After 10 days without a game you could feel that we were not in the rhythm of what we normally are but against this team it is difficult, that was clear for me.\" Roy Hodgson \"We had the chances to win the game. We controlled the game for large periods and I am disappointed that we conceded a late equaliser. \"It is a bad day for us because we lose one of our most important players to a sending off. We dropped two points which I think we should really have had.\" Opta Stats No Premier League side has drawn more games this season than Southampton (8). Crystal Palace have dropped 13 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season - only Fulham and Southampton (15 each) have lost more. Wilfried Zaha became only the second Crystal Palace player to score and be sent off in the same Premier League match, after Glenn Murray vs West Ham in February 2015. Southampton's James Ward-Prowse has scored three goals in 12 Premier League appearances this season, as many as he netted in 30 in the competition last term. What's next? Saints travel to Burnley this Saturday, while Palace have a London derby at home to Fulham."},{"date": "30/01/2019", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53092, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool",

Highlights from Liverpool's draw against Leicester in the Premier League Liverpool missed the chance to move seven points clear at the top of the Premier League as Leicester held them to a 1-1 draw on a nervy night at Anfield. Sadio Mane got Liverpool off to the perfect start with the opener inside three minutes, but Leicester hit back in first-half stoppage-time through Harry Maguire. That goal changed the complexion of the game at an expectant Anfield, and anxiety set in as Leicester became the first club outside the top six to take points off the leaders this season. Leicester stay 12th as a result while the draw extends Liverpool's lead at the top five points, but it could have been much more for Jurgen Klopp's title chasers. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (5), Matip (6), Van Dijk (6), Robertson (6), Wijnaldum (6), Keita (6), Henderson (6), Shaqiri (5), Firmino (6), Mane (7), Salah (6).

Subs: Choudhury (5), Okazaki (n/a), Iheanacho (n/a). Man of the Match: Harry Maguire. Manchester City's defeat at Newcastle on Tuesday presented Liverpool with a glorious chance to move closer to a first top-flight in 29 years, and they looked set to capitalise when Mane rounded off a 30-pass move with just two minutes and two seconds on the clock. But Liverpool were prevented from settling into their relentless rhythm by the remnants of a pre-match snow flurry, with Leicester able to contain the Reds while the ball sluggishly rolled around the Anfield turf. Sadio Mane makes it 1-0 inside three minutes at Anfield Leicester steadily grew into the game and should have equalised on 25 minutes, but James Maddison somehow missed the target with a close-range header, after the Foxes had pounced on a charged down Alisson clearance. Maguire saw yellow and not red on 41 minutes, despite deliberately bringing Mane to ground as race in behind the advanced Leicester defence, with referee Martin Atkinson ruling the incident, which occurred just inside the Leicester half, not to be clear goalscoring opportunity. Team news Jurgen Klopp made two changes as Georginio Wijnaldum and Xherdan Shaqiri returned. Virgil van Dijk recovered from illness to start. Claude Puel went one better, as Jonny Evans, Marc Albrighton and James Maddison were recalled into the Leicester line-up. And Maguire took full advantage of his reprieve, ghosting in at the back post the sweep Ben Chilwell's header into the back of the net, as the Liverpool defence played for offside. Chilwell's great reverse pass presented Maddison with an early sight of the Liverpool goal after the interval, and the Reds' goal continued to live an enchanted life as Maguire's knockdown, from an offside position, near fell for Jonny Evans, but a combination of Roberto Firmino and Alisson thwarted Leicester. Harry Maguire is mobbed by team-mates after equalising at Anfield Referee Atkinson was centre stage on 57 minutes as he failed to penalise Ricardo Pereira's challenge on Naby Keita in the area, despite the Leicester full-back treading on Keita's foot before he shanked a shot wide. As Liverpool appealed for penalty, Leicester, who were now a threat on the counter, broke at pace, but Demarai Gray fired a tame shot at Alisson instead of squaring for Maddison. Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw by Leicester on Wednesday Liverpool's push for a winner came up short as Kasper Schmeichel got down low to save from Firmino before Mane fired a near-post header over the bar, leaving Anfield with a sense of what could have been at full-time. Opta stats Liverpool failed to win at Anfield for just the second time in the Premier League this season (W9 D2), having also drawn against Manchester City in October 2018. Leicester are the first non-'top six' side that Liverpool have failed to beat in the Premier League this season - the other four opponents they haven't won against are Manchester City (x2), Chelsea and Arsenal. Leicester have avoided defeat in each of their last two Premier League away games at 'top six' sides (1-0 v Chelsea and 1-1 v Liverpool), as many as they had in their previous 14 such games combined (D2 L12). Liverpool attempted just 10 shots in this game against Leicester - the only occasions when they've had fewer in the Premier League this season were both against Manchester City (seven, both home and away). Sadio Mane's opener for Liverpool (2:01) was their quickest goal in the Premier League since April 2016, when Daniel Sturridge netted against Newcastle (1:07). Each of Harry Maguire's three league goals for Leicester this season have come away from home - only Wilfried Zaha (4) has netted more among players to have scored 100% of their goals in away games.

I have the feeling of regret a little because we had fantastic chances at the beginning of the second half. We conceded another goal after two minutes but after we showed fantastic character and personality.\" Man of the Match - Harry Maguire Liverpool looked set to blow Leicester away after Mane's early strike, but Maguire orchestrated a defensive display that frustrated at the Reds. Every time Liverpool tried to play through the heart of Leicester, Maguire was in the right place to intervene.

Highlights from Tottenham's win over Watford in the Premier League. Late goals from Heung-Min Son and Fernando Llorente rescued a tough week for Tottenham with a 2-1 comeback win over Watford. Watford took advantage of a Spurs side looking jaded after exiting both domestic cup competitions in the space of four days when Craig Cathcart bundled home from a corner (37). But the introduction of Lucas Moura at half-time proved the catalyst for a much-improved home performance and Llorente missed an open goal from four yards amid increasing pressure from the hosts. He redeemed himself though, providing a smart assist for Son to smash home 10 minutes from time before arcing a header into the far corner from Rose's cross (87) for a dramatic winner, which moves Tottenham to within two points of second-placed Manchester City. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (6), Aurier (5), Alderweireld (7), Sanchez (7), Vertonghen (7), Rose (8), Winks (7), Sissoko (6), Eriksen (5), Son (8), Llorente (7). Subs: Moura (7), Trippier (6), Lamela (6). Watford: Foster (7), Janmaat (6), Mariappa (7), Cathcart (7), Holebas (7), Hughes (6), Cleverley (6), Capoue (7), Pereyra (6), Deeney (6), Deulofeu (5). Subs: Success (5), Wilmot (7). Man of the match: Danny Rose Tottenham were still far from their fluid best despite the return of Son and a refreshed Eriksen, but on the odd occasion they upped the tempo they looked capable of hurting Watford. Son's rapid turn and shot from the right almost caught out Ben Foster, who was left rooted to the spot but grateful to see the South Korean's effort flash wide of his right-hand post. But it was Watford who took the initiative and held a half-time lead courtesy of Cathcart, who returned to haunt Tottenham after scoring the winner against them in September, rising to nod Jose Holebas' corner goalwards and, thanks to a sizeable deflection off Davinson Sanchez, finding the back of the net. Cathcart scored against Tottenham for the second time this season Moura's introduction, and whatever Mauricio Pochettino said at the break, made an instant impact on Spurs' second-half performance and they should have levelled when Llorente met Moussa Sissoko's cross from the right, forcing a stunning reaction save from Foster, but with the goal gaping from the rebound, the ball cannoned over the bar off his knee. Spurs' pressure finally told 10 minutes from time when Llorente brought down a ball down the right and fed it into Son's path. The returning South Korean showed Spurs what they had missed in his absence at the Asian Cup by taking a touch and firing in a powerful equaliser. Team news Tottenham welcomed back Heung-Min Son at the first opportunity to partner Fernando Llorente. Eric Dier and Kieran Trippier dropped to the bench for Erik Lamela and Davinson Sanchez. Will Hughes and Craig Cathcart returned from injury for Watford with Daryl Janmaat back for Kiko Femenia. And Llorente completed the late turnaround Spurs' second-half performance merited with some old-fashioned number nine play, lifting a header from Rose's excellent delivery back across Foster and just inside the far post. Thanks to Liverpool's draw with Leicester victory enhances Tottenham's slim title hopes, lifting them seven points off the top, and more pressingly as many ahead of Chelsea after their thrashing at Bournemouth. Opta facts Tottenham (54 points) have at least four more points after 24 Premier League games than they have ever had at this stage of the competition, last recording as many at this stage in the top-flight during their title winning season back in 1960-61 (65 points - 3/pts for a win). Only against Arsenal (9) and Manchester United (10) have Watford lost more Premier League games against than they have against Spurs (8). Watford have now lost four straight matches at Wembley Stadium, only Brentford (5), Shrewsbury Town (5) and Newcastle United (7) are on longer current such losing runs than the Hornets. Tottenham have now matched Bolton's Premier League record of the most consecutive matches without a draw in the competition (28 - W21 L7). Spurs have scored 13 headed goals in the Premier League in 2018-19, their most in a single top-flight season since 1999/00, when they netted 16 under manager George Graham. Watford's Craig Cathcart is the first defender to score both home and away against Tottenham within the same Premier League season since Per Mertesacker did so for Arsenal back in 2012-13. Tottenham forward Son Heung-Min has had a direct hand in six goals against Watford in the Premier League (five goals, one assist), against no other side has he been involved in more (also six v Southampton). Javier Gracia (38) has now managed the joint-most matches in the Premier League for Watford, winning more games than any of the other four managers to take charge of as many (13), as well as boasting the highest points per game ratio of any previous Watford manager in the competition (1.26). Man of the match - Danny Rose Rose was excellent down the Tottenham left despite Watford's Will Hughes following him around like a shadow for much of the evening. He evaded the midfielfder's clutches late on just long enough to deliver a pinpoint cross for Llorente to head home to cap a fine performance in which he made as many key passes (3) as anyone on either side and provided easily the best quality from wide across the pitch. What's next? Tottenham are on the box on Saturday against Newcastle at Wembley, and are live on Sky Sports from 11.30am. Watford have a feisty-looking encounter with former manager Marco Silva against Everton at Vicarage Road at 3pm on Saturday."},{"date": "29/01/2019", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59933,

Highlights: Arsenal 2-1 Cardiff Cardiff succumbed to a 2-1 defeat at Arsenal in their first game since the tragic disappearance of Emiliano Sala. Second-half goals from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette overcame a valiant display from Neil Warnock's side on a sombre night at Emirates Stadium. Tributes were paid to Cardiff's club-record signing ahead of kick-off, and the Bluebirds fittingly had the final word as substitute Nathaniel Mendez-Laing struck a consolation goal, even though this was a night when much more mattered. The defeat leaves Cardiff three points from safety in the relegation zone, while Arsenal stay fifth in the Premier League but move level on points with fourth-place Chelsea, who play Bournemouth on Wednesday. Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (6), Lichtsteiner (6), Mustafi (7), Monreal (6), Kolasinac (7), Elneny (6), Guendouzi (6), Torreira (6), Ozil (7), Lacazette (7), Aubameyang (7).

Subs: Mendez-Laing (7), Harris (6), Zohore (6). Man of the Match: Bobby Reid. Daffodils and tulips were laid ahead of kick-off by both captains, but at the request of Sala's family, black armbands were not worn, with the search for Sala and pliot Dave Ibbotson still ongoing. Given the testing circumstances, a tough away assignment looked to be following the script when Sead Kolasinac's low cross presented Alexandre Lacazette with an early chance, but Bruno Manga's decisive block laid the foundation for a spirited first-half display from Cardiff. Fans pay tribute to missing striker Emiliano Sala prior to the Premier League match between Arsenal and Cardiff City The visitors could have been two up inside their opening quarter of an hour, but Bobby Reid flashed a shot wide on 12 minutes before the unmarked striker headed a Callum Paterson cross over from close range. Both sides then exchanged penalty appeals as Kolasinac and Nacho Monreal's challenge on Oumar Niasse went unpunished before referee Mike Dean waved Lacazette's claims away after a coming together with Manga. Team news Mesut Ozil captained Arsenal on his first start since Boxing Day, with Unai Emery making seven changes following Friday’s FA Cup exit. Sead Kolasinac, Lucas Torreira, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette were the only players to retain their places. Neil Warnock made three changes from Cardiff’s defeat at Newcastle, as Bobby Reid, Aron Gunnarsson and Harry Arter returned. Unai Emery brought on Alex Iwobi at half-time in a bid to inject some pace into his static attacking line, but Cardiff continued to have the better opportunities in front of goal, a last-gasp Shkodran Mustafi block preventing Niasse from finding the target shortly after the hour. That was, however, until Iwobi's incisive through pass released Kolasinac in the area and he was upended by Manga. Aubameyang sent Neil Etheridge the wrong way to put Arsenal into the lead on 66 minutes, though they scarcely deserved it. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates after scoring from the penalty spot Iwobi had the chance to add a quickfire second when Ozil's deft flick played him through on goal, but he was denied by the outstretched arm of Etheridge. But Lacazette put the game to bed with a solo goal seven minutes from time, spinning away from Sol Bamba on the touchline before driving a shot through Etheridge's defences. Alexandre Lacazette doubled Arsenal's lead Mendez-Laing then rewarded Cardiff for their battling display, rifling a low shot into the far corner, but that, and the defeat, paled into insignificance after the events of last week. Opta stats Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League home games, since losing their first game of the season against Manchester City (0-2) in August (W10 D2). Cardiff City remain the only side in English league football yet to lead at half-time in a game in any competition this season (26 games). Arsenal midfielder Mesut Özil created his 500th goalscoring chance for a teammate in the Premier League (501 in total). Since his debut in the competition back in September 2013, only Christian Eriksen (510) has created more. Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette have each scored five Premier League goals against promoted sides this season, more than any other player. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hit his 25th goal in his 37th Premier League appearance for Arsenal, the quickest of any player to reach that total for the Gunners in the competition. The managers 2:48 Arsenal manager Unai Emery says his side deserved to win after their second-half performance but praised Cardiff's determination Arsenal manager Unai Emery says his side deserved to win after their second-half performance but praised Cardiff's determination Unai Emery: \"We are happy. The difference in the match was small details. In the second half we created moments with the ball and had chances. We played better in the second half, controlled the match and create more chances to score. Overall I think we deserved the result in the second half. We worked how we want.\" 2:33 Neil Warnock says he was really disappointed after Cardiff produced the 'best performance he's seen since he's been at the club' Neil Warnock says he was really disappointed after Cardiff produced the 'best performance he's seen since he's been at the club' Neil Warnock: \"This was probably the best away performance since I've been at the club, not just because of the circumstances but the opposition as well.

We can't do anymore than what the players did tonight other than score goals.\" Man of the Match - Bobby Reid Bobby Reid wasn't brilliant - if he was, Cardiff may have won the game - but he set the tone in a game which could have quite easily passed Cardiff by.

Player ratings Fulham: Rico (7), Le Marchand (7), Christie (7), Ream (5), Odoi (7), Bryan (7), Seri (8), Chambers (7), Schurrle (6), Mitrovic (9), Babel (8) Subs: R Seesegnon (6), Cairney (8), Vietto (8) Brighton: Ryan (7), Montoya (6), Duffy (6), Dunk (6), Bong (6), Stephens (6), Propper (6), March (5), Locadia (5), Murray (7), Gross (6) Subs: Subs: Andone (5), Knockhaert (5) Man of the match: Aleksandar Mitrovic The lead was doubled when Fulham cleared a cross only as far as Pascal Gross who produced an overhead kick straight into the path of Murray, allowing the striker to jab the ball home. Calum Chambers celebrates scoring Fulham's first goal of the game Fulham were disappointed that Dale Stephens only saw yellow following a studs up challenge on Andre Schurrle but the referee showed leniency. The hosts took until the 32nd minute to threaten the goal when Ryan Babel exchanged passes with Mitrovic and fired in a shot from 25 yards but Mat Ryan dived to his right to palm the shot wide. Team news Fulham kept the same XI which was defeated by Spurs in their last fixture.There was just one change for Brighton as Mat Ryan returned in goal following his time playing at the Asian Cup. It fell to Chambers to finally bring Fulham back into the game through a 25-yard volley after Shane Duffy headed a long ball straight into his path. Babel hit a high cross into the box which Brighton failed to deal with as the ball bounced, allowing Mitrovic to beat the flatfooted Ryan and Duffy to head home from six yards for the equaliser. Aleksandar Mitrovic scores Fulham's third goal at Craven Cottage Mitrovic completed the turnaround when he rose above Lewis Dunk to head a Joe Bryan cross down and into the corner to sends the fans wild. Vietto was one of the players to make the difference off the bench and he got his reward after fellow substitute Tom Cairney's shot hit the crossbar, the rebound landed at Babel's feet and his mishit shot fell to the Argentine who volleyed home. The managers Claudio Ranieri: \"We made a little step but we are alive but now we are a little more confident something can happen. \"It was important for us to react and react well. To win at the end. I said it at 2-0 goal it is much better to be like this at the beginning of the match than the end. \"We had all the time to have something good. It was great to score at the beginning of the second half, the players got the confidence, it was unbelievable.\" Chris Hughton: \"For as good as we were in the first half period, we were as bad in the second half period. \"We knew that they would come at us second half having changed it, we knew they would come at us but you have got to defend.\" Opta Stats Fulham vs Brighton is just the second match-up in Premier League history to see both sides come from two goals behind to avoid defeat in their two meetings within a season, after Blackburn Rovers vs Bolton Wanderers in 2003-04. Fulham came from behind in a Premier League game after being 2+ goals down at half-time for the first time since April 26th 2008; when they beat Manchester City 3-2 away from home after being 0-2 behind at half-time. Glenn Murray's opening goal ended an eight-game run without a goal for Brighton & Hove Albion - his worst-ever run without a goal in the Premier League for the club. In scoring the first goal of this game, Glenn Murray opened the scoring in a Premier League match for the sixth time this season - only Mohamed Salah (nine games) has done so more often than the Brighton and Hove Albion striker (level with Harry Kane). Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored 10 Premier League goals in 2018-19, one more than his previous best tally within a season in the competition (nine in 2015-16 with Newcastle) Man of the Match: Aleksandar Mitrovic The striker led by example for Fulham, even in the first half he was relentless with his chasing down of the opposition and got his rewards after the break with two fine finishes. Mitrovic was tenacious throughout, driving his team forward and giving a real focal point to an attack which needed to prove itself. What's next? Fulham travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace on Saturday 2 February at 3pm. Brighton return to the Amex where they will host Watford at the weekend."},{"date": "29/01/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 23699, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield Town", "lineup": [{"name": "Jonas Lössl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florent Hadergjonaj", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathias Jorgensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christopher Schindler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Terence Kongolo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juninho Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonathan Hogg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["55"]}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": ["65"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Elias Kachunga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["81"]}, {"name": "Steve Mounié", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Diakhaby", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["87"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Tommy Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Mooy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["55"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Hamer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Löwe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["81"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Depoitre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["87"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Durm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["55"]}, {"name": "André Gomes", "yellows": ["87"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernard", "yellows": ["31"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["86"]}, {"name": "Cenk Tosun", "yellows": ["43"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["70"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Digne", "yellows": [], "reds": ["66"], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["55"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": ["90+5"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["86"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjoe Kenny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["70"], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:21 Highlights from Everton's 1-0 win over Huddersfield in the Premier League. Highlights from Everton's 1-0 win over Huddersfield in the Premier League. Jan Siewert made a losing start to his tenure as Huddersfield head coach as Richarlison's third-minute strike was enough to secure a much-needed 1-0 win for 10-man Everton at the John Smith's Stadium. Tom Davies set up the Brazilian for the only goal of a cagey affair in West Yorkshire as Everton moved up to eighth in the Premier League to ease the pressure on manager Marco Silva. They were made to sweat on the result in the final 24 minutes as Lucas Digne was sent off for a professional foul on Adama Diakhaby, but Everton held on to just a third away win of the season. It is now 11 defeats in 12 games for Huddersfield, four games without a goal in all competitions, and the side are 11 points off 17th-placed Southampton with a significantly worse goal difference. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Kongolo (6), Jorgensen (6), Schindler (5), Hadergjonaj (6), Hogg (5), Bacuna (5), Puncheon (5), Diakhaby (6), Kachunga (6), Mounie (6) Subs: Mooy (7), Lowe (5), Depoitre (n/a) Everton: Pickford (7), Baines (7), Keane (8), Zouma, (7) Coleman (7), Gomes (7), Davies (8), Bernard (6), Sigurdsson (7), Richarlison (7), Tosun (7). Subs: Digne (3), Calvert-Lewin (n/a), Kenny (6) Man of the match: Michael Keane Everton boss Silva made five changes to the side that were embarrassed by Millwall in the FA Cup last weekend, but in the absence of Paris Saint-Germain target Idrissa Gueye they made the perfect start. From a throw-in, Davies followed his pass to be slipped down the right by Bernard, and the young Englishman crossed for Richarlison to score at the second attempt after Jonas Lossl had kept his initial effort out. Richarlison slides to put Everton into an early lead at the John Smith's Stadium Huddersfield struggled to carve out any opportunities of note with Everton playing a higher line to minimise their threat from set pieces, and it was not until the 45th minute that the hosts had a shot as Steve Mounie dragged his effort from distance wide of Jordan Pickford's left-hand post. Team news Siewert made three changes to the side picked by interim boss Hudson prior to his official appointment as Smith, Lowe and Mbenza all dropped out. Jorgensen, Mounie and Hadergjonaj all return. The big news was that after seven weeks out, Mooy was back on the bench. Davies took Gueye's place while Digne was dropped. Baines was back in at left-back, while Tosun and Bernard earned recalls in place of Calvert-Lewin and Lookman. Zouma replaced Mina as Silva made a total of five changes. Digne had been on the pitch for just 11 minutes, replacing the injured captain Leighton Baines, when he was forced to cynically haul down Diakhaby, leaving referee Stuart Attwell with no option but to dismiss the Frenchman. Lucas Digne was shown a straight red card shortly after coming on From the resulting free-kick, Aaron Mooy, on his return to the side as a fellow second-half substitute after a seven-week absence, forced Jordan Pickford into a brilliant save down to his right. The England No 1 had to be alert once more to deny Elias Kachunga as he tipped the forward's header from Diakhaby's cross to safety - and Everton's defence withstood a late onslaught to bring much-needed respite for Silva. Jordan Pickford produces a fine save to deny Aaron Mooy an equaliser Opta stats Huddersfield are winless in their last 11 meetings with Everton in all competitions (D5 L6), since a 1-0 win in a top-flight match in March 1956. Everton have kept a clean sheet in four of their last five top-flight meetings with Huddersfield. Everton are unbeaten in their last 14 away Premier League games against sides starting the day bottom of the table (W7 D7), since a 1-2 defeat against Wolves in May 2004. Huddersfield have failed to score in 50 per cent of their home Premier League games (16/32) - the highest percentage in the competition's history. Lucas Digne's red card was Everton's third sending off of the season in the Premier League - only Leicester (4) have seen more players sent off in the competition in 2018/19. Richarlison has scored 11 goals in all competitions for Everton this season, the same tally as Everton's top goalscorer in all competitions in 2017-18 (Wayne Rooney, also 11). Richarlison's opener for Everton after just two minutes and nine seconds was the earliest Premier League goal Huddersfield have conceded and the earliest in a league game since May 2016 (Sergi Canos after 20 seconds for Brentford in the Championship). The managers Jan Siewert: \"I'm disappointed but I'm proud. We had several chances and we couldn't have had a worse start. \"But we developed our game, and that's what I'm really proud of as we've only had seven days to work together. \"Today I'm disappointed because I saw why [Jordan] Pickford is England's No 1 goalkeeper. He made some incredible saves from Mooy and also from Kachunga.\" 1:42 Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert says he was proud of his side after their 1-0 defeat to Everton, and picked out Jordan Pickford for special praise Huddersfield boss Jan Siewert says he was proud of his side after their 1-0 defeat to Everton, and picked out Jordan Pickford for special praise Marco Silva: \"It's an important result for us. When you win away it's always important but it wasn't a fantastic performance. Sometimes you have to win games with character and personality. \"Twenty-five minutes with 10 players is always tough, and we've achieved three points that our players deserve. \"After the red card, we had to be more compact, and we did that. They had one direct free-kick and one header but they didn't have any other chances to equalise. For that we deserved the three points.\" 2:45 Everton manager Marco Silva was very pleased with the three points after their 1-0 win over Huddersfield Everton manager Marco Silva was very pleased with the three points after their 1-0 win over Huddersfield Man of the match - Michael Keane After being on the receiving end of a chastening experience in hostile conditions against Millwall, a trip to face an inevitable aerial bombardment from Huddersfield was always likely to prove a stiff mental test for Keane, especially after Digne's sending off. But the centre-back produced a commanding display to minimise the threat of Steve Mounie, taking control of a fragile back line to protect Everton's obvious weakness this season with a high line on defensive set pieces. Silva appears to still be figuring out what his preferred option is at centre-half, but it increasingly looks like being one of either Kurt Zouma or Yerry Mina alongside Keane after a second clean sheet in three Premier League games.

Highlights from Wolves' 3-0 win over West Ham in the Premier League. A second-half double from Raul Jimenez and another from Romain Saiss helped Wolves climb to seventh in the Premier League after a 3-0 win over West Ham. Saiss' header from a Joao Moutinho corner kick shortly after the hour mark finally put the dominant hosts in front on a night where they had controlled the game without manufacturing enough clear-cut chances until that point. The opener relieved any tension among a Wolves side knowing defeat would see West Ham leap-frog them in the table, and instead they grabbed a second when Jimenez turned home Moutinho's free-kick from wide with ten minutes left. And, as West Ham pushed up late on, Jimenez doubled his tally on the counter, lifting the ball over Lukasz Fabianski after Diego Jota had played him through to put the seal on the win. Player ratings Wolves: Rui Patricio (6), Bennett (7), Coady (7), Saiss (7), Doherty (8), Dendoncker (7), Neves (6), Moutinho (8), Jonny (7), Jimenez (8), Jota (7). Subs: Gibbs-White (n/a), Cavaleiro (n/a), Vinagre (n/a). West Ham: Fabianski (7), Zabaleta (5), Diop (5), Ogbonna (6), Masuaku (5), Noble (5), Rice (6), Antonio (6), Snodgrass (5), Anderson (6), Arnautovic (5). Subs: Carroll (5), Obiang (5), Hernandez (5). Man of the match: Raul Jimenez Wolves felt their way into the game as West Ham began hesitantly, and in the final minutes of the opening half they might have gone behind as the hosts' got into their stride. First, Leander Dendoncker's goal was ruled out when Jimenez was marginally offside in the build-up, then Jota saw a long-range effort tipped round the post, and likewise Matt Doherty from a tight angle in injury time. Team news Wolves made one change from the side that beat Leicester, with fit-again Matt Doherty replacing Ruben Vinagre. Marko Arnautovic was welcomed straight back into the West Ham fold after the conclusion of his transfer spat, with Arthur Masuaku and Robert Snodgrass also returning. West Ham briefly appeared to have shaken off their nerves after the break and looked more accomplished without testing Rui Patricio. But Wolves soon ramped up the pressure again, forcing Fabianski to save from Jota, Saiss and Jonny. The defences could not last forever, and so it proved as Saiss rose unchallenged to head home Moutinho's corner from the left on the hour mark. Jimenez then punished West Ham from another dead ball with 10 minutes to go as he shook off Declan Rice to sidefoot another Moutinho dead ball into the far corner from close-range. Marko Arnautovic was forced off with injury late on With West Ham looking for an unlikely route back into the game in the final minutes, two became three with four minutes to go. Moutinho's lofted ball forward was perfect for Jota to control, and he played Jimenez through to lift the ball inside the near post and seal Wolves' biggest win of the season. Opta facts Wolves have completed a league double over West Ham for the very first time in their history - in the 30th different campaign in which the sides have faced. Raúl Jiménez has been involved in 13 Premier League goals for Wolverhampton Wanderers this season (eight goals, five assists). The only player to have had more goal involvements in a PL season for Wolves is Steven Fletcher in 2011-12 (14) West Ham United have now lost their last three Premier League away games without scoring a single goal - their longest losing run without scoring a goal since December 2006 (a run of seven). Wolves' Diogo Jota has had a hand in seven goals in his last six Premier League appearances (5 goals, 2 assists), including a hat-trick against Leicester last time out. He hadn't scored or assisted a single goal in any of his first 13 appearances this season. João Moutinho has assisted two goals in back to back league Premier League games. He only managed two assists in his first 22 games this season. Wolverhampton Wanderers attempted nine shots on target in this game against West Ham United, the most they have attempted in a single Premier League match this season. Man of the match - Raul Jimenez Jimenez had a couple of contenders for his man of the match gong but his double, taking him into double figures for the season in all competitions, set him clear.

Highlights from Manchester United's draw against Burnley in the Premier League. Manchester United fought back from 2-0 down with three minutes remaining to earn a 2-2 draw with Burnley as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s perfect record ended at Old Trafford on Tuesday. Victor Lindelof slammed home a 92rd-minute equaliser from close range despite some Tom Heaton heroics, after Paul Pogba had halved the deficit with a penalty (87) to give United a chance of an unlikely draw. Burnley had taken the lead through Ashley Barnes six minutes after the break as the visitors capitalised on an Andreas Pereira mistake outside his own box, and doubled their advantage with nine minutes remaining as Chris Wood headed home Ashley Westwood's cross, and that looked to be that until United's late flurry. Ashley Barnes celebrates after Burnley take the lead at Old Trafford Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (5), Young (5), Lindelof (6), Jones (5), Shaw (6), Matic (6), Pogba (6), Pereira (4), Mata (5), Rashford (5), Lukaku (5) Subs: Lingard (6), Sanchez (5) Burnley: Heaton (8), Bardsley (7), Tarkowski (8), Mee (8), Taylor (8), McNeil (7), Westwood (7), Cork (7), Hendrick (6), Barnes (7), Wood (7) Subs: Gudmundsson (NA) Man of the match: Tom Heaton The result means sixth-place United missed out on a chance to move into the top four. Burnley are 15th, four points off the relegation zone. United struggled to break down a disciplined and industrious Burnley side in the first half, as Sean Dyche's men reduced the hosts to just one clear-cut chance. Breaking with blistering pace, Marcus Rashford fed Romelu Lukaku and received the Belgian's return pass in space inside the box with just Heaton to beat, only to miscue his effort and poke wide of goal from 10 yards out. The second half was far more open, but it was Burnley who went ahead as Pereira was robbed 40 yards from goal by Jack Cork, who played in Barnes to slam into the roof of the net from 15 yards. Team news There are five changes for United after the 3-1 win at Arsenal on Friday night; Lukaku starts again as Jones, Pereira, Mata, Rashford and De Gea come in for Bailly, Herrera, Lingard, Sanchez and Romero. Burnley revert back to the side that drew 0-0 at Watford, after making several changes for their FA Cup fourth-round defeat at Man City. Barnes celebrates with team-mates after Burnley take the lead at Old Trafford Heaton then made a superb stop from Lukaku's close-range effort, changing direction and tipping wide to his left, as United peppered Burnley's box to little success. Burnley thought they had won it as Wood glanced home from six yards from Ashley Westwood's first-time cross on 81 minutes, but there was far more drama to come. Jeff Hendrick's clumsy tug on substitute Jesse Lingard in the box gave United the chance to halve the score, and Pogba's trademark slow penalty run-up resulted in a fine finish into the top left corner. Heaton beat away Pogba's curling 20-yard effort shortly after, but United levelled two minutes into the five added on as Heaton first brilliantly tipped away Alexis Sanchez's header, only to be marginally beaten by Lindelof's rebound from a few yards out. Pogba reduces the deficit from the penalty spot The managers Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"We started the game almost feeling like the eight previous games meant we could start the game with a 1-0 lead, but it doesn't happen like this. We have to earn the right to win the game by having a good start. They made it difficult for us, but then again we had a great comeback.\" 2:00 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United started the game as if they were 1-0 up Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Manchester United started the game as if they were 1-0 up Sean Dyche: \"The frustration is a mystery five minutes, I was confused by that, I thought it gave the crowd a lift, and gave more energy to their side. I don't like to see penalties when they touch you on the shoulder and all of a sudden your legs don't work, I'm not a fan of that, but we know that happens. \"And unfortunately the tight calls went against us tonight. Sanchez wins the first header on their second goal, Heaton makes a save and I think Lindelof is offside to finish it off.\" 2:36 Sean Dyche criticised the officials’ decision to add on five minutes Sean Dyche criticised the officials’ decision to add on five minutes Opta stats Manchester United came from two goals down to draw against Burnley for the second time in as many Premier League meetings at Old Trafford, also doing so against the Clarets in December 2017. Burnley remain winless in their last 20 visits to Old Trafford against Man Utd in all competitions (D8 L12). Burnley striker Ashley Barnes has scored in each of his last two Premier League appearances at Old Trafford against Manchester United (two goals). Paul Pogba has both scored and missed a Premier League penalty against Burnley this season, failing from the spot at Turf Moor in September but scoring tonight. Victor Lindelof became the fourth Swedish player to score in the Premier League for Manchester United, after Jesper Blomqvist, Henrik Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Man of the match - Tom Heaton Returning to the ground where he started his career, Tom Heaton may be the most disappointed among Burnley's ranks to come away without a win. His saves - seven in total - frustrated United no end, in particular his fine fingertip stop from Lukaku at 1-0, changing direction to get the faintest of touches. He nearly kept out the leveller too, stopping Sanchez's header and getting a touch on Lindelof's rebound, and his dejection as Old Trafford went wild said it all. What's next? United now go to Leicester on Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League at 2.05pm, while Burnley host Southampton at 3pm on Saturday."},{"date": "29/01/2019", "arena": "St James' Park,

congratulated by team-mates after scoring Newcastle's winner from the penalty spot Newcastle came from behind to beat a lacklustre Manchester City 2-1 at St James' Park and hand Liverpool further initiative in the Premier League title race. City looked on course to close the gap to leaders Liverpool to one point after Sergio Aguero scored just 24 seconds into the match. However, a slack display from the champions was punished as Salomon Rondon equalised in the 66th minute and then Matt Ritchie converted a penalty with 10 minutes remaining. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Yedlin (7), Lejeune (7) Schar (7), Lascelles (7), Ritchie (7), Hayden (7), Longstaff (7), Atsu (6), Perez (6), Rondon (8) Subs: Manquillo (5), Kenedy (5) Manchester City: Ederson (5), Walker (5), Stones (5), Laporte (5), Danilo (4), Fernandinho (4), David Silva (5), De Bruyne (5), Sane (5), Sterling (5), Aguero (6) Subs: Bernardo Silva (5), Jesus (5), Gundogan (5) Man of the match: Salomon Rondon City hardly threatened a response and Liverpool could now move seven points clear if they beat Leicester on Wednesday. Newcastle, meanwhile, are five points clear of the relegation zone and could soon be boosted further by the signing of Miguel Almiron for a club-record fee. Ritchie celebrates putting Newcastle ahead The celebratory atmosphere at the final whistle at St James' Park was in stark contrast to the subdued start after City scored the quickest Premier League goal of the season. Raheem Sterling crossed to the back post and David Silva stooped to head across goal for Aguero, who scored his 15th goal in 13 Premier League appearances against Newcastle. But City did not build on their early advantage and were slack throughout the first half. Ayoze Perez had a chance for Newcastle in the 13th minute when he dragged a shot wide, while City saw a goal ruled out when Kevin De Bruyne was booked for taking a free-kick too quickly that Aguero scored from. As City struggled to find their rhythm, Newcastle threatened on the break and Christian Atsu had a shot that deflected over the bar. Sergio Agureo scores early at St James' Park City did not create another opening until late in the first half as David Silva's header was blocked in the six-yard box by Florian Lejeune. The visitors looked as though they would raise their level after the break as Sterling almost turned in a cross from Sane and then Martin Dubravka pushed clear a shot from Silva. However, City could not take control of the match and Newcastle took advantage. Sean Longstaff is fouled in the penalty area by Fernandinho Rondon volleyed home in the 67th minute after a headed dropped into the box before Newcastle were awarded a penalty when Fernandinho was caught in possession and tripped Sean Longstaff. Team news Newcastle stuck with the same XI that won against Cardiff in their last Premier League match while Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Raheem Sterling started for Manchester City. Benjamin Mendy did not make the squad. After a long wait as Ederson received treatment for an injury, Ritchie stepped up and fired the penalty past the goalkeeper. City controlled possession in the final 10 minutes but did not threaten an equaliser as Newcastle held out. Opta stats Newcastle have beaten Manchester City in a Premier League game for the first time since September 2005, ending a run of 22 meetings without a win against them in the division (D3 L19). This was Pep Guardiola's 100th Premier League game in charge of Manchester City (W73 D15 L12 - 234 points); despite the defeat, only Jose Mourinho (W73 D18 L9 - 237 points) picked up more points in his first 100 managerial games in the competition than the Spaniard. Newcastle have now won five of their last seven home Premier League matches against sides starting the day in the top two in the table (L2). Manchester City have now dropped 16 points in their 24 Premier League games this season having drawn twice and lost four times; already more than they dropped in the entirety of 2017-18 (14 - four draws, two defeats). Manchester City have lost three games in which they have been ahead in the Premier League this season, their most in a single campaign since 2008-09 (four). Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero has now scored 15 Premier League goals against Newcastle United; only Alan Shearer v Leeds (20 goals), Shearer v Everton (16) and Les Ferdinand v Everton (16) have more against a single club in the competition's history. Sergio Aguero's goal after 24 seconds was the earliest goal scored in this season's Premier League, and the fastest Manchester City have scored in a Premier League game since Jesus Navas netted after 13 seconds against Tottenham in November 2013. David Silva has been directly involved in 10 goals in 14 Premier League games against Newcastle for Man City (five goals, five assists), more than he has against any other opponent in the competition. All 30 of Salomon Rondon's Premier League goals have been scored from inside the box - of current Premier League players, only Javier Hernandez (49) has netted more with 100 per cent being from inside the area. Of Matt Ritchie's 16 league goals for Newcastle, 14 have been at St. James' Park; his penalty was Newcastle's first to be scored in the Premier League since Georginio Wijnaldum scored from the spot against Spurs in May 2016. Man of the match - Salomon Rondon He did not have too much service, but Rondon was the perfect outlet for Newcastle. He was strong when he got the ball, held it up well and brought team-mates into play. He made more passes than any other Newcastle player, won nine aerial duels - four more than any other player on the pitch - and showed composure to score the equalising goal. What's next? Newcastle are live on Sky Sports as they go to Tottenham on Saturday and then Wolves on Monday, February 11. City host Arsenal on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, before a trip to Everton next Wednesday. They then face Chelsea at the Etihad on Sunday, February 10, live on Sky Sports."},{"date": "20/01/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24190, "home_team": {"name": "Huddersfield

Player Ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Smith (5), Schindler (5), Kongolo (6), Lowe (5), Hogg (6), Puncheon (5), Bacuna (5), Kachunga (5), Diakhaby (5), Mbenza (6) Subs: Pritchard (6), Mounie (6) Manchester City: Ederson (7), Walker (6), Laporte (7), Otamendi (7), Danilo (7), Fernandinho (8), Gundogan (7), De Bruyne (7), Sane (8), Sterling (8), Aguero (8) Subs: Delph (6), David Silva (7), Bernardo Silva (7) Man of the match: Leroy Sane City came into this game having scored 99 goals in all competitions and it took them just 18 minutes to reach three figures. Danilo drove forward from full-back and struck a shot that took a wicked deflection off Christopher Schindler, with the ball flying into the corner of the net. Team news Nicolas Otamendi, Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero came in for John Stones, Bernardo Silva, David Silva and Gabriel Jesus. Meanwhile, interim Huddersfield boss Mark Hudson rang the changes, bringing in Tommy Smith, Terence Kongolo, Juninho Bacuna, Adama Diakhaby, Chris Lowe and Isaac Mbenza. The game started to drift for the remainder of the first half but Guardiola must have had words at the break as City came out with renewed energy. The champions went from first gear to fifth in a devastating two minutes of ruthless attacking, where Sterling and then Sane found the net. Sterling finished off a flowing move instigated by Kevin De Bruyne and assisted by Sane, although the German did look marginally offside. Just 90 seconds later Sergio Aguero nodded through Sane, who remained calm and skilfully finished from close range. The three-goal lead allowed City to operate in the comfort zone for the remainder of the game - and Huddersfield had no answers. Man of the match: Leroy Sane He floated in and out of the game but when he was at the forefront, Sane took Huddersfield apart. He's now scored seven goals and grabbed nine assists in his last 17 Premier League appearances. Gary Neville on co-commentary said: \"The first 20 minutes he looked dangerous and then after the break he came to life, setting up Sterling and then scoring himself. He's a player - as a right-back - I would hate coming up against.\" Leroy Sane was the pick of the players Opta stats Since losing 2-1 to Leicester City on Boxing Day, Manchester City have won their last six matches in all competitions by an aggregate score of 27-2. Huddersfield Town have lost five consecutive home league matches for the first time since a run of seven defeats in a row between April and September 2000. Manchester City became the first team in Europe's top five leagues to score 100 goals in all competitions this season (102). Sané has had a hand in 20 goals in his last 17 Premier League starts (8 goals, 12 assists). Huddersfield have won none of the 34 Premier League games in which they've conceded the first goal (D3 L31), losing all 14 home games when conceding first. Sterling's last two Premier League goals have been headers - only one of his first 57 in the competition came via his head. Since the start of last season, Huddersfield have failed to score in 32 Premier League matches - nine more than any other side. Sane and Sterling have combined for six Premier League goals for Man City this season - the only duo to combine for more are Bournemouth's Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser (seven goals). What's next? City face Burton Albion, live on Sky Sports, on Wednesday in the second leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final, with a 9-0 aggregate lead already in the bag. Meanwhile, Huddersfield's next game is in nine days when they host Everton in the Premier League."},{"date": "20/01/2019", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 24807, "home_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Sergio Rico", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxime Le Marchand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Ream", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jean Seri", "yellows": ["75"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["81"]}, {"name": "Joe Bryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["72"]}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": ["74"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Babel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["55"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marcus Bettinelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["55"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neeskens Kebano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["72"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cairney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Floyd Ayité", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Vietto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahima Cissé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["81"], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": ["90+4"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davinson Sánchez", "yellows": ["74"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": ["79"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["79"]}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["86"]}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": ["17"], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Georges-Kevin N'Koudou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["86"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["79"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Foyth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oliver Skipp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kazaiah Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:59 Highlights from Tottenham's 2-1 win over Fulham in the Premier League. Highlights from Tottenham's 2-1 win over Fulham in the Premier League. Harry Winks scored a stoppage-time winner as Tottenham came from behind to inflict a crushing 2-1 defeat on Fulham on Renault Super Sunday. Winks applied the finishing touch to a Georges-Kevin Nkoudou cross in the third minute of added time as Spurs passed their first assignment without Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son. Fernando Llorente, the man drafted in to replace Kane and Son, handed Fulham the lead with an own goal inside 16 minutes, but Dele Alli spared his blushes, drawing Spurs level six minutes into the second half, before he was forced off with a hamstring injury late on. Fulham looked to have secured a vital point in their battle against relegation but Winks' first goal since November 2016 saw Spurs beat a side managed by Claudio Ranieri in the Premier League for the first time, deepening their plight towards the foot of the table. Player ratings Fulham: Rico (6), Odoi (6), Le Marchand (7), Ream (6), Christie (7), Chambers (7), Seri (6), Bryan (6), Schurrle (7), Babel (7), Mitrovic (6). Subs: Sessegnon (6), Kebano (5), Cisse (n/a). Tottenham: Lloris (8), Alderweireld (6), Vertonghen (6), Sanchez (6), Trippier (6), Winks (8), Eriksen (7), Rose (6), Lamela (6), Alli (7), Llorente (5). Subs: Dier (5), Nkoudou (6). Man of the Match: Harry Winks All the talk ahead of kick-off concerned Tottenham's ability to cope without both Kane and Son for the first time in 132 Premier League games, but it was evident early on that it would take some time for Spurs to adjust. Fulham's recent signing Ryan Babel kicked off an impressive debut performance on 12 minutes when he outmuscled Davinson Sanchez and charged towards the area, where his fierce near-post shot was tipped behind by Hugo Lloris. Ryan Babel impressed on his Fulham debut against Spurs From the resulting corner, Denis Odoi shanked a shot wide from a good position but the early chances set the tone, giving Fulham confidence and belief that Spurs could be got at. Cyrus Christie accepted the invitation to charge forward on the quarter-hour. His cross deflected behind for a corner from which Fulham took the lead as the unsighted Llorente diverted Jean Michael Seri's delivery beyond Lloris. Fernando Llorente handed Fulham the lead when he put Seri's corner through his own net Llorente had the chance to atone for his clanger on 24 minutes but failed to make clear contact with Jan Vertonghen's deep cross, his effort off the shoulder dealt with by Sergio Rico. Spurs, who were laboured and short of ideas, were fortunate to reach the interval with just the one-goal deficit as Fulham laid siege to their goal. Babel should have doubled the hosts' tally on 40 minutes but he headed over from Christie's cross. Team news January signing Ryan Babel replaced Ryan Sessegnon in Fulham’s only change from their defeat at Burnley. With Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son missing, Fernando Llorente and Erik Lamela returned to lead the Spurs attack. Davinson Sanchez and Danny Rose were also handed starts as Mauricio Pochettino made four changes following the defeat to Manchester United. Andre Schurrle's brilliant volley then drew Lloris into an even better save before Aleksandar Mitrovic's rebound was ruled out for offside, while a last-gasp challenge from Vertonghen prevented Babel from finding the target after a deft back-heel from Calum Chambers. But after a number of close calls Spurs took just six minutes of the second half to erase Fulham's lead as Eriksen's whipped cross from the right was headed home by Alli at close range. Dele Alli drew Spurs level early in the second half Fulham saw claims for a penalty turned away when Lloris raced off his line to confront Mitrovic, with referee Craig Pawson confident the Spurs stopper had made clear contact with the ball first. Danny Rose's deflected shot cannoned off the crossbar on the hour before the England left-back whipped a peach of the cross into the area on 80 minutes. Llorente had another chance to make up for his own goal, this time at the same end, but he glanced wide from five yards. Harry Winks headed Spurs' winner deep into stoppage-time Fulham looked to have earned a vital point towards their survival bid but it was cruelly snatched away from them as Nkoudou's teasing cross from the left was dispatched by Winks with seconds remaining, leaving the hosts with no time to respond. Opta stats Spurs have won four of their last six Premier League away games in which they've conceded first (L2), including on both occasions this season (6-2 v Everton and 2-1 v Fulham). Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri suffered his first Premier League defeat against Spurs (W7 D4 L1), in what was his 12th game in the competition against them. Fulham are the first team in the top five European leagues to have conceded 50 goals in league competition this season (51). Spurs won a Premier League game without Harry Kane or Heung-Min Son for the first time since March 2014 (3-2 v Southampton). Since his Premier League debut in August 2015, Dele Alli has been directly involved in 47 per cent of Spurs' goals in the competition when Harry Kane hasn't played (7/15 - five goals and two assists). No player has scored more headed goals than Spurs midfielder Dele Alli in the Premier League this season (4 - joint-high with Aleksandar Mitrovic). Fernando Llorente's own goal for Spurs was their first in the Premier League since January 21, 2018 (364 days ago), when Davinson Sanchez did so against Southampton. Spurs have scored four Premier League own goals against Fulham - against no other side have they scored more (also four v Southampton). Fulham's Ryan Babel started his first Premier League game since December 6, 2010 (for Liverpool against Aston Villa), 2967 days ago. The managers 2:30 Claudio Ranieri questioned his players' game management as Fulham conceded in the final seconds to lose 2-1 Claudio Ranieri questioned his players' game management as Fulham conceded in the final seconds to lose 2-1 Claudio Ranieri: \"The first half was fantastic for us. We scored, maybe there was a penalty too after our goal. The second half they tried to do their best but the two goals, we lacked experience. With one minute at the end we had a free-kick and put it in the box, why? Take it to the corner. I think our fans are happy for their performance and we must continue this way. I am confident and haven't lost my confidence about the team.\" 3:41 Mauricio Pochettino praised his Spurs players' efforts after their late victory Mauricio Pochettino praised his Spurs players' efforts after their late victory Mauricio Pochettino: \"The performance was solid, although maybe not great. Fulham are a team who needed to win and we struggled a little bit in the first half, because from set-pieces, they work so hard. After Manchester United, it was a tough week for us because there were some negative bits around the team, but we turned it into a positive today.\" Man of the Match - Harry Winks Fernando Llorente handed Fulham the lead when he put Seri's corner through his own net With Kane and Son missing Spurs needed someone to step up to the plate when it mattered most and Winks proved to be that man. An assured midfield performance was capped in the most dramatic circumstances as he finished off the move he initiated, driving into the area to head Spurs back to winning ways with only his second goal for the club. What's next? Fulham host Brighton in the Premier League on January 29 (7.45pm). Spurs look to book their place in the Carabao Cup final when they travel to Chelsea for Thursday's semi-final second leg, live on Sky Sports, before making the trip to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday (4pm)."},{"date": "19/01/2019", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 31278, "home_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício", "yellows": [],

Highlights from Wolves' 4-3 win over Leicester in the Premier League. Diogo Jota's hat-trick, including an injury-time winner, saw Wolves beat Leicester 4-3 to increase the pressure on Foxes manager Claude Puel on Saturday. Wolves made a fast start to proceedings, scoring twice inside the opening quarter of an hour through Jota's well-taken effort after just four minutes, and Ryan Bennett's header eight minutes later. With the hosts seemingly cruising to the three points, though, Leicester responded right at the start of the second half through the recalled Demarai Gray (47), before Conor Coady's own goal completed a quickfire turnaround. Player ratings Wolves: Patricio (6), Bennett (6), Coady (6), Saiss (6), Vinagre (6), Dendoncker (6), Moutinho (7), Neves (7), Jonny (6), Jimenez (7), Jota (9) Subs: Doherty (6), Gibbs-White (6) Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Simpson (6), Morgan (6), Maguire (6), Chilwell (7), Ricardo (6), Mendy (6), Ndidi (7), Barnes (7), Gray (7), Vardy (7) Subs: Evans (6), Maddison (7), Iheanacho (6) Man of the match: Diogo Jota But Nuno Espirito Santo's side responded through Jota (64), only for Wes Morgan to head home substitute James Maddison's free kick (87), before the Portuguese sealed his hat-trick in stoppage time. The Wolves boss saw red for his wild on-pitch celebrations with his own players at the end as his team moved up to seventh in the table, while Leicester dropped to ninth ahead of Saturday afternoon's games. Wolves may have come into the game having won only one of their previous five league matches, but you would not have known given their start at Molineux. Wolves defender Ryan Bennett celebrates his goal with team-mates Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel had already produced a breathtaking one-handed stop to tip Ruben Neves' long-range curler over the bar, before the hosts took the lead from the resulting corner. Leicester cleared the initial danger, before breaking upfield, only to lose possession as Joao Moutinho got free down the right wing. And from the Portuguese's floated cross, there was Jota to steal in ahead of Danny Simpson and toe-poke his team ahead. That lead was soon doubled, and that man Moutinho was again the provider as Bennett got in front of Harry Maguire to power the playmaker's left-wing corner home with 12 minutes on the clock. Leicester City captain Wes Morgan looks dejected during the 4-3 loss to Wolves at Molineux Those two early goals had the under-fire Puel off his seat in the away dugout and raging at his players as chants of \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" came from the home faithful. However, those calls were soon silenced as the visitors scored twice in the first four minutes of the second half to turn the match on its head, the first coming from a Wolves corner. Leicester counter-attacked through Jamie Vardy, with the striker then sending Gray through on goal and from a tight angle in the box, the forward beat Rui Patricio with a low drive into the far corner of the goal. Team news Wolves made two changes from their 3-0 loss at Man City on MNF, with Romain Saiss and Ruben Vinagre coming in for the benched Matt Doherty and the suspended Willy Boly. Meanwhile, Leicester made three alterations from their 2-1 home loss to Southampton last weekend as Danny Simpson, Demarai Gray and Harvey Barnes, for his first Premier League start, replaced James Maddison, Marc Albrighton and Hamza Choudhury, who all dropped to the subs’ bench. Four minutes later and Leicester were level after Ben Chilwell's powerful run into the box was stopped, only for Harvey Barnes - on his Premier League debut - to collect the ball and see Coady deflect his shot past Patricio, the Wolves captain's second own goal in as many games. The scoring for the day was not over though as first Neves' glorious through ball released Jota, with the Portuguese drilling a shot past Schmeichel midway through the second half, only for Leicester's captain to rise highest to nod in Maddison's set piece with three minutes to go. However, if Puel and Leicester thought they had escaped with a draw, they were mistaken as Jota was on hand to sweep home Raul Jimenez's cross and send the home fans into delirium. Opta stats Wolves were two goals up at half-time for only the fourth time in the Premier League, winning all four of those games Leicester have lost five of their last eight Premier League games (W3) after going six games without defeat directly before that (W2 D4) Wolves have netted three 90+ minute winners in the Premier League this season, more than any other side Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel conceded his 200th goal in the Premier League in his 156th game in the competition (now 202). It took his father Peter Schmeichel 241 games to hit the 200 goals conceded mark in the English top-flight Joao Moutinho is the first Wolves player to provide two assists in a Premier League game since Kevin Doyle versus Swansea in April 2012 Wolves defender Conor Coady is the ninth player to score an own goal in consecutive Premier League appearances, and the first since Leighton Baines in October 2012 for Everton against Liverpool Leicester's Wes Morgan netted a Premier League goal for the first time in his last 73 appearances in the competition, since scoring for the Foxes against Swansea in August 2016 Man of the Match - Diogo Jota The forward ultimately proved to be the difference between the two sides at Molineux, with his hat-trick meaning the 22-year-old scored more goals in this match than he had in the whole of the season. All three of the Portuguese's goals were well taken, especially his second, while his clever runs caused the Leicester back line no end of problems all afternoon. As a result, the frontman became the first player to score a top-division hat-trick for Wolves since John Richards - also against Leicester - in October 1977.

I think we have a lot of different feelings in this game, we started with poor intentions and conceded two early goals. It was crazy, we come back into the game with good quality and good chances. We lacked quality in our play but we came back with fantastic spirit in the second half. We came back with desire, aggression and put Wolves under pressure. \"We made good pressing, continued our intensity but conceded a third goal after a fantastic feeling to come back but to finish 4-3, we need to waste some time.

Bournemouth 2-0 West Ham Bournemouth secured just a second win in their last eight Premier League games as goals from Callum Wilson and Joshua King gave them a 2-0 victory over West Ham. The Cherries had lost 11 of their previous 14 matches in all competitions, but after a goalless first half, Wilson met Ryan Fraser's deflected cross to half-volley home a fine opener (53) at the Vitality Stadium. West Ham were caught once more on the counter-attack in the first minute of stoppage time as King met David Brooks' low cross to fire in his sixth league goal of the season. Player ratings Bournemouth: Boruc (6), Clyne (7), Smith (6), Ake (7), Cook (6), Lerma (6), Gosling (6), Brooks (7), Fraser (7), King (7), Wilson (8). Subs: Mousset (n/a), Daniels (n/a), Stanislas (6). West Ham: Fabianski (7), Cresswell (6), Zabaleta (7), Diop (7), Ogbonna (7), Rice (6), Noble (6), Nasri (6), Anderson (7), Antonio (6), Carroll (5). Subs: Snodgrass (5), Hernandez (5), Diangana (5). Man of the match: Callum Wilson The result keeps Bournemouth in 12th, but they move three points off seventh, while West Ham dropped a place to 10th after Wolves' thrilling 4-3 win over Leicester. There had been 28 goals in the seven previous Premier League encounters - an average of four per game - but there was not a shot on target in a cagey opening 45 minutes. Bournemouth's best chance fell to Brooks, who met Wilson's deep cross but headed wide at the far post from an acute angle. Referee Simon Hooper correctly ruled out a Nathan Ake header from a Fraser cross with Wilson standing in an offside position and clearly interfering with play. Callum Wilson fires in a brilliant 10th league goal of the season Team news Bournemouth welcomed back their talisman Callum Wilson as he replaced Junior Stanislas, but the bigger news was that Artur Boruc started in goal in place of Asmir Begovic. Marko Arnautovic was absent from West Ham's 18-man squad. Andy Carroll started in the one change from the side that beat Arsenal last weekend. West Ham grew into the game and had their best opportunity after 25 minutes when Samir Nasri dragged a shot wide - but the contest came alive after the break as after Lukasz Fabianski produced a fine save to keep out Steve Cook's header, Andy Carroll missed a glorious chance to break the deadlock. Mark Noble's cross was initially headed back across goal by the striker, but after Ake failed to clear under pressure from Michail Antonio, Carroll inexplicably scooped his shot from two yards over the crossbar. The miss proved costly as moments later, Issa Diop failed to prevent Fraser from getting his cross away down the left, and with the ball spinning off the French defender to Wilson on the edge of the box, the returning striker lashed his volley past a static Fabianski. Joshua King wraps up the points in stoppage time for Bournemouth The goal was Wilson's sixth in as many games against the Hammers, and he very nearly doubled Bournemouth's lead when his shot from King's pass struck the foot of Fabianski's post, via the fingertips of the Poland keeper. It was not until after his withdrawal with a suspected knee injury that Bournemouth put the contest to bed. With West Ham stretched at the back as they went in search of an equaliser, the hosts broke down the right with Brooks, and the Wales international unselfishly set up King to secure a vital three points. The managers Eddie Howe: \"It means everything. It's such a tough league we're in and we're competing with the very best teams in the country. You can go through all sorts of moments in a season, and we've been on a really tough run. \"The players have been questioned, but I thought they came through with flying colours today. I thought it was really disciplined display full of hard work and I think we deserved the win. \"We've put a lot of hard work into the last few weeks and concentrated on our defending. It goes without saying, after the run that we've been on that's what we would do and I'm very pleased that the players got their reward.\" 3:07 Eddie Howe says Bournemouth's hard work focusing on defence paid off as they kept a clean sheet in their win over West Ham. Eddie Howe says Bournemouth's hard work focusing on defence paid off as they kept a clean sheet in their win over West Ham. Manuel Pellegrini: \"Of course, I'm disappointed with the result because it was a very close game in the opening 45 minutes. In the second-half we had a clear option to score the first goal. \"They scored a beautiful goal but with a lot of luck with the rebound going to the exact position for their player to shoot. It was a good reaction from our team but we couldn't score. \"If you don't score you can't win games, so I'm disappointed. We had an option to move higher in the table. Football is like that, you have games when you play better than the result.\" 2:15 Manuel Pellegrini says West Ham played well but just couldn't score in their defeat to Bournemouth. Manuel Pellegrini says West Ham played well but just couldn't score in their defeat to Bournemouth. Opta stats Bournemouth have enjoyed four Premier League wins against West Ham; against no other side have they registered more victories. West Ham failed to score for the first time in their 13 meetings with Bournemouth in all competitions. Bournemouth ended a run of four Premier League games without a win (D1 L3), keeping only their second clean sheet in their last 13 games in the competition. The Hammers have failed to score in consecutive away Premier League games for the first time since November 2017. Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson has netted six Premier League goals against West Ham in six appearances, more than he has managed against any other side in the competition. Bournemouth's Callum Wilson is only the second player to hit double figures for goals in a single Premier League season for the Cherries (10 goals), following Josh King's haul of 16 in 2016/17. Bournemouth attacker Josh King has scored four and assisted one in his three home Premier League appearances against West Ham. Man of the match - Callum Wilson From the very first whistle, Wilson's sharpness gave Bournemouth's attacks a real focal point and the England striker's presence allowed those around him to raise their game after a poor run of form. West Ham, in truth, had done well to nullify his threat inside the box for 53 minutes, but it was a venomous, dipping volley from 20 yards for which this game will be remembered. Wilson struck his sixth goal in as many games against West Ham on Saturday The strike no doubt put an extra few million on Wilson's price tag, and but for an excellent save from Fabianski, he would have had another. Wilson's worth to Bournemouth simply cannot be measured after another demonstration of why some of the country's biggest clubs are starting to express their interest. What's next? Bournemouth host Chelsea at the Vitality Stadium in their next Premier League match on January 30 while West Ham are on FA Cup fourth-round duty at AFC Wimbledon next weekend before travelling to face Wolves on January 29."},{"date": "19/01/2019", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53171, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson Ramses Becker", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

and extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points. Having beaten Manchester City last month, Palace looked like they might have another say in the title race when Andros Townsend struck in the 34th minute at Anfield. Liverpool hit back after half-time with two goals in seven minutes from Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, but James Tomkins headed in from a corner in the 65th minute. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (5), Robertson (6), Van Dijk (5), Matip (5), Milner (4), Fabinho (7), Henderson (8), Keita (6), Mane (7), Salah (8), Firmino (7) Subs: Shaqiri (5), Lallana (5), Camacho (5) Crystal Palace: Speroni (4), Van Aanholt (5), Tomkins (6), Sakho (5), Wan-Bissaka (5), McArthur (5), Milivojevic (6), Kouyate (5), Townsend (7), Ayew (5), Zaha (6) Subs: Schlupp (5), Meyer (6), Wickham (5) Man of the match: Jordan Henderson An error from 39-year-old goalkeeper Julian Speroni gifted Salah a second goal - his 50th in the Premier League - and Sadio Mane made it 4-2 in injury-time after James Milner had been sent off. Max Meyer scored a late goal for Palace but Liverpool held out to extend their lead over City, who play Huddersfield on Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Julian Speroni looks dejected after Liverpool's third goal It was City's surprise defeat to Palace in December that had initially swung the title race in Liverpool's favour, and Jurgen Klopp's side battled hard to ensure they did not lose any of their advantage. The hosts controlled possession from the start and went close in the eighth minute when Milner slipped a pass into the box for Joel Matip, who saw his shot smothered by Speroni. But that was the only save that Speroni would have to make in the first half. Roberto Firmino celebrates scoring Liverpool's second goal Matip and Virgil van Dijk both missed the target with headers before Palace took the lead in the 34th minute, Wilfried Zaha effortlessly skipping past Milner and then pulling back for Townsend to finish with a low shot. Van Dijk headed over shortly afterwards, while Palace players were aggrieved with Salah for seemingly exaggerating contact after a challenge from Mamadou Sakho in the box. Roberto Firmino gave Liverpool a 2-1 lead Liverpool were quickly out of the blocks in the second half, with Salah flicking in a volley after Van Dijk's shot deflected over the Palace defence. Firmino then made it 2-1 with a scuffed shot, but Palace fought back as Tomkins headed in from a corner. Team news Liverpool made three changes from their win at Brighton as Milner, Keita and Matip replacing Alexander-Arnold, Wijnaldum and Shaqiri. Palace handed a start to 39-year-old goalkeeper Speroni, who hadn't played for the club since December 2017. He featured due to injuries to Guaita and Hennessey. Speroni, making his first start in a year due to injuries to Wayne Hennessey and Vicente Guaita, was at fault for Liverpool's third as he flapped at a cross and Salah finished on the line. Milner was sent off after being booked twice for fouls on Zaha, but Mane scored Liverpool's fourth in the 93rd minute to ensure Meyer's late strike was only a consolation. Opta stats Liverpool have won seven consecutive Premier League home games for the first time since January 2014. Crystal Palace are the first Premier League team to score more than once at Anfield since February 2018 when Tottenham drew 2-2 with Liverpool. Liverpool hit the 1000-goal mark in the Premier League at Anfield (1002 in total), only the third side to score 1000+ goals at a specific venue in the competition (Man Utd, 1094 at Old Trafford and Chelsea, 1005 at Stamford Bridge). Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni (39y 246d) became the oldest player to make a Premier League appearance this term, and the oldest to appear in the competition since Shay Given (40y 151d) vs Crystal Palace in September 2016. Courtesy of his assist for Andros Townsend's opener, Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha registered a goal involvement for the first time in his last 14 Premier League games. Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has scored his 50th Premier League goal in his 72nd appearance in the competition - only Andy Cole (65), Alan Shearer (66) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (68) have reached the milestone in fewer appearances. Since Jurgen Klopp took over at Liverpool in October 2015, Roberto Firmino has been directly involved in 69 Premier League goals, more than any other player for the Reds (45 goals, 24 assists). James Milner picked up his second red card for Liverpool in the Premier League, also being sent off against Crystal Palace in March 2016 after a foul on Wilfried Zaha. Liverpool's Sadio Mane has scored in his last four Premier League games against Crystal Palace, the first time he has netted four in a row against a single opponent in the competition. Man of the match - Jordan Henderson Salah might have scored twice, but it was Henderson who was the standout performer for Liverpool. The midfielder kept his side ticking over (making more passes in the opposition half than any other player and having more touches than any other player) while also playing a key defensive role. What's next? With no FA Cup game next weekend, Liverpool are heading on a warm weather training camp this week. Their next game is at home to Leicester on Wednesday, January 30. Palace host Tottenham in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday before going to Southampton in the Premier League on January 30."},{"date": "19/01/2019", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance":

seven under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with a 2-1 victory over Brighton in the Premier League at Old Trafford on Saturday. Paul Pogba continued his fine form as he won and converted a penalty for United's opener (23), before Marcus Rashford got his eighth goal in 10 games with a fine curling effort from an acute angle (42). Pascal Gross halved the deficit in the second half with a poked finish from eight yards (72), but United held on to maintain their 100 per cent record since Jose Mourinho left the club. Paul Pogba celebrates making it 1-0 Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Young (6), Lindelof (7), Jones (7), Dalot (6), Matic (7), Herrera (8), Pogba (7), Lingard (6), Martial (7), Rashford (8) Subs: Mata (6), Lukaku (NA), Darmian (NA) Brighton: Button (5), Montoya (5), Duffy (7), Dunk (6), Bong (5), March (6), Stephens (5), Propper (6), Gross (6), Locadia (5), Murray (6) Subs: Knockaert (6), Andone (5), Kayal (NA) Man of the match: Marcus Rashford The result means United are sixth, just three points off fourth-place Chelsea, while Brighton are in 13th. There was a minute's applause before kick-off for former United manager Sir Matt Busby, the day before the 25th anniversary of his death. Though Brighton caused some issues in United's penalty area with aerial balls, the hosts started on the front foot and went close as Rashford saw his effort from 12 yards cleared well by the head of Shane Duffy. Pogba's acrobatic effort was then deflected just wide, but he created and finished off the opener as he was sandwiched by Gaetan Bong and Solly March to earn United a penalty midway through the half. After a trademark slow run-up, Pogba found the right corner superbly beyond David Button. Team news Ole Gunnar Solskjaer went for the same side that beat Tottenham 1-0 at Wembley last week, with Bailly and Sanchez replacing McTominay and Fred on the bench. But just before kick-off Shaw was taken ill, replaced by Dalot at left-back. Brighton were also completely unchanged after their 1-0 defeat against Liverpool last Saturday. Paul Pogba celebrates his goal in the first half They should have had a second as Button saved superbly from Anthony Martial when one-on-one after Victor Lindelof's simple long ball over Martin Montoya, while at the other end Glenn Murray flashed a chance wide on the half volley inside the box. But it was soon 2-0 as Rashford got his fourth goal in four Premier League games, using neat skill to get away from Gross at an angle on the left of the box before curling a beauty into the far right corner on the stretch. United continued their dominance in the second half as Lingard stretched inches away from a fine Rashford ball six yards out, while Martial flashed just over the bar after slipping away from Gross on the edge of the box. Gross made for a nervy finish as he collected Davy Propper's lofted ball into the box to control well and poke beyond David de Gea, and though Brighton piled numbers into the box to find a leveller, United saw the game out for another vital win in their quest for the top four. Rashford now has eight in his last 10 United games The managers Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"I can't complain can I? I am just smiling and this is one of these things I will remember for the rest of my life. It's just been a month, it's been a rollercoaster and it's class to be here.\" 2:31 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Marcus Rashford is looking more assured and confident Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says Marcus Rashford is looking more assured and confident Chris Hughton: \"It's disappointment. When you come here you know you've got to stay in the game, and we've paid the price for a slow start and poor goals conceded.\" 2:38 Chris Hughton says his Brighton side paid for a slow start Chris Hughton says his Brighton side paid for a slow start Opta stats Solskjaer is the first manager in Man Utd's history to win his first six league games in charge of the club. Solskjaer is just the third manager in Premier League history to win his first six games in charge of a certain club, after Carlo Ancelotti with Chelsea and Pep Guardiola with Man City. Brighton have lost all nine of their Premier League away games against 'big six' sides by an aggregate score of 2-19. United have won more penalties (7) while Brighton have conceded more (also 7) than any other Premier League side this season. Paul Pogba's goal was his eighth in the Premier League for Man Utd this season, equalling his best return in a single season in the top five European leagues (also 8 with Juventus in 2014/15 and 2015/16). Man of the match - Marcus Rashford He's among several United players to have improved under Solskjaer, Rashford looked in complete command on Saturday. His goal was superb, a neat bit of skill to create a yard, and an unlikely finish from an angle, but his all-round running is pivotal for United's game. He never stops chasing those channels, allowing space in-behind him and in the middle of the final third for Pogba, Martial and Lingard to exploit. ⚽ Aged 21 years & 80 days, Marcus Rashford is the youngest Man Utd player to score in 4 successive PL appearances pic.twitter.com/yPdzWMiykJ — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) January 19, 2019 What's next?

proved the unlikely hero after his double moved Newcastle out of the relegation places with a 3-0 win over fellow strugglers Cardiff City. Starting the day in the drop zone, there was a feeling around St James' Park that this was a must-win encounter and Schar, who had never scored for the club, scored either side of the break (24 & 63) and Ayoze Perez added a late third (90+3). The victory was a timely boost for Rafa Benitez's team who had slipped down the table after a run of just one win in their last nine games. Meanwhile, this victory lifts them above Cardiff, who drop into the bottom three and are now two points from safety. Player Ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Schar (9), Yedlin (7), Lascelles (8), Lejeune (8), Ritchie (7), Hayden (7), Longstaff (7), Atsu (7), Perez (6), Rondon (7) Subs: Manquillo (6) Cardiff: Etheridge (6), Peltier (6), Bennett (6), Manga (6), Bamba (6), Mendez-Laing (6), Ralls (5), Camarasa (6), Hoilett (6), Niasse (5), Paterson (6) Subs: Reid (6), Ward (6), Murphy (6) Man of the match: Fabian Schar In front of owner Mike Ashley, who was back among a crowd of 49,864 at St James' Park for the first time since November 10, Newcastle looked nervy in the opening stages against a Cardiff team that had new signing Oumar Niasse in attack. Perez drew some noise from the crowd when Neil Etheridge tipped over his glancing header on 13 minutes. Team news Fabian Schar replaced Ciaran Clark for Newcastle while Sean Morison and Harry Arter were missing for Cardiff. With the game drifting, Schar gave the hosts the lead in spectacular fashion on 24 minutes. The defender decided to drive forward with the ball and Cardiff backed off. He strode into the box before steadying himself and side-footing expertly into the bottom corner. Cardiff threatened a fightback after the break but the Newcastle defence stood firm. It gave their attack a platform to build on and it was soon 2-0. Jamaal Lascelles rose to flick on Matt Ritchie's corner and Schar arrived to bundle the ball home for an unlikely double salvo. The hat-trick did not materialise, despite heading a presentable chance wide and Perez rubber-stamped the win at the death as he scored from close range after some clever play from Rondon. Man of the match: Fabian Schar His last goal came in 2017 when Deportivo drew 2-2 with Athletic Bilbao, so there was little expectation of him delivering a match-winning performance. But he did. The centre-back was outstanding at the heart of the Newcastle back-line, supported by Lascelles and Florian Lejeune, winning 10 aerial duels as Cardiff went direct. But his performance will be remembered for his two goals, the first especially, where he showed sublime attacking instinct to curl home with his left-foot. Fabian Schar scored twice as Newcastle beat Cardiff Opta stats Newcastle have won their last 10 home league games against Cardiff - only against Bolton have they had a longer run in their history (11 between 1898 and 1914). Newcastle scored three goals in a Premier League game for the first time this season, last doing so against Chelsea on the final day of the 2017-18 campaign. Cardiff have failed to score in a league-high 11 different Premier League games this season. Schär scored both of Newcastle's goals in this match, his first ever goals in the Premier League. He'd scored just three goals in his previous 65 appearances in the top five European leagues. Schär became the first defender to score twice in a Premier League for Newcastle since Philippe Albert against Man City in February 1996. Each of Ayoze Perez's last five Premier League goals for Newcastle have come at St James' Park. The managers Rafa Benitez: \"We could see from the first minute our team wanted to get three points against a rival. We did really well. Everyone has to be pleased. My message to the fans was to stay calm and support the team - the players did well and the fans enjoyed every minute.\" 1:58 Neil Warnock said he didn't think Cardiff deserved to lose 3-0 at Newcastle but that Salomon Rondon was the difference between the sides. Neil Warnock said he didn't think Cardiff deserved to lose 3-0 at Newcastle but that Salomon Rondon was the difference between the sides. Neil Warnock: \"I didn't think it was a 3-0 game.

We didn't have anything drop for us and they were better than us in the final third.\" 1:54 Rafael Benitez says Newcastle's players were full of confidence and the fans enjoyed every minute as they beat Cardiff 3-0 in the Premier League.

continued as James Ward-Prowse's strike and a Lucas Digne own goal handed the hosts a 2-1 victory over Everton on Saturday. Southampton took the lead in the 50th minute as Ward-Prowse scored in his second successive match, before Digne extended the hosts' advantage when his tackle on Nathan Redmond rolled into the net (64). Gylfi Sigurdsson pulled a goal back in the 90th minute with a cool finish to set up a nervy ending, but Marco Silva's side failed to find the all-important equaliser. Back-to-back Premier League victories for Southampton means they move up to 15th on 22 points. Everton, meanwhile, remain in 11th.

On the quarter-hour mark, Danny Ings met Ward-Prowse's near-post corner, but his flicked header was superbly batted away by Jordan Pickford's strong left arm. Southampton continued to apply the pressure and the Liverpool loanee came close again in the 26th minute when he latched onto a lofted ball from Jan Bednarek, but his half-volley from range was punched away by Pickford. As the hosts continually pushed for the game's opening goal, Redmond dragged his low shot off the post, after breaking into a one-on-one, seven minutes before Andre Gomes' tackle on Ings in the box saw the ball bounce off the woodwork again. Team news Danny Ings and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg came into the team for Shane Long and Stuart Armstrong. Marco Silva named the same team that beat Bournemouth 2-0 last Sunday. Hasenhuttl's side took the lead shortly after the break, despite Everton starting the second half strongly. Ward-Prowse picked a loose ball up 30 yards from goal before he unleashed a venomous strike which swerved past the helpless Pickford. Nathan Redmond challenges Ademola Lookman Southampton continued to push for a second goal and they got it in bizarre circumstances. Redmond was set through on goal by Ings and took a touch to try and glide past Digne. Unfortunately for the former Barcelona defender, his challenge saw the ball roll straight into the bottom corner. Dominic Calvert-Lewin almost pulled a goal back for the visitors five minutes from time, but he nodded his close-range header over the bar under pressure from Alex McCarthy and Bednarek. Sigurdsson, who had a mostly quiet game, slotted in a late goal following a scramble in the box, but Southampton held on for an important three points. Opta stats Southampton have won five of their last six home league games against Everton, losing only in August 2015 (0-3). Southampton have won more Premier League games under Ralph Hasenhuttl (4 in 8) than they did with Mark Hughes (3 in 22). Everton have lost four of their last five away games in the Premier League (W1). Southampton's James Ward-Prowse has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career. Everton's Gylfi Sigurdsson has ended on the losing side in four games in which he's scored in the Premier league this term, a league-high. Southampton have won two of their last four Premier League games at St. Mary's, as many as they'd won in their previous 20.

Ralph Hasenhuttl says it was his best game so far in charge of Southampton as they beat Everton 2-1. Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"It was the best game so far, defensively good, we gave two chances away but a lot of chances to score, it could have been four or five. It was a very deserved win for us. \"We played good football, we were good in transition and created a lot and we were very balanced so it was a complete team performance and with the right decisions in the right moments. 2:24 Marco Silva says Everton didn't show the same aggression on the pitch at Southampton who he felt deserved the three points. Marco Silva says Everton didn't show the same aggression on the pitch at Southampton who he felt deserved the three points. Marco Silva: \"To be honest they deserved the three points even if they scored a fantastic goal when we started the second half better. \"We had a big chance before them in the second half but they deserved it because they were more aggressive during the match.\" Man of the Match - James Ward-Prowse James Ward-Prowse (left) produced a fine display for Southampton Ward-Prowse produced another highly influential performance from central midfield as he continues to thrive under Hasenhuttl.

Wood stroked home after Ben Foster had palmed Dwight McNeil's shot from the edge of the area into his path, but the assistant referee's flag was straight up despite Jose Holebas appearing to play the striker onside. It was otherwise a game marked by fine performances from the two goalkeepers, with Burnley's Tom Heaton producing the save of the game inside the opening two minutes - standing tall to deny Gerard Deulofeu with his legs after the Spaniard had sprung clear of the visitors' defence. Team news Watford made three changes to the team that won 2-1 at Crystal Palace last time out, with Christian Kabasele, Tom Cleverley and Ken Sema coming in for Craig Cathcart (knee), Abdoulaye Doucoure (knee) and Will Hughes (head). Sean Dyche kept faith with the same XI that started the win over Fulham. Foster also did well to deny Jeff Hendrick midway through the second half, and the draw means Watford remain in seventh with 33 points from 23 games, while Burnley's run of three straight wins is ended and leaves them three points clear of the relegation zone. Watford started well, with Deeney setting Deulofeu clear for his early effort before James Tarkowski was forced to clear off the line from Ken Sema's stab towards goal. Ashley Barnes shoots wide from close range for Burnley But Burnley slowly warmed to their task, with Ashley Barnes heading Ashley Westwood's superb cross straight at Foster before somehow contriving to slice his shot wide after Adrian Mariappa's poor defensive header fell to him six yards out. Wood then fired into the side netting on the turn, yet as the home fans began to voice their displeasure they might have seen their side go into the break ahead - Deeney forcing Heaton into a smart save after meeting Kiko Femenia's cross with a sweet half-volley from 10 yards out. The second half was a hugely disappointing affair, although Phil Bardsley might have done better after being found in space following a lung-bursting inside run from right-back, while Foster was smartly off his line to deny Hendrick. Player ratings Watford: Foster (8), Mariappa (7), Femenia (7), Holebas (6), Cleverley (7), Sema (6), Kabasele (6), Capoue (7), Deulofeu (6), Pereyra (5), Deeney (7) Subs used: Success (7), Britos (6) Burnley: Heaton (8), Taylor (7), Cork (7), Tarkowski (7), Mee (7), Barnes (7), Wood (7), Hendrick (7), Westwood (7), Bardsley (7), McNeil (7) Subs used: None Man of the match: Tom Heaton Heaton then did well to improvise after Deeney's header squirmed goalwards off a flailing Tarkowski before diving low to his right to stop Tom Cleverley's fine volley from the edge of the area. And with a disjointed game meandering towards its conclusion, there was just time for Wood's late strike to be ruled out and deny the Clarets their fourth straight win. The managers Javi Gracia: \"We knew it would be a very demanding game and it was. We started well, created the first clear-cut chance but didn't take it and after that the game was very close with a lot challenges for second balls. When you can't win one point is positive.\" 1:50 Watford's Javi Gracia said they did not play well against Burnley but insisted there were positives from the match Watford's Javi Gracia said they did not play well against Burnley but insisted there were positives from the match Sean Dyche: \"Unfortunately a decision goes against us again. They are important moments and another two points would have been even more pleasing to take it to four wins on the trot. It's a tough one to accept today, because it was an important moment.\" 1:42 Burnley's Sean Dyche was not pleased by a goal being ruled out for offside in their goalless draw against Watford Burnley's Sean Dyche was not pleased by a goal being ruled out for offside in their goalless draw against Watford Opta stats Watford have lost just one of their last eight Premier League games (W3 D4). Burnley kept their first league clean sheet away to Watford in 10 matches. Burnley have gone four Premier League games unbeaten for the first time since a run of six ending in April 2018. This was just Burnley's second clean sheet in the Premier League in their last 11 away games in the competition. Man of the match - Tom Heaton Not much to choose between Heaton and his opposite number in the Watford goal Ben Foster, with the two old friends in fine form, but Heaton just nicks it because he had the harder saves to make. The first was the most difficult, as his right leg deflected Gerard Deulofeu's effort wide just two minutes in, but he also did well to keep out Tom Cleverley's volley and Troy Deeney's stinger. What's next? Both teams have two away games up next. Watford are at Newcastle in the FA Cup next week before travelling to Wembley to take on Spurs on January 30. Burnley travel to Manchester City in the FA Cup next Saturday before another trip to the city the following Tuesday to face United in the Premier League."},{"date": "19/01/2019", "arena": "Emirates

Chelsea Arsenal breathed new life into the race for the Premier League's top four with a 2-0 win over Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium. Before kick-off Unai Emery conceded this was a must-win game if Arsenal were to secure a top-four finish this season and they responded with a clinical display against their London rivals. Goals from Alexandre Lacazette (14) and Laurent Koscielny (39) handed the Gunners, who lost Hector Bellerin to a nasty looking injury in the second half, a victory which reduced the gap to fourth-placed Chelsea. Defeat now leaves Maurizio Sarri's side, who had just one shot on target at the Emirates, looking over their shoulders with the Gunners and Manchester United three points off fourth. Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (7), Bellerin (7), Sokratis (8), Koscielny (8), Kolasinac (8), Xhaka (7), Torreira (7), Guendouzi (7), Ramsey (8), Lacazette (8), Aubameyang (7). Subs: Iwobi (6), Maitland-Niles (7), Elneny (6). Away Team: Arrizabalaga (7), Azpilicueta (6), Rudiger (6), Luiz (6), Alonso (7), Jorginho (5), Kante (6), Kovacic (5), Willian (6), Hazard (6), Pedro (6). Subs: Giroud (5), Barkley (5), Hudson-Odoi (5) Man of the match: Laurent Koscielny Arsenal flew out of the traps and they took a deserved lead in the 14th minute, Lacazette producing some sharp footwork in the penalty area before finding the roof of the net with superb finish from a tight angle. The Gunners were given a warning when Pedro latched onto David Luiz's inch-perfect through ball, but the Spain winger's lofted effort over the onrushing Bernd Leno bounced agonisingly wide. It did not deter the hosts though, and they grabbed an important second six minutes from half-time when Koscielny beat the offside trap to bundle Sokratis Papastathopoulos' cross in off his shoulder for his first goal in 351 days. Arsenal's Alexandre Lacazette celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game Marcos Alonso headed against the post as Chelsea ended the half strongly,but Arsenal held on to go in ahead - just the third time Emery's side have managed to do so in the league this season. After the break Pedro fired over and Alonso wide as Chelsea continued to create chances but Leno remained untested as the game entered the final 30 minutes. Sarri turned to Ross Barkley, and then former Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud, in search of a lifeline but their problems in front of goal continued. Team news Mesut Ozil was named in Unai Emery’s squad but he only started on the bench. Elsewhere, Emery made three changes from the side that lost 1-0 at West Ham. Aaron Ramsey, Lucas Torreira and Hector Bellerin returned with Alex Iwobi, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Shkodran Mustafi all dropping down to the bench. Maurizio Sarri stuck with the same side that beat Newcastle 2-1 last time out in the Premier League. Eden Hazard once again started as the central striker with former Arsenal player Olivier Giroud named on the bench. The only down side of the evening for Arsenal was Bellerin's injury. Starting for the first time since a calf injury, the Spain full-back was carried off on a stretcher having gone down holding his knee. Mohamed Elneny replaced the full-back as Arsenal's final change after Emery had introduced Alex Iwobi and Ainsley Maitland-Niles. Chelsea pushed further forward in the hope of a spectacular comeback but it never materialised as Arsenal returned to winning ways. Opta stats Arsenal have won consecutive home games against Chelsea in all competitions for the first time since February 2004. Chelsea have only won one of their last seven away London derbies in the Premier League (D2 L4), winning 1-0 at Crystal Palace in December. Arsenal are unbeaten in 13 Premier League London derby matches at home (W10 D3), winning the last six in a row. Arsenal have won more points in seven games against 'big six' sides this season (8) than they did in the whole of the 2017-18 campaign (6). Chelsea's first shot on target didn't come until the 82nd minute, from Marcos Alonso. 63% of Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette's Premier League goals this season have come in London derbies (5/8). Only Arsenal teammate Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (6) has scored more Premier League London derby goals this season than Alexandre Lacazette. The managers Unai Emery: \"Today, every circumstance came with us. The mentality was good. And we want to have the same mentality today at home and away - which we haven't yet.\" Maurizio Sarri: \"I have to say that I'm extremely angry, very angry indeed, because this defeat was due to our mentality more than anything else. We played against a team that was mentally far more determined that we were, and this is something I can't accept. 2:14 Maurizio Sarri launched a stinging attack on his players after Chelsea’s loss to Arsenal, accusing them of a lack of fight before suggesting they are a difficult group to motivate. Maurizio Sarri launched a stinging attack on his players after Chelsea’s loss to Arsenal, accusing them of a lack of fight before suggesting they are a difficult group to motivate. \"We had a similar issue in the league game at Tottenham. We spoke a great deal about that particular loss and our approach at the time. I spoke to the players, I thought that we had managed to overcome the issue. It seems to me that have an issue with having a sufficient amount of determination and being mentally solid. I'm not happy at all because I prefer to come into the press room and into the changing room to talk about the tactics and why we lost from a strategy point of view, but the fact of the matter is that it would appear that this group of players is extremely difficult to motivate.\" Man of the Match - Laurent Koscielny Coming into the game, Kosicelny was still searching for his best from following a seven month lay-off with an Achilles injury. There would have been doubts about whether he could rediscover top form but he dispelled all of those with a vintage display against Chelsea. Koscielny scored his first goal since last February His positional play was excellent. He was always in the right place at the right time and he put his body on the line for the Gunners. He also grabbed a crucial goal, becoming the first Arsenal defender to score 20 Premier League goals. The Frenchman has scored in each of his nine campaigns in the competition - only Dennis Bergkamp (11), Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott (10 each) have scored in more for the Gunners. What's next? Up next for Arsenal is an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Manchester United at the Emirates (7.55pm). They return to Premier League action on Tuesday January 29 when Cardiff are the visitors to north London (7.45pm). Chelsea will be hoping to bounce back when they take on Tottenham in the League Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge, live on Sky Sports on Thursday (7.45pm)."},{"date": "14/01/2019", "arena":

Jesus hammered home City's numerical advantage with his second from the penalty spot six minutes before half-time, before a Conor Coady own-goal 12 minutes from time compounded Wolves' misery. City's fifth consecutive victory in all competitions sees them remain on the coattails of leaders Liverpool, while Wolves stay 11th, a point off the top half. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (6), Danilo (6), Stones (7), Laporte (7), Fernandinho (7), B. Silva (7), D. Silva (6), Sterling (6), Sane (7), Jesus (8). Subs: De Bruyne (6), Gundogan (5), Aguero (5). Wolves: Patricio (7), Doherty (5), Jonny (6), Bennett (5), Boly (4), Coady (5), Neves (6), Moutinho (6), Dendoncker (6), Jota (6), Jimenez (6). Subs: Gibbs-White (5), Saiss (5), Traore (6). Man of the Match: Gabriel Jesus. It took just 10 minutes for City to break the deadlock. A brilliant deep pass from Aymeric Laporte freed Leroy Sane down the left, and he put the opener on a plate for Jesus, who scored for the third game running. Gabriel Jesus has scored 12 goals in his last eight appearances for Man City in all competitions at the Etihad Stadium. Rui Patricio tipped a deflected David Silva shot over on 16 minutes, but Wolves' hopes of getting back into the game suffered a blow three minutes later when Boly received a straight red card for a challenge on Bernardo Silva. The centre-back made contact with the ball before catching the Portuguese's ankle, but referee Craig Pawson showed no hesitation brandishing the red. Willy Boly was sent off for this tackle on Bernardo Silva in the first half The 10 men of Wolves came within inches of finding an unlikely equaliser on 36 minutes when Raul Jimenez released Jonny down the left, but the full-back's cross-come-shot evaded Diogo Jota. A penalty three minutes later, awarded after Ryan Bennett's challenge on Raheem Sterling, handed Jesus the chance to double his and City's tally, and the Brazilian made no mistake, sending Patricio the wrong way from 12 yards. Ryan Bennett's challenge on Raheem Sterling handed City a penalty late in the first half Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo brought Adama Traore on at half-time. Pep Guardiola responded by introducing Kevin de Bruyne, and the Belgium international nearly added a third for City was a rasping drive on 67 minutes. Two minutes later, Sane slipped Sterling through on goal, but Patricio raced off his line to smother the England international. The Wolves goalkeeper was then on hand to tip De Bruyne's fierce near-post drive behind 13 minutes from time. Team news City made two changes from their last PL outing against Liverpool as Gabriel Jesus and Kyle Walker replaced Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany. Nuno Espirito Santo made three changes to the Wolves line-up as Ruben Neves, Diogo Jota and Leander Dendoncker returned. But from the resulting corner, Patricio was beaten for a third time as De Bruyne's teasing cross cannoned in off Coady to confirm a victory that keeps City breathing down Liverpool's necks. The managers 3:30 Pep Guardiola felt his side lacked a little intensity in their win over Wolves, but said it's understandable given the number of games they've had to play recently. Pep Guardiola felt his side lacked a little intensity in their win over Wolves, but said it's understandable given the number of games they've had to play recently. Pep Guardiola: \"We were solid and didn't give away many chances so it is three points to keep the pressure on the team at the top of the table. Most teams come here and defend deep and it is not easy, but we did it well and we got a third to take us closer to Liverpool.\" 2:45 Nuno Espirito Santo admits it was a tough night, but praised his players' character and fight after succumbing to a 3-0 defeat to Man City in the Premier League. Nuno Espirito Santo admits it was a tough night, but praised his players' character and fight after succumbing to a 3-0 defeat to Man City in the Premier League. Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It was a very tough night. When we conceded the goal the game became very difficult, the red card and all these things. There was a moment where we tried but it became very hard. Playing against 11 is tough, with a man less it's harder.\" Opta stats Manchester City have lost just one of their last 15 Premier League games at the Etihad (W13 D1 L1), a 2-3 defeat against Crystal Palace in December. Manchester City have lost none of the 20 Premier League games in which Gabriel Jesus has scored (W19 D1), winning each of the last 17. Since the start of last season, Man City's Leroy Sane has provided 23 Premier League assists, five more than any other player in that period. David Silva made his 267th Premier League appearance for Manchester City, overtaking Joe Hart (266) as City's all-time leading appearance maker in the competition. Willy Boly is the first Wolves player to be sent off in a Premier League game since Sebastien Bassong versus Arsenal in April 2012. Wolves failed to land a single shot on target in a Premier League game for the first time since May 2012 against Everton. Man of the Match - Gabriel Jesus The Brazilian has made a breath-taking start to 2019 and showed Wolves no mercy as his blistering form in front of goal continued. Jesus was in the right place to dispatch City's opener with just 10 minutes on the close and showed great composure to double his tally from the penalty spot. It means Jesus now has more goals than Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool after taking his tally to seven in just three games this calendar year. What's next? Manchester City now go to Huddersfield on Renault Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League at 1.30pm, while Wolves host Leicester on Saturday at 12.30pm, live on Sky Sports Premier

Bournemouth Kurt Zouma's first goal for Everton helped secure a much-needed 2-0 win over Bournemouth on Sunday. In the week that Everton owner Farhad Moshiri described the club's Premier League position as \"just not good enough\", Zouma's 61st-minute header lifted the mood at Goodison Park before Dominic Calvert-Lewin made sure of victory in injury-time. Bournemouth had started the game brightly and hit the post in the 13th minute through David Brooks. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Coleman (6), Zouma (8), Keane (7), Digne (8), Gueye (7), Gomes (4), Sigurdsson (6), Lookman (7), Bernard (6), Richarlison (6) Subs: Walcott (5), Mina (5), Calvert-Lewin (6) Bournemouth: Begovic (5), Smith (5), Cook (5), Ake (6), Clyne (6), Gosling (6), Lerma (5), Brooks (6), Fraser (5), Stanislas (5), King (5) Subs: Mousset (5), Ibe (5) Man of the match: Lucas Digne However, the Cherries' threat diminished as the game wore on and they have now lost nine of their last 12 Premier League matches. Everton move up to 10th in the table after recovering from a poor opening 30 minutes to win only their second league game since the start of December. Bournemouth were bright in the early stages as Joshua King was denied at close range and then Brooks rolled a shot against the post after being played through by Junior Stanislas. Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored a late second goal for Everton Everton struggled to get into the game, with every misplaced pass and defensive lapse adding to the growing frustration among the home fans. Jordan Pickford pushed away a free-kick from Stanislas in the 26th minute, before Everton finally showed some signs of improvement. Ademola Lookman controls the ball Bernard headed over from Ademola Lookman's cross and Michael Keane flicked a header against the bar late in the half. Everton were more threatening after the break as Richarlison saw a shot blocked right on the line by Nathan Ake. Zouma then broke the deadlock in the 61st minute when he headed in from Lucas Digne's cross. Team news Everton made three changes from their last Premier League game as Bernard, Coleman and Lookman replaced Walcott, Kenny and Calvert-Lewin. Smith returned from injury to start at full-back for Bournemouth while January signing Clyne made his first Premier League start for the club and Wilson missed out with injury. Richarlison twice missed the target during a feisty finish to the match, while King spurned Bournemouth's best chance when he fired wide from just inside the box. Substitute Calvert-Lewin made sure of victory with a neat low finish in injury-time. Opta stats Everton have now won all six of their competitive home matches against Bournemouth, including all four in the Premier League. Bournemouth have conceded 103 goals in the Premier League since the start of 2017/18; two more than any other team in that period (West Ham on 100). Kurt Zouma was the 139th different player to score a goal for Everton in the Premier League, only West Ham (147), Tottenham (146) and Newcastle (141) have seen more players net for them in the competition. Kurt Zouma's goal for Everton was his third in the Premier League and his first since November 2017 for Stoke City. All three of his goals have come from headers inside the box. Everton's Lucas Digne has had six goal involvements this season (three goals, three assists), equaling his best ever tally in a top-flight campaign (also six for Roma in 2015-16). Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season for Everton, equaling his best-ever tally in a top-flight league campaign (four in 2017-18). After scoring six goals in his first nine Premier League appearances for Everton, Richarlison has scored just three goals in his last 11 games in the competition. Man of the match - Lucas Digne Zouma might have got the crucial first goal, but Digne provided the assist and was also impressive down the left side. He had the most touches in the match (72), made the most sprints (23) and created two chances. What's next? Everton are on the road for their next three matches. They go to Southampton and Huddersfield in the league (January 19 and 29) either side of an FA Cup clash with Millwall on January 26.

string of superb saves as Manchester United held on to beat Tottenham 1-0 and secure a sixth win in a row for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Marcus Rashford scored the winner late in the first half but Solskjaer was indebted to De Gea, who made no less than 11 saves to withstand a second-half Spurs barrage to seal the historic victory for the United interim manager. The sixth straight win victory sees Solskjaer confirm the best start of any manager in Manchester United's history, and sees him equal Sir Matt Busby's five wins in his first five league games. United move level with fifth-placed Arsenal as a result, and to within six points of the top four. Spurs remain third, nine points off Liverpool after suffering a huge dent in their title aspirations.

Subs: Lukaku (5), Dalot (n/a), McTominay (n/a) Man of the Match: David de Gea It was billed as Solskjaer's toughest assignment to date but there was no change in philosophy from the United interim boss in a first half full of attacking flare. Spurs registered the first attempt on goal inside nine minutes when Harry Winks dragged a shot wide after good hold-up play from Heung-Min Son, but that was where the script ended as United asserted themselves. Ander Herrera brilliantly controlled a Pogba diagonal pass, whipped a peach of a cross into the area which was flicked onto Jesse Lingard at the back post, but the England international blazed over. A minute later a rapid counter involving Pogba and Anthony Martial presented Rashford which a sight of goal but, having opted not to square for Lingard, he could not generate enough power on his left foot to beat Hugo Lloris. Marcus Rashford capped an impressive attacking display in the first half from Man Utd Pogba continued to pull the strings in midfield as he won back possession on halfway on 18 minutes and released Martial, who weaved his way into the area before drawing Lloris into action at his near post. Harry Kane led the Spurs response, bringing a corner under control on 25 minutes, only for his shot to be blocked by Phil Jones, before the Spurs skipper had his close-range tap-in ruled out for offside on the half-hour. Spurs lost Moussa Sissoko to injury just before half-time and United applied further salt to the wound as a raking Pogba pass played Rashford in behind, and he superbly rifled the opener into the far corner in the final minute of the half. Team news Hugo Lloris, Jan Vertonghen and Ben Davies returned as Spurs made three changes following their midweek Carabao Cup win over Chelsea. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made two changes from the win at Newcastle as Ashley Young and Jesse Lingard replaced Antonio Valencia and Juan Mata in the Man Utd starting line-up. Spurs laid siege to the United goal after the interval but came across an inspired De Gea. Kane fired a low drive at the feet of the United goalkeeper within minutes of the restart, before Alli saw a header clawed off the line by the Spaniard at full stretch. Lloris then denied compatriot Pogba from doubling United's lead with a towering header before tipping his lofted shot onto the roof of the net before the hour mark. De Gea pulled off 11 saves to thwart Spurs' second half fightback Kane headed a corner straight at De Gea while under pressure from Jones on 59 minutes, before the Spurs striker and Erik Lamela transpired to waste another opportunity, after Kieran Trippier's cross from the right. But the best was yet to come from De Gea. Alli was denied at the end of a counter before Toby Alderweireld's deft near-post flick from a corner was superbly kept out. Alli and Kane continued to pepper the United goal to no avail as the impenetrable De Gea sealed the victory. Opta stats Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has equalled Matt Busby's all-time record of winning his first five league games in charge of Manchester United. Tottenham have lost consecutive home Premier League games for the first time since May 2015. Tottenham have lost four home league games this season - double the amount they'd lost at home in their previous two Premier League campaigns combined (2). Manchester United have kept back-to-back clean sheets in the Premier League - they'd only kept two in their first 20 league matches this season. Man Utd's Marcus Rashford has scored in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time in his career. Paul Pogba has been directly involved in 53% of Man Utd's 15 Premier League goals since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took charge (4 goals, 4 assists). David de Gea made 11 saves in this match for Man Utd - only against Arsenal in December 2017 has he ever made more in a Premier League match (14). This was the most saves he's made in a top five European league game while also keeping a clean sheet. Tottenham's Harry Kane had seven shots in this match - he last had more without finding the net in a Premier League game in January 2018 (8 vs Man Utd).

Mauricio Pochettino says his side were fantastic, but it can be an unfair game sometimes as Tottenham fell to defeat to Manchester United in the Premier League. Mauricio Pochettino: \"I am so pleased and I'm proud. After four-and-a-half-years, the second half was the best performance I have seen Tottenham play. It was amazing and I think David de Gea made 11 saves which is unbelievable. In football, sometimes you deserve to win and don't and other times, you do not and you win. We were not clinical and sometimes you score with less opportunities but it is nothing to complain about. 3:23 Ole Gunnar Solksjaer says his Manchester United side showed they are ready to compete after a big win over Tottenham in the Premier League. Ole Gunnar Solksjaer says his Manchester United side showed they are ready to compete after a big win over Tottenham in the Premier League. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"Results wise, to come away here and beat Tottenham is fantastic. We hung on in the second half and we never got to grips with it when they changed the system, but you are allowed to have a good goalkeeper. Obviously when you make 11 saves it is a top performance, but even so, two of them were top saves but the rest you would expect David to make. We defended well as a team. It was just a complete team performance.\" Man of the Match - David de Gea David De Gea made a number of brilliant saves with his legs to deny Tottenham It's been a while since we've seen a performance like that from David de Gea. To be honest, he hasn't had much to do recently, but this exemplary display of goalkeeping was a timely reminder of his unrivalled quality.

Highlights from West Ham's 1-0 win over Arsenal in the Premier League. Declan Rice scored the only goal as West Ham beat Arsenal, while Marko Arnautovic appeared to bid farewell to the London Stadium. Rice picked a good time to grab his first West Ham goal, powering the ball beyond Bernd Leno from 12 yards three minutes after half-time in a game of few clear-cut chances. The main talking point came when Arnautovic seemed to wave goodbye to the home fans when he was substituted with 71 minutes played, days after West Ham rejected a £35m bid for the Austrian from an unnamed Chinese club. Player ratings Home Team: Fabianski (7), Zabaleta (7), Ogbonna (7), Diop (7), Cresswell (7), Noble (6), Rice (8), Antonio (6), Nasri (7), Anderson (6), Arnautovic (7). Subs: Carroll (6), Snodgrass (6), Obiang (n/a) Arsenal: Leno (6), Mustafi (6), Sokratis (6), Koscielny (6), Maitland-Niles (5), Xhaka (5), Guendouzi (6), Kolasinac (5), Iwobi (5), Lacazette (6), Aubameyang (6). Subs: Ramsey (5), Torreira (6), Bellerin (5) Man of the match: Declan Rice Arsenal managed just two shots on target across the whole 90 minutes as their wretched away form continued, leaving them with one win on their travels in their last seven Premier League games. Unai Emery's side had shown the greater intent before half-time but lacked the invention to regularly find a way through the home defence, with Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang onlookers for long spells of the first half. Arnautovic appeared to wave goodbye to the home fans when he was substituted Both sides exchanged cursory efforts early on but Arsenal did carve out the first real opportunity when Lacazette held off Pablo Zabaleta and powered into the box. Lukasz Fabianski saved his first effort from 12 yards, and he skied the rebound over. Emery has lost back-to-back away games for the first time as Arsenal boss But with the restored Arnautovic looking untroubled by the speculation around him at the tip of West Ham's attack, the hosts always had a focal point they could play off and he held the ball up for Samir Nasri, only for the Frenchman to strike the side netting from a tight angle. Felipe Anderson also came close when Nasri waited for his run and laid the ball into his path 25 yards out, before Matteo Guendouzi rounded off an even, but uninspiring first half by going close from a similar distance. Team news West Ham made five changes from their FA Cup win over Birmingham, including a return for Marko Arnautovic and a Premier League return for Samir Nasri. Unai Emery reverted to the Arsenal line-up which beat Fulham in their last league game, with Ainsley Maitland-Niles on the right of midfield in a 3-4-3. The second half sprang into life within five minutes of the restart with Nasri, who had been busy before half-time, teeing up Rice after a poor Granit Xhaka header to blast the ball beyond a rooted Leno from 12 yards. Aubameyang was put off his stride by Aaron Cresswell's sliding challenge in the box and Alex Iwobi just missed the far post when played in on the left as Arsenal pressed, but they still did not work Fabianski enough. The arrival of Aaron Ramsey and Lucas Torreira and even the pace of Hector Bellerin off the bench failed to ignite the Gunners' usual second-half charge, which has seen them pick up eight points in the last 10 minutes of games alone, as the hosts saw out a first victory over Arsenal on home soil since 2006. Opta facts West Ham registered only their third home Premier League win against Arsenal and their first since November 2006, ending a run of 10 home games without victory against the Gunners (D3 L7). Arsenal have taken just two points from their last five away Premier League games (W0 D2 L3) - they won 13 in the five away games prior to this run (W4 D1 L0). Declan Rice became the 10th teenager to score a Premier League goal for West Ham, and the first since Junior Stanislas in November 2009. Samir Nasri played his first Premier League game for West Ham and registered his first assist in the competition since April 2016, when he assisted Sergio Aguero for Man City against Chelsea. Arsenal are one of three Premier League teams yet to lead at half-time in an away Premier League match this season, along with Burnley and Cardiff City. Arsenal have won just three of their last 15 away Premier League London derbies (W3 D5 L7). Manuel Pellegrini remains unbeaten in home matches against Unai Emery in all competitions during his managerial career (P7 W5 D2 L0). West Ham have won six of their last nine Premier League games (D1 L2) - their previous six wins came over a period of 24 matches. The managers 4:08 Manuel Pellegrini says he will wait and see what happens with Marko Arnautovic but insists they must do what is right for the club. Manuel Pellegrini says he will wait and see what happens with Marko Arnautovic but insists they must do what is right for the club. Manuel Pellegrini: \"I was pleased with the balance and consistence of the team. We did not allow Arsenal any chances despite their quality of players.

Unai Emery says his since created more chances but were not clinical enough in their Premier League defeat to West Ham. Unai Emery: \"It's a bad results for us. It's concerning because we need to be competitive at home and away. At home we feel good but away we are not getting the results we want. Today we had to do more to impose our ideas. If we could have been more competitive with more quality we could have done better.\" Man of the match - Declan Rice Besides scoring the winner, Rice did a brilliant job anchoring the West Ham midfield, often doing the legwork of both himself and Mark Noble, who struggled to keep up with the pace of the game on the few occasions Arsenal got going. Rice celebrated his goal passionately with his team-mates He won the ball back more times (10) than anyone else on the pitch, but he never shied away from the ball either, scoring the only goal of the game and of his team-mates only Noble and Anderson had more touches over the 90 minutes. \"I'm trying to think of a defensive midfielder in the Premier League who does it better than him,\" said Sky Sports guest and West Ham midfielder Jack Wilshere. \"I'm not saying he's the best in the league because he's got a long way to go, but he's on the right track. His reading of the game, his maturity and today I saw a bit more - he wanted to go forward more and he can bring that to his game.\" What's next?

Mohamed Salah's penalty earned Liverpool a gritty 1-0 win at Brighton that moved them seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. Having lost their previous two matches in 2019, the Reds were frustrated in a tight first half at the Amex Stadium. However, Salah scored the winner from the penalty spot in the 50th minute after he was clumsily fouled by Pascal Gross. Player ratings Brighton: Button (6), Montoya (5), Dunk (6), Duffy (6), Bong (5), Stephens (5), Propper (6), March (5), Gross (5), Locadia (6), Murray (5) Subs: Andone (5), Knockaert (5), Kayal (5) Liverpool: Alisson (6), Robertson (7), Van Dijk (7), Fabinho (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Henderson (7), Wijnaldum (7), Shaqiri (6), Mane (6), Salah (7), Firmino (6) Subs: Milner (6), Keita (5), Origi (5) Man of the match: Fabinho Brighton did not manage a shot on target and Liverpool will now wait and see if title-rivals Tottenham and Manchester City can close the gap when they play live on Sky Sports on Sunday and Monday respectively. Jurgen Klopp had said before the match that Liverpool's situation remained \"very positive\" even though they had suffered back-to-back defeats for the first time this season. And even though it took them a while to break down Brighton, a third straight defeat never looked on the cards. Salah puts Liverpool ahead from the penalty spot The Premier League leaders soon asserted control of the game as Roberto Firmino slid and poked wide from Andy Robertson's low cross in the ninth minute before Xherdan Shaqiri flicked a header wide after a cross from Trent Alexander-Arnold, who played despite suffering a slight injury in the warm-ups. Fabinho, playing at centre-back, was hardly tested, aside from a header that Glenn Murray nodded over the bar. Mohamed Salah and Gaetan Bong battle for possession It was a similar story in the second half, albeit Brighton were chasing the game after Gross clumsily fouled Salah in the box and the Premier League's joint-top scorer fired the penalty past David Button. Brighton occasionally threatened on the break but Fabinho blocked a shot from Gross in the box and Alisson tipped away a shot from Jurgen Locadia. Team news Brighton made one change from their last Premier League game as Bong replaced Bernardo. Fabinho started at centre-back for Liverpool and Shaqiri made the XI ahead of Milner. Mane made his 100th Premier League appearance for the club. Otherwise Liverpool remained in control until the final whistle, even though Salah spurned a fantastic chance to make it 2-0 when he shot wide from eight yards out in the 88th minute. Opta stats Liverpool have 57 points from 22 Premier League games this season; in English top-flight history, only Preston (58 in 1888-89), Tottenham (59 in 1960-61), Chelsea (61 in 2005-06) and Manchester City (62 in 2017-18) have ever had more at this stage when adjusting to three points for a win. Liverpool have conceded just 10 goals in their 22 league matches this season; only Chelsea in 2004-05 (eight goals) have ever conceded fewer after 22 matches in an English top-flight season. Brighton manager Chris Hughton has lost more league games to Liverpool in his managerial career (seven defeats from seven meetings) than any other side. His sides have conceded 26 goals across those seven games. This was Liverpool's 50th clean sheet in the Premier League under Jurgen Klopp in their 128th match with the German in charge since his first in October 2015; 42% of those have come since Virgil van Dijk's league debut in January 2018 (21 in 37 games since). Brighton have now lost as many games at the Amex Stadium in all competitions this season (four of 12) as they did in the entirety of 2017-18 on home soil (four of 22 matches). Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has scored the opening goal in nine Premier League games this season, at least three more than any other player. Of the last 10 Premier League penalties taken by left-footed players, six have failed to score - the other four have all been scored by Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. The managers Chris Hughton: \"There's no intent and referees have a hard job, but sometimes you feel things go your way and sometimes you feel some of the decisions don't go your way. I felt today it was one of those days. No malice or anything towards the referee but I thought the bulk of decisions favoured Liverpool today.\" 2:10 Chris Hughton felt the bulk of decisions 'favoured Liverpool' Chris Hughton felt the bulk of decisions 'favoured Liverpool' Jurgen Klopp: \"I thought it was an unbelievable mature performance from my side, I really like that because it's really a new skill and we have to keep that.

Sean Dyche's side registered their third Premier League win in a row. Andre Schurrle broke the deadlock after two minutes with a brilliant half-volley, but Burnley levelled through a Joe Bryan own goal which deflected off his left leg (20). Andre Schurrle's screamer put Fulham in front Two minutes later and Fulham fired into their own net again as Denis Odoi headed past his team-mate Sergio Rico with what proved to be the decisive goal, despite Fulham's efforts to rally back in the second half of a game where Burnley failed to register a shot on target. Burnley's third successive Premier League win means they move further away from the relegation zone into 15th. Fulham, meanwhile, are five points off safety in 19th as the pressure continues to mount on Claudio Ranieri. Player ratings Burnley: Heaton (6), Bardsley (6), Mee (6), Tarkowski (7), Taylor (6), Hendrick (8), Westwood (6), Cork (6), McNeil (7), Barnes (7), Wood (7) Subs: Vokes (N/A) Fulham: Rico (6), Christie (6), Odoi (6), Ream (6), Bryan (6), Le Marchand (5), Seri (5), Chambers (6), R Sessegnon (5), Schurrle (6), Mitrovic (5) Subs: Vietto (7), Cairney (7), Kebano (6) Man of the match: Jeff Hendrick Fulham got off to a fast start with Schurrle putting the visitors in front after two minutes with a goal of the season contender. He took down Odoi's pinpoint long ball in the penalty box before smashing his brilliant dipping half-volley past Tom Heaton in off the crossbar. Joe Bryan deflected Hendrick's cross into his own net Chris Wood threatened an equaliser when his header came off the bar in the 18th minute, and Sean Dyche's side did go on to level moments later. A driven cross from Jeff Hendrick ricocheted off Ryan Sessegnon before deflecting off the unfortunate Bryan into the net. And it got even worse for Fulham when Odoi nodded in another Hendrick cross in the 23rd minute. Ranieri's men almost instantly responded with two good chances as Calum Chambers directed a bullet header off the woodwork before Sessegnon nodded his free effort narrowly over. Team news Johann Gudmundsson was not in the squad and was replaced by Jeff Hendrick in the starting XI. Calum Chambers and Jean-Michael Seri came in for Tom Cairney and Ibrahima Cisse. Luciano Vietto was introduced for Sessegnon at half-time and he so nearly had Fulham level. His low shot got the better of Heaton but it was spectacularly cleared off the line by James Tarkowski. In a less eventful second half at a wet and windy Turf Moor, Fulham came closest to equalising with twenty minutes left. A dangerous ball into the box from Vietto took a wicked deflection off Charlie Taylor, who nearly turned the ball in, but it drifted narrowly wide of Rico's right post. Fulham continued to put the pressure on with Vietto driving a vicious strike on goal in the 75th minute, but the shot was well parried by Heaton as the hosts held on for a valuable victory. Opta stats Burnley's Hendrick (centre) crossed in for his side's equaliser Burnley have collected nine points from their last three Premier League games (P3 W3 D0 L0), one more than they managed from their previous 13 matches in the competition (P13 W2 D2 L9). Fulham's 14 points after their opening 22 matches is their lowest-ever tally at this stage of a season in the club's history (converting three points/win). Burnley have become the first Premier League side to score at least two goals in a match without having a single shot on target since the start of the 2003/04 campaign. Fulham are the first side to score at least two own-goals in the first half of a Premier League match since Everton did so against Southampton back in April 2014. Fulham, who are yet to win away (P12 W0 D2 L10), are the first side in the Premier League to fail to win any of their opening 12 opening matches on the road in the competition since both Leicester (13) and Burnley (17) during the 2016-17 campaign. Since August 2003, Burnley have become just the fifth team in the Premier League to win a match in the competition without registering a single shot on target after Crystal Palace, Watford, Sunderland and Middlesbrough. André Schürrle's opener against Burnley (01:49) is the quickest goal by a Fulham player in the Premier League since Clint Dempsey scored netted against Norwich City back in March 2012 (01:46). The managers 1:57 Burnley's Sean Dyche says James Tarkowski's defending won them the game as they beat Fulham 2-1 at Turf Moor. Burnley's Sean Dyche says James Tarkowski's defending won them the game as they beat Fulham 2-1 at Turf Moor. Sean Dyche: \"It was really tough conditions today for both teams. We both tried to handle it. I thought the game was probably summed up from our point of view with a fine bit of defending from James Tarkowski. \"He put in a fantastic block on the line and it reminds ourselves of some of the good qualities we have. I mean that sincerely. \"It's not just about the players and the ability but it's about the detail and I thought that was a tremendous bit of defending. That's worth a goal for me and in the end that wins us the match.\" 1:13 Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri thought his side deserved more from their match at Burnley after the home side scored two own goals to win the game. Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri thought his side deserved more from their match at Burnley after the home side scored two own goals to win the game. Claudio Ranieri: \"It's unbelievable - football is fantastic. I think we deserved more than the draw but as for the football we scored early and played well. \"They had three chances and scored two own goals. It's unbelievable. We can draw the match in the first half but we hit the crossbar. \"In the second half they save on the line. It's a bad moment but we are alive. We never give up. We continue to fight.\" Man of the Match - Jeff Hendrick Hendrick celebrates as his cross is deflected into the Fulham goal by Joe Bryan Hendrick put in a composed performance on the right flank of Burnley's midfield and was responsible for causing both of Fulham's own goals. On both occasions, he was the player responsible for breaking open the Fulham defence and played in two dangerous crosses which Bryan and Odoi found themselves turning into their own net. What's next? Burnley travel to Hertfordshire to take on Watford on January 19. Fulham, meanwhile, host London rivals Tottenham on Super Sunday."},{"date": "12/01/2019", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 30725, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup":

ended an eight-game Premier League losing streak but were denied a second-half penalty in a dour 0-0 draw with Cardiff City. Referee Lee Mason initially awarded the Terriers a spot-kick in the second half when Cardiff defender Joe Bennett was adjudged to have brought down Florent Hadergjonaj inside the penalty box, but the decision was overturned after Mason consulted his assistant. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (7), Bennett (6), Morrison (7), Manga (6), Bamba (7), Arter (5), Gunnarsson (6), Mendez-Laing (7), Camarasa (5), Hoilett (7), Paterson (6). Subs: Ralls (5), Healey (5). Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Hogg (6), Jorgensen (6), Schindler (5), Hadergjonaj (6), Durm (7), Billing (6), Puncheon (7), Pritchard (7), Kachunga (6), Mounie (6). Subs: Mbenza (5), Depoitre (6). Man of the match: Sol Bamba. Laurent Depoitre was then denied by a fine Neil Etheridge save in stoppage-time but neither side produced enough quality to win a tense contest at the Cardiff City Stadium. Neil Warnock was made to wait for his 50th win in charge of the Bluebirds with his side dropping to 17th in the division, while the point means bottom-side Huddersfield remain eight points adrift of safety. The reverse fixture finished 0-0 at the John Smith's Stadium in August and both sides again showed their lack of cutting edge in a poor opening 45 minutes. Mason was far busier than either goalkeeper as his decision to yellow card Christopher Schindler for a cynical foul on Nathaniel Mendez-Laing left Warnock calling for a red. Jonas Lossl saves at the feet of Junior Hoilett during a rare Cardiff attack on Saturday Team news Victor Camarasa managed to shake off a knock to retain his place in the side from Cardiff's last Premier League outing against Tottenham. Greg Cunningham dropped to the bench as Joe Bennett returned in defence in one of three changes. Josh Murphy and Bobby Reid also made way in place of Nathaniel Mendez-Laing and Junior Hoilett. There was no Terence Kongolo for Huddersfield as Wagner recalled Erik Durm to his side following the 2-1 defeat by Burnley. Isaac Mbenza was absent from the 18-man squad as Jason Puncheon made his Premier League debut for the Terriers. Cardiff remain the only Premier League side yet to lead at half-time in a match this season, and Huddersfield created the better first-half chances as Bennett was forced into a desperate block to deny Erik Durm before Etheridge tipped Steve Mounie's hooked volley over the bar. Cardiff in turn had as many players booked as they managed shots in this match (three). Junior Hoilett was unable to convert Mendez-Laing's inviting cross, while Aron Gunnarsson just failed to reach Hoilett's deep corner. David Wagner's side dominated the second period but could not find a way past a resolute Cardiff defence well marshalled by Sol Bamba, with the veteran defender blocking shots from Jason Puncheon and Alex Pritchard. Referee Lee Mason overturns his initial decision to award Huddersfield a second-half penalty But the game's main talking point arrived in the 76th minute when Bennett was initially penalised for bringing down Hadergjonaj inside the box. Mason went across to speak with his assistant Stuart Burt and, after a brief discussion, overturned the decision. Huddersfield were denied in the dying seconds once more as Etheridge did well to keep out Depoitre's looping header from Pritchard's cross as the points were shared. The managers Neil Warnock: \"We knew we'd be struggling a little bit today. We had one or two players who shouldn't have been playing today. Paterson and Camarasa weren't really fit but I wanted to play them. \"We haven't got another striker with the lads we've got out and we just have to get on with it. Yes, we didn't play as well as we have done, but it's another clean sheet. That's six we've had this season. \"I thought we had the opportunities but we didn't get the rub of the green although, thankfully, the linesman was alert to overturn the penalty. We thought ours was a certain penalty for a foul on Hoilett.\" 2:02 Neil Warnock said Cardiff 'don't get the rub of the green' after Junior Hoilett was denied a penalty in their game against Fulham. Neil Warnock said Cardiff 'don't get the rub of the green' after Junior Hoilett was denied a penalty in their game against Fulham. David Wagner: \"I think the footage speaks for itself. It was clear holding and 1000 per cent a penalty from my point of view. The referee has seen it and the referee has given it. Then for whatever reason, the linesman had an opinion as well. \"He said to me the first one wasn't a penalty and the second one I haven't seen - I don't know exactly what he meant. We will obviously speak to him because it is a decision that is anything but understandable and it's cost us points today. \"To be totally honest, I don't know how many times this has now happened to us or against us. I don't know why. You will have to ask the men in black.\" 4:04 Huddersfield head coach David Wagner was left frustrated after the referee gave a penalty and then changed his mind in their 0-0 draw at Cardiff. Huddersfield head coach David Wagner was left frustrated after the referee gave a penalty and then changed his mind in their 0-0 draw at Cardiff. Opta stats Both Premier League matches between Cardiff and Huddersfield have ended goalless this season despite 36 shots attempted across the two games. Huddersfield have failed to score in 52 per cent of their Premier League matches (31 of 60). Cardiff had the first shot of the match after just 29 seconds - they had to wait until the 70th minute for their next effort at goal. Rhys Healey played his second Premier League match for Cardiff City - four years and 246 days after playing his first against Chelsea in May 2014. This was the eighth Premier League match in which Huddersfield had as much as 60 per cent possession - they've won none of those games (W0 D3 L5). 3:15 Paul Merson says he cannot see either Cardiff or Huddersfield staying up after their performance in their 0-0 draw. Paul Merson says he cannot see either Cardiff or Huddersfield staying up after their performance in their 0-0 draw. Man of the match - Sol Bamba Cardiff were far from their best as an attacking force and this display underlined what Warnock meant when he said this week that trying to strengthen his squad is \"like climbing a mountain with butter on your hands\". But the performance of Bamba in nullifying Huddersfield's best efforts to turn a point into three will rank high in the positives column. The defender turns 34 on Sunday but he produced a display that belied his advancing years, as Cardiff kept a third clean sheet in their last four Premier League outings. What's next? Cardiff travel to face Newcastle at St James' Park next Saturday, while Huddersfield host Manchester City, live on Sky Sports, next Super Sunday (kick-off: 1.30pm)."},{"date": "12/01/2019", "arena":

Palace 1-2 Watford Crystal Palace 1-2 Watford Watford produced a second-half comeback to take all three points against Crystal Palace, winning 2-1 at Selhurst Park. A huge scramble in the Watford area saw the ball turned home by Craig Cathcart's thigh (38) to put Crystal Palace ahead, with goal-line technology confirming it had gone over the line. But the defender redeemed himself in the 67th minute as he nodded home the Watford equaliser before a wonderful volley from Tom Cleverley (74) completed the comeback and handed the visitors the victory. Watford have moved into seventh on 32 points while Crystal Palace stay in 14th, six points clear of the relegation places. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Guaita (6), Wan-Bissaka (7), Sakho (6), Tomkins (6), Van Aanholt (7), Milivojevic (7), Kouyate (7), McArthur (7), Townsend (7), Zaha (7), Ayew (5).

Subs used: Sema (6), Cleverley (7), Masina (n/a). Man of the match: Gerard Deulofeu. Watford could have taken the lead inside five minutes but were twice denied by the post. Gerard Deulofeu burst past the Crystal Palace defence before trying to hit home on the angle, but his effort smacked against the far post before an unmarked Roberto Pereyra did the same with the rebound. Neither side really created much else until the 36th minute, when Watford went close again. Pereyra slipped the ball in for Jose Holebas down the left flank before he crossed into the area. Troy Deeney rose above Mamadou Sakho to head towards goal, but it just went past the post. Team news Crystal Palace kept the same XI from their last Premier League game with only Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha keeping their places from last weekend's FA Cup win. Watford made one change from their previous league outing - Ken Sema was replaced by Will Hughes - with the latter the only survivor from their FA Cup starting XI. Two minutes later, Crystal Palace took the lead, but in the scrappiest of circumstances. Luka Milivojevic delivered a corner which pinged around the area before Cathcart turned the ball over the line with his thigh from an attempted Abdoulaye Doucoure clearance. Ben Foster palmed it back out again as the scramble continued but referee Paul Tierney soon signalled that the goal would stand after goal-line technology confirmed it had crossed the line. Milivojevic nearly scored a wonder-goal in the 63rd minute as he controlled a Watford clearance, before hitting a sumptuous volley from around 45 yards out. As it dipped towards Foster, the goalkeeper made a superb leaping save to see it away. Ben Foster attempts to clear the ball as Crystal Palace score the first goal of the game Watford got themselves level four minutes later and Cathcart was on the scoresheet again - for the right side this time. He got his head onto the end of a Holebas corner, nodding home over the top of substitute goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey on a tight angle. Both sides had a chance to score the next goal. James McArthur was inches away from turning home a fizzing cross from Zaha - ending up in the net himself - before Aaron Wan-Bissaka produced a goal-line clearance to keep out a deflected Deeney effort. But Watford did take their next opportunity in the 74th minute. It was a wonderful finish from Cleverley too as a James Tomkins clearance from his initial effort landed back into his path and he volleyed home inside a packed area to seal the win for the visitors. Craig Cathcart celebrates his goal with team-mate Troy Deeney Opta stats Crystal Palace have lost six of their 11 home Premier League matches this season (W2 D3), only one fewer than they lost during the entirety of the 2017-18 campaign (7). Watford are unbeaten in four away Premier League matches (W2 D2), their best run since September 2017 (also four unbeaten). Craig Cathcart became the first player to both score a goal and an own goal in the same Premier League game since Ryan Shawcross in December 2017 (Stoke vs Spurs). Tom Cleverley scored his first Premier League goal since October 2017, ending a run of 18 league games without a goal. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"In the end, it's one of those game you have to accept but it is tough to accept it because I think we did enough to get at least a point out of the game but to go away with literally nothing is quite harsh. \"But on the other hand, I can't say it was undeserved from Watford's point of view either because they played a good game, did what they had to do and when they got their noses in front, they knew how to defend it.\" 3:47 Roy Hodgson admitted his Crystal Palace side were beaten by a wonder goal as Tom Cleverley's spectacular volley won the game for Watford Roy Hodgson admitted his Crystal Palace side were beaten by a wonder goal as Tom Cleverley's spectacular volley won the game for Watford Javi Gracia: \"In the first minutes, we started very well. We created one clear chance to score, we didn't take it and after, the game was equal because all the games we have played against this team are always has been very equal. \"I think the most important thing today was belief. We are doing a lot of things well and in the second half, we've got the reward with two goals and with a great victory.\" 2:53 Watford boss Javi Gracia praised Craig Cathcart's attitude, character and ambition after he scored at both ends during their win over Crystal Palace Watford boss Javi Gracia praised Craig Cathcart's attitude, character and ambition after he scored at both ends during their win over Crystal Palace Man of the match - Gerard Deulofeu Watford showed plenty of character to win at Selhurst Park, and Deulofeu was the focal point of much of their attacking play. He caused plenty of problems for Crystal Palace when he got forward. He was unlucky not to nab an early goal when he hit the woodwork and although it was quite a scrappy affair, he can be pleased with his contribution to Watford's performance. What's next? Crystal Palace's next task in the Premier League is a trip to leaders Liverpool next Saturday at Anfield.

Southampton were at full throttle from the first whistle at the King Power Stadium and took a deserved lead when James Ward-Prowse converted from the penalty spot (11). Leicester looked to have a way back into the game when 19-year-old Saints full-back Yan Valery showed his inexperience by picking up a second yellow card (45). However, Shane Long netted just 90 seconds later (45+1) to give the visitors a two-goal cushion heading into the break, it was Long's first goal of the season and just his second goal in his last 62 appearances. Wilfred Ndidi pulled one back (58) but Puel's men were too predictable in their play and the excellently-organised Saints held on to give new boss Ralph Hasenhuttl a third win in his seven Premier League games in charge and move the club out of the relegation places. Player Ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Chilwell (5), Morgan (6), Maguire (6), Ndidi (6), Mendy (4), Pereira (6), Albrighton (6), Maddison (5), Choudhury (6), Vardy (5). Subs: Gray (6), Barnes (6) Southampton: McCarthy (7), Stephens (7), Valery (5), Vestergaard (8), Bednarek (8), Targett (7), Romeu (9), Ward-Prowse (7), Armstrong (7), Redmond (7), Long (8) Subs: Soares (7), Gallagher (N/A), Slattery (6) Man of the match: Oriol Romeu It ends a dismal seven days for Puel, who saw his team knocked out of the FA Cup to Sky Bet League Two side Newport County and the Foxes have now suffered back-to-back home Premier League defeats after losing against Cardiff over the festive period. Following their FA Cup exit, Puel promised the home fans a response but it did not materialise as Southampton were fast out of the traps. Team news Wes Morgan, James Maddison and Marc Albrighton all came in for Leicester while Alex McCarthy was restored in goal in for Southampton in one of four changes. Long was bundled over by Nampalys Mendy just inside the area and referee Michael Oliver - fresh from the VAR controversy at Wembley on Tuesday - awarded the spot-kick. Ward-Prowse, without a goal in almost a year, fired home into the top corner. Leicester took until the half-hour to register a shot on goal with all the incisive play coming from the Saints as Jack Stephens was denied by a flying save from Kasper Schmeichel. The game looked to have swung the Foxes way when Valery tugged back Marc Albrighton having already been booked for a clash with Ben Chilwell. Yan Valery walks off the pitch after being shown a red card With the home fans still waving the full-back down the tunnel, their team switched off and Southampton took full advantage. Ricardo Pereira was caught napping by Long down the left and the striker stayed cool to fire home. Leicester dominated territory in the second period, registering a whopping 85 per cent possession, but their creative players were too predictable in their play. Pereira did charge down the right and set up Ndidi to bundle home, but the remaining 32 minutes were relatively comfortable for Southampton, who defended deep but with great composure. Ralph Hasenhuttl celebrates with goalscorer James Ward-Prowse Man of the match: Oriol Romeu Any of the defensive unit could have picked up the outstanding award but it was the former Chelsea man that led the masterclass. He was snapping around the heels of James Maddison all afternoon and kept the Leicester man very quiet while gaining possession for his team nine times. After falling out of favour under Mark Hughes, he has started all seven Premier League games under Hasenhuttl. He is a key cog in the way the boss wants to play. Opta stats Leicester City's last three Premier League defeats have come against sides starting the day in 16th (Crystal Palace), 17th (Cardiff City) and 18th (Southampton). Southampton have won two of Hasenhüttl's four away games in the Premier League (D1 L1), as many victories on the road in the competition as in Mark Hughes' full tenure at the club (P12 W2 D3 L7). In matches involving Leicester City in the Premier League this season, there has been nine red cards shown (four for, five against), the most of any club in the division. Ndidi has scored two goals in his last 13 Premier League appearances for Leicester, as many strikes as in his first 59 matches in the competition. Southampton's Valery (19y 324d) is the youngest ever player to be sent off in a Premier League match for the Saints. Ward-Prowse has scored each of the three penalities he's taken in the Premier League - among current players in the competiton, only Danny Ings and Junior Stanislas (4/4) have a better 100% ratio from the spot. Manager reaction: Claude Puel \"We wanted to perform, we wanted to have a reaction and our concentration was perhaps too much. It was a difficult scenario. \"We didn't manage the first half well. It would have been good to have come back without the second goal but it was harsh and it was a bad moment. \"We played with desire and intensity in the second half but we didn't perform enough.\" Manager reaction: Ralph Hasenhuttl \"We had to be compact in the second half and try to defend everything. \"I think the manner of the performance was good, showing passion. \"When they made it 2-1 I thought it would be too long for us to hold on. But the way we defended made it very difficult for the opposition to score. The longer the game went on the steadier and more balanced we were. \"That was the key to the success.\" 2:20 Ralph Hasenhuttl admits he was on edge in the second half as ten-man Southampton hung on to beat Leicester 2-1.

"report": "2:35 Chelsea 2-1 Newcastle Chelsea 2-1 Newcastle Chelsea strengthened their bid for a top-four finish in the Premier League after Willian's second-half strike handed the Blues a 2-1 win over Newcastle at Stamford Bridge. Following Arsenal's 1-0 defeat to West Ham earlier in the day, Maurizio Sarri's side had the opportunity to open a six-point gap over the Gunners in fifth and they made the perfect start through Pedro's early strike (9). Newcastle responded before half-time thanks to Ciaran Clark's powerful header (40) but Willian's curling effort (57) secured Chelsea all three points. The win sees Chelsea move to within a point of third-placed Tottenham, who face Manchester United on Renault Super Sunday live on Sky Sports, while defeat leaves Newcastle in the relegation zone. Chelsea were without a goal in their previous two home games in the league, but they put that barren spell in front of goal behind them when Pedro latched onto David Luiz's inch-perfect through ball before lofting the ball over Martin Dubravka and into the back of the net. Player ratings Chelsea: Arrizabalaga (6), Azpilicueta (7), Rudiger (7), Luiz (8), Alonso (6), Jorginho (6), Kante (6), Kovacic (6), Willian (8), Hazard (6), Pedro (7). Subs: Barkley (6), Hudson-Odoi (n/a), Giroud (n/a) Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Yedlin (6), Lascelles (7), Lejeune (6), Clark (7), Ritchie (7), Hayden (6), Longstaff (7), Atsu (7), Perez (6), Rondon (6). Subs: Murphy (n/a), Manquillo (n/a) Man of the match: Willian. It was the perfect start for Chelsea, who continued to dominate possession, but Sarri's side never really pushed on from taking an early lead. It allowed Newcastle to grow into the game and Ayoze Perez should have done better after latching onto Salomon Rondon's flick-on, but the Spanish forward sliced his shot wide of the upright with only Kepa Arrizabalaga to beat. Newcastle were finishing the stronger of the two sides and they eventually got their reward, Clark beating Luiz in the air to head Matt Ritchie's corner past Arrizabalaga and into the bottom corner. Pedro celebrates his ninth-minute opener Chelsea came close to restoring their advantage immediately from the restart, but with Newcastle's defence sleeping, Willian passed wide following Jorginho's through ball. Pedro then passed up two chances early in the second half, before Hazard, who had been quiet, burst into life to create Chelsea's second. The Belgium international drove at the heart of the Newcastle defence before laying the ball off to Willian, who checked inside from the left side of the area to curl the ball beyond the dive of Dubravka and inside the far post. Team news Chelsea made three changes from the side that lost 1-0 to Tottenham in midweek in the first leg of the their Carabao Cup semi-final. David Luiz, Mateo Kovacic and Pedro replaced Ross Barkley, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Andreas Christensen. Newcastle also made three changes from the side that lost 2-0 to Manchester United last time out in the Premier League. Florian Lejeune, Ciaran Clark and Sean Longstaff came in for Fabian Schar, Moahmed Diame and the injured Paul Dummett. Jonjo Shelvey also missed out for the visitors after picking up a thigh problem. Willian then had an opportunity to wrap up all three points after latching onto another excellent through ball from Luiz. He lifted the ball over Dubravka but the ball looked to be heading wide before Jamaal Lascelles turned the ball behind. Despite their slender advantage, Chelsea brought on Callum Hudson-Odoi for Pedro with 10 minutes remaining and soon after a chorus of \"we want you to stay\" was heard from the home fans, who were soon celebrating a 14th win of the season. Opta stats Chelsea have only lost one of their 12 Premier League matches at Stamford Bridge this season, drawing four whilst winning the other seven. Newcastle's total of 18 points from their opening 22 matches is their lowest tally at this stage of a top-flight season since 1988-89 campaign (17 points), with the Magpies going on to be relegated under manager Jim Smith. Chelsea (P4 W3 D1 L0) are on their longest unbeaten league run since losing none of their opening 12 league games under manager Maurizio Sarri (P12 W8 D4 L0). Newcastle have now lost 10 straight top-flight matches away from home against sides starting the day in the top four, last winning such a match back in November 2010 against Arsenal (P26 W0 D3 L23 since). Rafa Benitez has now lost six of his eight away league games against former employers Chelsea in the Premier League (W1 D1), including his two as Newcastle boss. Chelsea's Eden Hazard has both scored (10) and assisted (10) at least 10 goals in league games this season - the only other player within the top five European Leagues to have also done so in 2018-19 is Barcelona's Lionel Messi (16 goals, 10 assists). Pedro has now scored three goals in his two Premier League starts against Newcastle at Stamford Bridge - against no other side in the competiton has the Spaniard netted more goals for Chelsea (3, level with Bournemouth). Of players with at least 10 Premier League goals, only Ugo Ehiogu (84%) and David Wetherall (87%) have scored a higher percentage of their goals via their head than Newcastle's Kieran Clark (83%). Man of the Match - Willian Willian restored Chelsea's lead with a curling effort The game was firmly in the balance when Willian produced a moment of magic to score his first Premier League goal since October. It was only this third of the season but it could prove to be one of his most important come the end of the campaign. The 30-year-old has been linked with a January move to Barcelona but ahead of the game against Newcastle Sarri hailed him as an important player for the Blues. The Brazilian proved his head coach right, producing a stunning curling effort to secure victory as Chelsea tightened their grip on fourth place. What's next? Chelsea have the chance to move further clear of Arsenal when they face the Gunners next week (Saturday January 19, 5.30pm) at the Emirates Stadium. Next up for Newcastle is a trip to Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday for an FA Cup third-round replay (7.45pm) before a return to Premier League action on Saturday at home to Cardiff (3pm)."},{"date":

"2:56 Highlights from Manchester City's win over Liverpool in the Premier League Highlights from Manchester City's win over Liverpool in the Premier League Manchester City blew the title race wide open by inflicting Liverpool's first defeat of the season with an engrossing 2-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday. Sergio Aguero proved the scourge of Liverpool again with a clinical near-post drive - his seventh goal in seven home appearances against the Reds - at the end of a frenetic first half, which saw Sadio Mane strike the post and John Stones hook his own deflected clearance off the line with millimetres to spare. Roberto Firmino headed Liverpool level on 64 minutes but parity lasted just eight minutes as Leroy Sane cannoned the winning goal in off the post at the end of a trademark City counter. City were simply not willing to relinquish their title without a fight, their victory reduces Liverpool's lead at the top of the table to four points and leaves the Premier League title race delicately poised. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Danilo (6), Kompany (8), Stones (8), Laporte (7), Fernandinho (8), Bernardo Silva (8), Sterling (7), David Silva (6), Sane (8), Aguero (8). Subs: Gundogan (6), Walker (n/a), Otamendi (n/a). Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Lovren (6), Van Dijk (7), Robertson (7), Henderson (6), Milner (6), Wijnaldum (7), Salah (6), Firmino (7), Mane (6). Subs: Fabinho (6), Sturridge (n/a), Shaqiri (5). Man of the Match: Fernandinho. The highly-anticipated clash between the champions and the challengers did not disappoint. City flew out of the traps early on, setting the tone for a pulsating half, but the better chances fell for Liverpool. Firmino slipped Mane through on goal after 18 minutes and his low strike cannoned off the post. Stones then fired his clearance into Ederson, sending the ball looping back towards goal, where the England international miraculously recovered by hooking the ball off the goal-line. John Stones makes a goal-line clearance for Manchester City Having weathered the early City storm, Liverpool pounced on the chance to go forward again as Virgil van Dijk's diagonal ball was brilliantly hooked back to the edge of the area by Andrew Robertson, and Mane lashed a volley straight at Ederson. Team news Pep Guardiola recalled John Stones and Leroy Sane in Manchester City’s two changes. Jordan Henderson and James Milner returned for Liverpool following the win over Arsenal. Vincent Kompany saw yellow and not red for a lunge on Mohamed Salah on the half hour, before appeals for a City penalty were waved away on 40 minutes after Aguero clashed with Van Dijk. But City sought their own retribution seconds later as the Argentine skipped away from Dejan Lovren and lashed a stunning drive past Alisson at his near post from a tight angle. Sergio Aguero scored his seventh goal in seven home appearances against Liverpool Liverpool hit back just after the hour as full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Robertson combined on opposing flanks and the left-back's brilliant cross was nodded home by the unmarked Firmino at the back post. The buoyant Reds threatened to add a quick-fire second but City responded in typical fashion as Raheem Sterling streaked clear, switched the play to Sane on the left and the Germany international fired the champions' second in off the woodwork. Roberto Firmino celebrates his equaliser for Liverpool City could have had a third when Aguero tried and failed to round Alisson on 83 minutes, and Bernardo Silva pounced on a poor Lovren clearance late on. The Liverpool goalkeeper prevailed on both occasions but it was City left rejoicing at the end of a thrilling victory. Opta stats Man City ended Liverpool's unbeaten Premier League start to the season in the 21st match - only Arsenal in 2003-04 (38 games), Man Utd in 2010-11 (24) and Man City in 2017-18 (22) have had longer unbeaten starts to a Premier League season. This was only Man City's second win in their last 12 matches against Liverpool in all competitions (D3 L7), winning at the Etihad in the Premier League in each of the last two seasons. Since the start of the 2011-12 season, Sergio Aguero has scored 37 Premier League goals for Man City in meetings between 'big six' clubs - 16 more than any other player. Liverpool have lost 10 of their 25 matches in all competitions under Jurgen Klopp in the month of January (W8 D7), making up 29% of his total defeats as Reds boss (10 of 35). Sergio Aguero has scored in all seven of his Premier League appearances for Manchester City against Liverpool at the Etihad, scoring one goal in each game. Since the start of last season, Leroy Sane has been involved in 26 goals in 25 home Premier League appearances for Manchester City (9 goals, 17 assists). Roberto Firmino has scored his 10th goal of the season for Liverpool in all competitions, registering double figures for the fourth consecutive season (11 in 2015-16, 12 in 2016-17, 27 in 2017-18). The managers 3:54 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola credited his players - especially those playing in unfamiliar positions - for their performances Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola credited his players - especially those playing in unfamiliar positions - for their performances Pep Guardiola: \"The game was a real game for both sides, we beat an incredible team. We were outstanding from the first minute. Liverpool don't concede goals and we scored two. We are happy for this victory to reduce the gap. Everything is open. If we lose today it is almost done, it would be so difficult. But we are four points behind them and they are the leaders. We have to fight a lot, but this gives us a lot of confidence.\" 4:47 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp claims his side were unlucky in front of goal and suggested that proved to be the difference Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp claims his side were unlucky in front of goal and suggested that proved to be the difference Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a big pressure. Very intense game. We were unlucky in our finishing moments. Unluckier than City I would say. Sane scores and the situation with Sadio when he hit the post. They had periods where they dominated the game and everybody felt the intensity. But we came back and had big chances. It is always like this. You have to score in those moments.\" Man of the Match - Fernandinho There were star performers all over the pitch for Manchester City, notably Bernardo Silva, Sergio Aguero and Aymeric Laporte, but the champions' midfield enforcer underlined his continued importance to Pep Guardiola's side. James Milner and Jordan Henderson were drafted into the Liverpool midfield ahead of kick-off, perhaps in a bid to cope with the shift Fernandinho was about to deliver. But cope they could not. City's title defence momentarily derailed in the Brazilian's absence, but having got it back on track, he could play as big a role as any in the destination of the title. What's next? Man City host Rotherham (Sunday, 4pm) and Burton (Wednesday, 7.45pm) in the FA Cup third-round and Carabao Cup semi-finals, respectively, before Wolves travel to the Etihad on Monday Night Football on January 14, live on Sky Sports.

3 Watford Highlights of Bournemouth 3 - 3 Watford Bournemouth and Watford played out a 3-3 draw as four goals were scored in six frantic first-half minutes at the Vitality Stadium on Wednesday. Troy Deeney's two goals gave Watford a commanding lead (14 & 27) before Bournemouth responded in quickfire fashion with goals from Nathan Ake (34) and Callum Wilson (37). Seconds later, Ken Sema put Watford back in front again with a fine half-volley (38) before Ryan Fraser levelled the game with a composed finish (40) in an action-packed first half. The result means Watford move up one place into eighth on 29 points. Bournemouth remain in 12th as their winless run stretches to three games.

The 30-year-old nodded in Sema's cross to put the visitors ahead before he curled in his fifth goal of the season 13 minutes later after Gerard Deulofeu capitalised on Dan Gosling's poor backpass looking for Ake. 1:32 Troy Deeney believes Watford were on the wrong end of several decisions by ref David Coote. Troy Deeney believes Watford were on the wrong end of several decisions by ref David Coote. Bournemouth then profited from two free-kicks. First, Ake turned in from close range after Gosling had seen his header from Fraser's set-piece saved at point-blank range by Foster. Then, three minutes later and another free-kick, this time from the right, was finished by Wilson as he looped his header over Foster from a near-post position. Team news Jordon Ibe, Andrew Surman and Sergio Rico dropped out for Jefferson Lerma, Ryan Fraser and Dan Gosling. Kiko Femenia, Jose Holebas, Abdoulaye Doucoure, Ken Sema and Troy Deeney came in for Daryl Janmaat, Adam Masina, Domingos Quina, Will Hughes and Isaac Success. Both sides' defences descended into disarray when Sema put Watford back in front in stunning fashion. A long ball up from Foster was flicked forward by Deeney before Sema powered his half-volley past Asmir Begovic. Almost immediately from the restart, Fraser scored on the counter-attack and slotted his shot into the bottom corner. The second half was a scrappy affair with Abdoulaye Doucoure substituted in the 54th minute having already received a yellow card for a dangerous first-half challenge on Fraser. And with Bournemouth on the front foot, Foster made a fine save to deny Wilson who powered a header on goal from close range. Abdoulaye Doucoure picked up a yellow card after a dangerous challenge on Ryan Fraser As the hosts continued their pursuit for a fourth goal, Foster smothered a close-range shot from Josh King in the box after Craig Cathcart slipped over on the ball. The 35-year-old was called into action again two minutes later to deny Gosling, on his return to the starting XI, as Watford held on for a valuable point.

Southampton rarely threatened but will likely be satisfied with a hard-earned point, while there were some boos from Chelsea fans at the final whistle. Having lost their final home game of 2018 to Leicester, this was another lacklustre display from Chelsea in front of their own supporters, who had been buoyed earlier in the day by the signing of Christian Pulisic from Borussia Dortmund. N'Golo Kante and James Ward-Prowse compete for the ball Chelsea particularly struggled to get anything going in a forgettable first half. Morata headed at Gunn while Willian had a shot blocked before he was taken off with injury in the 37th minute. Chelsea's best chance fell to Hazard but he fired at Gunn after controlling Antonio Rudiger's pass over the top. While Southampton didn't have a shot on target before the break, they were compact in defence and succeeded in frustrating Chelsea and keeping them at bay. Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was called into action early in the second half to tip a low shot wide from Stuart Armstrong. Jannik Vestergaard gets above Willian to head clear But the game soon settled into the same pattern as the first half, with Chelsea controlling possession and failing to create any clear openings. Hazard and Jorginho shot at Gunn while Morata thought he had broken the deadlock when he finished from inside the box, only for the flag to go up for a tight offside call. Team news Chelsea made one change from their win at Crystal Palace as Morata replaced the injured Giroud. Southampton made eight changes from their loss to Manchester City, with Gunn making his Premier League debut in goal and Cedric, Yoshida, Vestergaard, Valery, Armstrong, Redmond and Ings starting. Substitutes Cesc Fabregas and Ruben Loftus-Cheek then combined to tee up Morata but Gunn blocked his low shot. Opta stats Southampton have only won four of their 20 visits to Stamford Bridge in the Premier League (D6 L11), most recently a 3-1 win over Jose Mourinho's Blues in October 2015. Chelsea have failed to score in three of their last five Premier League games at Stamford Bridge, as many as in their previous 22 in the competition. Southampton have drawn nine Premier League games by a 0-0 scoreline since the start of last season; two more than any other side. Southampton have recorded their first Premier League clean sheet since October, conceding 24 goals in their previous 10 before today. At 22 years and 346 days, Southampton's Angus Gunn is the youngest English goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet on his Premier League debut since Ben Amos for Man Utd against Stoke in January 2012 (21 years, 295 days). Angus Gunn (1) has recorded more Premier League clean sheets at Stamford Bridge than his father Bryan did (0 in 3 attempts). Alvaro Morata has recorded 1.9 offsides per 90 this season, the most of any player to have played at least 90 minutes. Cesc Fabregas' appearance for Chelsea vs Southampton is his 500th for English club sides in all competitions. The managers Maurizio Sarri: \"The match was under control with the ball possession and the opportunities, but it's very difficult to create a lot of opportunities if you are not able to score the first goal. If you are able to score then you can find spaces and it's easier to create a lot of opportunities. They were really very compact and it wasn't easy. You need to score the first goal otherwise it's very difficult. We are in trouble only in the last 20 metres, I think for 80 metres we played a very good match.\" 3:18 Maurizio Sarri says he was happy that Chelsea created enough chances despite their 0-0 draw with Southampton Maurizio Sarri says he was happy that Chelsea created enough chances despite their 0-0 draw with Southampton Ralph Hasenhuttl: \"We made the right decision on Sunday to change so many players against Manchester City. We knew if we wanted to have a chance against Chelsea we had to put seven or eight fresh players on the pitch otherwise it's not possible to defend for 95 minutes and I think we did a good job.\" 2:48 Ralph Hasenhuttl says the commitment and fight shown by Southampton was very impressive. Ralph Hasenhuttl says the commitment and fight shown by Southampton was very impressive. Man of the match - Maya Yoshida The experienced Southampton defender produced a strong performance to limit Chelsea's chances and ensure Gunn did not have an overly busy night on his Premier League debut. He made one crucial tackle towards the end of the match to prevent N'Golo Kante from having a clear sight of goal. Yoshida made a crucial late tackle to deny Kante What's next? Chelsea host Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup on Saturday and then travel to Tottenham for the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final on Tuesday, live on Sky Sports. Their next Premier League match sees them host Newcastle on Saturday, January 12. Southampton face a trip to Championship side Derby in the FA Cup on Saturday and then travel to Leicester in the Premier League on January 12."},{"date": "02/01/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's

Huddersfield 1-2 Burnley Huddersfield 1-2 Burnley Ashley Barnes struck the winner as Burnley came from behind to beat 10-man Huddersfield in the Premier League on Wednesday night. Huddersfield had taken the lead at the John Smith's Stadium through Steve Mounie, but Chris Wood levelled up for Burnley before Christopher Schindler picked up a second yellow card before the break. Barnes then punished the Terriers with 16 minutes to go, as they were condemned to an eighth-straight league defeat for the first time in their history. Burnley saw Robbie Brady sent off in the 90th minute, but held on for a victory that lifted them out of the relegation zone. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Hadergjonaj (5), Jorgensen (6), Schindler (3), Kongolo (7), Hogg (5), Billing (6), Kachunga (6), Mbenza (7), Pritchard (5), Mounie (6) Subs: Lowe (n/a), Depoitre (n/a), Durm (5) Burnley: Heaton (7), Bardsley (5), Tarkowski (7), Mee (6), Taylor (6), Gudmundsson (6), Cork (7), Westwood (7), McNeil (8), Barnes (7), Wood (6) Subs: Lowton (n/a), Brady (3), Hendrick (n/a) Man of the match: Dwight McNeil It started so well for Huddersfield as, at the 21st time of asking this season, one of their strikers found the back of the net. Isaac Mbenza whipped a superb ball in from the left and Mounie was there to head the ball past Tom Heaton. Steve Mounie celebrates after putting Huddersfield ahead Their lead didn't last long. Dwight McNeil scored at the weekend after being recalled by Sean Dyche and the teenager made his mark again here after 40 minutes. He twisted and turned away from his man before firing a low ball across the six-yard box to find Wood, who snuck ahead of his marker to turn the ball home. And it went from bad to worse for Huddersfield just a minute later as Schindler, who had gone into the book on the half-hour mark for tripping Wood, received his marching orders for bringing down McNeil on the edge of the area. Team news David Wagner made two attacking changes as Elias Kachunga and Isaac Mbenza came into his starting XI, while Burnley were unchanged. Burnley struggled to break down Huddersfield as they pushed for a winner, but finally they found their way through as Wood and Ashley Westwood combined before the latter fed Barnes, and he took a touch before bending the ball past Jonas Lossl. There was time for some late drama as Brady, who was introduced as a second-half substitute, hacked down Mbenza from behind as Huddersfield attempted to break and was shown a straight red card by referee Mike Dean. Man of the match - Dwight McNeil Dwight McNeil (R) celebrates after setting up Chris Wood's equaliser for Burnley Performances like this make you wonder why it took so long for Sean Dyche to give McNeil an opportunity for Burnley. The left-winger created the equaliser that turned the game on its head and was a constant threat until he was prematurely replaced in the second half. If he keeps performing like this we will see plenty more of him in the second half of the season. The managers 3:14 David Wagner says Christopher Schindler’s sending off meant his side could not maintain their tempo and intensity in Huddersfield’s 2-1 defeat to Burnley. David Wagner says Christopher Schindler’s sending off meant his side could not maintain their tempo and intensity in Huddersfield’s 2-1 defeat to Burnley. David Wagner: \"We gave ourselves a schedule of what we have to do until the end of the season.Obviously today was disappointing because we didn't get any points and we know the statistic that no team has ever stayed up with 10 points from 21 games. \"But we have beaten statistics before with Huddersfield Town and we still have the aim and ambition [to stay up]. We know what we have to do. We have to accept this result, but we will move forward. The table tells you the truth and the truth is that at this stage of the season we have lost eight games in a row.\" 3:15 Sean Dyche was proud of the way his side came from behind to win against Huddersfield and says it’s a sign that his side is improving, although there’s still work to do. Sean Dyche was proud of the way his side came from behind to win against Huddersfield and says it’s a sign that his side is improving, although there’s still work to do. Sean Dyche: \"We aren't flying at the moment like last season, but the confidence is building. We had one real blip against Everton but the performances recently have been decent. We've still got more to do and I reminded the players of that, but I'm pleased for them. \"It's not easy to win back-to-back games, especially home and away. We've had a few false starts this season but the signs are getting better of the team remodelling itself. The mentality and physicality is getting stronger again. \"You soon forget that after five games we had one point and were bottom of the league. So we have been climbing but we have to continue putting in performances to look after ourselves.\" Opta stats Burnley have won consecutive Premier League games for the first time since September 2018. Huddersfield have suffered eight consecutive league defeats for the first time in their history. Before tonight, Burnley had lost all 12 Premier League games this season in which they'd conceded the first goal of the match. Since the start of last season, only Leicester City (9) have received more Premier League red cards than Huddersfield Town (6 - level with Watford). Chris Wood's leveller for Burnley was his 100th goal in English league football - 14 in the Premier League, 78 in Championship and eight in League One. Huddersfield striker Steve Mounie scored his first Premier League goal of the season, with what was his 35th shot in the campaign. Burnley's Ashley Barnes has been involved in three goals in his last four Premier League games (two goals, one assist), more than in his previous 18 combined (two goals). What's next? Both sides are in FA Cup third-round action on Saturday. Burnley host League One Barnsley at 12.30pm and Huddersfield head to Championship Bristol City at 5.30pm. The pair are also back in Premier League action on Saturday, January 12. Burnley welcome Fulham to Turf Moor and Huddersfield travel to Cardiff.

In a crazy spell of four goals in 11 second-half minutes, Dale Stephens put the visitors in front (57) before Shane Duffy acrobatically hooked home to double the lead (59). West Ham responded by sending on Mark Noble and Michail Antonio and they both played a part as Arnautovic netted a quick-fire double (66 & 68) to draw the hosts level. His second goal - from a Antonio cross - was controversial as the ball was borderline off the pitch when the winger found his striker. The Hammers won more points in December (15) than they previously had all season (12), but they looked short on confidence from the get go. Player Ratings West Ham: Fabianski (7), Zabaleta (7), Ogbonna (6), Diop (6), Cresswell (6), Snodgrass (6), Obiang (6), Rice (7), Anderson (6), Carroll (6), Arnautovic (8) Subs: Noble (8), Antonio (8), Perez (6) Brighton: Button (6), Duffy (7), Dunk (7), Montoya (6), Bernardo (6), Stephens (7), Gross (6), March (7), Propper (6), Murray (6), Locadia (6) Subs: Bong (6), Andone (6) Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic Andy Carroll struggled to link with Felipe Anderson and Arnautovic and Brighton were well drilled in midfield. Space was hard to come by but Anderson should have done better on 24 minutes when firing straight at David Button from 12 yards. Carroll was replaced at half-time by Lucas Perez but it was Brighton that took charge. Team news Manuel Pellegrini handed Andy Carroll a first start of the season in one of three changes while Glenn Murray replaced Florin Andone for Brighton. A corner was only half-punched clear by Lukas Fabianski and it dropped to Stephens, who controlled a very clever finish into the net. Brighton seized their opportunity and doubled their lead two minutes later. Another corner wasn't dealt with properly by the Hammers and Duffy stole in at the far post. There was still a lot for him to do from a tight angle but he hooked a sublime finish into the net. Declan Rice (R) clears the ball With the home fans starting to turn on their team, Arnautovic hauled the Hammers back into the match. Substitute Noble clipped a ball over the top and the Austrian raced through, held off Duffy, and fired home from close range. He was at it again minutes later, this time finishing off after some brilliant wing play by Antonio, who was at full-stretch on the by-line to narrowly keep the ball in play in the opinion of the match officials. Both teams looked for a winner in the closing stages but the lively Antonio fired over before Brighton nearly scored from a third corner but Duffy headed wide. Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic Marko Arnautovic scores West Ham's second goal This showed how important the Austrian is to the Hammers. He's been missing since picking up a hamstring strain against Cardiff but got 70 minutes under his belt against Burnley. That put him cherry-ripe for this encounter and his second-half display when playing through the middle was first-class. He was strong, powerful and clinical in front of goal. Manager reaction: Manuel Pellegrini \"We know Brighton score most of their goals from set pieces, especially corners, so to concede two goals knowing the characteristic of this team, I was very disappointed. \"I don't remember one chance for Brighton except the two set pieces. \"But fortunately we never gave up and the substitutes changed the face of the game. I'm disappointed about the result but very happy with the spirit of the team. Before the game I didn't want to draw but I think we must be happy.\" Manager reaction: Chris Hughton \"It's hugely disappointing, there won't be too many opportunities like that away from home. \"The first-half performance from us was very good, so at the moment the overriding feeling is disappointment. \"Five points from nine is a good points tally from us and we know we mustn't get complacent.\" Opta stats West Ham have only won one of their eight top-flight matches against Brighton (D2 L5), winning 2-1 in March 1983. West Ham have conceded at least once in each of their last eight home Premier League games, the longest current such run in the competition. There were just 125 seconds between Dale Stephen's opener for Brighton and Shane Duffy putting the Seagulls two goals in front, whilst there were 131 seconds between Marko Arnautovic's two strikes for West Ham. Brighton's Shane Duffy has scored four goals in 18 Premier League appearances this campaign - his joint highest goal return in a single season across the top four tiers of English Football (also 4 goals in 41 games during the 2015/16 Championship season for Blackburn). Dale Stephens opener for Brighton was his first ever Premier League goal and his first in league competition since December 2016 against Blackburn Rovers in the Championship. What's next? West Ham have back-to-back home games to look forward to, first against Birmingham in the FA Cup before welcoming Arsenal the following week, which is live on Sky Sports. Meanwhile, Brighton have a trip to Bournemouth in the cup and then a home clash with Liverpool."},{"date": "02/01/2019", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 30666, "home_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton

Milivojevic saw Crystal Palace secure a 2-0 win against Wolves at Molineux. Ayew broke the deadlock in the 83rd minute with his first goal for the club before Milivojevic's penalty in stoppage time, after Ryan Bennett had brought down Wilfried Zaha, secured all three points. Victory sees Palace stay 14th but they move six points clear of the relegation zone after picking up seven points from their last four matches in the league, while Wolves drop a place to ninth after a disappointing evening. Crystal Palace enjoyed plenty of possession, but chances were few and far between during what was an extremely poor opening 45 minutes of football. Player ratings Wolves: Patricio (6), Bennett (6), Coady (7), Boly (5), Doherty (6), Saiss (5), Moutinho (6), Jonny (5), Cavaleiro (6), Costa (5), Jimenez (5). Subs: Gibbs-White (6), Neves (6), Traore (n/a). Crystal Palace: Guaita (7), Wan-Bissaka (7), Tomkins (7), Sakho (7), Van Aanholt (7), Milivojevic (7), Kouyate (6), McArthur (6), Townsend (7), Zaha (7), Ayew (8). Subs: Wickham (n/a). Man of the match: Jordan Ayew Milivojevic went closest to opening the scoring for Palace. Wily Boly's error gifted possession to Andros Townsend and the winger picked out the Palace skipper, whose shot was tipped over by Rui Patricio. Wolves struggled to get going but they should have taken the lead in the 36th minute when Ivan Cavaleiro's corner picked out an unmarked Boly in the penalty area. The defender miscued his header, but the ball bounced kindly for Matt Doherty at the far post and he sent the ball over Vicente Guaita's crossbar. Ivan Cavaleiro challenges Andros Townsend Wolves did improve after the break, but their evening was summed up when Jonny struck high over Guaita's crossbar from the edge of the penalty area on the hour mark. Palace's struggles in front of goal have been well documented this season but they grabbed the opener seven minutes from time as Ayew scored his first goal since April 14. Team news Wolves made three changes from the side that beat Tottenham 3-1 at Wembley. Romain Saiss, Joao Moutinho and Helder Costa came in for Ruben Neves, Leander Dendoncker and Adama Traore. There was one change for Crystal Palace from the side that lost 1-0 to Chelsea. Jordan Ayew returned in place of Jeffrey Schlupp. The ball dropped to Patrick van Aanholt on the edge of the area and his shot fell to Ayew, who produced a brilliant touch to bring the ball down before striking home his first goal of the season from six yards. Wolves finally produced their first shot on target in stoppage time as they went in search of an equaliser, but substitute Ruben Neves' drive was palmed away to safety by Guaita. Milivojevic then wrapped up Palace's first top-flight win at Molineux, emphatically scoring from the spot after Bennett had fouled Zaha. Luka Milivojevic celebrates after scoring from the spot Opta stats Crystal Palace have won consecutive away Premier League games within the same season for the first time since April 2017. Wolves have lost five of their last seven Premier League home games (W2 D0 L5) after remaining unbeaten in their first four at Molineux this season (W2 D2 L0). Wolves attempted just one shot on target in this match, their joint-lowest tally in a Premier League game this season (also one vs Watford at home in October). Only Liverpool (12), Chelsea (10) and Tottenham (9) have kept more Premier League clean sheets this season than Crystal Palace (8). Jordan Ayew scored his first ever Premier League goal for Crystal Palace, last netting in the competition for Swansea against Everton in April 2018. Since the start of last season, Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha has won eight Premier League penalties, two more than any other player. 78% of Crystal Palace midfielder Luka Milivojevic's Premier League goals have been penalties (14/18) - the highest ratio among players with 15+ goals in the competition. Man of the Match - Jordan Ayew Ayew scored his first goal since April Ayew plugged away all evening for Palace and he got his just rewards seven minutes from time. His struggles in front of goal have been well documented since moving to Selhurst Park on a season-long loan from Swansea on Deadline Day, but he showed brilliant composure in controlling Van Aanholt's miscued shot dead before finishing past Patricio for a timely first goal for the club. The managers Nuno Espirito Santo: \"I'm disappointed but it was a tough game. The first half was very compact but in the second half we started good and created a couple of chances. But as the game went by we managed the ball sometimes, but the counter-attack of Palace created us problems. It was a tough game so credit to Crystal Palace because they fight, and this is the game, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.\" 0:56 Nuno Espirito Santo was left disappointed after Wolves lost 2-0 at home to Crystal Palace in what Santo described as a frustrating performance. Nuno Espirito Santo was left disappointed after Wolves lost 2-0 at home to Crystal Palace in what Santo described as a frustrating performance. Roy Hodgson: \"I think we did [deserve victory]. It was a very good team performance right from the start of the game. I thought we had a lot of possession and asked a lot of questions. It's not easy to score against this Wolves team, which has a lot of confidence, but even though a point would have been an acceptable result, quite honestly, we did deserve to win the game.\" 2:19 Roy Hodgson admitted that he would have settled for a point at Molineux but felt his Crystal Palace players deserved the win more than the opposition as they won 2-0 against Wolves. Roy Hodgson admitted that he would have settled for a point at Molineux but felt his Crystal Palace players deserved the win more than the opposition as they won 2-0 against Wolves. The pundit Iain Dowie gave his verdict on Crystal Palace's 2-0 win at Wolves on Gillette Soccer Special... \"Wolves just looked like they'd had too many games,\" he said. \"They looked tired and this was a thoroughly deserved win for Palace. Palace had the players with energy. Townsend and Zaha were both excellent in committing people, and Ayew got his goal. Do I think he was offside? Yes, I do - but the touch is that good, it's deserved to be a goal. Wolves have this inconsistency against sides eighth down. It seems bizarre. They've had an incredible season, so we should praise them. But it's a disappointing night for them.\" What's next?

Highlights from Manchester United's win against Newcastle in the Premier League. Manchester United made it four wins from four under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with a 2-0 victory over Newcastle at St. James' Park that saw the interim manager emulate Sir Matt Busby. Substitute Romelu Lukaku scored with his first touch on 63 minutes, 38 seconds after coming on, before Marcus Rashford wrapped up the three points 10 minutes from time. Neville: Rashford brilliant to watch Solskjaer's forward power The victory sees Solskjaer become only the second manager in Manchester United's history to win their first four games in charge, after Busby in 1946, and sees sixth-placed United move to within six points of the top four. Newcastle, who have now won just one of their last eight league games, stay 15th, just two points clear of the relegation zone.

Subs: Lingard (n/a), Sanchez (6), Lukaku (7). Man of the Match: Marcus Rashford. Manchester United had not tasted victory on Tyneside since March 2015, and that looked set to continue as they rode their luck in a first-half performance in stark contrast of those seen in Solskjaer's first three games. Christian Atsu could have had a first-half hat-trick, but the Ghana international was twice thwarted by David de Gea before dragging a shot wide inside the opening 20 minutes. Marcus Rashford makes it 2-0 Anthony Martial lofted an effort onto the roof of the net midway though the half before Salomon Rondon did the same with a header 10 minutes before the interval. There were signs that Manchester United were just starting to build some momentum before the break, and that continued in the second half with Rashford flashing a shot wide on 52 minutes. Team news Fabian Schar replaced the injured Federico Fernandez at centre-back in Newcastle’s only change from the draw at Watford. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made three changes to the Man Utd side that beat Bournemouth, as Antonio Valencia, Phil Jones and Juan Mata were recalled. Solskjaer brought Lukaku and Sanchez off the bench on 63 minutes, and the former had an immediate impact, punishing Martin Dubravka after he spilled a dipping Rashford free-kick in the six-yard box. Rashford then got himself on the scoresheet, applying the finishing touch at the end of a rapid counter on 80 minutes as Solskjaer extended him dream start to life at United with a fourth win and a first clean sheet. 0:44 Jonjo Shelvey was lucky to avoid seeing red after a high footed challenge on Paul Pogba Jonjo Shelvey was lucky to avoid seeing red after a high footed challenge on Paul Pogba Opta stats Newcastle have lost eight of their 11 home Premier League games this season (W2 D1) - only in 2012-13 (9) have they lost more at St James' Park in a single campaign in the competition.

The England international led the line against a physical Newcastle defence with the maturity of a seasoned centre-forward. Rashford has spoken of his desire to play as an out and out striker for his club, if he continues in this manner, those demands will simply have to be met by Solskjaer. What's next?

Jamie Vardy gets Foxes off to perfect start in 2019 2:55 Highlights from Leicester's win over Everton in the Premier League Highlights from Leicester's win over Everton in the Premier League Jamie Vardy scored the winner as Leicester City got their festive period back on track with a 1-0 victory at Everton on New Year's Day. Having beaten Manchester City on Boxing Day, Claude Puel's men suffered a shock home defeat to Cardiff on Saturday but were back on form at Goodison Park. Vardy - employed as a lone striker but starved of service for long periods - gobbled up the only chance that came his way (58) which grabbed Leicester a deserved three points. Everton were stifled by an organised Foxes team that restricted the home attackers any space to such an extent it took Marco Silva's men 75 minutes to register a shot on target. Everton have now lost four of their last five games, while Leicester are up to seventh in the Premier League table.

Subs: Albrighton (7), Gray (N/A) Man of the match: Jonny Evans The opening exchanges were nervy with both teams lacking quality. Jonjoe Kenny cracked an effort from 20 yards against the corner of the post and crossbar on 19 minutes before Kurt Zouma summed up Everton's frustrations with a wild 30-yard effort. Team news Both teams rang the changes. Marco Silva started Jonjoe Kenny, Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Gylfi Sigurdsson while Danny Simpson, Hamza Choudhury, Jonny Evans and Rachid Ghezzal returned for Leicester. Leicester's plan to soak up pressure was working a charm and they took the lead just before the hour mark. Michael Keane lost possession deep in his own half and Ricardo Pereira played a through-ball which Vardy gleefully accepted and finished past Jordan Pickford. Gylfi Sigurdsson fired over the crossbar and substitute Cenk Tosun tested Kasper Schmeichel's palms with a fierce strike but rarely did Everton look capable of opening Leicester up. Dominic Calvert-Lewin (C) is tackled by Danny Simpson and Hamza Choudhury In fact, it was the visitors that carried the bigger threat. Minutes after referee Martin Atkinson waved away a penalty claim for handball by Keane following a Harry Maguire header, the England centre-back should have doubled the lead but blazed over from close range. The Everton players mustered nothing in response and the home fans vented their frustration as they trudged off at full-time. The managers 4:51 Marco Silva was disappointed with the performance of his Everton players Marco Silva was disappointed with the performance of his Everton players Marco Silva: \"It was a disappointing result and a poor performance to be honest. We always have to be honest and we have to look clearly at the game and analyse the match calmly and to pass the feedback back to our boys. \"If you look at our last few results, they haven't been consistent but there is no reason to be so anxious and so nervous.

We've had some difficult balls to play in the second half but the togetherness and organisation from the team was perfect. \"It was a difficult challenge, of course. Everton are a team with lot of ambition, character and strengths. This moment is a busy period, all the players are tired and they have had to play like us. But the most important thing is to show our strength in this moment and to handle the situation in the right way.\" Opta stats Leicester have won three of their last four Premier League matches (L1) - one more than in their previous 10 combined. Everton have lost four of their last five Premier League games (W1) - as many as they lost in their first 16 matches of the 2018-19 season (W6 D6 L4). Since Claude Puel's first Premier League match in charge of the club in October 2017, Jamie Vardy has scored 22 goals in the competition for Leicester under the Frenchman - double the number of any other player. Leicester have won five of their last six league matches played on New Year's Day (D1). Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has been involved in seven goals against Everton in the Premier League (5 goals, 2 assists) - only against Liverpool (8) has he been involved in more. Everton have lost three of their last five home games against Leicester in all competitions (W2) - as many as in their previous 24 games at Goodison Park against the Foxes. Man of the match: Jonny Evans The Northern Ireland international turns 31 later this week and gave a reminder to all about his talents with a dominant showing, alongside the equally brilliant Harry Maguire. Evans kept Dominic Calvert-Lewin very quiet, making nine clearances and winning five duels. What made the level of his performance even more remarkable was that he has not played in the last five games. He will be impossible to leave out for the next Premier League game. Jonny Evans was outstanding for Leicester City What's next? Everton host Lincoln City in the FA Cup on Saturday, while Leicester have a trip to Newport County."},{"date": "01/01/2019", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59887, "home_team": {"name":

victory to close gap on top four 2:53 Arsenal 4-1 Fulham Arsenal 4-1 Fulham Arsenal returned to winning ways in emphatic style with a 4-1 victory over Fulham on New Year's Day. Looking to bounce back from a 5-1 drubbing at Liverpool, Arsenal punished Fulham for two missed Ryan Sessegnon chances when Granit Xhaka broke the deadlock (25) at the Emirates. Alexandre Lacazette then scored Arsenal's second (55) after the break following a fine team move, and though substitute Aboubakar Kamara gave the visitors hope (69), it was only short-lived. Aaron Ramsey (79) restored the two-goal advantage before Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (83) added a somewhat flattering fourth. Arsenal move two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, while Fulham remain 19th in the Premier League table. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates scoring Arsenal's fourth goal Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (6), Sokratis (6), Koscielny (6), Mustafi (6), Maitland-Niles (7), Guendouzi (7), Xhaka (7), Kolasinac (8), Iwobi (8), Lacazette (7), Aubameyang (7) Subs: Torreira (6), Ramsey (7), Saka (6) Fulham: Rico (7), Christie (6), Odoi (6), Ream (6), Le Marchand (6), Sessegnon (6), Bryan (6), Cairney (6), Schurrle (5), Cisse (5), Mitrovic (6) Subs: Fosu-Mensah (6), Kamara (7), Seri (6) Man of the match: Alex Iwobi It was a tale of three chances in the opening 25 minutes, with Sessegnon firing wide of the far post when one-on-one with Bernd Leno before the 18-year-old then missed a cross completely six yards out. Xhaka duly punished Sessegnon for those missed opportunities, with the Swiss midfielder controlling Alex Iwobi's cross before stabbing an attempt beyond Sergio Rico for his first Premier League goal from inside the box. Arsenal could have extended their lead further before the break, but a valiant block from Tim Ream denied Xhaka, while Rico kept out Lacazette's low drive after Aubameyang headed wide. Team news Laurent Koscielny, Matteo Guendouzi and Alexandre Lacazette returned to Arsenal’s XI as Unai Emery reverted to three at the back. Mesut Ozil (knee) remained out. Four Fulham changes saw Andre Schurrle, Maxime Le Marchand, Ibrahima Cisse and Ryan Sessegnon start, with Aboubakar Kamara dropped to the bench after ‘disrespecting’ the club when taking a penalty instead of Aleksandar Mitrovic in the previous match. Alexandre Lacazette celebrates his goal Lacazette doubled Arsenal's lead 10 minutes into the second half, adding the finishing touch to a quality move which saw Iwobi, Sead Kolasinac and Aubameyang link-up brilliantly down the left. Fulham got back into it thanks to Kamara - who had been dropped to the bench after his penalty antics against Huddersfield - with the forward coming off the bench to tap in Sessegnon's cross. 14 - Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the outright top-scorer in the Premier League this season, with 14 goals in 21 games. Potent. pic.twitter.com/iycVHJVIwp — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) January 1, 2019 Ramsey then came on for Lacazette, and though the tactical switch brought about jeers from the home fans, it was the Wales midfielder who added Arsenal's third from inside the area before Aubameyang saw his heavily-deflected effort sail past Rico to seal the three points. Aaron Ramsey celebrates his goal after coming on as a second-half substitute Opta stats Arsenal have scored 10 Premier League goals this season courtesy of substitutes, more than any other team. Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri has never won a Premier League match against Arsenal in 11 attempts (D4 L7) and has a worse points-per-game ratio against the Gunners (0.36) than he does versus any other opponent in the competition. Arsenal have kept just one clean sheet in their last 14 Premier League games. Granit Xhaka has scored three Premier League goals in 20 appearances for Arsenal in 2018-19 - as many as in his previous two seasons combined (3 in 70 games). The managers Unai Emery: \"We worked well. We wanted to win like this. It's a good result, we need to take confidence here with a match like today. We struggled in some moments, but the team continued to push and create chances. We can be happy today. \"It's normal at 2-1, there can be some doubt, but we continued to show confidence. The team continued to work and kept to their plan. \"We can score with different players - it's good. We can continue creating our identity with different players and different systems.\" 3:16 Arsenal boss Unai Emery says he was pleased with his side performance and happy to have many different goalscorers in their 4-1 win over Fulham Arsenal boss Unai Emery says he was pleased with his side performance and happy to have many different goalscorers in their 4-1 win over Fulham Claudio Ranieri: \"If you analyse you think, okay, the first half-an-hour before their first goal, we created two great chances. The Arsenal crowd was, 'Oh! What happened?' and started to boo their players. \"But they scored with their first chance because we made mistakes in the middle of the box. In the second half, other little mistakes. \"After we reopened the match and had two chances to draw. But when you make mistakes against a big team, and then also we were a little tired, we don't have the quality of Arsenal. Four goals, but I do not think our performance was bad. We could have drawn.\" 2:33 Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri says his side paid the price for poor mistakes in their 4-1 defeat against Arsenal Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri says his side paid the price for poor mistakes in their 4-1 defeat against Arsenal Man of the match - Alex Iwobi No goals for Iwobi, but he was a constant menace along with Kolasinac down the left, which is where Arsenal found most of their openings against Fulham. The Nigeria international assisted the first for Xhaka and was key in the build-up to Arsenal's second. He does not always receive the plaudits with Aubameyang and Lacazette for company up front, but Iwobi deserves recognition for his telling New Year's Day contribution. What's next? Arsenal are in FA Cup action at Blackpool on Saturday before heading to West Ham the following weekend, live on Sky Sports on January 12.

Spurs were in complete control early on through Harry Kane's messy finish (3), before Christian Eriksen's low strike from 20 yards gave him his fourth goal in five league games. Heung-Min Son scored from a tight angle to make it 3-0 (26), and though Spurs had some half-chances to add to their lead in the second half, keeping a clean sheet seemed their priority.

Cardiff are 16th, three points above the drop zone. Looking to bounce back from their 3-1 defeat by Wolves on Saturday, Spurs were flying in the first half while barely moving out of second gear. Kane had them ahead with his 18th goal of the season as Sean Morrison failed to clear from close range, the ball ricocheting off Kane's thigh and past Neil Etheridge, meaning he has now scored against every Premier League side he has faced. It was 2-0 shortly after as Kane started a move down the right for Moussa Sissoko, who squared for Son who then pushed it along to Eriksen. The Dane took his time and slotted into the bottom left corner through the legs of Bruno Manga to wrong-foot Etheridge. Team news Cardiff made just one change following the win at Leicester; Hoilett made way for Reid on the wing. It was also just one change for Spurs as Rose came in for Davies at left-back. Christian Eriksen makes it 2-0 in the 12th minute It was 3-0 after only 26 minutes through Son, who found the far left corner from an acute angle on the right of the box after Kane's touch had found him in space. Cardiff's first opportunity came after the break as sub Junior Hoilett saw a header well saved by Hugo Lloris from close range after Spurs let the ball bounce in the area, before Son came close to a second at the other end, only to be snuffed out by a combination of Sol Bamba and Etheridge. Spurs stayed in control and got their clean sheet, keeping them in the title race as attention turns to Thursday's huge clash at the Etihad. The managers Neil Warnock: \"We've got to start better. Against the good sides, if you give them the goals the confidence oozes and they can tear you apart. \"I think we've done remarkably well in that first period, up to today, and you can't be too disappointed, you've just got to get on with it.\" Mauricio Pochettino: \"First it is about the three points and then I don't want to see the table. Of course we are in a very good position, but we have to be consistent. \"Of course today the Premier League is so tough, if you want to be in a good position you must be consistent for the whole season, and you can't afford to lose the three points like we did against Wolves.\" Man of the match - Christian Eriksen Although he was afforded too much room in the final third, Eriksen was at the heart of everything Spurs did as they strolled back into second place. His finish for the second was so clever, knowing if he could get the ball through the legs of defender Manga, he would score. Special mentions also to Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son, but once again Eriksen was the catalyst. Christian Eriksen celebrates his goal with Dele Alli and Harry Kane Opta stats Spurs have won each of their four Premier League games against Cardiff - only Manchester City (7 v Bournemouth) and Arsenal (6 v Reading) have a better 100 per cent record against an opponent in the competition. Spurs are still yet to play out a draw in the Premier League this season (W16 D0 L5), just the ninth occasion in top-flight history that a team has gone 21 or more games into a season without drawing. Cardiff have the same number of points this season (18) as they did after 21 games of their only previous Premier League campaign (18 in 2013-14), however they do have a worse goal difference this term (-22). Cardiff have conceded 25 goals across their games against the \"big six\" teams in the Premier League this season; the most of any side. Spurs striker Harry Kane has now scored against all 28 of the opponents he's faced in the Premier League, with this his first goal against Cardiff in his fourth appearance against them.

Chelsea had a goal disallowed for offside and twice hit the post in the first half at Selhurst Park, but scored the winner five minutes into the second period when Kante (50) rolled the ball past Vicente Guaita. Crystal Palace rallied towards the end of the game, with Connor Wickham almost poking home in the 89th minute, but they could not find an equaliser. Chelsea now have 43 points on the board - five ahead of Arsenal in fifth - while Crystal Palace remain in 14th with 19 points. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Guaita (6), Wan-Bissaka (7), Sakho, Tomkins (6), Van Aanholt (6), Schlupp (6), Milivojevic (7), Kouyate (6), McArthur (6), Townsend (6), Zaha (6). Subs used: Wickham (5), Meyer (5). Chelsea: Kepa (6), Azpilicueta (7), Luiz (7), Rudiger (7), Alonso (6), Jorginho (8), Kante (7), Barkley (6), Willian (7), Hazard (6), Giroud (7). Subs used: Morata (4), Emerson (n/a), Kovacic (n/a). Man of the match: Jorginho. Chelsea had their first chance of the game in the 14th minute. Willian curled a free-kick into the area, which Antonio Rudiger met with a free header, but it looped into the arms of Eagles 'keeper Guaita. Not long after, Kante tried his luck from the top of the box, but it just whistled past the far post. The visitors had the ball in the back of the net just before the half-hour mark, but Olivier Giroud was flagged for offside in a marginal call. Jorginho pinged the ball over the top for the striker, but as he slotted home on the angle, the flag was raised and the goal ruled out. Willian went close with another free-kick in the 35th minute. His curling effort deflected off the crossbar before going wide, although a corner was given - to the dismay of the home fans - as Guaita did not touch the ball as he attempted to make a stretching save. From the corner, Willian tested Guaita, who did push it away this time, before Ross Barkley put a header onto the crossbar from a second delivery. Team news Crystal Palace made one change with Jeffrey Schlupp replacing Max Meyer. Chelsea made two changes as Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud came in for Mateo Kovacic and Pedro. Alvaro Morata started on the bench. Chelsea did find the net five minutes into the second half. David Luiz pinged a ball over the top for Kante, who got behind Patrick van Aanholt to collect before sending the ball rolling past Guaita, with the Palace goalkeeper getting a fingertip to the ball but not enough to keep it out. Giroud had the ball in the net for a second time in the 74th minute, but he was once again penalised for offside in another tight call. Willian played him through and he hammered the ball home, but the linesman had his flag up and it was ruled out. Giroud got his foot caught under the body of James Tomkins as he struck and injured his ankle, which resulted in him being replaced Alvaro Morata not long after. Crystal Palace looked the most threatening in the final 10 minutes and could have snatched a late equaliser in the 89th minute. Luka Milivojevic floated a free-kick into the area, which was headed down for Wickham by Tomkins. He controlled with his chest despite some tight marking from Rudiger and managed to get a toe to the ball but sent it just over the crossbar from close range. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"I thought we worked as hard as we could work and we were playing a very good team who made it difficult for us to disturb their passing rhythm... I don't know if we could have done much more in terms of our approach to the game. We played against a very good side and they were much better than we were.\" 2:51 Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson admitted his side were second best in their 1-0 defeat to Chelsea Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson admitted his side were second best in their 1-0 defeat to Chelsea Maurizio Sarri: \"I like that we were in full control of the match for 85 minutes. We moved the ball very well and fast, especially in the second half. \"I think we need continuity, in the results and the performances. We need continuity in motivation and, as a consequence, in determination on the pitch, because in the last months we had some difficulties to find continuity.\" 4:53 Chelsea boss Mauricio Sarri says his side controlled the game but was critical of Ross Barkley's performance Chelsea boss Mauricio Sarri says his side controlled the game but was critical of Ross Barkley's performance Opta stats Crystal Palace failed to record a single shot on target in a Premier League home game for the first time since March 2017 vs Watford. Chelsea have won three consecutive Premier League away games for the first time under Maurizio Sarri, last doing so in April under Antonio Conte. Only Tottenham (9) and Liverpool (8) have won more away Premier League games this season than Chelsea (7). Chelsea's N'Golo Kante scored his third league goal of the season - his best-ever return in a single campaign in the top five European leagues. Jorginho put in another solid performance for Chelsea on Sunday Man of the match - Jorginho Although it was far from a vintage performance from Chelsea, Jorginho continues to show his importance to the side. He played some world-class passes, especially in the first half, and had the most passes of any players on the pitch. With Kante going forward more often - and scoring - he pulled the strings in the middle of the park and did well to limit Crystal Palace's quick attacking players throughout the game. What's next? Crystal Palace's next game will be on Wednesday January 2 when they travel to Wolves in the Premier League.

Burnley, who had lost six of their last seven league games, dominated the opening 45 minutes and went ahead when Ashley Barnes' flick-on found Wood, whose powerful near-post shot beat Lukasz Fabianski (15). McNeil then grabbed his first professional goal, sliding in to score at the far post (34) when Ashley Westwood returned Issa Diop's poor clearance into the box. After half-time, Barnes and Wood both missed marvellous chances to increase Burnley's advantage before Tom Heaton pulled off a stunning late save to deny substitute Andy Carroll, and leave the hosts inside the Premier League relegation zone only on goal difference. Player ratings Burnley: Heaton (7), Bardsley (8), Mee (8), Tarkowski (7), Taylor (7), Gudmundsson (6), Westwood (9), Cork (8), McNeil (8), Wood (7), Barnes (8) Subs: Vokes (n/a) West Ham: Fabianski (6), Antonio (4), Ogbonna (5), Diop (4), Cresswell (5), Snodgrass (5), Noble (5), Rice (6), Anderson (5), Perez (4), Arnautovic (5) Subs: Diangana (6), Carroll (6), Silva (6) Man of the match: Ashley Westwood Burnley made it clear they were over their 5-1 hammering by Everton on Boxing Day immediately from kick-off - and inside 90 seconds, Barnes sidefooted a great chance wide of the near post from McNeil's cross. West Ham were surprisingly sluggish and were deservedly put to the sword by Wood with 15 minutes gone through a brilliant counter-attacking move. Westwood's long ball from midfield was nodded on by Barnes, and with Diop out of position, Wood slipped in to receive the ball and fire in the opener. Burnley's dominance looked fragile without further goals, but 10 minutes before half-time they added a second courtesy of some calamitous defending. Dwight McNeil had played just 107 minutes of Premier League football prior to the game West Ham failed to clear two crosses in quick succession before a third was scuffed away by Diop to Westwood, who curled it back into the box and McNeil slid in at the far post for his first Burnley goal. A pair of half-time changes gave the visitors a little more bite in attack, but their defensive woes did not improve, and Barnes was guilty of another big miss when he fired wide moments after the restart. Barnes went closer when he turned Wood's cross goalwards from close-range but Fabianski dived well to keep his effort out. Team news Burnley boss Sean Dyche rang the changes from the Boxing Day defeat to Everton, bringing in five new faces including Tom Heaton for his first appearance since September 2017. There were two changes for West Ham from the win at Southampton, with Marko Arnautovic fit to start and captain Mark Noble also returning. The goalkeeper showed quick reactions again soon afterwards to race off his line with Wood clean through on goal, and the striker's rushed miss owed everything to his presence of mind. At the other end West Ham put Burnley's box under increased pressure in the second half but Heaton's only save of note came in the final minutes, albeit a crucial one. Burnley's Chris Wood celebrates scoring his side's first goal of the game Carroll looked certain to halve the deficit when he headed Aaron Cresswell's ball back towards the near post, until Heaton stuck out a strong hand to deny the forward from point-blank range. While Burnley were left celebrating a much-needed win at the full-time whistle, West Ham were busy ruing a missed opportunity which could have taken them seventh in the Premier League but instead sees them end 2018 in 11th. Opta facts Burnley have won two of their last three home league games, more than they had in their previous 10 at Turf Moor (W1 D2 L7). West Ham have lost two of their last three Premier League games (W1), more than they had in their previous eight in the competition (W5 D2 L1). Burnley's Tom Heaton kept a clean sheet on his first Premier League start in 476 days, last starting in the competition in September 2017 against Crystal Palace. Aged 19y 38d, Dwight McNeil became the first ever teenager to score a Premier League goal for Burnley. Burnley striker Chris Wood has scored in all four of his Premier League appearances against West Ham, netting five goals in total. Burnley striker Chris Wood's five Premier League goals against West Ham account for 38% of his total strikes in the competition (5/13). Second half substitute Andy Carroll was responsible for 45% of West Ham's total shots in this match (5/11). Man of the match - Ashley Westwood Westwood was truly outstanding in a Burnley midfield which has come in for plenty of criticism after recent defeats, getting the hosts on the front foot as much as he could and providing the kind of quality passes which Wood and Barnes were only too happy to feed off. Ashley Westwood proved a handful for the West Ham defence throughout the 90 minutes As well as putting in as many good crosses as anyone on the pitch (3, joint with McNeil), he had the best pass completion in the opposition half of any Burnley player, at 85.2 per cent, and made three key passes. His playmaking was superb and he and central partner Jack Cork dominated the midfield battle throughout. What's next? Burnley travel to fellow Premier League strugglers Huddersfield on Wednesday at 7.45pm, the same time as West Ham host Brighton at the London Stadium."},{"date": "30/12/2019", "arena": " Mary's

Manchester City Manchester City rallied from successive defeats to reassert themselves in the Premier League title race with a 3-1 win over Southampton at St Mary's. David Silva's 10th-minute opener was scant reward for City's slick early play, yet Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - who was later sent off - threatened another troubling afternoon for the champions when he lashed Saints level (37). But the game turned back decisively in a dramatic end to the first half as James Ward-Prowse, after being denied a penalty, diverted into his own net (45), before Sergio Aguero struck (45+3) to seal a result that lifts City back into second. Pep Guardiola's side had surrendered the title initiative to Liverpool during a cheerless December featuring three league defeats, but they head into Thursday's showdown with the leaders seven points behind, knowing victory in front of the Sky Sports cameras could trim an ominous gap to four points.

Subs: Jesus (6), Walker (n/a), Sane (n/a). Man of the match: David Silva Guardiola had talked up his stuttering side's stats ahead of the game and they started with purpose, David Silva forcing a fine save from Alex McCarthy before slotting past him soon after when namesake Bernardo and Riyad Mahrez combined. James Ward-Prowse goes down under a challenge from Oleksandr Zinchenko Charlie Austin dithered when through on goal just moments before the breakthrough and City's bravado at the back might have been punished but Saints were camped in by City's one-touch weaving, Aguero thwarted by McCarthy after another sweeping move down the right. See Man City and Liverpool go head to head on Sky Sports Premier League. A shift in momentum was unexpected but it came as Austin forced Ederson into a fine save with a flicked header, before Hojbjerg robbed Oleksandr Zinchenko of the ball and rifled into the roof of the net. Sergio Aguero celebrates scoring Manchester City's third goal Team news Key defensive midfielder Fernandinho shook off a thigh problem to return for Man City, but Kevin De Bruyne missed out again. Pep Guardiola made five changes from the 2-1 loss at Leicester, with Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Riyad Mahrez starting. Southampton handed 18-year-old defender Kayne Ramsay his debut while Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg returned in midfield and Mohamed Elyounoussi played off Charlie Austin in attack. Guardiola slumped into his seat but the game suddenly lurched back in his side's favour. Ward-Prowse called for a penalty after tumbling under close attention from Zinchenko but straight up the other end, unwittingly prodded Raheem Sterling's cross beyond his goalkeeper. Aguero met Zinchenko's cross minutes later and Southampton hope, having been swiftly snuffed out, never looked like reigniting. City bossed the ball after the break but though Sterling had a series of opportunities - denied on one occasion by McCarthy's head - and Aguero hit a post, they were unable to add further gloss to the scoreline. The tiring Saints finished with 10 men as Hojbjerg saw red (85) for a meaty challenge on Fernandinho but the game was long gone, home supporters streaming out as City's travelling fans warned Jurgen Klopp's Reds: \"We'll fight to the end.\" Man of the match - David Silva Back in the starting XI, Silva opened the scoring and was City's chief creator in a largely dominant first half. He crafted four chances, was accurate with 91 per cent of his passes and has now scored home and away against the same side in a single season six times (Arsenal 13-14, Newcastle 14-15, Stoke 17-18, Swansea 17-18, WBA 14/15, Southampton 18/19). Opta stats Manchester City have won five consecutive Premier League games against Southampton for the first time. Southampton have lost back to back Premier League home matches for the first time since September 2017 under Mauricio Pellegrino. Man City have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 10 competitive matches - their longest streak since a run of 10 ending in February 2015. Man City's Bernardo Silva has been directly involved in 10 goals in 19 Premier League games this season (5 goals, 5 assists), equalling his total in 2017-18 in 35 games (6 goals, 4 assists). Southampton's starting XI vs Man City today had an average age of 24 years & 274 days; their youngest in a Premier League match for five years (Dec 2013 vs Newcastle).

United beat Bournemouth 4-1 at Old Trafford to maintain Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's 100 per cent start as caretaker manager. Pogba had United ahead on five minutes, finishing off from close range after magnificent skill by Marcus Rashford, and he added a second on 33 minutes, heading home a wicked Ander Herrera cross ahead of Asmir Begovic. Rashford got in on the act with a deft touch on the stretch from Anthony Martial's brilliant lofted pass (45), but United failed to keep a clean sheet for the eighth straight game as Nathan Ake's header made it 3-1 (45+2). Marcus Rashford turns away in celebration after scoring Manchester United's third goal Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (7), Young (7), Lindelof (7), Bailly (5), Shaw (7), Herrera (7), Matic (6), Pogba (9), Lingard (7), Rashford (9), Martial (8). Subs: Lukaku (6), Pereira (NA), Jones (NA) Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Cook (5), Ake (6), Daniels (5), Ibe (5), Stanislas (5), Brooks (5), Surman (5), Rico (5), King (5), Wilson (5). Subs: Fraser (5), Mousset (5), Mings (NA) Man of the match: Paul Pogba Romelu Lukaku scored two minutes after being introduced (72), converting Pogba's lifted pass, but Eric Bailly was dismissed for a rash challenge on Ryan Fraser (79). The result means United are now eight points off fourth place in the Premier League following their third straight win under Solskjaer, while Bournemouth are 12th. Having scored eight in their previous two games, there was a confident air around Old Trafford, and it did not take long for United to get going again. In a tight situation near the right corner flag, Rashford skilfully flicked past Ake then Diego Rico before getting into the area to square for Pogba to slide home from six yards. Team news United made four changes from the side that beat Huddersfield; Martial came in for Mata, Young returned for Dalot, Bailly got the nod over Jones and Herrera replaced Fred. Fraser and Lerma dropped out of the Bournemouth line-up, replaced by Ibe and King, while Rico came in for the injured Francis at left-back. Pogba celebrates his early goal with team-mates Rashford then nearly had a goal for himself as his half-volley deflected off Ake's face and whistled wide, while at the other end Ake himself saw a close-range header from a corner deflect goalwards off Herrera, only for David de Gea to produce a reflex save. Just as Bournemouth looked to be finding their feet, Pogba struck again. Latching onto Herrera's fine, curling cross, the Frenchman piled in to head on the stretch as Begovic struggled to punch clear. Pogba has now scored four goals in his last two Premier League appearances under Solskjaer, as many as he had in his previous 20 under Jose Mourinho. It was 3-0 just before the break as Rashford arrived between defenders at the far post to slide home Martial's superb ball from the right with the outside of his boot, but there was still time for Ake to pull a goal back before half-time with a near-post header from David Brooks' lifted cross. Romelu Lukaku celebrates his goal after coming on as a second-half substitute The tempo slowed slightly after half time, with Rashford's effort blocked by Begovic at his feet, until Lukaku's introduction on 70 minutes. Letting the ball run across his body as he got on the end of Pogba's through ball, the Belgian poked past Begovic from 15 yards for a much-needed goal, just his third in 18 appearances. Pogba then hit the bottom of the left-hand post from 20 yards via a stunning touch from Begovic, before Bailly found himself in trouble, sent off by Lee Mason for a nasty scissor challenge on Fraser. Man of the match - Paul Pogba All eyes were on Pogba yet again as the post-Mourinho era looked to be favouring him most, and as Jamie Carragher said after his second goal: \"I hope Jose isn't watching!\" Pogba was dominant on Sunday, gliding through midfield on the ball and working back well without it. He had more shots (five), key passes (three), touches (99), opposition half passes (61) and won possession more times than any of his team-mates. As the Frenchman admitted himself after the game, there is still work to do. Pogba now must prove he is a superstar against top-six opposition. Pogba strikes a pose after giving Manchester United an early lead The managers Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"First half, you go out attack the game, high tempo, high energy, win the ball back, but the response from their goal was great. Second half was excellent, managing the game so much better than we did against Huddersfield for example. \"You always look for improvements, we're looking for that clean sheet, we can't switch off for one second, in this league. But I have to say it's a very, very good performance. Crowd was enjoying it, but then again Newcastle, the next one, is a challenge. A different kind of test.\" Manchester United caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer shakes hands with Paul Pogba at the final whistle Eddie Howe: \"Tough game. Disappointing performance from us. We weren't every quite right in the game I felt, we conceded early and it was very difficult from that moment onwards. \"Technically and defensively below the usual level, hence we got punished.\" The pundit - Jamie Redknapp \"It's a big ask but of course United can challenge [for top four]. The last thing Chelsea and Arsenal wanted to see was this kind of United again because they are free-flowing and full of confidence and have got a lot of good players. They are right in the equation for the top four. Chelsea are of course hot favourites still but United can do it.\" Opta stats Manchester United have recorded three consecutive Premier League victories for the first time since a run of five in April. No side have kept fewer clean sheets in the Premier League this season than Manchester United (2, also Fulham). Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is only the third United manager to win his first three league games in charge of the club, after Matt Busby and Jose Mourinho. United striker Marcus Rashford has provided six assists in 17 Premier League appearances this season; as many as in his previous two seasons combined (77 apps). Paul Pogba is the first Man Utd player to score at least twice in consecutive Premier League appearances since Wayne Rooney in December 2012. What's next?

Highlights: Brighton 1-0 Everton Jurgen Locadia's instinctive 59th-minute strike was enough to seal a hard-fought 1-0 victory for Brighton against Everton at the AMEX Stadium. The Dutchman had scored just once in his first 18 appearances for the Seagulls, but his second goal in as many games was enough to end a four-match winless run for the hosts. Player ratings Brighton: Button (7), Duffy (7), Dunk (8), Montoya (7), Bernardo (7), Stephens (6), Gross (6), March (7), Propper (6), Andone (7), Locadia (7). Subs: Murray (6). Everton: Pickford (7), Digne (6), Coleman (6), Keane (6), Zouma (6), Mina (5), Gueye (6), Gomes (5), Walcott (5), Bernard (6), Richarlison (6). Subs: Sigurdsson (6), Niasse (5), Calvert-Lewin (5). Man of the match: Lewis Dunk. Everton struck the woodwork on two occasions as Richarlison and Kurt Zouma were both denied as they searched for an equaliser in the second period. The result consolidates Brighton's position in 13th, but they are just two points off Everton in 10th. It was the perfect gift for manager Chris Hughton, two days shy of celebrating his fourth anniversary in charge of Brighton. Jurgen Locadia's strike was enough for Brighton to beat Everton Team news David Button replaced Mat Ryan in goal for Brighton while Hughton also opted to recall striker Florin Andone in place of Glenn Murray. Lewis Dunk was back from suspension and straight into the side in place of Leon Balogun, who dropped to the bench. Everton made two changes to the side that beat Burnley as Idrissa Gueye and Richarlison returned while Gylfi Sigurdsson and Dominic Calvert-Lewin dropped to the bench. The hosts were without a win since beating Crystal Palace at the start of the month, and they rode their luck at times to deny an Everton side that failed to sparkle as they had in beating Burnley 5-1 on Boxing Day. Jordan Pickford did well to punch clear under pressure from Florin Andone after an inviting low cross from Pascal Gross before Yerry Mina blocked Locadia's follow-up in Brighton's only chance of the first half. Everton lacked a cutting edge after failing to capitalise on a mistake by David Button on his first Premier League start, with the goalkeeper spilling Theo Walcott's cross but Richarlison could not take advantage, with Shane Duffy clearing his shot off the line. Richarlison had a shot cleared off the line in the best chance of the first half Moments later, an error from Duffy allowed the lively Richarlison to run through on goal, but his shot was parried by Button before Seamus Coleman's rebound was blocked by Lewis Dunk. The interval came at a good time for Brighton, who re-emerged with far greater energy and penetration. A sharp turn from Davy Propper resulted in Zouma being forced into a last-ditch tackle on Andone. Pickford was then forced into a smart save to deny Andone with a close-range header from Gross' cross, but he was powerless to keep the ball out from Brighton's next corner. Andrew Madley consulted with his assistant before awarding Brighton the opener Gross' delivery was inadvertently directed into the path of Locadia by Andre Gomes, and the former PSV Eindhoven striker swivelled to shoot past the England goalkeeper. Referee Andrew Madley initially ruled the goal out for offside, but after consulting his assistant, the correct decision was made. Everton immediately came within inches of an equaliser as Richarlison's shot went through the legs of Bernardo, but was brilliantly tipped onto the post by Button. Silva introduced Gylfi Sigurdsson and the Iceland midfielder's free-kick with three minutes remaining found Zouma, but the Chelsea loanee could only crash his header against the crossbar as Brighton stood firm. The managers Chris Hughton: \"Your first thought when you see the flag go up is that it's been disallowed. When you're that far away, you're not quite sure what's happened. But it very quickly became obvious to everybody, and the reaction of our players that it had come off their player. \"There will be numerous incidents where the referee is in the wrong place - even when the reaction of our players says it should go in our favour. If you don't see it, it's very difficult to give it, so it was very good officiating.\" 4:02 Brighton manager Chris Hughton says he was pleased with his side's honesty and says they deserved their 1-0 win on the balance of play against Everton in the Premier League Brighton manager Chris Hughton says he was pleased with his side's honesty and says they deserved their 1-0 win on the balance of play against Everton in the Premier League Marco Silva: \"We were unlucky with the deflection off Andre and it gave the chance to Locadia. We had control for the rest of the game, but that's football. They scored one goal and we didn't score with our chances. \"It was a tough match but not with great intensity. It was not our best performance with the ball, but in the last 15 minutes, we were more ourselves, and we know they are strong with the set pieces. We had the ball, but we didn't create big chances.\" 3:22 Everton manager Marco Silva says his side lacked intensity and did not take their chances after their 1-0 defeat against Brighton in the Premier League Everton manager Marco Silva says his side lacked intensity and did not take their chances after their 1-0 defeat against Brighton in the Premier League The pundit Paul Merson: \"It was a slightly fortuitous winner, but it was great refereeing. Brighton are just phenomenal at what they do, to be where they are in the league. \"I thought Everton were poor. I don't know if Silva made the right decision putting Sigurdsson on the bench. For me, he's the first name on the team sheet and then you go from there. \"If I was an Everton fan and I was travelling there after Christmas, travelling all that way and you're not playing Sigurdsson, I'd want my money back.\" 1:23 Paul Merson analyses Everton's poor performance against an impressive Brighton Paul Merson analyses Everton's poor performance against an impressive Brighton Opta stats Brighton have only lost two of their last 13 Premier League games on home soil (W6 D5), scoring at least once in each fixture. Everton are without a win in each of their last eight Premier League away games against south coast teams (D3 L5), since a 3-0 victory against Southampton in August 2015. This was Brighton manager Chris Hughton's first Premier League win against Everton since February 2013 (2-1 in charge of Norwich), having lost each of his previous five such games before today (D2 L3). Brighton kept their first clean sheet in the Premier League since October (1-0 v Wolves), ending a run of nine consecutive games without one. Everton haven't won back-to-back away games in the Premier League since September 2016 (under Ronald Koeman). Jurgen Locadia has scored in each of his last two Premier League appearances for Brighton, one more than he netted in his first 18 outings in the competition (1). Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford has conceded 15 goals in the Premier League in December, as many as he had in August, September, October and November of this season combined (15). Man of the match - Lewis Dunk Everton came into the game full of confidence after a five-star display at Burnley. But Marco Silva tinkered with a winning line-up as Richarlison was recalled. Lewis Dunk kept Richarlison quiet during a commanding performance The Brazilian was unfortunate not to score during a period of dominance in the opening period, but his growing frustration was largely due to the presence of Dunk, on his return to the side following suspension. It is no coincidence the Seagulls celebrated their first Premier League win in five games with Dunk back alongside Shane Duffy, with the centre-back winning countless aerial balls and making crucial blocks as Brighton kept a first clean sheet in 10 games.

Huddersfield Fulham 1-0 Huddersfield Aleksandar Mitrovic's injury-time strike saw Fulham beat Huddersfield 1-0 in the battle of the basement sides at Craven Cottage on Saturday. There was huge relief for the hosts after Aboubakar Kamara had a late penalty saved by Jonas Lossl, with the substitute having grabbed the ball off top-scorer Mitrovic in order to take the spot kick. However, that 83rd-minute miss was soon forgotten as Mitrovic drilled home a 91st-minute winner, the Serbian's first goal in seven matches and eighth in total this season. Player ratings Fulham: Rico (6), Odoi (8), Mawson (6), Ream (6), Christie (7), Chambers (6), Cairney (6), Seri (5), Bryan (7), Vietto (5), Mitrovic (7) Subs: R Sessegnon (7), Le Marchand (6), Kamara (6) Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Durm (7), Schindler (6), Zanka (6), Kongolo (6), Hadergjonaj (6), Lowe (6), Billing (6), Hogg (7), Pritchard (7), Mounie (6) Subs: Kachunga (6) Depoitre (6) Man of the match: Denis Odoi As a result, Claudio Ranieri's team moved up to 18th in the Premier League and are just a point from safety, while Huddersfield remain bottom of the table. Huddersfield may have started the better of the two struggling sides, dominating both possession and territory before the break in west London. Aboubakar Kamara (right) and Aleksandar Mitrovic got in a heated dispute over who should take Fulham’s late penalty It was the home team who created the better openings, though, with leading-scorer Mitrovic twice going close from right-wing corners, only for his far-post headers to miss the target. Ranieri made a double change at the break and while the switches gave the hosts more attacking edge, the contest appeared to be petering out for a draw, until late drama unfolded down by the Thames. Team news Fulham made two changes from their Boxing Day draw with Wolves, with captain Tom Cairney and Luciano Vietto coming in for Andre Schurrle and Aboubakar Kamara, who dropped to the bench. The Terriers, meanwhile, made three changes from their 3-1 loss at Man Utd on Boxing Day, with Jonathan Hogg, Chris Lowe and Steve Mounie all recalled. And Elias Kachunga, Isaac Mbenza, Laurent Depoitre were subs. Firstly, Fulham were awarded a penalty when Chris Lowe was judged to have handled Kamara's shot in the box after Joe Bryan's miss-hit cross had deceived Lossl and hit the bar. However, following a dispute over who should take the spot kick, with Kamara winning the argument, the substitute then saw his weak effort easily saved by Lossl, diving to his left. 7 - Huddersfield Town are the first team to lose seven Premier League games in a single calendar month since Leicester City in April 2001 (also seven).

From the substitute's wonderful pass, there was the ever-willing Mitrovic to drill the ball through the advancing Lossl's legs and send the Cottage into pandemonium. ⚽ Aleksandar Mitrovic scored his 1st PL goal in 28 goal attempts (5 today) & 7 games since netting a brace against Southampton on November 24.

Huddersfield failed to score in 20 Premier League matches during 2018 - more than any other side. During 2018, Aleksandar Mitrovic scored 20 league goals for Fulham - seven more than any other Cottagers player. Since the start of last season, only Lukasz Fabianski (4) has saved more Premier League penalties than Huddersfield goalkeeper Jonas Lossl (3). Huddersfield striker Steve Mounie had two shots in this game without success, taking his tally to 32 without scoring in the Premier League this season - the most of any player. None of Fulham's last 158 home league matches have ended goalless. Managers Claudio Ranieri: \"The man who should shoot the penalty is Mitrovic, and Kamara did not respect me, the club, the team-mates, the crowd, anybody. He take the ball and want to shoot the ball, it is unbelievable. I want to kill him.\" 1:37 Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri says he was relieved after his side's late win but was disappointed with Aboubakar Kamara, who took the ball of Aleksandar Mitrovic for Fulham's missed penalty Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri says he was relieved after his side's late win but was disappointed with Aboubakar Kamara, who took the ball of Aleksandar Mitrovic for Fulham's missed penalty David Wagner: Obviously it's a low point. Not only because we've lost seven in a row but how we lost it. It's a heavy loss we've conceded (at Fulham). We will need for sure a little bit longer than only 30 minutes afterwards to deal with it. \"December wasn't our month, obviously. But for me it's not possible to think so quickly after the game about the transfer window or the next game. I have to reflect.\" 2:07 David Wagner was left frustrated after Huddersfield conceded a last-minute goal in the 1-0 defeat to relegation rivals Fulham David Wagner was left frustrated after Huddersfield conceded a last-minute goal in the 1-0 defeat to relegation rivals Fulham Man of the Match - Denis Odoi The experienced defender has come in for criticism for some of his displays with his side struggling this season. However, against Huddersfield, the Belgium international was back to the sort of form he showed as the Cottagers won promotion to the Premier League last season. The 30-year-old was a dominating presence in the hosts' back line, breaking up opposition attacks, before helping to launch attacks with his accurate passing into midfield. Ranieri will need more such performances from the Belgian between now and the end of the season if Fulham are to beat the drop. What's next? Fulham take on Champions League-chasing Arsenal at the Emirates on Tuesday afternoon, while Huddersfield host fellow-strugglers Burnley on Wednesday night."},{"date": "29/12/2019", "arena": "The King

Cardiff's win over Leicester in the Premier League Highlights from Cardiff's win over Leicester in the Premier League Victor Camarasa's superb injury-time strike gave Cardiff their first Premier League away win of the season as they beat Leicester 1-0 on Saturday. The game looked to be heading for a goalless draw when the Real Betis loanee curled home from just outside the area in the 92nd minute, giving Cardiff their first three points on the road. Leicester had a penalty saved in the 75th minute, with James Maddison - who was tugged back by Sean Morrison - seeing his spot-kick pushed away by Neil Etheridge before Sol Bamba helped clear the rebound. Cardiff have now moved up a place into 16th - two places and four points ahead of the drop zone - while Leicester drop a place into eighth. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Chilwell (6), Maguire (6), Pereira (7), Soyuncu (7), Mendy (7), Ndidi (7), Maddison (7), Albrighton (6), Gray (7), Vardy (6). Subs used: Ghezzal (5), Iheanacho (4), Okazaki (4). Cardiff: Etheridge (7), Manga (7), Morrison (6), Bamba (7), Cunningham (5), Gunnarsson (6), Hoilett (7), Camarasa (8), Arter (7), Murphy (7), Paterson (6). Subs used: Harris (5), Reid (n/a), Peltier (n/a). Man of the match: Victor Camarasa It was nearly a terrible start for Cardiff as Greg Cunningham went close to scoring an own goal inside six minutes. Demarai Gray slipped the ball through for Marc Albrighton, with Cunningham getting ahead of the latter. However, his touch back to Etheridge was heavy, missing the goalkeeper and just trickled past the far post. Not long after and Maddison went close. He rounded Aron Gunnarsson and Harry Arter in the middle of the park before driving towards goal. With five goals so far this season, he tried his luck, and forced Etheridge to tip it around the post. Team news Leicester made two changes with Caglar Soyuncu and Demarai Gray coming into the side for Wes Morgan and Hamza Choudhury. Cardiff made six changes with only Neil Etheridge, Bruno Ecuele Manga, Sean Morrison, Sol Bamba and Roberto Camarasa keeping their places. The Cardiff goalkeeper was the busier of the two in the first half, and made two fine saves in quick succession. Ricardo Pereira scored a stunning goal against Man City on Boxing Day and went close again in the 27th minute, but Etheridge leapt to keep it out. Not long after, Maddison tested him with a curling free-kick but he was once again there to deny him. The second half began in the same vein with Etheridge keeping Leicester at bay. Just minutes after the restart, the goalkeeper got down low to stop a shot from Pereira before Cardiff nearly scored in their own net once again. Gray fired in a cross from the left flank and Morrison got there ahead of any Leicester players to see it away, although could well have diverted it past Etheridge. Cardiff tested Kasper Schmeichel for the first time in the 67th minute. Caglar Soyuncu's mistake allowed Josh Murphy to burst forward before striking, but the Leicester goalkeeper got down low to save. Not long after, Junior Hoilett struck, but his effort pinged off the foot of Harry Maguire before Murphy put the rebound wide. James Maddison competes for the ball with Aron Gunnarsson Leicester were awarded a penalty in the 74th minute after Morrison tugged the shoulder of Maddison and sent him to ground. With Jamie Vardy substituted not long before, Maddison took the penalty, but Etheridge went the right way to save before Bamba managed to get the ball away from the feet of Maddison - who was poised to strike - with a superb clearance. Cardiff then snatched the victory in the second minute of four added on. Rachid Ghezzal was dispossessed by Arter on the left-hand side, with the Cardiff midfielder picking out Bobby Reid in the area. He then cut it back for the waiting and unmarked Camarasa, who curled home a wonderful strike into the top far corner to give the visitors their first away win of the Premier League season. The managers Claude Puel: \"We managed our game without conceding chances until the goal at the end of the game. It's harsh for my players because they gave their best and we deserved another result. It is not a fair result but it is football and we were unlucky. \"We missed a penalty in our good period, we needed to score but a draw today was the minimum and losing is a big disappointment.\" 3:12 Leicester boss Claude Puel felt his side deserved more from the match Leicester boss Claude Puel felt his side deserved more from the match Neil Warnock: \"I'm really pleased and I'm proud of the lads because I thought we played some good stuff. I thought we deserved it today, we got the late goal, but I thought we shaded it a bit. \"If we had a little bit more clinical finishing in the last third, I think we could have to put it to bed. But all credit to them, it took a penalty save to keep us in the game.\" 2:57 Cardiff manager Neil Warnock felt his side deserved the three points as they beat Leicester Cardiff manager Neil Warnock felt his side deserved the three points as they beat Leicester Opta stats Leicester have lost two of their last three home Premier League matches against newly promoted sides (W1). Cardiff boss Neil Warnock has won two of his last three away league matches against Leicester City (D1), having lost six of his previous seven visits there (D1). Leicester have lost their final Premier League match in each of the last two calendar years, losing 1-2 to Liverpool last season and 0-1 to Cardiff today. This was Cardiff's third away Premier League clean sheet of the season - as many as they managed during the entirety of their last top-flight campaign in 2013-14. Man of the match - Victor Camarasa Victor Camarasa scored the winning goal for Cardiff at the King Power Stadium Camarasa was the best player on the pitch for Cardiff at the King Power Stadium and he rounded it off with an absolutely superb strike. He was the shining light in much of Cardiff's attacking play with delightful passes all over the pitch and good set-piece deliveries. On loan from Real Betis, he has performed well throughout the season for Cardiff and now has two goals in three Premier League games for the visitors. They will surely want a permanent deal for him when the time arrives. What's next? Both sides are in action live on Sky Sports on New Year's Day.

After a slow start, Harry Kane celebrated being awarded an MBE this week with a sensational strike to break the deadlock 22 minutes in - his 13th goal of the season, taking him level with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the top of the Premier League Golden Boot race. Spurs sat back after their opener, happy to soak up Wolves pressure, but they were caught cold by Willy Boly, who headed an equaliser with Wolves' first effort on target in the 78th minute to leave Wembley stunned. Wolves were not done there either, as late goals from Raul Jimenez (83) and Helder Costa (87) earned them a surprise victory, leaving Spurs trailing leaders Liverpool by nine points. Wolves climb from 11th to seventh after a first win in three games.

The England striker carried the ball down the right flank, cut inside onto his left before arrowing an effort into the net from 25 yards, leaving Patricio with no chance. Son Hueng-Min then went close with another excellent from range as Spurs remained in command until the interval. Team news Dele Alli was fit to start having passed a fitness test. Lucas Moura was the man to make way. Three other changes, all at the back, for Spurs from Boxing Day's win with Davinson Sanchez, Kieran Trippier and Ben Davies replacing Danny Rose, Kyle Walker-Peters and Juan Foyth. There was a first start for Leander Dendoncker for Wolves, with Ivan Cavaleiro and Ruben Neves also coming in. Joao Moutinho, Morgan Gibbs-White and Romain Saiss dropped out. After the break, Wolves stepped up the tempo but struggled to create any real chances of note, with Spurs happy to sit back and take their foot off the gas. That tactic proved foolish, as Boly climbed highest to head Joao Moutinho's corner into the net to equalise. It got worse for Spurs late on as Jimenez picked up a pass from Ivan Cavaleiro, who span on the spot, before guiding a fine finish past Hugo Lloris to turn the match on its head. Costa's 87th-minute finish, having latched on to an intricate throughball from Matt Doherty, completed the win for Wolves, as doubts over Spurs' longevity in this Premier League title race reared their head once again. 2:59 Mauricio Pochettino admits the heavy fixture schedule caught up with his Tottenham players as they lost 3-1 at home to Wolves Mauricio Pochettino admits the heavy fixture schedule caught up with his Tottenham players as they lost 3-1 at home to Wolves The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"You need to play not only with quality but with energy and it was difficult to find energy.

Wolves recorded their first Premier League win over Spurs since February 2010 (1-0 under Mick McCarthy), having gone winless in their previous five meetings in the competition (D2 L3). This was only the third time that Spurs have lost a Premier League home game by 2+ goals under Mauricio Pochettino - the other two were against Liverpool (0-3 in August 2014) and Manchester City (1-3 in April 2018). Spurs suffered a Premier League home defeat after opening the scoring for the first time since May 2016 (1-2 v Southampton). Wolves have only lost two of their seven Premier League games against 'big six' opponents this season (W2 D3 L2), managing to avoid defeat in each of their three away games (W1 D2). Man of the match - Raul Jimenez Jimenez cut a frustrated figure in the first half as he was starved of service, but the sign of a good striker is taking your chance when it comes, and Jimenez's brilliant spin and finish in the box, with defenders all around him, decided this game. Only Son had more shots at Wembley, as Jimenez kept plugging away, and worked tirelessly up front on his own for the cause. What's next?

up to ninth in the Premier league table as substitute Abdoulaye Doucoure scored a late equaliser in their 1-1 draw against Newcastle. Salomon Rondon gave the visitors a surprise lead in the first half (29) shortly after Gerard Deulofeu squandered a great opportunity to put the hosts in front. But Watford grabbed a deserved equaliser through substitute Doucoure (82), who converted his powerful header from close range. The result means Watford are four points behind sixth-placed Manchester United on 28 points, while Newcastle are 15th. Player ratings Watford: Foster (7), Janmaat (6), Mariappa (5), Cathcart (6), Masina (6), Capoue (5), Quina (6), Pereyra (6), Hughes (6), Success (7), Deulofeu (6) Subs: Deeney (7), Doucoure (7), Holebas (6) Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Yedlin (4), Fernandez (5), Lascelles (6), Dummett (6), Ritchie (7), Diame (6), Hayden (6), Atsu (6), Perez (5), Rondon (7) Subs: Schar (5), Shelvey (6) Man of the match: Abdoulaye Doucoure Watford started the game stronger and Deulofeu was presented with a glorious chance to give them the lead in the 16th minute. Roberto Pereyra's fine floated ball put the former Barcelona forward into a one-on-one position, but Martin Dubravka did well to block his shot aimed for the bottom corner. Although Javi Gracia's side looked the more likely team to take the lead, it was the visitors who broke the deadlock thanks to Rondon. The Venezuela international sneaked into a gap between Craig Cathcart and Adam Masina at the far post and converted Matt Ritchie's early cross by powering his header past Ben Foster for his fifth Premier League goal of the season. The goal seemed to rattle the Watford defence as Rondon had the ball in the net 10 minutes later, but it was chalked off for offside. Watford did create another good chance through Isaac Success shortly before half-time, but his venomous strike was batted away by Dubravka. Team news Javi Gracia made six changes. Daryl Janmaat, Adrian Mariappa, Adam Masina, Domingos Quina, Will Hughes and Isaac Success entered the starting XI. For Newcastle, Christian Atsu, Ayoze Perez and Salomon Rondon came in for Kenedy, Yoshinori Muto and Joselu. With Newcastle starting the second half on the front foot, and Ritchie looking particularly lively for the visitors, Gracia elected to bring on Troy Deeney and Doucoure in search of an equaliser early on - and the decision paid off. Deulofeu delivered a fine cross from the right flank for the unmarked Doucoure, who steered his header into the top corner. Watford continued to press for the winner in the final few minutes with Success' tame effort landing into the grateful arms of Dubravka as Newcastle held on for a precious point. Opta stats Watford have drawn a Premier League match at home for the first time since April, having won six and lost five of their last 11 matches before today. Newcastle have now won just one of their last seven league games (D3 L3), following a sequence of three straight wins prior to this run. Watford have picked up just nine points from their last 10 Premier League matches (P10 W2 D3 L5), 10 fewer than the number they amassed in the previous 10 such games before this run (P10 W6 D1 L3 - 19 points). Despite conceding late, Newcastle United have only lost one of their last six away games in the top-flight (W2 D3), this after suffering five defeats in the previous seven matches on their travels beforehand. Watford's Gerard Deulofeu has had a direct hand in four goals in his last four Premier League games (two goals, two assists), as many goal involvements as in his previous 36 games combined. Newcastle striker Salomón Rondón has scored five goals in his last eight Premier League matches, as many strikes as in his previous 30 such games in the competition. The managers 2:31 Watford head coach Javi Gracia felt the changes he made to his side were justified as Watford fought back to earn a 1-1 draw with Newcastle. Watford head coach Javi Gracia felt the changes he made to his side were justified as Watford fought back to earn a 1-1 draw with Newcastle. Javi Gracia: \"It was a difficult game. We knew before the start that after conceding the goal it was even more difficult but we had the possession. We knew we would have the possession but it wasn't enough to control the game all the time. \"We created good chances in the beginning and when they scored their goal it was more difficult for us. We tried until the end. We crated some new chances and we scored one goal for the draw.\" 2:21 Rafael Benitez was pleased with the effort and work-rate of his players as Newcastle drew 1-1 with Watford. Rafael Benitez was pleased with the effort and work-rate of his players as Newcastle drew 1-1 with Watford. Rafael Benitez: \"It's frustrating. You have to give credit to our players because they're working so hard trying to do the things that we wanted them to do. \"We did well against a good team and they are where they are in the table because they have some good players and the play well. I'm happy with the effort and the work rate of everyone.\" Man of the Match - Abdoulaye Doucoure With Watford looking relatively uninspiring going forward after going a goal down, Doucoure helped swing the game in the hosts' favour when he was introduced off the bench early in the second half. He combined well with fellow substitute Deeney to cause the Newcastle defence problems and capped his performance off with a crucial equaliser in the 82nd minute as he displayed his goalscoring prowess once again. What's next? Watford travel to Bournemouth on January 2. Newcastle, meanwhile, host Manchester United on the same evening."},{"date": "29/12/2019", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 53326, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Alisson

hat-trick as Liverpool surged nine points clear at the top of the Premier League with a thumping 5-1 victory over Arsenal at Anfield. With Tottenham having lost to Wolves earlier in the day, it looked like Arsenal might do their north London rivals - and Manchester City - a favour when Ainsley Maitland-Niles put them ahead in the 11th minute. However, Liverpool responded in devastating fashion with two goals in 90 seconds from Firmino and then a third from Sadio Mane in the 32nd minute.

Liverpool now turn their attentions to a showdown with title rivals Manchester City on Thursday, live on Sky Sports. Depending how City fare against Southampton on Sunday, Liverpool could end the week 13 points clear of the champions, or only four. Having seen Spurs slip up against Wolves, it looked as though Liverpool might be in for a tricky evening as Alex Iwobi crossed for Maitland-Niles to put Arsenal ahead in the 11th minute. Roberto Firmino celebrates after completing his hat-trick But the lead didn't last long as Liverpool responded with two goals in 90 seconds from Firmino. The first was fortuitous as Arsenal tried to clear in their own box and the ball rebounded kindly for Firmino, who scored with a no-look finish into an empty net. Firmino scored with a no-look finish for Liverpool Firmino then made it 2-1 in the 16th minute when he shimmied past two tackles and fired a shot into the bottom corner. Anfield was rocking and Liverpool extended their advantage in the 32nd minute. Arsenal cleared a corner to Andy Robertson on halfway and his long ball forward was passed across the box by Salah for Mane to finish. Salah made it 4-1 in first-half injury-time when he rifled a penalty past Bernd Leno after being clumsily fouled by Sokratis. Sadio Mane celebrates scoring Liverpool's third goal Aaron Ramsey spurned a chance for Arsenal early in the second half when he was unable to finish in the box. However, Arsenal's defence continued to look creaky and they conceded a fifth when Sead Kolasinac was penalised for a push on Dejan Lovren and Firmino converted the penalty. Team news Liverpool made one change from their win over Newcastle as Fabinho replaced Henderson. Mustafi returned in defence for Arsenal and Ramsey, Maitland-Niles and Iwobi also started. Ozil missed out with a knee injury. Liverpool eased up late in the game but went close to scoring again as Jordan Henderson shot narrowly wide and Leno saved a toe-poked shot from Salah. Opta stats Arsenal versus Liverpool is now the highest scoring fixture in Premier League history (155 goals). Liverpool have accrued 54 points from their opening 20 Premier League games this season; when assuming three points for a win, only Chelsea (55 in 2005-06) and Manchester City (58 in 2017-18) have ever had more at this stage in English top-flight history. Arsenal conceded four goals in the first half of a Premier League game for the fourth time, with Liverpool responsible for two of those (Feb 2014 and today, as well as Man Utd in Feb 2001 and Chelsea in March 2014). Liverpool are now unbeaten in 31 Premier League games at Anfield (W22 D9), their joint-longest ever unbeaten home run in the competition, having also gone 31 without defeat between December 2007 and August 2009. Liverpool fell behind in a Premier League game at Anfield for the first time since 30th December 2017 against Leicester City, 364 days ago. Arsenal are now without a win in their last 20 away league games against fellow \"big-six\" opposition (D7 L13), losing 10 of their last 12 such matches (D2). Roberto Firmino has been directly involved in 11 goals in his eight Premier League games against Arsenal for Liverpool (8 goals, 3 assists), more than he has against any other opponent in the competition. Roberto Firmino's hat-trick is the sixth to have been scored in fixtures between Arsenal and Liverpool in the Premier League - the most hat-tricks in a single fixture in Premier League history. Liverpool's Roberto Firmino has become the third Brazilian player to score a Premier League hat-trick, after Robinho (for Man City v Stoke in Oct 2008) and Afonso Alves (for Middlesbrough v Man City in May 2008). Man of the match - Roberto Firmino The striker scored his first Liverpool hat-trick to put Arsenal to the sword. While there was plenty of fortune in the first goal, Firmino showed excellent skill and control to create the second and then finish past Leno. He then added a third from the penalty spot to complete the rout. What's next? Liverpool can strengthen their title chances when they travel to Manchester City on Thursday, live on Sky Sports.

Their woes looked set to worsen early on, but Redmond could only shoot straight at West Ham goalkeeper Fabianski. The visitors grew into the match, however, and had the best chance of the half with Aaron Cresswell squaring a perfect pass for Lucas Perez, but the West Ham striker scuffed wide from point-blank range. Team news West Ham have a number of injury issues at the moment and made five changes for this game, as well as only naming six substitutes. Zabaleta, Balubuena, Masuaku, Noble and Hernandez dropped out, with Ogbonna, Cresswell, Obiang, Diangana and Perez starting. Southampton only made one change from their win over Huddersfield with Lemina replaceing Hojbjerg. After the break, the hosts stepped it up a gear and soon had themselves in front. Oriol Romeu's strike was well saved by Fabianski, it came out to Danny Ings and Redmond, who appeared to be offside, but Grady Diangana was deep, playing them both on. Romeu bundled the ball back towards goal before Redmond got the final touch on the goal line under a challenge from Angelo Ogbonna. Nonetheless, the in-form Anderson lifted the visitors with an immediate equaliser out of nowhere, arrowing a fine strike into the net from distance, catching Alex McCarthy out at his near post. Then, with Saints pressing for a goal down the other end, West Ham countered at pace, Michail Antonio squared for Anderson, who again finished superbly to complete the turnaround. Saints pressed for a leveller, with Lemina denied by a fine save from Fabianski, but the visitors held out to get back to winning ways after their pre-Christmas defeat to Watford. Opta stats Southampton have dropped 15 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season; the most of any team in the competition, with 12 of those coming in home games. West Ham have won five of their last six games in the Premier League (L1) - their previous five wins in the competition came over a run of 20 games between April and November. This was West Ham's first Premier League away win after conceding the opening goal since May 2017, when they won 2-1 against Burnley at Turf Moor. Southampton have suffered back-to-back Premier League defeats against West Ham for the first time since October 2001 (a run of four). West Ham have won 15 points in the Premier League in December (P6 W5 D0 L1); their most in a single month of a season in competition history. Man of the match - Felipe Anderson The big-money summer signing had a very quiet first half, and was wayward with much of his passing, but a sign of a real quality player is being able to turn it on when it really counts, and his goals of real quality, when his side were trailing is further proof why West Ham decided to splash the cash in the close season. Seven goals in his last nine league games has helped see West Ham climb the table, and should he continue in this vain of form, expect the Hammers to continue their rise. What's next?

Wolverhampton Wanderers left Craven Cottage with a 1-1 draw on Boxing Day. Ryan Sessegnon came off the bench to open the scoring after 74 minutes, the 18-year-old's first Premier League goal at home for Fulham. However, Claudio Ranieri's side could not keep hold of the lead, with Saiss levelling matters with a close-range finish with only five minutes left to play. Player ratings Fulham: Sergio Rico (6), Odoi (6), Mawson (7), Ream (6), Christie (5), Chambers (7), Seri (6), Bryan (6), Kamara (5), Mitrovic (9), Schurrle (6) Subs: Ryan Sessegnon (7), McDonald (6), Cairney (7) Wolves: Rui Patricio (6), Bennett (6), Coady (7), Boly (5), Doherty (7), Joao Moutinho (7), Saiss (7), Jonny (6), Traore (5), Jimenez (7), Gibbs-White (6) Subs: Ivan Cavaleiro (7), Helder Costa (7), Ruben Vinagre (6) Man of the match: Aleksandar Mitrovic As a result, Fulham moved off the foot of the table and remain four points from safety, while Wolves stay 10th. Fulham went into the game on the back of their first clean sheet of the season at Newcastle on Saturday. But that new-found defensive solidity was tested early on when Denis Odoi made a hash of an attempted clearance and handled the ball, although referee Andre Marriner deemed it accidental. Ryan Sessegnon is mobbed by team-mates after Fulham take the lead The home side created the better openings before the break, only for Aleksandar Mitrovic to spurn them. The Serb headed Andre Schurrle's inviting centre just off target when well placed, before somehow failing to get a toe on Cyrus Christie's driven ball across the six-yard box and then shooting too close to Rui Patricio after selling an outrageous dummy to escape Willy Boly. What would VAR have changed? The extra official would have been busy in the first half and it would be interesting to see whether he would have given a penalty to the visitors after Odoi’s early handball, while Chambers may also have been in trouble with the VAR after two naughty tackles. The visitors will feel their task should have been made easier by the sending off of Calum Chambers but, despite two questionable tackles, the Fulham holding midfielder was only yellow carded once before the break. Fulham took advantage of that stroke of luck to make a crucial breakthrough with just 16 minutes to go after Alfie Mawson did well to head Jean Seri's lofted free kick across the box, forcing Patricio to punch clear under pressure from Odoi. Team news Wolves made one change from the side that lost 2-0 to Liverpool last Friday, with Morgan Gibbs-White replacing Ruben Neves, who dropped to the bench. It was also one change for Fulham from their goalless draw at Newcastle last time out, with Aboubakar Kamara coming in for Tom Cairney, who was a sub, while Ryan Sessegnon returned to the bench following a groin strain. However, the ball dropped straight at the feet of Sessegnon, who did well to fire it back through a posse of Wolves players in the six-yard box and into the back of the net. Fulham's lead lasted just over 10 minutes before Wolves drew level after a lovely team goal involving Joao Moutinho and Ivan Cavaleiro down the left flank, with the latter firing an inviting ball across the six-yard box. Saiss equalises for Wolves Fellow substitute Helder Costa reached the centre at the far post, with Saiss in the right place to convert from virtually on the line, the Morocco international's first Premier League goal for Wolves. Mitrovic almost won it in the last minute, only for Wolves captain Conor Coady to scamper back to make a last-gasp goal-line clearance as Fulham's winless run stretched to six matches. .@RyanSessegnon scores his 1st home @premierleague goal@FulhamFC top scorers since his Aug 2016 debut: 2️⃣5️⃣ Ryan Sessegnon 2️⃣1️⃣ Stefan Johansen 1️⃣9️⃣ Tom Cairney 1️⃣9️⃣ Aleksandar Mitrovic#FULWOL pic.twitter.com/9FxBaOiOwD — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) December 26, 2018 Opta stats Fulham have conceded in all but one of their last 23 Premier League fixtures Wolves have lost just one of their last eight Premier League games in London (W3 D4) Wolves have scored 75% of their Premier League goals in the second half of their games this season (15/20), the highest proportion in the competition This was Wolves' 100th league game played on Boxing Day, making them just the second side to play as many on the date (after West Bromwich Albion) Fulham's Ryan Sessegnon has scored his first league goal as a substitute since August 2016, when he netted his first-ever goal for Fulham against Cardiff, 858 days ago Since his league debut in August 2016, Ryan Sessegnon has been directly involved in more league goals (inc. playoffs) than any other Fulham player (23 goals, 14 assists) At 18 years and 221 days old, Fulham teenager Ryan Sessegnon is the third youngest player to score in the Premier League on Boxing Day, after James Milner (16y 356d in 2002) and Michael Owen (18y 12d in 1997) Man of the Match - Aleksandar Mitrovic Where would struggling Fulham be without their talismanic captain, who was a thorn in the visitors' back line all afternoon long at the Cottage?

Highlights from Everton's 5-1 win at Burnley in the Premier League. Lucas Digne scored twice as Everton secured their first win in six Premier League games by thumping Burnley 5-1 at Turf Moor. Marco Silva's side responded emphatically to their 6-2 defeat to Tottenham on Sunday, with Yerry Mina's header giving them the perfect start (3), before Digne stretched their lead with a fine free-kick (13). Gylfi Sigurdsson made it 3-0 from the spot in the 22nd minute, after Ben Mee was adjudged to have handled inside the box, before Ben Gibson pulled a goal back for the hosts from close range eight minutes before half-time.

Subs: Gueye (n/a), Davies (n/a), Richarlison (7). Man of the match: Lucas Digne But Everton quelled the fightback and re-established their three-goal cushion in the 71st minute when the impressive Digne fired past Joe Hart from 25 yards - and there was still time for substitute Richarlison to add a fifth in stoppage time (90+3). It is only the third time that Everton have scored five goals in an away Premier League game and the first time since a 5-2 win at Sheffield Wednesday in April 1996. The win moves the Toffees back up to eighth in the table, while Burnley remain 18th, three points adrift of safety. Burnley did the double over Everton as they achieved a seventh-placed finish last season, but those days seem a long time ago now with pressure mounting on manager Sean Dyche. Team news Phil Bardlsey, Kevin Long dropped to the bench as Ben Gibson and Matthew Lowton returned to the starting XI. Sam Vokes replaced Chris Wood in supporting Ashley Barnes. Marco Silva dropped Richarlison to the bench following the 6-2 defeat to Tottenham with Bernard recalled to the side. Yerry Mina replaced Tom Davies as Everton reverted to a back three. His side went behind after more slack defending inside three minutes as Yerry Mina - on his return to the Everton side having missed the defeat to Tottenham - rose unmarked to head in Bernard's cross. If the first goal was avoidable, there was very little Hart could do about Everton's second as, after Dominic Calvert-Lewin had been unceremoniously brought down by Jack Cork, Digne brilliantly lifted his 25-yard free-kick over the wall and beyond the fingertips of the former England goalkeeper. Everton were clearly intent on making a statement three days after that Spurs humbling, but they were gifted the opportunity of stretching their lead when Mee inexplicably lifted his hand to take the ball off Mina's head just nine minutes later. Referee Michael Oliver did not hesitate in pointing to the spot, and Sigurdsson - who had already missed two penalties this season against Fulham and Watford - sent Hart the wrong way to notch his ninth goal of the campaign. Mina leads the celebrations as Gylfi Sigurdsson makes it 3-0 from the spot Burnley were in need of a response before half-time and it duly arrived when Gibson, on his first Premier League start since joining from Middlesbrough last summer, directed the ball over the line from close range after Michael Keane had initially kept James Tarkowski's header out on the goal line. But that was as good as it got for Burnley, as Digne's well-struck shot from Bernard's pass ended any hopes of a comeback, and Richarlison heaped more misery on Dyche with virtually the final kick of the game as he received Sigurdsson's pass to poke his shot low into the net beyond Hart. The managers Sean Dyche: \"It was a very difficult afternoon for us. Mainly for the first half an hour of the game. \"After a poor start with the tempo of the game - they came out with a really hard tempo - and we didn't deal with that. There were sloppy goals and sloppy moments. The big moment of the game from our point of view was Tarky [James Tarkowski]'s miss. \"If that goes in, they've just conceded six, it could've been a nervous time for them. But it didn't and the rest is how it shows in the scoreline.\" 2:01 Sean Dyche says Burnley conceded 'sloppy' goals in their 5-1 defeat at home to Everton.. Sean Dyche says Burnley conceded 'sloppy' goals in their 5-1 defeat at home to Everton.. Marco Silva: \"It's football. When we win one match, always the face is different.

We scored early in the last game too and we kept focus with their direct football.

Everton manager Marco Silva says his side were well prepared to face Burnley as they won 5-1 at Turf Moor. Opta stats Burnley have already conceded 41 goals in the Premier League this season after 19 games, two more than they shipped in the whole of last season (39). At one minute and 39 seconds, Yerry Mina's goal for Everton was the quickest Premier League goal on Boxing Day since 2014 when both Harry Kane and Adam Johnson both scored within the first minute. Yerry Mina's opener (1m 39s) was the quickest Premier League goal by an Everton player since Tom Davies scored against Leicester after 30 seconds in April 2017. Burnley goalkeeper Joe Hart has conceded 41 goals in 19 games in the Premier League this season; only in 2009-10 (42 in 36 games) did he ship more in a single campaign in the competition. Gylfi Sigurdsson has scored 12 Premier League goals for Everton since the start of last season, more than any other player. Richarlison has netted nine goals in 17 Premier League appearances this season with Everton, four more than he scored with Watford last season (five in 38 appearances). Man of the match - Lucas Digne Having seen their six-game unbeaten run at home come crashing to an end against Tottenham, a visit to Turf Moor might not have been classed as the ideal place for Everton to look for a response. But in Digne, a player who is playing club football through the winter for the first time in his career, Everton had the touch of class needed to make a tough assignment a procession. Lucas Digne was the stand-out performer for the Toffees at Turf Moor The former Barcelona full-back is developing a reputation as a set-piece specialist, and he not only added to his repertoire here, but showed his ability in open play with a fine second to end Burnley's hopes of recovery. Five of the eight goals scored by Digne in Europe's big-five leagues have come from outside the box, including each of his three for the Toffees. What's next? Burnley host West Ham at Turf Moor on Sunday at 2.15pm, while Everton travel to face Brighton a day earlier (kick-off 3pm) at the Amex Stadium."},{"date": "26/12/2019", "arena": "Selhurst Park",

Selhurst Park with a valuable point after Crystal Palace missed a host of chances in a 0-0 draw. Palace were unlucky not to take the lead in a dominant first half that saw Andros Townsend hit the bar and near misses from Wilfried Zaha, Luka Milivojevic and Townsend again. Cardiff struggled in the second half to resist a Palace onslaught but somehow stayed level thanks to the woodwork, some wayward finishing from Palace's strikers, and a series of saves by keeper Neil Etheridge. Zaha could not inspire the home side to victory Player ratings Crystal Palace: Guita (6), Van Aanholt (8), Tomkins (6), Sakho (6), Wan-Bissaka (7), Kouyate (7), Milivojevic (7), Meyer (6), McArthur (6), Townsend (7), Zaha (7) Subs: Wickham (4) Cardiff: Etheridge (8), Peltier (6), Bamba (6), Morrison (5), Bennett (6), Manga (6), Reid (7), Ralls (5), Camarasa (5), Harris (5), Hoilett (6) Subs: Artur (n/a), Gunnarsson (n/a) Man of the match: Neil Etheridge The result means that Cardiff stay out the relegation zone while Palace remain in 14th place. Palace could have taken the lead after just two minutes when Townsend hit the bar after fine work by Zaha to play him through. Townsend then had another great opportunity when Patrick van Aanholt set him up just outside the box, while Milivojevic, Zaha, and Aaron Wan-Bissaka also went close from distance. Bobby Reid and James Tomkins in action Team news Roy Hodgson made only one change to the side that beat Manchester City last weekend, with Cheikhou Kouyate coming in for Jeffrey Schlupp. Cardiff manager Neil Warnock made five changes to the team that lost 5-1 to Manchester United, with defender Joe Bennett returning to the side after an injury. Cardiff finally had chances through Junior Hoilett and Bobby Reid, but were very lucky to get into the break level after Palace continued to push for an opener. Zaha worked tirelessly in the second half to create chance upon chance for an Eagles side that struggled desperately for accuracy, and when they did hit the target they were met with the very safe hands of Cardiff stopper Neil Etheridge. Etheridge, however, was rooted when Milivojevic curled a free-kick in from 23 yards that struck the crossbar, and could only watch as Connor Wickham missed a glorious opportunity from six yards. Wilfried Zaha is challenged by Bruno Ecuele Cardiff had a chance of their own towards the end but were denied by a fine save from Vicente Guaita. Cardiff 'keeper Etheridge also pulled enough another fine save to deny Van Aanholt in the final minutes. The result means that Cardiff stay just afloat of the relegation zone, while Palace keep distance between themselves at the bottom in 14th, though they will be disappointed they didn't take all three points today. What the Managers said Palace manager Roy Hodgson: \"We really took the game to Cardiff, but they were defending doggedly and with a lot of players behind the ball and making it difficult for us of course, but to get 32 shots, 24 in the second half, and hit the cross bar, and force some saves, unfortunately it wouldn't find the net for us today.\" Cardiff manager Neil Warnock: \"We knew we were gonna be up against it, but I thought we prepared really good, I thought the lads were really in for it, and after that first ten minutes when we were a little bit apprehensive I thought we grew into the game before half time.\" We've shot ourselves in the foot so many times by giving away elementary goals, especially last week against Manchester United. We had to be a lot sharper and we changed things and i'm pleased we did now, we looked solid but we also looked capable of scoring.\" What's next? Palace have a three-day break before hosting Chelsea live on Sky Sports Premier League, while Cardiff visit Leicester on December 29.

The Portuguese defender fired brilliantly into the far corner from 20 yards from a cleared corner, meaning City have picked up just three points from their last four games. They did take the lead through Bernardo Silva's seventh of the season after Sergio Aguero's deft pass (14), but Leicester levelled shortly after through Marc Albrighton's controlled header from Jamie Vardy's pinpoint delivery (19).

Leicester, meanwhile, are up to seventh. Pep Guardiola's side were looking to bounce back following a 3-2 defeat by Crystal Palace on Saturday, and seemed to revert to type as Silva put them ahead. Aymeric Laporte fizzed a ball into Aguero in a central position, and his threaded pass allowed Silva to tuck past Kasper Schmeichel from 10 yards. But Leicester levelled just five minutes later with a fine move of their own as Vardy looked up on the left to curl a cross for Albrighton at the far post to head back where it came from and into the left corner. Team news Manchester City made three changes following the defeat by Palace; Danilo, De Bruyne and Aguero came in, replacing Walker, Otamendi and Jesus. Leicester were unchanged following their win at Stamford Bridge, with Vardy starting again. Bernardo Silva celebrates his goal with Sergio Aguero There was a flurry of chances late in the half; Aguero hooked over from close range, Vardy saw a one-on-one effort blocked at his feet by Ederson after Danilo's wild backpass, before Hamza Choudhury's effort at the far post was just touched away to safety by the goalkeeper. Manchester City had 68 per cent of possession in the second half but failed to create many clear-cut chances, as the Leicester defence and Harry Maguire, in particular, held firm superbly. That gave the hosts the platform to break, and after Leroy Sane had cleared Albrighton's corner, Pereira hit a fierce first-time effort into the left corner through a crowd of players and past Ederson's grasp for the winner. Manchester City pushed for a leveller, but their task was made harder as Delph's torrid day was rounded off by a late red, winning the ball in a challenge with Pereira, but leaving his studs in the defender's ankle. Danilo competes for a header with Wilfred Ndidi The managers Claude Puel: \"I think we deserve the result, because I think we get more chances than City. It's a fantastic result for the team, a good reward for the mentality and togetherness since the beginning of the season.\" 4:37 Leicester manager Claude Puel reflects on two wins against Chelsea and Man City Leicester manager Claude Puel reflects on two wins against Chelsea and Man City Pep Guardiola: \"The reality is there are two or three teams better than us, so they are better.

Leicester have won their last two Premier League games against 'big six' opposition, as many as they had in their previous 19 in the competition (W2 D2 L15). Manchester City have conceded a goal from their first shot faced in three of their last four Premier League matches (vs Chelsea, Crystal Palace and Leicester). Six of Guardiola's 11 Premier League defeats have come in the month of December. Man City's Bernardo Silva has had a hand in nine goals in his 18 Premier League appearances this season (5 goals, 4 assists), just one fewer than in his 35 games in the competition last term (6 goals, 4 assists). With Ricardo Pereira scoring for Leicester, and Bernardo Silva netting for Man City, this was the first time a Premier League match saw a Portuguese player score for both sides. Man of the match - Harry Maguire Leicester needed a mammoth defensive performance if they were to get a result against the champions, and they got it. It was all led by this man. He made a whopping 16 clearances, double any other player on the pitch, and won 86 per cent of his duels. What's next?

assists as Reds go six points clear at top 2:56 Liverpool 4-0 Newcastle Liverpool 4-0 Newcastle Mohamed Salah scored one and made another as Liverpool moved six points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 4-0 rout of Newcastle at Anfield on Boxing Day. Dejan Lovren's stunning 11th-minute half-volley gave Liverpool a half-time lead with one of the few first-half chances mustered against a stubborn Newcastle defence. But after the break the hosts turned their dominance into more goals, with Salah converting a penalty he won after Paul Dummett was harshly judged to have brought him to ground (47). Xherdan Shaqiri put the result beyond doubt by slotting home Trent Alexander-Arnold's low cross 11 minutes from time, and then, seconds after title rivals Manchester City had fallen behind in their game at Leicester, Fabinho headed in Salah's corner (85) to put Liverpool in firm control of the race for the Premier League trophy. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Lovren (9), Van Dijk (7), Robertson (7), Henderson (8), Wijnaldum (7), Salah (8), Shaqiri (8), Mane (7), Firmino (6).

Subs: Longstaff (6), Murphy (n/a). Man of the match: Dejan Lovren Had Joselu netted a fine early chance from Ritchie's cross it could have been a very different afternoon, but he headed into the ground and wide - and soon, normal Anfield service was resumed. A corner taken short to Andrew Robertson was whipped into the back post where Jamal Lascelles' weak header fell perfectly for Lovren, who smashed in his first goal of the season with a peach of a strike from 12 yards. Newcastle held out until the break as Jurgen Klopp's side failed to create clear chances, but after half-time it was one-way traffic and Liverpool found their clinical edge. Team news Liverpool saw Trent Alexander-Arnold replace the injured James Milner at right-back, with Xherdan Shaqiri and Giorginio Wijnaldum also back in. There were some six changes for Newcastle, who dropped Salomon Rondon and Ayoze Perez to the bench, and welcomed back Federico Fernandez in defence. Salah netted a penalty within three minutes of the re-start after ref Graham Scott judged Dummett's tug on the Egyptian's arm enough to award a spot kick. Newcastle survived several scares, with Sadio Mane and Shaqiri both going close before the latter ended a spell of relentless Liverpool pressure in the final third by turning in Alexander-Arnold's cross from a lovely first-time Jordan Henderson through ball. Fabinho's (right) goal was his first in Liverpool colours And with news filtering through that Manchester City were on the verge of a second shock defeat in four days, Fabinho turned in Salah's whipped corner to complete the scoring on a perfect afternoon for Klopp's side. Man of the match - Dejan Lovren Lovren's goal was his first since scoring against Brighton on the last day of 2017/18 The self-styled best defender in the world has had a tough time at Liverpool for much of his four years at Anfield, but his goal was the high point of another excellent performance from the World Cup runner-up since he came back into the starting line-up against Manchester United before Christmas. He took on more aerial duels than anyone else on the Liverpool team (9), winning six of them (also a Liverpool high), and made three clearances too. Opta facts Liverpool are only the fourth Premier League team to be unbeaten at the halfway stage of a season, along with Arsenal in 2003-04, Man Utd in 2010-11 and Man City in 2017-18. This was Newcastle's heaviest league defeat at Anfield against Liverpool since December 1987 (also a 0-4 loss). Jurgen Klopp registered his 100th win as Liverpool manager in all competitions in his 181st match as Reds boss. Mohamed Salah has been involved in 35 goals in 28 home Premier League games for Liverpool (25 goals, 10 assists). Newcastle United have now lost each of their last nine away Premier League matches against the 'big six' teams and have lost all six matches against the 'big six' this season. Xherdan Shaqiri has scored four goals in his last four Premier League matches - one more than he managed in the 20 prior to this run (3). Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 20 matches in December in all competitions (W16 D4), winning their last nine December games in a row. This was Liverpool's seventh win in all competitions during December 2018 - their most wins in a calendar month since September 1996 (also seven). Managers Jurgen Klopp: \"[The gap] means nothing. It's important how many points we have, not the others, because what is six points? It's nothing. We have to play them still, they are all strong, we have to play all of them again. 2:26 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp applauds his side for taking a six-point Premier League lead but says there is a long way to go. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp applauds his side for taking a six-point Premier League lead but says there is a long way to go. \"The first part of the season is over, and the second starts again in three days against Arsenal. It's a tough season, but so far a good season for us. We just have to keep on going.\" Rafa Benitez: \"The soft penalty in the game made the difference, we were in the game at 1-0 at half-time, but when we conceded the second goal it was more difficult for us to react against a very good team. 2:19 Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez says Mo Salah's penalty was the crucial moment in their 4-0 defeat at Liverpool. Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez says Mo Salah's penalty was the crucial moment in their 4-0 defeat at Liverpool. \"The second goal was crucial, it gave them more confidence and was more difficult for us, you have to take more risks, be more open then you make more mistakes and pay for that.\" What's next? Liverpool host Arsenal at Anfield on Saturday, in the 5.30pm late kick-off.

Highlights from Man Utd's 3-1 win over Huddersfield in the Premier League. Paul Pogba scored a second-half double to earn Manchester United a 3-1 win over Huddersfield in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first home game as interim manager. United laboured early on but got their breakthrough in the 28th minute with Nemanja Matic stabbing home his first league goal since March to settle the nerves around Old Trafford. Huddersfield pressed for a leveller in the second half, with Laurent Depoitre denied by a brilliant save from David de Gea, and that save proved decisive as Pogba stroked in United's second in the 64th minute, before making sure of the win 12 minutes from time from distance. Mathias Jorgensen's 88th-minute goal was a mere consolation as Huddersfield slipped to a sixth successive defeat, while Solskjaer has now overseen back-to-back wins since taking over from Jose Mourinho. Player ratings Manchester United: De Gea (8), Shaw (7), Lindelof (7), Jones (7), Dalot (7), Matic (8), Fred (5), Pogba (8), Lingard (6), Rashford (7), Mata (6). Subs: Herrera (7), Gomes (6), Young (6) Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Hadergjonaj (6), Zanka (6), Schindler (5), Kongolo (6), Mbenza (5), Durm (5), Billing (5), Kachunga (6), Pritchard (7), Depoitre (6). Subs: Quaner (6), Mounie (6), Lowe (6) Man of the match: Paul Pogba. With Anthony Martial missing through illness, United struggled to find any rhythm early on and could have found themselves behind in just the 12th minute, but Terence Kongolo blazed over from close range. Huddersfield were looking comfortable at the back, with United not really putting them under a great deal of pressure before, out of nowhere, Matic converted at the far post to break the deadlock after Victor Lindelof's header had been saved. Chants of \"Ole, Ole, Ole\" came booming down from the Stretford End in the direction of the jubilant United interim boss, whose mood could have been improved yet further had Diogo Dalot scored from a good position, after being brilliantly picked out by Marcus Rashford, but the young full-back side-footed wide. Team news There was no Anthony Martial in the squad for United, with the club revealing Martial had picked up an illness pre-match. Three changes in all, with Diogo Dalot, Juan Mata and Fred coming in for Martial, Ashley Young and Ander Herrera. Three changes for Huddersfield also from the side beaten at Southampton, with Laurent Depoitre, Elias Kachunga and Erik Durm coming in for Steve Mounie, Juninho Bacuna and Chris Lowe. Huddersfield came out with added impetus in the second half, and came within a whisker of a leveller through Depoitre, who flicked for the top corner, but De Gea flung himself across goal before clawing the ball out. That save proved to be a wake-up call for United, and two minutes later they doubled their lead. Rashford did well down the right, cut the ball back for Juan Mata, who burst into the middle before laying it off for Ander Herrera, who poked the ball across for Pogba to find the net from just inside the penalty area. 4 - Paul Pogba has been involved in four goals in two Premier League games under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (2 goals, 2 assists), the same total he had registered in his last 12 games under Jose Mourinho (1 goal, 3 assists). Upturn. pic.twitter.com/BzQA8KEHZo — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 26, 2018 That goal all-but ended Huddersfield's resistance, with Pogba adding his second to make sure of the win, firing a strike in at the near post to give United some breathing space and ensure the rest of the match was time for United to enjoy themselves. Jorgensen's late goal after reacting quickest to Steve Mounie's knockdown ruined De Gea's hopes of a rare clean sheet, but a second win in a row for Solskjaer remained intact nonetheless. The managers Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: \"That [De Gea save] was the defining moment of the game. It was one of the best saves I have ever seen. That was a big, big moment for us. \"He [Pogba] has got the attributes for scoring, and got a few assists last game. I was very pleased for him today. Paul is the same, he loves football and loves to go forward he has a big, big smile, and I have enjoyed working with him.\" 2:34 Manchester United caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reflects on a winning home debut against Huddersfield in the Premier League. Manchester United caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reflects on a winning home debut against Huddersfield in the Premier League. David Wagner: \"I think the performance was very good. There was effort, determination and decent football that the guys played. I do not know if one hand is enough to count all the clear-cut chances we had. \"We were unfortunately unable to use them. We could go in front very early on, where Terence Kongolo has a clear-cut chance and another just before half-time.\" 3:20 Huddersfield manager David Wagner says he was pleased with his side but 'world class' Paul Pogba showed how good he is as Manchester United won 3-1. Huddersfield manager David Wagner says he was pleased with his side but 'world class' Paul Pogba showed how good he is as Manchester United won 3-1. Opta stats Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is just the fifth Manchester United manager to win both of his first two league matches in charge, after TJ Wallworth, Matt Busby, Dave Sexton and Jose Mourinho. Huddersfield Town have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 15 away games against Man Utd in league competition (45 goals conceded). Manchester United haven't lost a home league game on Boxing Day since 1978-79 (0-3 versus Liverpool), winning 15 and drawing three since. Huddersfield are only the fourth team in Premier League history to lose six matches in one calendar month (Norwich April 1995, Wimbledon April 2000, Leicester April 2001). Man Utd's Jesse Lingard has been directly involved in six goals in his last five appearances in the Premier League (4 goals, 2 assists), assisting in consecutive games for the first time in his top-flight career. Man Utd midfielder Paul Pogba scored his first Premier League brace since netting twice against Man City in April at the Etihad. Man of the match - Paul Pogba Pogba has been involved in four goals in his last two games, and looks like a man reborn. Released from the Jose Mourinho shackles, Pogba needs no invitation to shoot, with his clinical finishing making all the difference against Huddersfield. His finish for the clinching third goal showed all his intelligence, and emphasised the wealth of ability he possesses. What's next?

Highlights from Tottenham's 5-0 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League. Tottenham made it 11 goals in three days and moved above Manchester City after hammering Bournemouth 5-0 on Boxing Day. Fresh from their 6-2 win over Everton, Spurs maintained their hot streak with goals from Christian Eriksen (16), Lucas Moura (35), Harry Kane (61) and a double from Heung-Min Son (23,70), which means the South Korean has now scored 10 goals in his last 10 games in all competitions. The victory moves Mauricio Pochettino's men up to second in the Premier League after City lost 2-1 at Leicester. Spurs are six points off leaders Liverpool. Player Ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Walker-Peters (8), Foyth (7), Alderweireld (7), Rose (7), Winks (7), Sissoko (7), Eriksen (7), Son (8), Moura (7), Kane (8) Subs: Llorente (N/A), Skipp (6), Davies (6) Bournemouth: Begovic (5), Francis (4), Cook (4), Ake (4), Surman (6), Lerma (6), Daniels (2), Wilson (5), Fraser (5), Stanislas (5), Brooks (5) Subs: Rico (4), Mousset (5) Man of the match: Kyle Walker-Peters Bournemouth's performance was littered with defensive mistakes and their skipper Simon Francis was stretchered off with a serious-looking injury. Both teams struggled to find an early rhythm but Eriksen changed that with one swing of his boot on 16 minutes. This strike was not as spectacular as his cute volley against Everton but it still found the net from 20 yards, via a wicked deflection off Jefferson Lerma. Team news Kyle Walker-Peters, Lucas Moura, Juan Foyth and Danny Rose all were handed starts while there was one change made by Eddie Howe after their victory over Brighton as Ryan Fraser came in for Josh King. Bournemouth then went to pieces. Charlie Daniels made a hash of a routine long ball and Kyle Walker-Peters nipped in to set up Son from the edge of the box. The South Korean looked full of confidence as he carefully curled one into the bottom corner. Walker-Peters was revelling in a rare start and set up Tottenham's third. Harry Winks picked him out with a great ball over Daniels and his subsequent pass was finished off from close range by Moura. Bournemouth threatened to make a game of it but a penalty appeal on Callum Wilson was turned down and Junior Stanislas had a goal rightly chalked off for offside. Any hopes of a sensational turnaround were dashed by Kane on 61 minutes. Eriksen played the quarterback role and chipped a wonderful pass over the top for Kane to chase and slide home from an acute angle. The scoring was not completed there as Son was on hand from three yards to bundle home after an almighty scramble inside the Bournemouth box. A cheer rang around Wembley as the Manchester City score was shown on the big screen. The Spurs go marching on. Man of the match: Kyle Walker-Peters After making a crucial mistake in the Nou Camp against Barcelona, this was a much-needed boost for the talented full-back, who was making his first start of the Premier League season. He set up all three goals in the first half, admittedly with a little help from the hapless Daniels. Who needs a transfer window when you have got this sort of back-up in the youth team? Kyle Walker Peters Opta stats Tottenham are still without a draw after 19 Premier League games this season - the last team to have as long a wait for a draw in a top-flight season were Arsenal in 1983-84 (also 19 games). Bournemouth's 5-0 loss to Tottenham is their biggest defeat in the Premier League and their largest in the league since a 6-1 loss to Watford in August 2013. Eddie Howe has lost six Premier League games against Tottenham, only losing more against Man City (7). Eriksen has scored 18 Premier League goals from outside the area - the most of any Tottenham player in the competition's history. Eriksen has assisted Kane 18 times in the Premier League - only Frank Lampard to Didier Drogba (24), Darren Anderton to Teddy Sheringham (20) and Steve McManaman to Robbie Fowler (20) have assisted a teammate more in the competition's history. Son has had a hand in 10 goals in his last nine Premier League appearances (7 goals, 3 assists). Manager reaction: Mauricio Pochettino \"I'm trying to keep balance in my emotions,\" Pochettino said when asked about moving above City in the table. \"The way that we work, is paying back now. It doesn't surprise me. We only focus on us, not the opponent. It doesn't mean too much to us to be second or third. The most important position is when you finish in May.\" Manager reaction: Eddie Howe \"It was strange game. We had a good moments in the match. But we didn't take them. It was unfortunate goal - it changes the mentality of the players and conceded poor goals. It was a bizarre game.\" What's next?

Brighton ended a three-game losing run as they fought back to claim a 1-1 draw with Arsenal at the Amex Stadium. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put the Gunners ahead in the seventh minute with his 13th Premier League goal of the season. But, after Mat Ryan made a sharp save to prevent Aubameyang from making it 2-0, Brighton levelled in the 35th minute when Arsenal failed to deal with a long pass over the top and Jurgen Locadia scored. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (7), Montoya (6), Duffy (6), Balogun (6), Bernardo (7), Stephens (7), March (6), Propper (7), Gross (5), Locadia (7), Murray (5) Subs: Andone (5), Knockaert (5) Arsenal: Leno (6), Kolasinac (6), Sokratis (6), Koscielny (6), Lichsteiner (6), Guendouzi (6), Xhaka (6), Torreira (6), Ozil (5), Lacazette (6), Aubameyang (7) Subs: Iwobi (5), Ramsey (5), Maitland-Niles (5) Man of the match: Davy Propper Arsenal's level dropped in the second half but Brighton were unable to take advantage, with Solly March and Locadia spurning their best chances. Brighton beat Arsenal 2-1 at the Amex last season but a repeat looked unlikely in the opening 30 minutes as the Gunners made a fast start. Ryan tipped over a lob from Aubameyang in the fourth minute before Brighton failed to clear their lines and Aubameyang finished with a curling first-time shot from inside the box. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates scoring the opening goal Brighton struggled to settle into the game and when they did get the ball in the net it was ruled out as Glenn Murray had kicked the ball out of Bernd Leno's hands. Ryan then made a fantastic save to deny Aubameyang before Brighton levelled after an Arsenal corner. Propper's long pass was flicked backwards by Stephan Lichtsteiner and Locadia nipped ahead of Leno and then finished into the empty net. Aaron Ramsey battles for possession with Pascal Gross Mesut Ozil was taken off at half-time but that did not appear to benefit Arsenal as they were unable to regain their early control of the game. Brighton had the better chances as Propper twice went close before March lobbed an effort over the bar from the edge of the box and then Locadia dragged a shot wide. Team news Duffy returned from suspension for Brighton and started along with Murray and Stephens. Arsenal made three changes as Lichtsteiner, Torreira and Koscielny replaced Monreal, Elneny and Maitland-Niles. Arsenal applied pressure late in the game but the closest they came was when a clearance deflected off Alex Iwobi and spun past the post. Opta stats Brighton have lost just two of their last 12 Premier League home games, winning five and drawing five. Arsenal have conceded in each of their last nine away Premier League games, only going longer without an away shut-out in the competition in a run of 11 ending in October 2010. Brighton haven't won any of their last 10 league games played on Boxing Day (W0 D4 L6), since beating QPR 1-0 in 2005-06. Arsenal failed to score in the second-half for the first time in their last 17 Premier League games, since losing to Chelsea on August 18th. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in 30 goals in his 32 Premier League appearances for Arsenal, scoring 23 and assisting seven. Since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's debut for Arsenal in February, no duo has combined for more Premier League goals than the Gabonese striker and Alexandre Lacazette (6, level with Bournemouth's Wilson and Fraser and Tottenham's Kane and Eriksen). Arsenal's Alexandre Lacazette has provided an assist in three consecutive games in Europe's big five leagues for the first time ever. Brighton's Jurgen Locadia scored for the first time in his last 18 Premier League games, since scoring on his debut in the competition in February against Swansea City, The managers Chris Hughton: \"We showed great character to get back into the game. If there was a team that was going to score in the second half, I felt it was going to be us.\" 2:38 Brighton boss Chris Hughton gives his reaction to Sky Sports Brighton boss Chris Hughton gives his reaction to Sky Sports Unai Emery: \"I think the key today was the first 45 minutes. We controlled the match like we wanted, we scored and had two good chances from Aubameyang to get the second - but their keeper saved. Then they equalised. From then, it gave us the second half to try again to control the match, create chances and be able to win - but we didn't do that.\" 2:50 Arsenal boss Unai Emery was disappointed after his side let their early lead slip Arsenal boss Unai Emery was disappointed after his side let their early lead slip Man of the match - Davy Propper Propper played a key role in helping Brighton get a point from the game. He was busy in shielding the back four and played several intelligent passes to help Brighton break. He looked like he had a good connection with former PSV team-mate Locadia, who also had a good game. What's next? Brighton host Everton on Saturday before a trip to West Ham on Wednesday, January 2.

Hazard netted his 100th goal for Chelsea in all competitions when he opened the scoring in the first minute of added time in the first half although, just over two minutes later, Roberto Pereyra equalised for Watford (45+3). The Belgian scored his second goal of the evening in the 58th minute after he won a penalty, with Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster bundling him over in the area. He then sent Foster the wrong way from the spot and ultimately sealed the win for Chelsea. It puts the Blues back in the top four in the Premier League table on 40 points after Arsenal's draw at Brighton had briefly seen them drop down to fifth. Watford remain in ninth.

Subs used: Hudson-Odoi (6), Barkley (n/a), Emerson (n/a). Man of the match: Eden Hazard. Chelsea had the first chance of the game in the 11th minute. Mateo Kovacic broke down the field before picking out Willian on the left flank. The Brazilian then cut inside - getting around the oncoming Foster - before trying to slot home on the angle but Christian Kabasele was there to see it behind. However, the Watford defender clattered into the upright with his armpit and was substituted not long after. Watford went close just after the half an hour mark, but a woeful finish from Abdoulaye Doucoure after a gut-busting run from Pereyra saw the ball fly high over the crossbar. Chelsea then had a chance at the other end, but Hazard was not able to turn a fizzing Cesar Azpilicueta cross home, trying to use his heel to turn it home. Team news Both Watford and Chelsea named unchanged XIs from their weekend fixtures. Chelsea made two changes on the bench with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Davide Zappacosta replaced by Callum Hudson-Odoi and Emerson. But the goals came thick and fast as four minutes of added time were shown. Hazard got his 100th Chelsea goal inside the first minute as Kovacic took advantage of a poor square pass from Etienne Capoue, picking out Hazard to the left. The Belgian then rounded the oncoming Foster before slotting home into an open net. Just over two minutes later - 137 seconds to be exact - and Watford were level. It came from a corner after Kepa Arrizabalaga did well to keep out Doucoure at the near post. Jose Holebas delivered the set-piece, which found an unmarked Pereyra at the top of the area and he hit an arrowing volley through the packed box into the bottom corner. Chelsea retook the lead 13 minutes after the restart after being awarded a penalty as Foster bundled into Hazard in the area. Hazard stepped up to take and sent the Watford goalkeeper the wrong way as he notched his second goal of the evening. Eden Hazard tucked home his 100th Chelsea goal to give the visitors the lead The visitors continued to go close as the game wore on, with Willian seeing an effort ping off the post in the 72nd minute after a lovely cross from Hazard before the Belgian was involved again not long after with a storming Chelsea break. He picked out Kante to his right, but with Watford defenders closing in, the midfielder could only send his shot past the far post. A minute later Doucoure put a lovely cross into the area for Troy Deeney - who had got ahead of David Luiz - but he did not catch the ball well and lifted it over the crossbar from inside the six-yard box as the game ended in defeat for Watford. Opta stats Chelsea have only lost one of their seven Premier League games against opponents that started the day in the top 10 this season (W3 D3), with that lone defeat coming against Spurs in November (1-3 at Wembley). After losing just three of their first 13 home league games under Javi Gracia (W8 D2), Watford have since lost three of their last four (W1). Eden Hazard became the 10th different player to have scored 100 goals in all competitions for Chelsea (now on 101). Watford midfielder Roberto Pereyra has scored three goals in three Premier League appearances against Chelsea - more than against any other opponent in the competition.

It was a vintage Hazard performance and he hit an important milestone with his century for Chelsea in all competitions. He continued to show why he is so important for the west London sides, being involved in many of the attacks, and he could well have had a hat-trick. But with three shots, two on target and two scored, it was still a successful evening and a late Christmas present for the Belgian, with Sky Sports pundit Alex Scott calling his performance 'absolutely superb'.

"2:59 Everton 2-6 Tottenham Everton 2-6 Tottenham Tottenham underlined their credentials as title contenders with a pulsating 6-2 victory over Everton at Goodison Park on Renault Super Sunday. Heung-Min Son and Harry Kane both scored twice in a devastating display of finishing from Mauricio Pochettino's side, which was capped by a stunning 20-yard volley from Christian Eriksen. Dele Alli was also on the scoresheet as Spurs consolidated third spot by moving five points clear of Chelsea, and closed the gap to leaders Liverpool and Manchester City to six and two points respectively. Theo Walcott had given Everton the lead on 21 minutes while Gylfi Sigurdsson momentarily threatened to spark a comeback when his second-half strike made it 4-2, but the Toffees, who remain in 11th place, conceded six in the league at home for the first time since August 2014. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (4), Coleman (5), Keane (5), Zouma (4), Digne (5), Gomes (5), Davies (5), Walcott (6), Sigurdsson (6), Calvert-Lewin (5), Richarlison (5).

Subs: Lamela (6), Skipp (5), Moura (n/a). Man of the Match: Heung-Min Son Spurs edged the opening exchanges but fell behind against the run of play as Sigurdsson capitalised on some hesitant defending and played the ball forward to Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose ball into the near post was dispatched by Walcott from 10 yards. Everton were harshly denied a quick-fire second as Calvert-Lewin's brilliant header into the far corner was chalked off after he was adjudged to have pushed Davinson Sanchez. Heung-Min Son put Tottenham 5-2 up with his second goal of the game Things took a turn for the worse shortly after as Everton gift wrapped Spurs their equaliser. Jordan Pickford unnecessarily raced off his line to clear a ball that Kurt Zouma was dealing with, the pair collided and Son fired into the unguarded net from a tight angle. One became two for Spurs on 35 minutes when Alli reacted quickest to convert a rebound after Pickford failed to parry a Son shot away from danger, and it was not long until Kane got in on act, stroking Tottenham's third into the net after a Kieran Trippier free-kick came back off the post. Team news Everton made two changes from their defeat to Manchester City as Theo Walcott and Tom Davies replaced Yerry Mina and Bernard. Mauricio Pochettino made four changes as Davinson Sanchez, Harry Winks, Christian Eriksen and Heung-min Son were recalled. A sumptuous volley from Eriksen just three minutes into the second half took Spurs' tally to four. Sigurdsson pulled one back for the Toffees with a well-taken effort on 51 minutes, but Spurs quickly extinguished any hopes of an Everton revival. Substitute Erik Lamela threaded Son, who was borderline offside, through on goal, and the South Korean slotted his second past Pickford. Kane scored twice against Everton for the fourth consecutive game Having got his second, Son turned provider on 74 minutes as he crossed from the left for Kane to convert his second and confirm a miserable afternoon for Everton. Opta stats Tottenham have won nine of their 11 Premier League away games this season - only in three completed seasons in the competition have they won more (10 in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2017-18). 2018-19 is the first top-flight season to see at least three clubs amass 40+ points by Christmas (Liverpool 48, Man City 44, Spurs 42) since the 1985-86 campaign. This was the third time Everton conceded six goals in a Premier League home game, with all of those coming against London clubs (1-6 vs Arsenal in August 2009, 3-6 vs Chelsea in August 2014). This was the fourth time Tottenham have scored 6+ goals in a Premier League away game, with three of those coming in the last three seasons, and twice against a side managed by Marco Silva. Under Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham have won more games (18) and more points (70) from losing positions than any other side in the Premier League. No player has made more errors leading to a goal in the Premier League this season than Everton's Jordan Pickford (3). Tottenham have never lost in the 36 Premier League games in which Dele Alli has scored for them (W30 D6 L0).

Tottenham Hotspur stormed to a 6-2 victory over Everton as braces from Heung-min Son and Harry Kane saw Spurs move just two points behind Manchester City who are in second place. You will have to go a long way to find a performance from Son that bettered his display at Goodison Park.

Aubameyang's 11th goal of the campaign handed Arsenal a half-time lead in the Premier League for the first time this season. The Gabon international then added a clinical second on the counter on 48 minutes to take his tally to 12 for the season. Ashley Barnes pulled a goal back for Burnley but Alex Iwobi's third in stoppage-time saw Arsenal end a two-game losing streak that moves them level with fourth-place Chelsea and leaves the Clarets in the relegation zone. Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (6), Sokratis (6), Elneny (6), Monreal (5), Maitland-Niles (6), Xhaka (6), Guendouzi (6), Kolasinac (8), Ozil (7), Lacazette (6), Aubameyang (8). Subs: Lichtsteiner (6), Torreira (5), Iwobi (6). Burnley: Hart (6), Bardsley (5), Tarkowski (5), Mee (5), Long (6), Taylor (6), Cork (6), Westwood (5), Hendrick (5), Barnes (6), Wood (5). Subs: Vydra (5), Vokes (5), Lowton (n/a) Man of the Match: Sead Kolasinac. A pulsating start saw both sides register attempts on goal in the opening three minutes, as Ainsley Maitland-Niles' low drive drew Joe Hart into a reflex save, seconds before Ashley Westwood's effort to flicked behind off the foot of Bernd Leno at the end of an immediate Burnley counter. Granit Xhaka called Hart into action on seven minutes with a curling effort from the edge of the area, and it was not long until the Arsenal pressure told. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates with Alexandre Lacazette Mesut Ozil, restored to the Arsenal line-up as captain, dissected the Burnley defence with a pass which Sead Kolasinac kept in play, allowing Aubameyang to drift into through the static defence to poke home into the far corner. Barnes and Sokratis Papastathopoulos were involved to two heated altercations before the interval, but the Gunners kept their heads to go into the break ahead for the first time in the league this season. Team news Mesut Ozil returned to captain Arsenal as Unai Emery made six changes to the side that lost at Southampton. Mohamed Elneny made his first PL appearance of the season while there were recalls for Alexandre Lacazette, Sokratis, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Sead Kolasinac. Chris Wood and Jeff Hendrick replaced Aaron Lennon and Robbie Brady as Burnley made two changes following their defeat at Tottenham. One became two three minutes into the second half as Kolasinac and Lacazette combined at pace on the counter, before Aubameyang clinically doubled his tally with a thunderous near-post drive. Burnley were competitive throughout without testing the Arsenal defence, but the visitors were gifted a route back into the game when the Arsenal defence failed to clear a cross into the box, and Barnes lashed home from six yards. Ashley Barnes reduced the deficit midway through the second-half Arsenal maintained a measure of control from there but made sure of the victory in stoppage-time when substitute Iwobi, played onside by Mathew Lowton, fired a third past Hart after Ozil's blocked shot deflected into his path. Opta stats Arsenal found themselves ahead in a Premier League game at half-time for the first time this season, last doing so against Huddersfield on the final day of last season. Courtesy of their 12 points, this is Burnley's worst top-flight campaign after 18 games since 1970/71, when they had accrued 10 at this stage (3pts for a win) and were ultimately relegated. Arsenal have won their last 28 home league games against sides starting the day in the relegation zone since a 4-4 draw with Tottenham in October 2008. Burnley boss Sean Dyche has lost all seven of his Premier League meetings with Arsenal, more defeats in the competition than he has suffered against any other side. Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in 19 goals in his 17 Premier League home games (14 goals, 5 assists). Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is the outright top-scorer in the Premier League this season, with 12 goals. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored 22 goals in his 31 Premier League appearances for Arsenal, five more than any other player for the club after 31 games in the competition (Thierry Henry next on 17). The managers 2:37 Arsenal manager Unai Emery claims his side were prepared for a tough physical challenge against Burnley in their 3-1 in the Premier League. Arsenal manager Unai Emery claims his side were prepared for a tough physical challenge against Burnley in their 3-1 in the Premier League. Unai Emery: \"We expected long balls, section actions, pushes - they also have good players and their attacking players created problems for us. And then we needed to impose our game plan, but we worked very well today, it was a tough match like we expected and we are happy with this victory. \"Physicality is part of football and you need to be physically strong. Both teams needed to impose themselves physically and with quality. We imposed our game plan in our moment and this victory is a consequence of this and we are pleased with this.\" 3:49 Burnley manager Sean Dyche was disappointed that Arsenal were not penalised on two occasions for diving in the Clarets' 3-1 defeat at The Emirates Stadium in the Premier League. Burnley manager Sean Dyche was disappointed that Arsenal were not penalised on two occasions for diving in the Clarets' 3-1 defeat at The Emirates Stadium in the Premier League. Sean Dyche: \"No one wants to see diving in the game. There was one with [Granit] Xhaka later in the game and I know he dives as he looks at the ref within a millisecond of going down in the box. I do not want to see that and I do not think anyone else wants to see that \"Ashley Barnes comes out of a tackle and their lad clearly elbows him, but our lad comes out with a booking, which is nearly impossible. There were two dives in the game and no one got a booking. One of them was already on a booking, so that's a red card.\" What would VAR have changed? It would have been interesting to see if the VAR would have agreed with Sean Dyche’s view that Burnley were denied a penalty when Sead Kolasinac pushed Burnley defender Kevin Long in the back in the second half. However, there is no doubt that Arsenal’s late third goal would have been disallowed for offside after Alex Iwobi had just strayed offside. Man of the Match - Sead Kolasinac Aubameyang may have scored two goals but the Kolasinac scooped the Sky Sports award. The Bosnian was resolute in defence against a Burnley side committed to making Arsenal fight from the first whistle. While his defensive quality has been up for debate, Kolasinac's quality in the other direction was evident for all to see. And when tempers flare, he was on hand with a mature performance was guided Arsenal back onto the winning path. What's next? Arsenal travel to Brighton for the teatime kick-off on Boxing Day, live on Sky Sports Premier League, while Burnley host Everton at Turf Moor earlier on that day."},{"date": "22/12/2019", "arena":

Bournemouth 2-0 Brighton David Brooks struck twice as Bournemouth eased to a 2-0 victory over 10-man Brighton at the Vitality Stadium. The midfielder gave the hosts the lead after 21 minutes when he drove through the heart of the visitors' defence before unleashing a low shot past Albion 'keeper Mat Ryan into the left-hand corner of the goal. Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic was regularly called into action in the first half and pulled off brilliant saves from Yves Bissouma and Lewis Dunk to keep the home side in the lead going into the break. The Cherries posed the bigger threat in the second 45 and, after Seagulls captain Dunk had been giving his marching order after picking up a second yellow card (73), a lovely, flighted header from Brooks (77) ensured the home crowd had plenty to cheer about. Both sides took their time to settle into the match and it was Brighton who had the first chance of note when Bissouma made space for himself inside the box before unleashing a low strike to the left, which forced Begovic to palm the ball away to safety. Yves Bissouma is yet to score for Brighton in 16 Premier League appearances The hosts counter-punched and Callum Wilson's well-placed header just lacked enough pace to test Ryan but, less than five minutes later, Brighton's defenders were guilty of allowing Brooks too much space as he gave Bournemouth the lead. Chris Hughton's side pressed for an equaliser, with Bissouma and Florin Andone continuing to look dangerous as they both went close, while Begovic was again called into action in spectacular fashion just before the break to divert Dunk's goal-bound header at full stretch. Having spent much of the second half of the first 45 minutes under the cosh, Bournemouth posed more of an attacking threat following the break with Junior Stanislas, Charlie Daniels and Brooks all causing problems. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (8), Francis (7), Cook (7), Ake (6), Daniels (7), Wilson (6), Lerma (6), Surman (6), Stanislas (7), Brooks (8), King (7). Subs: Fraser (6), Mousset (N/A), Ibe (N/A) Brighton: Ryan (5), Dunk (4), Bissouma (6), Locadia (5), Andone (6), Gross (4), Balogun (5), March (4), Montoya (5), Propper (5), Bernardo (6) Subs: Knockaert (5), Bong (5), Murray (N/A) Man of the match: David Brooks Brighton's abundance of crosses from the right were disappointingly poor as they failed to test Begovic - Solly March and Pascal Gross, in particular, guilty of not utilising the time and space being given to them. Dunk earned a tame first caution when the defender and Bissouma combined to stop Brooks from pressing forward and a more cynical clip on Stanislas saw him pick up his second yellow with just over 15 minutes left. Team news Eddie Howe's injury-ravaged side included Simon Francis after the Cherries captain recovered from the knock he suffered during the midweek League Cup match against Chelsea. Jefferson Lerma also returned in midfield, as Ryan Fraser dropped to the bench. Meanwhile, Chris Hughton made three changes from the Seagulls side that was beaten by Chelsea last time out in the Premier League. Florin Andone, Jurgen Locadia and Yves Bissouma all started having come on as substitutes in the previous league outing. Just four minutes later, the home side took advantage when substitute Ryan Fraser floated a lovely ball into the box and Brooks nodded the ball up and over Ryan to settle the contest into style. The victory was just the second in Bournemouth's last eight Premier League matches, while Brighton slipped to their third consecutive league loss.

Brighton have lost three consecutive Premier League games within a single season for the first time since December 2017. Bournemouth have seen their opponents pick up five red cards this season in the Premier League, more than any other side. Brighton boss Chris Hughton has never beaten Bournemouth in his managerial career, losing four and drawing once (all while in charge of Brighton). Bournemouth's David Brooks has netted five goals in his last 11 league appearances, after managing just three in his previous 35. Josh King has been directly involved in 44 Premier League goals for Bournemouth (35 goals, 9 assists), 10 more than any other player (Callum Wilson on 34). Bournemouth's Jefferson Lerma picked up a divisional-high eighth booking of the season in the Premier League, with only Harry Arter in 2016/17 accruing more in a single campaign in the competition for the Cherries (11). Only Eden Hazard (9) has registered more assists in the Premier League this season than Bournemouth's Ryan Fraser (8). Man of the match - David Brooks The 21-year-old playmaker was in scintillating form on Saturday afternoon, creating numerous chances. Brooks danced past the opposition's defence to give the home side the lead with a powerful strike and his guided header for his, and Bournemouth's, second goal was equally exquisite. Pundit's verdict - Charlie Nicholas It wasn't comfortable for Bournemouth. In spells, I thought Brighton could have got a draw , but it was too fabulous goals from David Brooks. He is a very impressive young player. 2:53 Charlie Nicholas says match-winner David Brooks was very impressive during Bournemouth's 2-0 win over Brighton Charlie Nicholas says match-winner David Brooks was very impressive during Bournemouth's 2-0 win over Brighton It was harsh on Brighton because when they went down to 10 men, Dunk's first yellow card was harsh but the second one wasn't. It sounds comfortable, but Bournemouth had to work a little bit harder and scored two excellent goals. What's next? Bournemouth will now travel to Wembley for their Boxing Day clash with Tottenham, while Brighton host Arsenal, live on Sky Sports Premier League, later on December 26."},{"date": "22/12/2019",

Leicester Chelsea 0-1 Leicester Jamie Vardy scored the winner as Leicester produced an impressive display to shock Chelsea 1-0 at Stamford Bridge. Eden Hazard hit the bar for Chelsea in the first half, but Vardy fired the Foxes in front with a fine near-post finish in the 51st minute. It took Chelsea until late in the game to respond as Antonio Rudiger headed wide from a corner and then Marcos Alonso hit the post with only Kasper Schmeichel to beat. Player ratings Chelsea: Kepa (5), Alonso (5), Rudiger (5), Luiz (5), Azpilicueta (6), Jorginho (5), Kante (5), Kovacic (5), Willian (5), Pedro (5), Hazard (6) Subs: Giroud (5), Loftus-Cheek (5), Fabregas (5) Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Chilwell (8), Morgan (7), Maguire (7), Pereira (8), Mendy (7), Choudhury (7), Ndidi (7), Albrighton (6), Maddison (6), Vardy (7) Subs: Gray (5), Iheanacho (5) Man of the match: Ben Chilwell But Leicester held out to move up to ninth in the Premier League and provide a welcome pre-Christmas boost for manager Claude Puel. There had been reports before the match that Puel was fighting for his job over the festive period, but the performance - particularly in the second half - should lift his spirits as Leicester won at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2000. Claude Puel celebrates victory Chelsea, who had not previously lost at home this season, dominated possession in the first half without creating many clear openings. A long ball from David Luiz almost provided the opening goal in the second minute, drifting just wide of the post after confusion in the Leicester defence left Schmeichel stranded on the edge of the box. Luiz was then inches away from nodding in a corner at the back post before Hazard spun Harry Maguire but fired against the bar from 15 yards out. Leicester were resolute and well-organised, and only a brilliant save from Kepa Arrizabalaga prevented Wilfred Ndidi scoring from 30 yards out in the 40th minute. Vardy fires Leicester in front But the Foxes did break the deadlock in the 51st minute, sweeping forward on the counter before James Maddison slipped a pass through for Vardy and he fired past Arrizabalaga at the near post. Hazard forced Schmeichel into a sharp save shortly afterwards, but otherwise Chelsea were lacklustre and careless in possession in both halves. Leicester went closest to scoring next as Cesar Azpilicueta blocked a backheeled shot from Vardy and then Arrizabalaga pushed away an effort from Marc Albrighton. Chelsea eventually threatened with injury-time approaching but Rudiger glanced a header wide from six yards out and then Schmeichel got the faintest touch to tip Alonso's low shot onto the post. Team news Chelsea named the same XI that won at Brighton last weekend, meaning Eden Hazard again started up front. Leicester made two changes from their last Premier League match as Hamza Choudhury and Ben Chilwell replaced Demarai Gray and Christian Fuchs. Opta stats Chelsea have lost at home in the league for the first time in 13 games, since a 1-3 defeat to Tottenham in April (W7 D5). Leicester enjoyed a Premier League victory in London for the first time in 11 visits, since a 3-2 win at West Ham in March 2017 (D4 L6). Chelsea have failed to find the back of the net in two of their last four home Premier League games, as many as in their previous 21. Leicester have beaten Chelsea at Stamford Bridge for the first time in their last nine visits in all competitions (D2 L6). Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy has scored 13 goals in his last 15 Premier League appearances against the 'big six' sides. Courtesy of Jamie Vardy's opener for Leicester, Chelsea conceded a home Premier League goal for the first time in four games, ending a run of 357 minutes without an opposition goal at Stamford Bridge. Jamie Vardy's goal for Leicester was his first not to come from the penalty spot in his last 10 Premier League appearances, since scoring against Huddersfield in September. Man of the match - Ben Chilwell He wasn't involved in the goal, but Chilwell was involved in almost every other Leicester attack, particularly in the second half when he launched several counter-attacks. He was also strong in defence as the Foxes kept Chelsea at bay. What's next? Chelsea are live on Sky Sports when they go to Watford on Boxing Day and Crystal Palace on Sunday. They then host Southampton on January 2.

Southampton Huddersfield 1-3 Southampton Michael Obafemi's first goal for Southampton put the seal on a 3-1 victory at Huddersfield, earning new manager Ralph Hasenhuttl back-to-back wins. Looking to build on last weekend's thrilling victory over Arsenal, Nathan Redmond edged the visitors in front as early as the 15th minute, finishing well for his first goal of the season, and the home side found themselves two goals down three minutes before the break, with Danny Ings winning a penalty before converting from the spot with aplomb. Out of nowhere, Philip Billing rifled a strike into the net in the 58th minute to get the hosts back in the contest, before Obafemi became the youngster player from the Republic of Ireland to score in the Premier League when sealing victory in the 71st minute. The result means Huddersfield remain with just one home win all season as they sit 19th, four points from safety, while victory sees Southampton climb to 16th, three points clear of the relegation zone. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Hadergjonaj (6), Zanka (6), Schindler (5), Kongolo (6), Mbenza (6), Mbenza (7), Billing (7), Bacuna (5), Pritchard (7), Mounie (5).

Subs: Obafemi (7), Lemina (6), Stephens (6) Man of the match: Nathan Redmond. After another disappointing home defeat last weekend against Newcastle, the home fans were expecting more pre-match, but soon saw their side fall behind once more with just 15 minutes on the clock. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg threaded a lovely through pass for Redmond, who let the ball run into his path before lifting the ball over the onrushing home goalkeeper Jonas Lossl. Redmond was causing all kinds of problems for the home defence and only some timely interceptions prevented him from causing more damage, but Saints did not have to wait too long for their second goal, with Ings felled in the box by a clumsy challenge from Mathias Jorgensen, before getting up to convert his third penalty of the season. Team news As expected, Saints went with the same starting XI that got the better of Arsenal last weekend, with match-winner Charlie Austin starting from the bench once more. Steve Mounie was back from a three-game ban, and straight into the Huddersfield side. David Wagner made two changes in all from the side beaten by Newcastle last time out, with Mounie and Isaac Mbenza coming in for Jonathan Hogg and Laurent Depoitre. After the break, Huddersfield raised their game, but still struggled to create any openings of note before Billings shocked Saints with his long-range strike, with the swerve getting the better of Alex McCarthy in the visitors' goal. McCarthy was then forced into a smart save to deny Isaac Mbenza, before Obafemi came off the bench to make sure of the win, stroking the ball home after Redmond had stolen the ball off Christopher Schindler before teeing up the youngster. Steve Mounie's close-range miss late in the day summed up Huddersfield's afternoon, as they go into a clash with Manchester United without a win in five league games. Opta stats Southampton have registered back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since April 2017 under Claude Puel. Huddersfield have lost nine of their last 12 home Premier League games (W1 D2), netting just four goals in that time. Nathan Redmond scored his first Premier League goal of the season for Southampton with his 28th shot at goal. Ralph Hasenhuttl has won two of his three Premier League matches in charge of Southampton (L1) - only one fewer than Mark Hughes managed in 22 attempts as Saints boss. Since the start of last season, Huddersfield Town have had more different players booked for diving than any other Premier League team (4 - Rajiv van La Parra, Alex Pritchard, Laurent Depoitre and Chris Lowe). Man of the match - Nathan Redmond It has not gone Redmond's way this season so far, but he has kept going, picking up his first assist last weekend, before finally netting his first goal of the season this weekend. He continued to stretch Huddersfield in the second half, and claimed another assist after refusing to give up the chase. His work ethic and productivity both seem to be on the up under Hasenhuttl. What's next? Huddersfield travel to Manchester United next on Boxing Day, while Southampton have a day extra recuperation, hosting West Ham on December 27, live on Sky Sports."},{"date": "22/12/2019", "arena":

The home side dominated the early exchanges and Ilkay Gundogan headed them in front after 27 minutes. However, Palace hit back six minutes later through Jeffrey Schlupp (33) and Andros Townsend's stunning volley (35) put the visitors ahead at the break. Luka Milivojevic extended Palace's lead from the penalty spot (51) after Max Meyer was brought down by Kyle Walker and although Kevin de Bruyne got one back for City with five minutes remaining, Roy Hodgson's team held on for a memorable victory. The defeat, City's second in three league games and a first at home this season, means there is daylight between the top two for the first time this season while Palace are up to 14th. For the first half hour, everything went as expected with Fabian Delph's drive from the edge of the box forcing a fine stop from Vicente Guaita in the Palace goal in the second minute, the home side dominating possession and keeping the visitors trapped inside their own half.

The lead was short lived though as Palace levelled through Schlupp. Wilfried Zaha was stopped by Aymeric Laporte but the ball came to Townsend, he shifted it to Schlupp and the winger advanced into the box before arrowing a shot into the far corner of the net. Team news Pep Guardiola made two changes to the side that beat Everton last weekend with John Stones and Raheem Sterling in for Fernandinho and Riyad Mahrez. The injured Martin Kelly and Cheikhou Kouyate dropped out of the Palace squad, James Tomkins and Jeffrey Schlupp replaced them. Wilfried Zaha also returned with Jordan Ayew making way. Two minutes later, Palace were ahead. Van Aanholt's free-kick from the left was only half-cleared, Bernardo Silva headed it further away but Townsend, 30 yards out, came onto it and thumped a stunning volley past Ederson into the top corner. Less than five minutes into the second half, Guardiola sent Sergio Aguero on but within a minute of the Argentine's introduction, Palace had a third. Luka Milivojevic celebrates his goal at the Etihad Stadium Another shift counter-attack ended with Townsend heading against the post from Aaron Wan-Bissaka's cross and as Meyer tried to take control of the rebound he was tripped by Walker. Milivojevic stepped up and hit the spot kick firmly to Ederson's left and into the bottom corner. De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez came on but with James Tomkins and Mamadou Sakho impressing at the heart of the Palace defence, clear cut chances remained hard to come by. 2:33 Andros Townsend says the stunning goal he scored in Palace's 3-2 win at Man City was the best and most important goal of his career Andros Townsend says the stunning goal he scored in Palace's 3-2 win at Man City was the best and most important goal of his career Gundogan whistled a shot just wide from 25 yards, Sane's free-kick struck the post but bounced wide and it took De Bruyne's over-hit cross to drift beyond Guaita and into the far corner with five minutes to reduce the deficit. That livened up the home fans and City had the chance to snatch a point in the dying seconds when De Bruyne's superb left-foot cross was met by Gabriel Jesus at the far post. The Brazilian striker was unchallenged but couldn't keep the header down, leaving City to reflect on a potentially damaging defeat.

Crystal Palace registered their first away league win at Man City since December 1990, having drawn three and lost nine since then before today. This was Manchester City's first home Premier League defeat against a non-big six side since February 2016, when they lost 1-3 to Leicester City under Manuel Pellegrini. Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend has scored 17 Premier League goals - with 10 of those coming from outside the box. Man City lost a Premier League match kicking off at 3pm local time on a Saturday for the first time since August 2014 against Stoke, ending a run of 36 games unbeaten (W32 D4) Man of the match - James Tomkins While Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha were impressive going forward, causing City problems on the counter, Palace's victory was built on an exemplary defensive effort. The organisation, concentration and commitment they showed was typified by Tomkins, who marshalled the backline alongside Mamadou Sakho and made countless crucial interventions inside his own penalty area to keep City at bay. Pundit's verdict - Matt Le Tissier \"It wasn't a fluke, it really wasn't. Yes, City were camped in Crystal Palace's half, but they weren't creating chance after chance. You thought when they went 1-0 up, it would open up a bit but the important thing for Palace is they got the goal back pretty quickly. \"From that minute on, Palace seemed to find a bit of belief and what happened two minutes later - just wow. \"It was more than a tidy finish from Andros Townsend. It was one of the best volleys I've seen for a long time. It has got to be a contender for goal of the season. It went like an absolute rocket. The goalkeeper had no chance from 30 yards - that's how good it was. \"Crystal Palace were so tight and organised, there were none of those little gaps that Man City like to exploit around the box.\" What's next?

0-0 draw with Fulham Newcastle were held to a 0-0 draw at St James' Park by a Fulham side that kept their first clean sheet of the season. Neither side were able to create too much but both will feel they could have had the points if penalty appeals had gone their way late in the game. Substitute Kenedy appeared to be tugged down by Joe Bryan in the Fulham box before Aleksandar Mitrovic, against his old club, had a shot blocked by the arm of Jamaal Lascelles. Ultimately, Claudio Ranieri's Fulham remain bottom but they showed resolve using a new formation, while Rafa Benitez will again be left thinking decisions have cost his team. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (5), Manquillo (6), Schar (6), Lascelles (7), Dummett (6), Diame (6), Ki (7), Ritchie (6), Perez (6), Rondon (6), Atsu (6) Subs: Kenedy (6), Yedlin (n/a) Fulham: Rico (6), Odoi (7), Mawson (7), Ream (7), Bryan (6), Christie (7), Chambers (6), Seri (6), Cairney (6), Schurrle (6), Mitrovic (6) Subs: Ayite (6), Kamara (6) Man of the match: Alfie Mawson Ranieri's switch to a back-three - although Benitez referred to it as a back-five - seemed to help Fulham as it at least gave them bodies in defence. Newcastle could not break through. The home side did not attempt a shot on goal until Ki Sung-yueng dragged a long-range effort wide in the 36th minute. Sergio Rico got to the break without needing to make a save. The most action that the Fulham goalkeeper saw in that opening 45 minutes was to punch his own defender when Alfie Mawson bravely put himself in harm's way. Team news Rafa Benitez made two changes to the Newcastle team that won at Huddersfield. Paul Dummett came in for the injured Ciaran Clark, while Matt Ritchie returned as a replacement for Kenedy. Claudio Ranieri made only one change to the Fulham team that was beaten at home to West Ham as Cyrus Christie came in for Aboubakar Kamara. But the game did come to life following the introduction of Kenedy. In the 77th minute, he looked set to head home a left-wing cross only for Bryan to appear to knock him off balance. Fulham had a strong shout of their own in the final minutes when Mitrovic, having moments before almost dispossessed a dallying Martin Dubravka, had his shot blocked by an arm. The ball struck Lascelles high on the arm but he was leaning into it and the decision could easily have gone against Newcastle. As it was, both teams were left bemoaning their luck. Opta stats Benitez has yet to lose a home Premier League game against Fulham (W4 D4), with his teams keeping a clean sheet in each of the last six meetings. Fulham kept their first clean sheet in the Premier League in 22 games, since winning 1-0 against Norwich in April 2014. Fulham have won just their second away point in their last 12 outings in the Premier League (D2 L10). Newcastle have won just three of their last 17 Premier League games against promoted sides (D5 L9). Newcastle have won just two of their last 10 Premier League games at St. James' Park (D1 L7). Fulham have failed to find the back of the net in six of their last nine Premier League games. The managers Rafael Benitez (Newcastle): \"For me, the main thing is if you cannot win, do not give the other team chances to score. We have to put into perspective where we were at the beginning and we are now playing against teams like Fulham and Wolves who have spent a lot of money during the summer.\" Claudio Ranieri (Fulham): \"At this moment for us, it's important to get a point, it's important to have a clean sheet because in the last matches, we have played well and from their first chance, the opponent has scored a goal. They made a lot of crosses - 30 - and they shot at goal, but our keeper never had to save anything.\" Man of the match - Alfie Mawson The Fulham defender had been open about the need for improvement before this game and he delivered personally by playing a key role in the team's long-awaited clean sheet. After being accidentally punched by his own goalkeeper in the first half, Mawson recovered to fight off countless Newcastle attacks in the second half with a resilient display. Alfie Mawson got caught by his own goalkeeper during the first half What's next? Fulham host Wolves in the early kick-off on Boxing Day, live on Sky Sports Premier League. Newcastle have a tough assignment later that afternoon when Benitez returns to Anfield to take on the leaders Liverpool."},{"date": "22/12/2019", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56833,

League as goals from Troy Deeney and Gerard Deulofeu secured a 2-0 win at West Ham. Deeney gave the visitors the lead in the 30th minute, stepping up to score his third goal of the season from the spot after Fabian Balbuena had brought down Roberto Pereyra. West Ham, who drop down to 12th, almost grabbed an equaliser early in the second half when Michail Antonio's header rebounded off the post and the forward had another golden opportunity in the 85th minute, heading against the crossbar from close range after Ben Foster had denied Robert Snodgrass. The miss came back to haunt the Hammers as minutes later Deulofeu (87) struck to secure all three points for the visitors.

However, it was Watford who took the lead in the 30th minute, Deeney beating Fabianski from the spot after Balbuena had brought down Pereyra when the midfielder was through on goal. Troy Deeney celebrates after putting Watford ahead from the penalty spot The hosts went close to an equaliser before the break as Antonio headed Felipe Anderson's deep cross down towards Javier Hernandez. The Mexico international volleyed the ball towards the bottom corner but Foster dived to his left to push the ball to safety. Moments after the break Antonio went even closer, glancing Robert Snodgrass's corner against the far post. Foster then denied Arthur Masuaku from distance before Hernandez totally missed his kick six yards out after being played in by Felipe Anderson. Team news West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini stuck with the same side that won 2-0 at Fulham last Saturday. Watford made one change from the side that beat Cardiff 3-2 last weekend. Etienne Capoue replaced Domingos Quina, who dropped down to the bench. Abdoulaye Doucoure thought he had doubled Watford's lead after latching onto Pereyra's low cross, but Fabianski did brilliantly to tip the ball over the crossbar before also denied Deeney a second. Manuel Pellegrini sent on Andy Carroll in a bid to grab a late equaliser but with West Ham piling forward, they left gaps at the back and Deulofeu punished then with a low finish across Fabianski to seal victory. Opta stats Watford have won five of their last eight Premier League games against West Ham (D1 L2), winning three away from home in this run (1-0 in Feb 2007, 4-2 in Sept 2016 and 2-0 in Dec 2018). West Ham lost just their second game in their last nine in the Premier League, having won each of the last four before today. The Hammers have failed to keep a clean sheet in 10 of their last 11 Premier League home games. Deeney has scored in three of his last four league appearances against West Ham, with two of those goals coming at London Stadium. Deulofeu scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time in his career. Watford ended a run of seven consecutive Premier League games in which they failed to keep a clean sheet. The managers Manuel Pellegrini: \"Really I think we were a bit unlucky to not at least draw. The penalty was the only action in our box in the first half, and we had three or four chances to draw the game. Unfortunately, we didn't score and then they scored their second. We had to be faster and more accurate. In the second half they had a couple of chances but before that we had all the clear opportunities to draw.\" 2:06 Manuel Pellegrini says West Ham were not lucky in front of goal as they fell to a 2-0 defeat to Watford in the Premier League.

But today I have a special reason because we have played very well. It was a very good performance here and we got another clean. To win against West Ham is always difficult but, in this situation, after four straight win, it was very special. It was good for us to get another clean sheet. It's something good for us.

He made crucial saves at crucial moments in the game to help his side secure a second away win of the season.

United started life without Jose Mourinho with a stylish and energetic display under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as they thrashed Cardiff 5-1. Goals from Marcus Rashford (3), Ander Herrera (28), Anthony Martial (41) and a second-half double from Jesse Lingard (64, 90) saw United score five goals in a Premier League game for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson departed. After the negative performances under Mourinho, Solskjaer seemed to give his players a freedom to express themselves and was rewarded with a scintillating attacking showing, spearheaded by Martial, who looked especially rejuvenated, as did Paul Pogba. Cardiff, who had won their last three home games, were completely outclassed and could only muster a penalty from Victor Camarasa (38) in response to United's silky and exciting showing. Player Ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (3), Bamba (5), Manga (5), Morrison (5), Cunningham (5), Arter (5), Gunnarsson (3), Camarasa (6), Murphy (3), Hoilett (5), Paterson (5). Subs: Zahore (7), Harris (5) Manchester United: De Gea (7), Shaw (7), Lindelof (7), Jones (7), Young (7), Matic (8), Herrera (8), Pogba (8), Lingard (9), Rashford (9), Martial (9). Subs: Fellaini (N/A), Pereira (N/A), Fred (7) Man of the match: Anthony Martial United made the perfect start when Pogba won a free-kick after a neat one-two and Rashford stepped up to blast home a swerving effort from 30 yards. Pogba played a part in the second goal, too. The World Cup winner - out in the cold under Mourinho - found Herrera with a clever ball and the Spanish midfielder's effort from 25 yards took a deflection off Greg Cunningham and flew into the top corner. Team news Solskjaer made four changes from Mourinho’s last game in charge against Liverpool. Luke Shaw, Paul Pogba, Phil Jones and Anthony Martial all were handed starts. Romelu Lukaku was away on compassionate leave. There was just one change for Neil Warnock’s men as Greg Cunningham replaced Joe Bennett. Cardiff quickly got themselves back into proceedings as Rashford was adjudged to have handled in the box, which provided Camarasa with a chance from the spot, one that he took. However, the Cardiff goal only triggered United to step it up another gear. Martial, Pogba and Lingard linked brilliantly just outside the box and Martial galloped through before finishing into the far corner. United continued to attack after the break and Lingard was brought down in the box as he tried to dribble past Sol Bamba and Sean Morrison. Lingard confidently netted from the spot. Four was not enough for the visitors as they pressed on and Pogba slipped in Lingard with one of the last attacks to cap a dream start to Solskjaer's tenure. Man of the match: Anthony Martial This style of football suits the Frenchman, who was in his element with the attack-minded football that Solskjaer obviously demanded. Unlike his recent performances this season, every touch he took was a positive one which put the Cardiff defence on the back foot from the first whistle. His excellent goal summed up United's new approach. It was slick, quick and full of quality. Anthony Martial celebrates his goal with Jesse Lingard Opta stats Manchester United scored 5+ goals in a Premier League game for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson's final match in charge, in May 2013 against West Brom (5-5). Since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club, four of the five different managers to take charge of Manchester United have seen their side score 3+ goals in their first Premier League game (Moyes 4, Mourinho 3, Giggs 4 and Solskjaer 5). Cardiff have lost each of their last 14 Premier League games against 'big six' opponents, conceding 45 goals in this run. Martial has been directly involved in 70 goals for Manchester United in all competitions (45 goals, 25 assists); the most of any player for the club since his debut in September 2015. Rashford has had a hand in more Premier League goals this season than any other Manchester United player (9 - four goals and five assists). Manager reaction: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer \"The attitude and application of the boys when you go out there and see them, the attitude has been fantastic, the dressing room, the way they approached this game. \"It's been a difficult week for everyone and to get the focus and perform as well as they did [is impressive].\" Manager reaction: Neil Warnock \"We need to stop conceding elementary goals. At any level, that first goal was terrible. It knocked us down. We were bound to get knocked down. We were playing against a top side with a new manager and all that comes with that. I was disappointed with the goals today, not the effort.\" What's next? United are back at Old Trafford on Boxing Day when Huddersfield will be the visitors, while Cardiff take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park."},{"date": "21/12/2019", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance":

Watch goals and highlights of Wolves 0-2 Liverpool Liverpool are guaranteed to be top of the Premier League on Christmas Day after extending their lead at the summit with a 2-0 win at Wolves. In the previous 10 Premier League seasons the side top at Christmas has won the title eight times and the Reds laid that marker down with goals from Mohamed Salah (18) and the excellent Virgil van Dijk (68). The victory moves Jurgen Klopp's team four points clear of Manchester City, who play Crystal Palace on Saturday. On a wet night in Wolverhampton, Liverpool failed to settle but Adama Traore could not take advantage of an early opening following a poor pass by Fabinho. Player Ratings Wolves: Patricio (6), Doherty (7), Bennett (6), Coady (6), Boly (6), Saiss (6), Jonny (6), Neves (5), Moutinho (6), Traore (5), Jimenez (6). Subs: Cavalerio (6), Gibbs-White (6) Liverpool: Alisson (8), Milner (7), Lovren (7), Van Dijk (9), Robertson (7), Fabinho (8), Henderson (7), Keita (7), Mane (7), Firmino (6), Salah (8) Subs: Wijnaldum (6), Clyne (6), Lallana (6) Man of the match: Virgil van Dijk The Liverpool midfielder made up for that error by setting up the opening goal on 18 minutes. Ruben Neves failed to track his run down the right and the Brazilian crossed for Salah to skilfully flick home for his 11th goal of the season. Wolves looked a threat on the break but despite registering four shots on target in the opening half, Alisson was not severely troubled. Team news Wolves switched to a 5-3-1-1 with Romain Saiss and Adama Traore given chances from the start. James Milner and Jordan Henderson came in for Liverpool. Liverpool looked far more comfortable after the interval with Salah a constant threat on the counter attack. He provided a touch of class on 68 minutes to double his team's lead. Van Dijk was on hand to finish Salah's pin-point cross to score his first Premier League goal for the Reds. Mohamed Salah celebrates his goal From that moment it was game over and Salah could have added to his tally but Rui Patricio made some smart blocks. Klopp's men saw the game out in comfortable fashion and as Jamie Carragher noted on commentary: \"We have a title race!\" Man of the match: Virgil van Dijk Virgil van Dijk capped a majestic performance with the second goal The Netherlands international is fast becoming the best centre-back in the Premier League, some would claim he is. This performance would add further fuel to that argument - it was a masterclass. Adama Traore got absolutely nothing out of the Liverpool defender, who even managed to match the striker for pace at one point. He's got it all. 3:16 Jamie Carragher takes a look at Virgil van Dijk’s masterful performance against Wolves. Jamie Carragher takes a look at Virgil van Dijk’s masterful performance against Wolves.

Only two teams - Chelsea in 2005-06 (49) and Man City in 2017-18 (52) - have had more points after 18 Premier League games in a season than Liverpool do this season (48). Salah has scored in each of his last six Premier League appearances for Liverpool against newly-promoted opposition, finding the net exactly once in each game. Wolves have lost four of their last six home league matches - as many as in their previous 34 combined at Molineux. Liverpool are unbeaten in 10 away league games (W8 D2) - their best run in the Premier League and longest since also going 10 unbeaten between October 1991 and February 1992. Klopp has now defeated all 32 of the British clubs he has faced as Liverpool boss in all competitions - before tonight, Wolves were the only side he had failed to beat, losing in the FA Cup in January 2017 in their only previous meeting. Liverpool have won 25 league matches in 2018 - their most in a calendar year since 1990, when they also won 25. The managers Nuno Espirito Santo: \"The way we conceded doesn't give me any joy at all. It was a good game. There were chances for both teams in the first half, we could have done better in the final third and with final decisions. The only thing that gives me something to think about is the way we conceded. After a set-piece, a second ball, it's a total lack of focus that we lost in that moment so we have to look at that and analyse that moment.\" 1:35 Nuno Espirito Santo was pleased with Wolves’ display against Liverpool but says he was unhappy with the way his side lost focus for the two goals.

First-half goals from Pedro (17) and Eden Hazard (33), who suffered a late injury scare, sent Maurizio Sarri's side on their way to victory but Solly March pulled one back for the hosts in the 66th minute to set up a nervy finish. Chelsea, who were forced to take Hazard off after he was caught on the ankle by Dale Stephens' late challenge, held on for all three points to stay fourth, eight points behind league leaders Liverpool. Meanwhile, Brighton, who stay 13th in the league, are still looking for their first win over Chelsea in any competition since January, 1933. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Montoya (6), Dunk (7), Balogun (5), Bernardo (7), Stephens (6), Gross (6), Propper (6), Knockaert (7), Murray (6), March (7).

Wizardry. pic.twitter.com/kVaa703Xit — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 16, 2018 Chelsea looked to be in full control but Sarri, who warned his side against complacency when they threw away a lead to lose at Wolves, wouldn't have been happy when Mateo Kovacic's pass across the face of goal gifted possession to March. The Brighton midfielder hit the target from 25 yards but the effort had nowhere near enough power to trouble Kepa Arrizabalaga. Hazard, who ended a seven-match league run without a goal, then got on the scoresheet, scoring his eighth of the season to double the visitors' advantage. Leon Balogun gifted possession to Willian, whose pass released Hazard and he made no mistake, wrong-footing Mat Ryan to pick out the bottom corner. Pedro celebrates his early goal Marcos Alonso nearly made the points safe in the 63rd minute, striking a superb 20-yard effort against the post. But March then set up a tense finish at the Amex, popping up in the penalty area to hook home Bernardo's knockdown. Solly March pulled a goal back for Brighton The visitors, who were forced to take off Hazard after he picked up an ankle knock following Stephens' late tackle, had a scare late on when Alonso hauled down March just outside the penalty area, but the Spain international escaped with a booking, with David Luiz adjudged to have been in position to cover. March got back to his feet to strike the resultant free-kick high over the crossbar as Chelsea held on for victory. Team news Chris Hughton made three changes from the side that lost 1-0 at Burnley last time out. Martin Montoya, Dale Stephens and Glenn Murray returned to the starting line-up in place of Bruno, Yves Bissouma and Florin Andone, who all dropped to the bench. Shane Duffy missed out through suspension. Maurizio Sarri made 10 changes from Chelsea’s midweek draw with Vidi in the Europa League. Willian was the only player to keep his place in the side as the likes of Eden Hazard, Pedro, N’Golo Kante, Jorginho, David Luiz, Cesar Apilicueta and Kepa Arrizabalaga returned. Sarri stuck with the same side that beat Manchester City 2-0 last Saturday. Opta stats Chelsea have scored 37 goals in the Premier League this season; their most at this stage of a campaign since 2014/15 when they won the title (38). Five of Brighton's six home defeats in the Premier League have come against the traditional 'big six' teams, including both such defeats this season (1-2 v Spurs and Chelsea). Chelsea have won each of their seven games against Brighton in league competition; their best 100 per cent record against a single opponent in league history. Brighton have kept just three clean sheets in their last 19 games in the Premier League, conceding 31 goals in this run. Chelsea winger Willian has now been directly involved in 50 goals in the Premier League (27 goals, 23 assists); becoming the third Brazilian player in competition history to reach this milestone, after Philippe Coutinho (76) and Roberto Firmino (64). Only Glenn Murray (8) has had a hand in more Premier League goals for Brighton than Solly March this season (6 - one goal, five assists).

Maurizio Sarri says he was happy with Chelsea’s performance in their 2-1 win against Brighton but admits they were not in control of the match when they conceded a goal. Man of the Match - Eden Hazard In the end it was Hazard's first-half performance that was the difference between the two sides. He produced a brilliant pass to set up Pedro's opener before a calm finish wrong-footed Ryan to give him his eighth goal of the season. Hazard has provided more assists in league competition than any other player in the Top 5 European Leagues in 2018-19. Hazard has now been directly involved in more Premier League goals this season (17 in 16 apps) than he was in the whole of last season (16 in 34 apps). He is the first Chelsea player to assist a goal in four consecutive Premier League games since September 2014, when Cesc Fabregas did so. Chelsea will now be hoping the Belgium international, who was substituted late on, can shake off what appeared to be an ankle knock ahead of their Carabao Cup quarter-final against Bournemouth on Wednesday. What's next? Chelsea's next task is a Carabao Cup quarter-final against Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday (7.45pm). Their next Premier League encounter is also at Stamford Bridge against Leicester on Saturday (3pm). Brighton's next game is also against Bournemouth but in the Premier League.

for Southampton as new boss Ralph Hasenhuttl made an instant impact at St Mary's to end Arsenal's 22-game unbeaten run. Danny Ings had twice put the Saints ahead (20, 44) on his return from injury but they were pegged back by two Henrik Mkhitaryan efforts (28, 53). With the game locked at 2-2, both teams had chances to win it but substitute Austin headed home for his fifth goal against the Gunners (85) after Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno misjudged a high cross. A first home league win of the season lifts Southampton out of the bottom three and Hasenhuttl, who replaced Mark Hughes earlier this month, celebrated on the pitch with his players at full-time. Player Ratings Southampton: McCarthy (7), Yoshida (6), Valery (6), Vestergaard (7), Bednarek (7), Targett (7), Romeu (6), Hojbjerg (8), Armstrong (6), Redmond (7), Ings (9). Subs: Long (8), Austin (8), Arsenal: Leno (5), Bellerin (6), Koscielny (5), Lichtsteiner (5), Monreal (6), Xhaka (5), Iwobi (6), Guendouzi (6), Torreira (7), Mkhitaryan (7), Aubameyang (7). Subs: Lacazette (7), Ozil (6), Maitland-Niles (6) Man of the match: Danny Ings Danny Ings scored twice on his return from injury Arsenal have yet to be in front at half-time this season and once again their sharpness early on could be questioned. Ings made them pay on 20 minutes when he headed home from 10 yards after a pinpoint cross from the left by Matt Targett. The Gunners looked in danger of falling further behind but replied eight minutes later. Nacho Monreal provided the width down the left and his cross was guided home by Mkhitaryan. The game continued to ebb and flow in front of a buoyant crowd, who were witnessing their team play a tempo not seen yet this season. They were off their seats just before the break when Ings doubled his tally. Team news Laurent Koscielny made his first Premier League start for seven months after his injury nightmare as Mesut Ozil and Alexandre Lacazette were on the bench. Danny Ings returning from a hamstring injury in one of two changes for Southampton. Again, Arsenal failed to deal with a ball into the box - this time from Nathan Redmond - and Ings was on hand to divert a sumptuous looping header into the top corner. Unai Emery sent on Alexandre Lacazette in place of the injured Hector Bellerin at half-time and switched to a back four. The changes sparked an almost instant response. Oriol Romeu dallied in possession, which allowed Mkhitaryan to strike from the edge of the box, via a deflection off Jannik Vestergaard and into the net. Henrikh Mkhitaryan scored twice for Arsenal Shane Long provided Saints with an extra edge when coming off the bench and he had a goal disallowed with 15 minutes remaining after Maya Yoshida's header was saved brilliantly by Leno. But the goalkeeper couldn't keep out Austin minutes later. Long burst away down the right-hand side and his cross deceived Leno, and allowed the striker to head into the empty net. 6:13 New Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl says it was an unbelievable moment to celebrate his side's 3-2 win against Arsenal which saw the Gunners' 22-game unbeaten run come to an end. New Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl says it was an unbelievable moment to celebrate his side's 3-2 win against Arsenal which saw the Gunners' 22-game unbeaten run come to an end. Man of the match: Danny Ings After a prolonged period on the sidelines with two different cruciate knee injuries, you'd have to have a heart of stone not to feel warm watching Ings bounce back into form. In a game where Southampton created only a few chances, Ings was at his best to finish past Leno with two superb headed finishes. If he stays in this type of form, Southampton will be fine this season. Opta stats Southampton picked up their first win in all competitions since beating Crystal Palace in September, ending a streak of 14 games without a victory. Arsenal have lost their first competitive match since August versus Chelsea, ending a run of 22 games without defeat. Southampton are the first team to score three headed goals in a Premier League game since West Brom did so versus Swansea in December 2016. Saints last achieved this themselves in October 2001 (vs Ipswich). Arsenal haven't led at half-time in any of their 17 Premier League games so far this season. The Gunners have scored a league-high 27 second-half goals in 2018/19. Austin has scored in all five of his Premier League games against Arsenal - only Raheem Sterling versus Bournemouth (6 games) has a better 100 per cent record of scoring against a specific opponent in Premier League history. 3:33 Unai Emery says the important thing now is that Arsenal recover quickly from their 3-2 defeat to Southampton, ready for their next league match against Tottenham.

3-1 Man Utd Liverpool 3-1 Man Utd Xherdan Shaqiri came off the bench to make an instant impact with two second-half goals as Liverpool returned to the top of the Premier League with a 3-1 win over Manchester United at Anfield. Liverpool took a deserved lead through Sadio Mane's neat control and finish from a fine Fabinho assist (24), but Alisson was at fault for United's equaliser as he dropped a cross into the path of Jesse Lingard, who finished with ease (33). Though United improved in the second half, Liverpool regained their lead through sub Shaqiri as his shot from 12 yards deflected off Ashley Young and in off the crossbar (73), just three minutes after the Swiss had come on. Xherdan Shaqiri celebrates after scoring Liverpool's second goal Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (5), Clyne (7), Lovren (6), Van Dijk (7), Robertson (7), Fabinho (7), Wijnaldum (7), Keita (7), Mane (7), Firmino (7), Salah (6) Subs: Shaqiri (8), Henderson (NA) Man Utd: De Gea (7), Dalot (5), Lindelof (5), Bailly (5), Darmian (6), Matic (5), Herrera (6), Lingard (6), Rashford (6), Young (6), Lukaku (5). Subs: Fellaini (5), Martial (NA), Mata (NA) Man of the match: Xherdan Shaqiri Shaqiri scored again just seven minutes later with another deflected effort from 20 yards, and the result means Liverpool are a point ahead of Manchester City after 17 games. United remain sixth, 19 points off the leaders. United have now also conceded more goals this season (29) than in the entire 2017/18 season (28), while Liverpool's 36 attempts on goal against their old foes was the most by any team in the Premier League this season. It was all Liverpool during a frantic start, as David de Gea was tested early by Roberto Firmino's low effort from the edge of the box, tipping the ball away to his left. Liverpool got the goal their start deserved midway through the half as Fabinho brilliantly picked out Mane in-between the United defence, before the forward took the ball down and tucked it under De Gea. Sadio Mane gave Liverpool a deserved lead after 24 minutes Team news Clyne made his first Premier League appearance of the season, while Lovren was also drafted in to partner Van Dijk in central defence. Keita and Fabinho also came in to replace Henderson and Miler, who was not in the squad. Mourinho opted to leave Pogba on the bench, while Lukaku was the only player to keep his place following the defeat at Valenica. Lindelof and Darmian also came in, replacing Jones and Mata. Smalling was injured in the warm-up at Anfield, and was replaced by Bailly. But United were handed an early Christmas present as Alisson spilled Romelu Lukaku's simple cross from the left, allowing Lingard to turn the ball home with ease from close range. Though Paul Pogba was once more an option from the bench, Jose Mourinho decided to introduce Marouane Fellaini at half-time in place of Diogo Dalot, and the Belgian proved handy in United's own box by making several important clearances from Liverpool's regular corners. Liverpool nearly regained their lead shortly after the break as Firmino danced his way through the United defence, only to see his poked effort turned away low by De Gea, and though the visitors forced a few attacks, Liverpool did eventually get their second. Jesse Lingard capitalised on Alisson's error to level for Manchester United After De Gea flicked away Mane's cross at the byline into the path of Shaqiri, the summer signing struck a low effort which deflected off Young and beyond the stretch of De Gea. His second goal came in similar circumstances, deciding to take on a shot from the edge of the box, before seeing it deflect of Eric Bailly this time and into the left corner. Jurgen Klopp and Jose Mourinho before the match The pundits Roy Keane: \"I honestly think that if another manager came in, say Pochettino, he would say he needed some players to get United back to competing for trophies at the top level. You are not judged as Manchester United players by beating Fulham, Huddersfield and Newcastle, those teams can be beaten easily if you play for United. It's what you do against the big teams, that's where you are judged if you want to be a top player for a top football club. Manchester United have got their recruitment wrong for a few years, a blind man can see that.\" 1:37 Roy Keane thinks the United players are giving everything, but some are just not good enough and the club must re-invest Roy Keane thinks the United players are giving everything, but some are just not good enough and the club must re-invest Gary Neville: \"I'm in shock. Liverpool were streets ahead of United, absolutely streets ahead. United were awful today. They haven't got anyone in midfield that can pass a ball. Not one of them. They were hanging in there for a bit but the only real team who were going to win the game was Liverpool. It's not good enough.\" The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a brilliant start, one of the best performances we've had since I was at Liverpool, to be honest. The first half an hour was outstanding. How we played was just perfect.\" 3:35 Jurgen Klopp says he is completely over the moon with Liverpool's performance Jurgen Klopp says he is completely over the moon with Liverpool's performance Jose Mourinho: \"First of all, we have lots of problems related with physicality. We have lots of players that I could consider 'injury-prones', because some of our players are always injured. And it's not with me, it was before me. \"If you look to the stats with Mr Van Gaal, and before him with David [Moyes], that period there were players that were permanently injured. When you are permanently injured, physicality is difficult to get. Then there are qualities that a player has, and doesn't have, you cannot improve and cannot make them have.\" 4:13 Jose Mourinho says Manchester United can still finish in the top four Jose Mourinho says Manchester United can still finish in the top four Opta facts Liverpool are now 19 points ahead of Man Utd - their biggest ever lead over them after the first 17 games of an English top-flight season (based on relevant points-for-a-win rules). Liverpool have recorded their biggest Premier League victory over Manchester United at Anfield since also winning 3-1 in March 2011. Manchester United have now conceded 29 goals in the Premier League this season; one more than they did in the entirety of the 2017/18 campaign (28). Manchester United have conceded 29 goals in their opening 17 Premier League games this season - the most goals they've conceded at this stage of a top-flight campaign since 1962/63. Liverpool recorded 36 shots against Manchester United - the most United have faced in a Premier League match since Opta started recording shot data in 2003/04. Man of the match - Xherdan Shaqiri When he was introduced with 20 minutes to go, there was a collective roar around Anfield, as if they knew this was the impact Liverpool needed. At that point, United were creating half chances, and the hosts were desperate for a lift. Yes, both goals were deflected, but Shaqiri found himself in space on numerous occasions, and his low centre of gravity on the ball can change the tempo of a game in and around the penalty in an instant. That's just what Liverpool need when having difficulty in breaking down sides late on. What a signing. What's next? Liverpool now go to Wolves on Friday Night Football, live on Sky Sports Premier League at 8pm, while United are at Cardiff at 5.30pm on Saturday in the Premier League."},{"date": "15/12/2019", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54173, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": ["76"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["75"]}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["66"]}], "subs": [{"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["66"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["75"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Foden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arijanet Muric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["57"]}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yerry Mina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Digne", "yellows": ["19"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["81"]}, {"name": "Bernard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["57"]}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": ["76"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["57"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cenk Tosun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["81"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["57"], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:59 Highlights from Manchester City's win over Everton in the Premier League. Highlights from Manchester City's win over Everton in the Premier League. Gabriel Jesus ended his goal drought as Manchester City returned to the top of the Premier League for at least a day with a 3-1 win over Everton. Jesus gave City the lead at the Etihad with a low finish (22), his first goal in 12 appearances, following Leroy Sane's delightful assist, and he made it 2-0 on 50 minutes by heading home from close range from another weighted Sane cross. Everton halved the deficit through Dominic Calvert-Lewin's own header (65), but substitute Raheem Sterling restored the two-goal cushion with a header of his own (69), converting Fernandinho's ball from close range to end a difficult week on a bright note. Raheem Sterling celebrates with team-mates after scoring from the bench The result means champions City are back on the summit after Pep Guardiola's 100th win in all competitions with the club, with Liverpool two points behind and hosting Manchester United live on Super Sunday. Everton are now without a win in four. The first chance of the game fell to Everton as Lucas Digne found Richarlison at the far post, but the Brazilian could not keep his volley from 10 yards down. But after a sloppy start, City began to turn the screw. Player Ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (6), Laporte (7), Otamendi (6), Delph (6), Gundogan (8), Bernardo Silva (7), Fernandinho (7), Sane (8), Mahrez (7), Jesus (9).

Team news Manchester City made three changes from the side that lost at Chelsea; Sterling, Stones and the injured David Silva come out, replaced by Otamendi, Gundogan and Jesus. Kevin De Bruyne returned to the bench after his injury. Everton made two changes as Zouma and Calvert-Lewin replaced Gueye and Walcott. After Yerry Mina gave away possession, Sane threaded a perfect ball through to Jesus on the left of the box, and the forward tucked it under Jordan Pickford. City got their two-goal cushion after the break; picking the ball up on the left of the box, Sane picked out Jesus ahead of his marker Kurt Zouma, and though his header was central, it had enough power to beat Pickford's reflexes. The hosts looked in control until the final quarter of the game, as Digne's lifted cross from the left was headed into the far corner by Calvert-Lewin via the head of Fabian Delph, but the nerves didn't last long as Sterling, two minutes and 55 seconds after coming on for Sane, peeled off Zouma and headed past Pickford from a fine Fernandinho ball at the left byline. Jesus scored for the first time in 12 City appearances Everton did waste chances late on through Richarlison, Theo Walcott and then Calvert-Lewin's flick between his legs, but City saw the game out with relative comfort to return back to winning ways. 2:55 Bernardo Silva and Gabriel Jesus say they are so proud of Manchester City's 3-1 win against Everton and hailed a great team performance. Bernardo Silva and Gabriel Jesus say they are so proud of Manchester City's 3-1 win against Everton and hailed a great team performance. Opta stats Man City have won all 21 of their games in all competitions this season when they've scored in the first half. The only five games they've failed to win this season are the five in which they've not scored in the first half. Man City have won their last 10 Premier League home games, scoring 36 and conceding just seven goals. Everton have won just one of their last nine Premier League away games (D3 L5). Since Pep Guardiola became Man City manager, Everton have scored more Premier League goals against the Citizens than any other side (8). Gabriel Jesus' opener for Man City was his first Premier League goal since August, ending a run of 11 games, 487 minutes and 18 shots without one in the competition. Man City's Leroy Sane assisted both of Gabriel Jesus' goals in this game - before today the German had never previously assisted the Brazilian in the Premier League. Man City's Raheem Sterling scored just his second headed goal in the Premier League, and first since December 2015 vs Sunderland. Man of the match: Gabriel Jesus The Brazilian handed a reminder to onlookers about his qualities. His goals were expertly taken but it was his all-round game that impressed more as he led the line with great maturity, showing an array of silky touches to bring his teammates into play. The returning Sergio Aguero, who was on the bench, may struggle to get his spot back. Jesus celebrates putting Manchester City ahead Manager reaction: Pep Guardiola \"It was a tricky game after the Champions League, less than three days' recovery. \"They were able to draw at Stamford Bridge and at Anfield - until the last second. They are a top side, not just the 11 that started. \"Today it was in our minds we were going to suffer and so we did.

the difference as Crystal Palace edged past Leicester City with a 1-0 victory at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon. In what was a scrappy affair on a wet day in south-east London, Palace captain Milivojevic produced a moment of magic in the first half, drilling the ball past Kasper Schmeichel from 25 yards. Palace win without Zaha Palace enjoyed their first win in 14 Premier League games without Wilfried Zaha (L13) since beating Sunderland 3-2 on Sept 24, 2016 Leicester improved after the break, but they were denied an equaliser when Palace goalkeeper Vicente Guaita, on his Premier League debut, made a superb save to thwart Jamie Vardy. Palace held on to take all three points and move up to 15th in the table, five points clear of the relegations zone, while Leicester drop to 11th after suffering back-to-back defeats. With Wayne Hennessey ruled out due to back spasms, Palace turned to Guaita, who they signed from Getafe on a free transfer last summer, for his league debut and it was almost a start to forget for the Spanish 'keeper. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Guaita (8), Wan-Bissaka (6), Sakho (7), Kelly (8), Van Aanholt (6), Milivojevic (7), McArthur (7), Meyer (7), Kouyate (6), Townsend (7), Ayew (6). Subs: Schlupp (6), Sorloth (6), Puncheon (n/a). Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Pereira (7), Morgan (6), Maguire (7), Fuchs (6), Mendy (6), Ndidi (6), Gray (7), Maddison (5), Albrighton (6), Vardy (7). Subs: Ghezzal (7), Iheanacho (6), Okazaki (n/a). Man of the match: Martin Kelly After taking a heavy touch to control Milivojevic's back pass, Guaita was caught in possession inside his own penalty area by Jamie Vardy, who rolled the ball into an empty net. However, the former England forward was judged by referee Michael Oliver to have fouled the Palace No 1. Both teams were struggling to create anything of real significance, so when Palace took the lead in the 39th minute it was a goal that came out of the blue. Milivojevic celebrates his stunning winner Townsend picked out Milivojevic 25 yards from goal and the Palace captain had time and space to to bend the ball beyond the dive of Schmeichel and inside the far post. Leicester improved after the break and they were almost level in the 66th minute. Vardy's pass released Demarai Gray, who found substitute Rachid Ghezzal at the far post, but the winger's first-time shot flashed wide of the target. Team news Roy Hodgson made three changes from the side that lost 3-2 to West Ham last time out. Martin Kelly and Jordan Ayew replaced the suspended duo of Wilfried Zaha and James Tomkins, while Vicente Guaita came in for his Premier League debut in place of the injured Wayne Hennessey. Claude Puel made four changes as Jamie Vardy and Harry Maguire returned to the starting XI. Marc Albrighton and Christian Fuchs also came in to replace the injured Ben Chilwell and Vicente Iborra. Then came Guaita's big moment. Ghezzal's pass picked out fellow substitute Kelechi Iheanacho, who released Vardy clean through on goal. However, the striker's well-struck shot was brilliantly tipped on to the post by the Spaniard, who then collected the rebound after the ball bounced straight back into his hands. Leicester had one final chance when Martin Kelly's clearance fell kindly to Wilfred Ndidi on the edge of the penalty area, but the midfielder's effort failed to trouble Guaita as Palace held on for victory. Opta stats Palace have won consecutive home league games for the first time since their final three matches at Selhurst Park in 2017-18. Leicester have lost three consecutive games without scoring against an opponent in the Premier League for the first time since April 2002 (six in a row against Manchester United). Leicester are without a win in their last 10 Premier League visits to London (D4 L6), wince a 3-2 win against West Ham in March 2017. Palace have won and kept a clean sheet in each of their last three Premier League games against Leicester, doing so against a single team for the first time since April 2014 (Aston Villa). Since his Premier League debut in February 2017, Milivojevic has scored more goals in the competition for Crystal Palace than any other player. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"I thought our first-half performance was really excellent against such a good team. Unfortunately we had to make a change in the second-half with Cheikhou Kouyate, who had done so well. We had to reorganise our team again - we had already had to reorganise our team a lot due to the suspensions and injuries. \"After that Leicester did very well and they got on top of us but the great thing for me to be able to state, despite them getting on top, is our back four and midfield worked so very hard and we restricted them to few chances. And then when a little bit of luck was needed, for once, it went our way. It was a vital victory and the players deserve a lot of credit for pulling it out of the bag.\" 4:16 Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson says that his side got the bit of luck that they deserved after beating Leicester City 1-0 in the Premier League. Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson says that his side got the bit of luck that they deserved after beating Leicester City 1-0 in the Premier League. Claude Puel: \"Our first half an hour was not enough. For me it was a poor first half without the right intensity and the right ingredients. After we conceded a great goal but the second half was more interesting but without luck. I think we had three or four chances to score. It was a tough game. We needed to play with good fighting spirit because it was a fight and we weren't ready in the first half to play this game.\" 2:25 Puel says Leicester were poor in the first half of their loss at Palace Puel says Leicester were poor in the first half of their loss at Palace Man of the Match - Martin Kelly Martin Kelly put in an assured performance for Palace Martin Kelly came in for just his fourth Premier League appearance of the season, starting in place of the suspended James Tomkins. However, the defender produced an assured display at the heart of the Palace back line as Hodgson's side secured a much-needed victory and a clean sheet. Alongside Mamadou Sakho, he dealt with the threat of Jamie Vardy well and was in the right place at the right time on numerous occasions when Leicester threatened. \"To be fair, Martin Kelly was excellent,\" Hodgson told Sky Sports. \"The two centre-backs were excellent and the goalkeeper played his part as well.\" The pundit Soccer Saturday pundit Charlie Nicholas says Claude Puel and Leicester need something to change following their 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace.

John Smith's Stadium Highlights as Newcastle beat Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium Salomon Rondon's second-half goal lifted Newcastle six points clear of the bottom three with a 1-0 win at Huddersfield. Rondon swept home a lovely Javier Manquillo ball across the box for the only goal of the game to finish off a well-worked counter-attack 10 minutes after half-time, but Newcastle found themselves on the back foot for the majority of the match at the John Smith's Stadium. Huddersfield enjoyed more than 70 per cent of possession across the 90 minutes, but some strong defending and toothless attacking play contributed to a quiet afternoon for Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. The visitors should have had a second from another counter when Ayoze Perez was played clean through and lifted the ball over Jonas Lossl before being wrongly denied by the offside flag, but the decision had little significance on the result as Newcastle held firm for a first win in four. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Hadergjonaj (5), Zanka (6), Schindler (6), Kongolo (6), Lowe (6), Hogg (5), Billing (7), Bacuna (7), Pritchard (6), Depoitre (5) Subs: Durm (6), Sobhi (5), Mbenza (5) Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Clark (7), Schar (8), Lascelles (7), Manquillo (7), Diame (6), Ki (6), Kenedy (5), Perez (6), Rondon (7), Atsu (7) Subs: Hayden (6), Ritchie (n/a), Dummett (n/a) Man of the match: Fabian Schar Huddersfield dominated proceedings from the off but lacked a cutting edge, a recurring theme for David Wagner's side this season, and could not offer Laurent Depoitre any kind of quality service. The one clear chance he did get he volleyed over from eight yards when found unmarked by a Christopher Lowe corner, but that was the closest they came before half-time. Florent Hadergjonaj (right) attempted 10 crosses, but only three found their intended target in a wasteful performance At the other end, Lossl took a whack when diving at Christian Atsu's feet when the winger got away from impressive debutant Juninho Bacuna, and was also alert to keep out Schar when he was played in over the top from a free-kick, and arrowed an effort at the near post. Atsu was back at it after half-time, firing first-time at Lossl who showed good reflexes to palm away, but two minutes later he could do nothing to keep out a fine counter-attack which was slotted in by Rondon, but owed so much to a fine curled pass to the far side from Manquillo, who had raced from his own half to pick up Ayoze Perez's pass. Team news Huddersfield made three changes from their defeat to Arsenal, with the injured trio of Danny WIlliams, Tommy Smith and Aaron Mooy missing out. Florent Hadergjonaj and Philip Billing came in, so too Juninho Bacuna for his first Premier League start. As for Newcastle, they went back to a three-man defence with Fabian Schar restored, while Kenedy and Christian Atsu were also back in the line-up. Lowe forced a rare diving save from Dubravka moments later from 25 yards, and from the rebound Florent Hadergjonaj appeared to be pushed in the back by Kenedy inside the area, only for the offside flag to curtail his shouts for a penalty. It was another flag which would wrongly deny Newcastle a second goal on the break, when Atsu bent the ball around Christopher Schindler and into Perez's path, but after lifting it beyond Lossl his strike was chalked off before replays showed he had been in line with the last man. Huddersfield attempted a late onslaught but their possession rarely looked like turning into anything more threatening, as they were consigned to a fourth consecutive defeat to stay third bottom. Reaction David Wagner: \"It's what we have seen in recent weeks. Performance-wise we were good, sometimes very good, but we had less clear-cut chances than we have in the past. 2:36 David Wagner says he believes Huddersfield are playing well and have the ability to turn round their poor run of form following a 1-0 defeat to Newcastle. David Wagner says he believes Huddersfield are playing well and have the ability to turn round their poor run of form following a 1-0 defeat to Newcastle. \"We have to continue and still believe that we can change this. Because of how the players have done in recent weeks and how they stick together, it gives me everything I need to think we can change the results.\" Rafa Benitez: \"It was a really important for us, and them, so to get three points here in the way that we did, with a big effort from every player, is always something you have to be satisfied with. 1:28 Newcastle United manager Rafa Benitez says it was a very important victory against a 'difficult' Huddersfield side after their 1-0 win in the Premier League. Newcastle United manager Rafa Benitez says it was a very important victory against a 'difficult' Huddersfield side after their 1-0 win in the Premier League. \"We had to deal with all these situations, but in the first half we gave the ball away a little bit cheaply, we were stronger in the second half and they didn't have the space. It wasn't easy for them, and we knew we would have to play on the counter-attack.\" Opta facts Huddersfield have won just two of their last 14 games against Newcastle in all competitions (D4 L8). Newcastle are unbeaten in four consecutive Premier League away games (W2 D2) for the first time since November 2012. Newcastle United's Premier League games have seen 36 goals scored this season, fewer than any other side (scored 14, conceded 22). Since the start of last season, Huddersfield have failed to score in 29 Premier League games, eight more than any other side. Huddersfield posted a 73.6% possession figure in this game, the highest of any side to lose a Premier League game this season. Newcastle striker Salomón Rondón has netted four goals in his last six Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 24 in the competition. Newcastle' Javier Manquillo registered only his second assist in his 58 Premier League appearances. Man of the match - Fabian Schar Any of Newcastle's back three could stake a good claim for being the best player on the pitch, they soaked up everything Huddersfield threw at them during the game to make Dubravka's afternoon a quiet one. But Schar completed more tackles than anyone on his side (3), as well as making more interceptions (4), and every time Hadergjonaj got the ball in space on the right - and it was a lot - he was the man you expected to be heading it away at the back post. And he did. He wasn't far away from netting the opener either, playing his part in a lovely free-kick move before half-time when Lossl denied him at his near post with a sharp stop. What's next? Huddersfield host Southampton at the John Smith's Stadium on December 22 at 3pm, at the same time Newcastle will face Fulham at St James' Park."},{"date": "15/12/2019", "arena": "Wembley Stadium",

a 1-0 victory over Burnley at Wembley on Saturday. Burnley defended resolutely and wasted time where possible, and looked to be set for a point after Joe Hart twice denied Erik Lamela. However, Harry Kane picked out Eriksen in stoppage time, and the Dane fired beyond a helpless Hart to end Burnley's resistance in dramatic fashion. The victory ensures Spurs remain five points behind leaders Manchester City, while Burnley are teetering two points above the relegation zone in 17th. Christian Eriksen celebrates his late winner for Spurs Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (6), Trippier (6), Alderweireld (7), Davies (7), Rose (6), Sissoko (7), Skipp (6), Lamela (6), Moura (6), Alli (6), Kane (6) Subs: Eriksen (8), Son (6), Llorente (6) Burnley: Hart (7), Bardsley (7), Tarkowski (8), Mee (7), Long (7), Taylor (6), Lennon (6), Westwood (6), Cork (6), Brady (5), Barnes (6) Subs: Wood (6), Vokes (N/A), Hendrick (N/A) Man of the match: James Tarkowski The wet conditions made for a sluggish start at Wembley, as a Spurs side who made five changes from the midweek draw at Barcelona found it difficult to break down Burnley's five-man defence. However, the hosts did go close in the first half, with Lucas Moura dinking a first-time volley just wide before Lamela's stabbed effort was saved by Hart. Lucas Moura's dinked volley went just wide in the first half Kane also had a penalty claim waved away between those chances, with referee Graham Scott seeing nothing wrong with James Tarkowski's challenge on the Spurs striker. Team news Oliver Skipp, 18, made his full Premier League debut for Spurs. Kieran Trippier, Lucas Moura, Ben Davies and Erik Lamela returned to the starting XI. Two Burnley changes saw Kevin Long and Aaron Lennon replace Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Chris Wood. A wayward Ashley Barnes header was Burnley's best opportunity of the half, and the forward went close shortly after the break when his volley was blocked by Toby Alderweireld and then Kane. Oliver Skipp, 18, made his first Premier League start for Spurs Burnley's tactics continued to frustrate Spurs, with Robbie Brady and Phil Bardsley both booked for time-wasting, and Mauricio Pochettino sought to bring on Eriksen and Heung-min Son to change his side's fortunes. Hart then got down well to keep another Lamela attempt out with 15 minutes to go, but after Son fired wide from an acute angle, Eriksen finally broke Burnley's resolve with a sweeping effort at the near post. Opta stats None of Tottenham's last 21 Premier League games have ended level, with Spurs winning 16 and losing five since a 1-1 at Brighton in April. Only Bolton in 2011-12 (18) have had a longer run without a draw from the start of a Premier League campaign than Spurs this season (17). Burnley failed to register a single shot on target in this match. It's the third time they've done so in the Premier League this season - no other side has done so more than once. Erik Lamela had 47% of Tottenham's shots in this match (7/15) and 67% of their shots on target (2/3). The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"We fully deserved the victory. Sometimes you don't get the reward, but we did everything to win. \"If you work hard, have patience, and try and try, you get the reward. I'm so happy for the three very important points after qualifying in the Champions League. It's a massive week for us.\" 3:44 Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham got what they deserved in their 1-0 victory over Burnley Mauricio Pochettino says Tottenham got what they deserved in their 1-0 victory over Burnley Sean Dyche: \"We thought it was going to be that type of game, we came down here with a solid organisation. I was pleased with the way the players delivered it tactically because it's not easy with the change of shape. \"The players have been open-minded, and they delivered it today against a top, top side, a side that create a lot of chances but didn't so much today. 3:47 Burnley manager Sean Dyche says he was frustrated for his players after conceding a last-minute goal Burnley manager Sean Dyche says he was frustrated for his players after conceding a last-minute goal Man of the match - James Tarkowski Burnley were three minutes away from the point they were playing for, and though Spurs eventually broke them down, Tarkowski typified the visitors' dogged approach to the game. The defender made a match-high nine clearances and three interceptions, and reduced Kane to just two blocked attempts. Kane did get the last laugh, however, with his late assist for Eriksen, who will likely be viewed as Spurs' man of the match for his telling contribution.

Cardiff at Vicarage Road Watford ended a run of six games without a Premier League win with a 3-2 victory against Cardiff in an entertaining contest at Vicarage Road. In torrential conditions, the hosts raced into a deserved 3-0 lead courtesy of brilliant goals from Gerard Deulofeu (16), Jose Holebas (52) and Domingos Quina (68). Cardiff pulled a goal back with 10 minutes remaining through another stunning strike from Junior Hoilett and, two minutes later, Bobby Reid poked in a second to set up a nervy finish. Gerard Deulofeu tucks in his shot to give Watford the lead after 16 minutes Player ratings Watford: Foster (6), Femenia (6), Cathcart (6), Kabasele (6), Holebas (7), Doucoure (7), Sema (7), Quina (8), Pereyra (7), Deulofeu (9), Deeney (6). Subs: Cleverley (n/a), Success (6), Okaka (n/a). Cardiff: Etheridge (8), Bamba (6), Manga (6), Morrison (6), Bennett (6), Arter (5), Gunnarsson (5), Camarasa (6), Murphy (4), Hoilett (7), Paterson (5). Subs: Peltier (n/a), Reid (6), Mendez-Laing (6). Man of the match: Gerard Deulofeu. But Javi Gracia's side held on to move up to 10th in the Premier League as Cardiff slip to 16th - still four points above the relegation zone. Deulofeu was the game's stand-out performer, and the former Everton and Barcelona winger might have broken the deadlock before he eventually did, with his curled shot after six minutes just bending wide of the post. Cardiff were bidding to win consecutive top-flight games for the first time since 1962, but they fell behind when Deulofeu picked up Abdoulaye Doucoure's pass, ran between Bruno Ecuele Manga and Sean Morrison before tucking his low shot to the left of Neil Etheridge. Domingos Quina curls in his first goal for Watford to make it 3-0 on Saturday Team news Watford made one change to the side that drew 2-2 at Everton as Gerard Deulofeu replaced Isaac Success in partnering Troy Deeney. Tom Cleverley returned as a substitute after his lengthy absence. As for Cardiff, Nathaniel Mendez-Laing dropped to the bench as Junior Hoilett returned to the side in the one change from the 1-0 win over Southampton. Cardiff offered very little as an attacking threat in the opening 45 minutes, and they were fortunate not to trail by more at the interval, with Roberto Pereyra's free-kick in stoppage time tipped around the post by the busy Etheridge. Watford still have not lost three top-flight home games in a row since April 1988, and the hosts deservedly doubled their lead seven minutes after the re-start as Deulofeu turned provider for Holebas to curl in his third goal of the season from the edge of the area. Bobby Reid celebrates scoring Cardiff City's second goal Watford by now were playing full of confidence, and Quina underlined their dominance by stretching the lead 16 minutes later as he received Ken Sema's pass before bending his shot high to the right of Etheridge, much to the delight of the home supporters. There appeared little sign of life in Cardiff, but Hoilett restored hope in the 80th minute when he cut inside Doucoure and bent an unstoppable shot beyond Foster - a finish that was reminiscent of his goal against Wolves a fortnight ago. 3 - Watford vs Cardiff is the first Premier League game to see three goals from outside the box since Bournemouth v Crystal Palace in April. Blasters. #WATCAR — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) December 15, 2018 Two minutes later, the visitors halved the arrears as Reid pounced on a loose ball to stab his shot beyond Foster, but a point would have severely flattered Cardiff and Watford weathered the storm to return to winning ways. The managers Javi Gracia: \"I'm proud of my players in all the games we've played before. Always my players play with great commitment and today was no different. \"We played in very bad weather, and Cardiff are a team who always win a lot of challenges, a lot of second balls so it's not easy to play against them. Today, I'm very pleased.\" 3:45 Watford's Javi Gracia was delighted with the quality of his side's goals in their win Watford's Javi Gracia was delighted with the quality of his side's goals in their win Neil Warnock: \"I think Troy (Deeney) should've been booked for the challenge on our goalkeeper. If that had been down the other end, there would've been five or six lads surrounding the referee. \"I thought he could've pulled out and the studs went up, but we've got an inexperienced referee (Andrew Madley), the first game he's had in the Premier League (this season), we've got Andre Marriner stood at the side of me. I think it's a disgrace. 2:58 Cardiff's Neil Warnock wants to know why referee Andrew Madley was officiating Cardiff's Neil Warnock wants to know why referee Andrew Madley was officiating \"Why should we be an experiment? Is it just because it's Cardiff City? I don't accept that, I think it's poor today. I think an experienced ref would've done something about the challenge.\" Opta stats This was Watford's first win in seven Premier League games (D2 L4), since beating Huddersfield 3-0 in October. Cardiff scored twice in an away Premier League game for the first time this season, last doing so in March 2014 vs West Brom (3-3). Watford (2) vs Cardiff (1) was the first Premier League match to see three goals scored from outside the box this season. At 19 years and 27 days, Domingos Quina became Watford's youngest-ever Premier League goalscorer. Abdoulaye Doucoure registered his fifth Premier League assist this season - only Troy Deeney in 2015-16 (7) has provided more for Watford in a single campaign. Watford's Jose Holebas has been directly involved in more goals than any other Premier League defender this season (7 - 3 goals, 4 assists). Cardiff's Junior Hoilett has scored two goals in his last four Premier League games - more than he'd managed in his previous 61 in the competition (1). Man of the match - Gerard Deulofeu This was a vibrant attacking display from the Hornets, and Deulofeu was right at the heart of everything creative from Gracia's side. Etheridge won his duel with Roberto Pereya, making three fine saves to deny the Argentine, but he came out second best to Deulofeu, whose opening goal set the standards for what followed. Deulofeu broke the deadlock with a brilliant individual strike The former Everton winger blows hot and cold, but in blustery conditions he thrived, providing the assist for Holebas' second to vindicate Gracia's decision to recall him to the starting line-up. It was the first time Deulofeu both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for Watford, last doing so in November 2015 for Everton against Sunderland. What's next? Watford travel to face West Ham at the London Stadium in the Premier League next Saturday at 3pm, while Cardiff host Manchester United later that day at 5.30pm."},{"date": "15/12/2019", "arena":

a third win on the bounce as goals from Raul Jimenez and Ivan Cavaleiro gave them a 2-0 victory over Bournemouth. Neither side were able to find their best form at Molineux but Jimenez (12) profited from Charlie Daniels' error to give Wolves the lead and, with Bournemouth pushing for an equaliser, Cavaleiro (90+4) made sure of the points deep into stoppage time. The defeat continues a worrying run of form for Eddie Howe's side, who have now lost six of their last seven Premier League games. They remain in the top half though while Nuno Espirito Santo's side are up to seventh, overtaking today's opponents, and just one point behind Manchester United. Player ratings Wolves: Patricio (6), Doherty (6), Bennett (7), Coady (7), Boly (7), Jonny (6), Neves (7), Moutinho (7), Gibbs-White (7), Jota (6), Jimenez (8). Subs: Costa (7), Saiss (6), Cavaleiro (7) Bournemouth: Begovic (5), Cook (6), Ake (6), Mings (5), Daniels (4), Ibe (5), Lerma (6), Surman (5), Stanislas (6), Fraser (4), King (6). Subs: Rico (5), Wilson (6), Mousset (N/A) Man of the match: Raul Jimenez Both sides failed to make the most of some presentable openings after a lively start with Josh King waiting too long to get his shot away after finding space on the right-hand side of the box in the third minute, allowing Conor Coady to slide across and divert it over the bar. Carelessness was the theme of a first half heavily punctuated by errors but it was Bournemouth who were punished as Daniels' drilled his cross-field pass straight to Diogo Jota. The winger drove past Nathan Ake and into the box and although he dragged his shot, Jimenez was on hand at the far post to stroke the ball into the empty net from six yards. Bournemouth were hampered further after Tyrone Mings was forced off just after the half hour mark, holding his lower back, while Wolves lost Jota to injury after a collision with Steve Cook just before the break. Team news Wolves made four changes to the team that won at Newcastle as Jonny, Joao Moutinho, Morgan Gibbs-White and Raul Jimenez returned to the starting XI in place of Romain Saiss, Ruben Vinagre, Helder Costa and Adama Traore. Meanwhile, Eddie Howe brought Tyrone Mings and Jordon Ibe in for Simon Francis and David Brooks. Callum Wilson returned to the squad and took his place among the substitutes. The Bournemouth defender got across superbly to deny the winger a one-on-one opportunity after Jimenez's excellent pass but Jota stayed down and was unable to continue. Helder Costa replaced him and should have doubled Wolves' lead just before the hour after being sent clear down the right by Morgan Gibbs-White. Costa was unable to get the ball onto his favoured left foot, Jimenez was straining to get forward in support but the substitute went for goal with his right and sliced the effort horribly wide with only Asmir Begovic to beat. Howe sent on the fit-again Callum Wilson and his introduction triggered the start of Bournemouth's best spell of the game. Junior Stanislas rattled the bar with a free-kick from the edge of the box but, as the game wore on, Wolves wrestled back control and after Costa's perfectly-timed through ball sent him clear, Cavaleiro slotted the ball past Begovic to secure the victory in the final seconds. The managers 1:52 Wolves manager Nuno Santo praised his players' performance against a 'very good' Bournemouth team Wolves manager Nuno Santo praised his players' performance against a 'very good' Bournemouth team 1:54 Eddie Howe says Bournemouth haven't been clinical enough as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at Wolves Eddie Howe says Bournemouth haven't been clinical enough as they fell to a 2-0 defeat at Wolves Man of the match - Raul Jimenez The Wolves frontman showed his predatory instincts to ghost in at the far post to score the opening goal but it was his all-round play that really caught the eye. A stunning ball with the outside of his right foot to send Jota away at the end of the first half showed he is far more than just a target man. His link-up play was as immaculate as ever and with his willingness to run the channels and harry the Bournemouth defenders, even when he wasn't directly threatening the goal, he was keeping the back line occupied. Opta stats Wolves have won three consecutive top-flight games for the first time since March 1980. This was Wolves' first victory against Bournemouth in all competitions since December 1989, having failed to win any of their previous five meetings (D2 L3). Bournemouth have lost six of their last seven Premier League games (W1) - as many defeats as in their previous 21 games in the competition. Wolves have scored two goals in each of their last three Premier League games - they last went on a longer run of scoring two or more goals in consecutive Premier League games in August 2011 (run of five). Since keeping three consecutive clean sheets in October, Bournemouth have conceded in each of their last seven Premier League games (16 goals in total). What's next? Wolves' final game before Christmas sees them host Liverpool on Friday Night Football while Bournemouth travel to Chelsea for the Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday before they welcome Brighton to

"report": "2:41 Highlights: Fulham 0-2 West Ham Highlights: Fulham 0-2 West Ham West Ham claimed a fourth Premier League win in a row with a 2-0 victory over rock-bottom Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday. Fulham missed a host of early chances before Robert Snodgrass and Michail Antonio exposed their defensive frailties in the space of 12 minutes to put the Hammers two up at the break. West Ham's first-half double took Fulham's goals conceded tally to 42 for the season, as their wait for a first clean sheet of the campaign continued. The defeat leaves Fulham three points from safety at the bottom on the Premier League, while West Ham climb to ninth after their best run in the Premier League since February 2014. Player ratings Fulham: Rico (5), Odoi (5), Mawson (5), Chambers (5), Ream (5), Bryan (6), Seri (5), Schurrle (6), Cairney (6), Kamara (5), Mitrovic (5). Subs: Kebano (n/a), Johansen (5), Christie (6). West Ham: Fabianski (7), Zabaleta (6), Balbuena (8), Diop (6), Masuaku (6), Snodgrass (8), Noble (6), Rice (6), Anderson (7), Hernandez (6), Antonio (8). Subs: Carroll (5), Obiang (5), Diangana (n/a). Man of the Match: Fabian Balbuena. Recalled into the Fulham starting line-up after his goal at Old Trafford, Aboubakar Kamara nearly vindicated his selection with the opening goal on nine minutes, but striker spurned a glorious chance as Lukasz Fabianski saved his near-post shot. And Fulham were made to pay for that miss as Felipe Anderson spun away from Denis Odoi and rolled the ball back to the edge of the area where Snodgrass curled a fine effort into the top corner. Declan Rice and Tom Cairney in action at Craven Cottage Aleksandar Mitrovic failed to haul Fulham level when he headed wide from a Joe Bryan cross on 26 minutes, but the chances kept on falling Fulham's way. A brilliant Odoi cross landed perfectly for Kamara a minute later but Fabianski got down low to his left to keep the header out. Frustrated with his earlier misses, Kamara then stung the palms of the West Ham 'keeper with a 25-yard drive. Team news Calum Chambers and Aboubakar Kamara replaced Ryan Sessegnon and the suspended Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa for Fulham. Michael Antonio partnered Javier Hernandez in attack for West Ham following Lucas Perez’s injury. But after a flurry of missed Fulham chances, West Ham gave then hosts a lesson in finishing as Javier Hernandez flicked a cross from the left onto Antonio at the back post, and the forward took a touch to control before slotting a second through Sergio Rico's legs. From there on, Fulham showed little sign of getting back into the game. A driven cross from Cyrus Christie was nearly turned into his own net by Issa Diop, but that was a brief moment of panic in an otherwise assured defensive display from West Ham. Robert Snodgrass celebrates his goal with Javier Hernandez Opta stats West Ham have won four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since February 2014. Fulham haven't kept a clean sheet in any of their last 21 Premier League games, conceding at least twice in 18 of those games (53 goals in total). West Ham have won more Premier League London derbies this season (2) than they did in the whole of 2017-18 (1). This is the first time they've won back-to-back league London derbies since a run of three in October 2015. West Ham's Robert Snodgrass has been directly involved in five goals in his last four Premier League games (2 goals, 3 assists), after previously going 16 games without a goal or assist in the competition. Following his assist today, Felipe Anderson has been involved in more Premier League goals this season than any other West Ham player (8 - 6 goals, 2 assists). Javier Hernandez's assist for West Ham's second goal was the Mexican's first assist in the Premier League since April 2014, when he set up Juan Mata for Man Utd vs Newcastle.

Claudio Ranieri says it is in the tough times that teams must stick together following Fulham’s 2-0 home defeat to West Ham. Claudio Ranieri: \"We shot at goal 16 times - we have to be more and more effective. They create two counter-attacks and they scored two goals. It's unbelievable. I can say nothing today. They tried their best. When you play a team with experience and quality you try to do your best and we tried.

We didn't create too many chances but we scored the chances and we defended very well, especially in the second half.\" Man of the Match - Fabian Balbuena The Paraguayan did not put a foot wrong at Craven Cottage, despite the testing conditions in sodden south-west London. Many eyebrows were raised when West Ham signed Balbuena last summer, but with each passing game, it's looking like a shrewd piece of business from the Hammers. What's next?

free-kick rescued a point for Marco Silva as his reunion with Watford ended 2-2 on Monday Night Football. Abdoulaye Doucoure looked to have headed the winner after Seamus Coleman's own goal cancelled out Richarlison's opener against his old club. Gylfi Sigurdsson then missed a penalty for the second time this season but Watford were denied their first win at Goodison Park as Digne opened his account for the Toffees with a sumptuous effort in stoppage-time. The draw sees Everton miss the chance to climb back into the top six, they remain seventh, three points and five places clear of Watford in 12th. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Coleman (6), Keane (6), Mina (6), Digne (7), Gueye (6), Gomes (7), Walcott (6), Sigurdsson (5), Bernard (6), Richarlison (7).

Subs: Deulofeu (6), Chalobah (5), Mariappa (n/a). Man of the Match: Abdoulaye Doucoure. It took just 15 minutes for Richarlison to show Watford what they were missing as he peeled into space in the penalty area and applied a clinical finish to Andre Gomes' cutback from the right. Replays showed Theo Walcott to be in an offside position in the build-up to Richarlison's opener, but the goal was allowed to stand. Everton's Richarlison celebrates after scoring against his former club Watford Troy Deeney missed a glorious chance to draw Watford level four minutes later when he diverted Domingos Quina's cross over an open goal, although the linesman's flag was already up to spare his blushes. Both sides had chances before the interval as Pereyra glanced a Ken Sema cross wide on 38 minutes before Sigurdsson's effort was blocked by Craig Cathcart. Watford returned from the break energised and nearly scored on three occasions early in the second period. Watford's Roberto Pereyra celebrates with Domingos Quina The travelling Watford fans thought Pereyra had hauled them level when he fired a free-kick into the side-netting on 55 minutes. A long throw then fell for Doucoure, who saw a shot inadvertently blocked on the ground by Yerry Mina, before Deeney's shot with the outside of his foot was tipped away by Jordan Pickford. But Watford finally drew level on 63 minutes when Coleman turned the ball into his own net after Pereyra's shot cannoned back off the post. Team news Theo Walcott, Bernard and Michael Keane were drafted into the Everton side after they were held at home to Newcastle last week. Javi Gracia made two changes as Domingos Quina and Ken Sema started for Watford. And the Hornets completed a remarkable turnaround two minutes later, taking the lead for the first time thanks to Doucoure's towering header. Everton were handed the chance to restore parity on 68 minutes when Christian Kabasele bundled Mina over in the area, but Sigurdsson's penalty was saved by the legs of Ben Foster. Watford's Abdoulaye Doucoure scored his side's second goal against Everton Watford looked set to return to winning ways after five games without a win but Digne has the final say with virtually the last kick, curling a stunning free-kick beyond Foster to salvage a point. Opta stats Watford remain winless in all 13 of their league trips to Goodison Park against Everton (W0 D2 L11). 13 of the last 14 goals scored in Premier League clashes between Everton and Watford have come in the second-half. Only Burnley (9) have conceded more Premier League goals in the 90th minute or later since the start of 2017-18 than Watford (8 - level with Southampton and West Ham). There were just two minutes and 10 seconds between Watford's two goals in this game. At 19 years and 22 days, Domingos Quina is the second-youngest player ever to start a Premier League game for Watford after Al Bangura in December 2006 v Reading (18y 319d). Everton's Richarlison is the fourth different player to both score a Premier League goal both for and against Watford, after Ashley Young, Heidar Helguson and Daryl Janmaat. Everton full-back Seamus Coleman has scored two own-goals in his last three Premier League appearances against Watford. Everton playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson has failed to convert two of his last three Premier League penalties as an Everton player, after scoring each of the six before that whilst at Swansea City. Lucas Digne's equaliser for Everton was the second-latest goal in the Premier League this season at 95:08, behind only Ross Barkley's strike for Chelsea against Manchester United in October (95:27).

Wolves Newcastle 1-2 Wolves Matt Doherty's stoppage-time header ensured Wolves made it back-to-back wins in the Premier League following a 2-1 win against 10-man Newcastle at St James' Park. Diogo Jota (17) scored his second goal in as many Premier League matches to give the visitors the lead but Newcastle were back on level terms six minutes later through Ayoze Perez's header (23). The hosts were left to play 33 minutes with 10 men when referee Mike Dean showed DeAndre Yedlin a straight red card for bringing down Jota, but it looked like Rafael Benitez's side had done enough to hold on for a point until Doherty pounced in the fourth minute of stoppage time to seal Wolves' first away win in two months. Victory sees Nuno Espirito Santo's side move up to 10th in the Premier League, while Newcastle stay 15th, three points above the relegation places. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Clark (6), Lascelles (6), Fernandez (6), Yedlin (5), Ki (6), Diame (7), Ritchie (6), Atsu (7), Perez (8), Rondon (8). Subs: Manquillo (6), Joselu (n/a), Kenedy (n/a). Wolves: Patricio (7), Doherty (7), Bennett (6), Saiss (6), Coady (7), Boly (6), Vinagre (6), Neves (6), Jota (8), Costa (7), Traore (6). Subs: Jimenez (7), Gibbs-White (6), Moutinho (6). Man of the match: Ayoze Perez The visitors made the perfect start, taking the lead in the 17th minute when Helder Costa's flat cross from the right picked out Jota, who controlled the ball on his chest before volleying past Martin Dubravka from close range. Newcastle almost found themselves further behind as Jota's low cross almost picked out Adama Traore at the far post but they were back on level terms six minutes after going behind with Salomon Rondon playing a key role. The Venezuela striker's stunning free-kick beat Rui Patricio but crashed back off the underside of the crossbar. The visitors struggled to clear which allowed Rondon the chance to produce an inch-perfect cross for Perez, who flicked a superb header past Rui Patricio. Ayoze Perez (L) celebrates after scoring his team's first goal with Salomon Rondon (R) Newcastle were forced into a change at the break as Javier Manquillo replaced Federico Fernandez, who picked up a calf injury. It also meant a positional change for Yedlin, who moved to an unfamiliar position on the right side of a back three. The hosts were then reduced to 10 men in the 57th minute when, under no pressure at all, Yedlin slipped as he tried to play the ball to Jamaal Lascelles. It allowed Jota to nip and burst past the American, who deliberately pulled him back just outside the penalty area leaving the referee with no choice but to brandish a red card. Nuno sent on Raul Jimenez and Morgan Gibbs-White in place of Traore and Romain Saiss in search of a winner and the changes almost paid off, Jimenez striking the ball against the crossbar from 20 yards in the 74th minute. Team news Matt Ritchie, Ayoze Perez and Ciaran Clark all returned to the starting XI as Rafa Benitez switched things up following the 1-1 draw with Everton. Meanwhile, Wolves made three changes too as Ruben Neves, Adama Traore and Helder Costa were handed starts. Benitez, already upset by decision to send off Yedlin, was further frustrated when Perez was left clutching his face on the floor following a challenge from Wily Boly. Wolves launched a counter-attack and Doherty almost picked out the far corner but he was denied by a flying Dubravka, who turned the ball around the post. Just as it was looking as if 10-man Newcastle would hold on for a draw, a stoppage-time shot from Jota was pushed into the path of Doherty by Dubravka and the Republic of Ireland international could not miss with a close-range header right at the death. Doherty (right) scored deep into stoppage time to secure Wolves' 2-1 win at Newcastle Opta stats Wolves have won their first ever Premier League game against Newcastle after drawing four and losing two of their previous six meetings. Nuno's side have won six of their 16 Premier League games this season, more than they managed in the whole of their last top-flight campaign (5 wins in 2011-12). No team have had more 90th minute winners this season than Wolves (2, also Man Utd), with Newcastle losing to a 90th-minute winner for the second time this season; more than any other side. All seven meetings between Newcastle and Wolves in the Premier League have seen both teams score - it's the most played fixture in the competition not to see a clean sheet. Only Everton (91) and Arsenal (86) have had more Premier League red cards than Newcastle (82). Seven of Newcastle's 13 Premier League goals this season have been headers, including six of the seven they've scored at St James' Park. Newcastle have picked up just six points from their opening nine home Premier League games this campaign (P9 W2 D0 L7) - their worst ever start after nine home matches of a season in the top four tiers of English Football (previously eight points in the 1957/58 season assuming three points for a win). Jota has scored in back to back Premier League games, after not scoring in his first 13 in competition Rondon has been directly involved in four of Newcastle's last six Premier League goals (3 goals, 1 assist), including the last three in a row at St James' Park. Man of the Match - Ayoze Perez Andy Hinchcliffe: \"Ayoze Perez has taken a lot of stick off Newcastle fans recently for not taking his chances. He took his goal brilliantly with a superb flicked header. He's worked hard for the cause as well.\" Man of the Match, @NUFC’s Ayoze Perez 1 goal from 2 shots 46 touches 7 touches in opposition box (joint-most in match) Involved in 11 of Newcastle’s last 22 PL goals either side of summer - scored 8, assisted 3 pic.twitter.com/wPm3OmLeRH — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) December 9, 2018 The managers Rafael Benitez: \"I saw the replay and we need VAR right now. You can see the replay. I was praising the referees after a player was talking and they fined me. Imagine how I feel now. It was an elbow in the face, he was bleeding - it was so obvious. But I have seen the replay. You can see the replay and see the face of the player and after, what happened. Anyone can see that, so we need VAR.\" 2:30 Rafa Benitez says it's clear VAR needs to be introduced in the Premier League after several decisions didn't go Newcastle's way in their Premier League defeat to Wolves. Rafa Benitez says it's clear VAR needs to be introduced in the Premier League after several decisions didn't go Newcastle's way in their Premier League defeat to Wolves. Nuno Espirito Santo: \"Honestly, with all my respect - which is a lot - for Rafa, the law is clear. You can argue if Lascelles can arrive on time to avoid the one v one of Diogo with the goalkeeper. I don't think so. Honestly, I have seen it and I don't think so. I think Diogo is clear one v one with the goalkeeper, so the law is clear and it is a red card.\" 3:22 Nuno Espirito Santo says his Wolves side must control games better, but praised his players for never giving up as they got a late winner against Newcastle in the Premier League. Nuno Espirito Santo says his Wolves side must control games better, but praised his players for never giving up as they got a late winner against Newcastle in the Premier League. The pundits Sky Sports pundits Matt Murray and Shola Ameobi both felt Willy Boly should have been red carded for an elbow on Ayoze Perez inside the area. Murray: \"I've got a Wolves hat on, but for me, that's a red card. If you jump with your arms in the air like that you're running the risk of giving away a penalty. It's definitely a penalty if VAR looked at it. You couldn't complain if he got a red card too. It was a pivotal moment.\" Ameobi: \"I've broken a couple of cheekbones from challenges like that and it is very dangerous. It's a definite red card. It's not a natural movement, he's going up for the ball - there's no reason to swing his arm back.\" What's next? Newcastle's next game is on Saturday when they travel to the John Smith's Stadium to face Huddersfield (3pm).

in the Premier League Mohamed Salah scored a hat-trick as Liverpool went to the top of the Premier League with a 4-0 win at Bournemouth. Having not scored in three games, Salah gave Liverpool a controversial lead (25), converting from close range having been in an offside position as Asmir Begovic fumbled from Roberto Firmino's effort. But there was nothing contentious about Salah's second (48), slotting into the far corner after Steve Cook had handed the ball to Liverpool high up the pitch, and Cook's day got worse as he put through his own net for the third (68). Mohamed Salah celebrates his goal to put Liverpool ahead Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (4), Francis (5), Cook (3), Ake (5), Daniels (5), Lerma (4), Surman (5), Brooks (5), Stanislas (5), Fraser (5), King (5) Subs: Mousset (5), Mings (NA), Rico (NA) Liverpool: Alisson (7), Robertson (8), Milner (7), Matip (7), Van Dijk (7), Fabinho (7), Keita (8), Wijnaldum (7), Shaqiri (8), Salah (9), Firmino (8) Subs: Mane (6), Lallana (6), Henderson (NA) Man of the match: Mo Salah Salah then got his third, rounding Begovic twice to coolly slot home (77), and the Reds remained top of the league at the end of the day as Chelsea ended Manchester City's unbeaten run with a 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge. The win also means Liverpool matched their record of 17 Premier League games unbeaten, set in 2008. Despite Liverpool dominating the early possession, Bournemouth forced Alisson into the first save as David Brooks saw his shot from a tight angle beaten away at the near post. But Liverpool took the lead on 26 minutes as Firmino's dipping half-volley from the edge of the box proved too hot for Begovic to handle, squirming out for Salah to convert from close range. However, replays showed Salah was fractionally offside from Firmino's shot. Team news Top scorer Callum Wilson missed out for Bournemouth due to injury, with Stanislas coming in. Surman also replaced Cook. Liverpool made five changes; Alberto Moreno drops out of the 18, Joe Gomez is injured, and Andy Robertson came back in. Jordan Henderson dropped to the bench, Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum started, while Divock Origi and Daniel Sturridge were replaced by Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. Salah put Liverpool ahead in controversial fashion in the 26th minute Outside of the box, Salah's touch was amiss for the first hour, but the Egyptian was back to his deadly best inside it. After Cook had given Firmino the ball on a plate on halfway, the Brazilian fed Salah, who stayed on his feet after a cynical Cook tackle before rolling it into the far corner. Josh King, in for injured top scorer Callum Wilson, could have halved the deficit soon after, but didn't get his shot away from close range, seemingly expecting a challenge from Alisson. Cook then turned into his own net midway through the second half, hooking Andy Robertson's left-wing cross behind him and beyond Begovic's grasp as the defender attempted to clear. Mohamed Salah rounds Asmir Begovic for a second time to score his hat-trick goal And Cook's day to forget was capped off late on as he struggled in a foot race with Salah, made a hash of his sliding clearance, and allowed last season's top scorer to round Begovic twice and poke home nonchalantly for his 10th league goal of the season. The managers Eddie Howe on offside opener: \"It was a tough game. The first goal was a real key moment in the match. Up until that point, I thought we defended well, our shape was OK, we kept them away from our goal and, and Salah is offside. 1:53 Howe felt the first goal was clearly offside Howe felt the first goal was clearly offside \"The goal shouldn't stand, and in these games, when you're playing the big guns, you need these decisions to go in your favour. Jurgen Klopp on title challenge: \"I do think the only way to be successful is to be completely focused on yourself, that's what we try to do. It is quite difficult because people ask us about other teams, we are not really interested in that but we give answers because we are polite!\" 4:22 Jurgen Klopp hailed Salah's performance Jurgen Klopp hailed Salah's performance The pundit - Jamie Redknapp \"Liverpool are purring right now, and if they can get through on Tuesday [in Champions League against Napoli], keep going in the Premier League, they can hang onto Man City's coat-tails. \"Virgil van Dijk can wear his kit on Tuesday night, it was that clean. Liverpool never got out of second gear, it was so comfortable in possession. When you've got a player like Salah, he can take a game away from any team.\" Opta stats Since the start of 2015/16, Bournemouth have scored more own goals in the Premier League (8) than any other side currently playing in the division. Liverpool have accrued 42 points from their opening 16 league games of the season, their best-ever tally at this stage of a top-flight campaign. James Milner made his 500th Premier League appearance in this match, the 13th player to reach this landmark and the second youngest to do so (32y 338d), behind only Gareth Barry (32y 219d). Bournemouth's Asmir Begovic has made eight errors leading directly to a goal in the Premier League since the start of 2017/18, more than any other player. Since the start of last season, only Lionel Messi (43) has scored more league goals in the big five European leagues than Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (42). Man of the match - Mo Salah You sense this was just the tonic for the Egyptian, who had not been at his blistering best of late and even looked sluggish in the first half. Though his first came fortuitously, and from an offside position, his second was a class act. Not many would stay on their feet as Steve Cook attempted to hack him down from behind, and Salah's directed finish into the far corner was trademark. Salah now has 10 Premier League goals this season By the time the third goal game, Salah's confidence was back. He rounded Begovic not once but twice, before teasing the Bournemouth defenders as he poked home. He even offered James Milner the man-of-the-match award after the game, on the midfielder's 500th Premier League appearance. If Liverpool want this league title, they need Salah in this form. 2:38 Salah didn't accept his MOTM award, instead giving it to James Milner Salah didn't accept his MOTM award, instead giving it to James Milner What's next?

Huddersfield Arsenal 1-0 Huddersfield Lucas Torreira's late overhead kick gave Arsenal a hard-fought 1-0 win over Huddersfield and extended their unbeaten run to 21 games. Unai Emery's side were frustrated for long periods during a tetchy encounter at the Emirates but Torreira's acrobatic effort from close range (83) was enough to secure all three points for the hosts. Referee Paul Tierney was kept busy with nine players booked in total, three for simulation, as tempers flared either side of the break, while Alexandre Lacazette had a goal controversially disallowed for offside in the first half.

There was little in the way of chances before the game sprung to life just before the half hour as Arsenal missed two glorious opportunities in the space of two minutes. Firstly, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, unmarked in the middle of the area, diverted Granit Xhaka's cross-cum-shot wide from six yards and then Lacazette lost his footing and fired over from 12 yards after being found by Matteo Guendouzi. A flurry of yellow cards followed as Arsenal's players became irritated by some robust Huddersfield challenges and responded in kind but it was the decision to rule out Lacazette's strike shortly before half-time that really riled the home fans and players alike. Team news Arsenal made three changes to the side that drew at Manchester United with Stephan Lichtsteiner, Granit Xhaka and Alexandre Lacazette coming in for Rob Holding, Aaron Ramsey and Alex Iwobi. There was still no Mesut Ozil in the 18. David Wagner also made three changes to the Huddersfield side after their loss at Bournemouth. In came Tommy Smith, Chris Lowe and Danny Williams, making way were Florent Hadergjonaj, Philip Billing and Erik Durm. The Frenchman was offside as Aubameyang flicked the ball on but Mathias Jorgensen intercepted it, only to under-hit his pass back to Jonas Lossl, allowing Lacazette to round the goalkeeper and finish. However, the assistant referee deemed that it was all the same phase of play and raised his flag the moment the striker touched the ball. With the home side still raging at that decision, Huddersfield had the chance to anger them further as Tommy Smith pulled the ball back for Alex Pritchard, who had the freedom of the penalty area, only for the midfielder to blaze it over the bar from eight yards. Emery made a double change at half-time, introducing Alex Iwobi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan but after an initial burst at the start of the second period, the game reverted to the same pattern as the first. Chances remained hard to come by before Guendouzi, who had been booked for diving minutes earlier, clipped a lovely ball to the far post. After a brief scramble, Aubameyang managed to dig out a cross and Torreira was waiting inside the six-yard box to apply the athletic finish. Lucas Torreira scores with an acrobatic effort Huddersfield pushed for an equaliser without success but it was not all good news for Arsenal, who will be without Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi for their next league game at Southampton. Both received their fifth bookings of the season, leaving Laurent Koscielny, who returned to the matchday squad on Saturday after seven months out, as their only available centre-back. Man of the match - Lucas Torreira It has taken less than half a season but Torreira already seems to have established himself as Arsenal's key man. They were far from their best against a combative Huddersfield but, even putting aside his match-winning overhead kick, the central midfielder was always involved. He put his foot in when needed and despite being on the end of a number of hefty challenges, never shied away from the next one. His curling effort from distance forced Jonas Lossl into a fine save at the end of the first half but seven minutes from time, there was nothing the goalkeeper could do to deny him.

The Clarets had not won in over two months heading into Saturday's game - last beating Cardiff on September 30 - but ground out a vital victory at a wet and windy Turf Moor. James Tarkowski turned home a Jack Cork shot with his midriff in the 40th minute to lift Burnley into 17th place on 12 points - two ahead of Huddersfield in 18th. For Brighton, they slip down a place in 11th and their own three-game unbeaten streak comes to an end.

Man of the match: Johann Burg Gudmundsson. The opening half an hour was a tepid affair, with Burnley have the first shot of the game on the 30-minute mark. Johann Berg Gudmundsson's cross picked out Robbie Brady at the top of the box. He hit the ball first time, but his connection was not the best as it flew over the top of the crossbar. Five minutes later and Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan was forced into two good saves. Brady's ball into the area was controlled well by the chest of Ashley Barnes, who then tapped it into the path of Chris Wood. However, his shot at the post was saved well by Ryan. He was down low again not long after to collect a Brady shot that fizzed through a packed box. Burnley took advantage of their pressure in the 40th minute, although it was a scrappy affair. Gudmundsson put a cross into the area after a cleared free-kick, picking out Ben Mee on the left. His ball forward was cleared by a Ryan punch, with the rebound falling to Cork. He struck and the effort was turned home by the midriff of Tarkowski to see the hosts ahead. Team news Burnley named the same matchday 18 from midweek. Brighton named three changes with Bruno, Florian Andone and Anthony Knockaert coming into the XI. Eight minutes after the restart, and Burnley had a penalty appeal turned down. Yves Bissouma tried to clear a Ryan pass with a high boot as Phil Bardsley came in to meet the ball with his head. The Burnley defender went to ground, apparently being caught, although Bissouma did get to the ball first as Martin Atkinson waved away the claims with Burnley now going 58 Premier League games without being awarded a penalty. Tarkowski nearly scored another in the 62nd minute after a brilliant corner delivery from Gudmundsson and although the defender rose highest to meet it, the ball just whistled past the back post. Brighton could have snatched a point with seven minutes of normal time to play as they pummelled the Burnley box. Glenn Murray lofted a superb ball into the box to meet the run of Jurgen Locadia, but he put his header over the crossbar from just inside the six-yard box as the hosts saw out the important victory. Phil Bardsley is challenged by Florin Andone Opta stats Brighton have enjoyed just two wins in their last 22 Premier League away games, drawing five and losing 15. The three Premier League clashes between these two sides have produced a total of just the one goal. Burnley registered a clean sheet at Turf Moor for only the third time in their last 18 league games there. Burnley's Jack Cork has registered goal involvements in consecutive Premier League appearances (assist v Brighton, goal v Liverpool) for the first time since March 2016 with Swansea. The managers Sean Dyche: \"It certainly feels better than some results recently. It was a very resilient performance and more like us. We've been trying to get ourselves back to that and we need to know there is more quality to come. We know there's more ability to come from the players but we needed to get back to a basic framework that works for us and has worked for us so many times. \"That was on show today against a side that do equally keep it tight, so we didn't think it was going to be a flurry of goals. We thought it might be a tight game and it ended up being exactly that.\" 3:18 Sean Dyche says Burnley getting back to basics in their framework helped secure a 1-0 win over Brighton, but insists there is still quality to come.

Chris Hughton: \"It's disappointing because I thought we were the better team,\" he told Sky Sports. \"Probably what we weren't able to do was capitalise on our good play, particularly in that final third, but you're up against a team that are fighting hard and they had to defend well. \"The positive is the level of performance was good. We had a defeat a few games ago where we couldn't argue because our level of performance didn't deserve to get anything more than we got, but I thought we deserved more today.\" 2:07 Paul Merson gives his thoughts on a better Burnely, as they took on Brighton in the Premier League Paul Merson gives his thoughts on a better Burnely, as they took on Brighton in the Premier League Man of the match - Johann Berg Gudmundsson Gudmundsson was back to his best on Saturday and it is no surprise that Burnley won with him playing well. He gave Brighton the runaround down the right flank - especially in the first half - and got back to clear the danger in the box on a few occasions too. His set-piece deliveries were of a good quality and he had a hand in the build-up to the goal. It was a shame he went off injured in the 73rd minute with fatigue possibly playing a factor as he popped up all over the Burnley pitch. Hopefully, he just needs rest and will be back in action next weekend. What's next? Burnley are on their travels next Saturday when they take on Tottenham at Wembley in the Premier League. Brighton will be playing on Sunday, December 16 when they welcome Chelsea to the Amex Stadium."},{"date": "08/12/2019", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 30067, "home_team": {"name":

only goal to spoil Ralph Hasenhuttl's first match in charge of Southampton as Cardiff won 1-0 on Saturday. Paterson's scrappy second-half finish (73) following a glaring error by defender Jannik Vestergaard was enough for Cardiff to secure a victory over Hasenhuttl's side. In a game of few clear-cut chances, Southampton's Stuart Armstrong felt he should have had a penalty before the hour mark when he fell under the challenge of Victor Camarasa in the box, but referee Jon Moss waved away the protests. The result means Cardiff move up into 14th place. Southampton, meanwhile, drop down into 19th on nine points as their worst run of form in 20 years continues. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (7), Manga (6), Morrison (7), Bamba (7), Bennett (6), Gunnarsson (7), Camarasa (6), Arter (6), Murphy (7), Mendez-Laing (7), Paterson (8) Subs: Harris (6), Hoilett (7), Ralls (N/A) Southampton: McCarthy (6), Valery (4), Vestergaard (4), Bednarek (4), Targett (4), Romeu (5), Lemina (5), Hojbjerg (5), Armstrong (6), Redmond (6), Austin (5) Subs: Stephens (6) Ward-Prowse (5), Gabbiadini (5) Man of the match: Callum Paterson Southampton started the game brightly in a 4-3-2-1 formation with wide men Armstrong and Nathan Redmond playing very narrow, but the first chance of the game fell to Cardiff. Josh Murphy's cross was excellently recovered by Nathaniel Mendez-Laing to tee up Harry Arter, but the Bournemouth loanee failed to get enough power behind his shot. In the 17th minute, Murphy had the chance to put Neil Warnock's side in front, but his low drive was well blocked by Alex McCarthy. Seven minutes later and Murphy was slipped through by Paterson into a one-on-one following a lapse of concentration from Jan Bednarek, but McCarthy took the ball away from the 23-year-old's feet as he tried to round the England international. Mendez-Laing, on just his third Premier League start, had a venomous strike on goal just before the break, but McCarthy was there to make another stop as he tipped a powerful effort over the bar. Team news Joe Ralls and Junior Hoilett dropped to the bench. Josh Murphy and Nathaniel Mendez-Laing took their places. Valery, Bednarek, Vestergaard, Romeu, Lemina, Austin came into Ralph Hassenhuttl's starting XI. Southampton had strong appeals for a penalty in the 59th minute when Armstrong appeared to be tripped in the box by Camarasa, but Moss did not believe there was enough contact to award a spot-kick. In a second half lacking creativity in the wet and windy conditions at the Cardiff City Stadium, it took until the 74th minute for the deadlock to be broken by Paterson. The 24-year-old pounced on a mistake by Vestergaard, who dwelled on the ball far too long, before he trickled a tame shot past McCarthy into the bottom corner for his fourth goal of the season. With Southampton not producing much of a fightback, Cardiff almost extended their lead 10 minutes from time through their captain Sean Morrison, but he failed to direct his free header on target. Nevertheless, Cardiff held on for an important victory which leaves Hasenhuttl with plenty to think about ahead of Southampton's Super Sunday clash against Arsenal. Opta stats Cardiff have won four of their last five Premier League home games (L1), as many as they had won in their previous 22 in the competition (W4 D6 L12). Southampton's current 14-game winless run is (W0 D7 L7) is their longest such-run in all competitions since March 1989 (20 games). Cardiff ended a run of 12 Premier League games without a clean sheet, since a 0-0 draw with Huddersfield in August. Southampton are winless in their last nine Premier League games against newly promoted teams (D5 L4). Southampton have lost eight of their last nine away league games against Cardiff (W1). Nine of Callum Paterson's 14 league goals for Cardiff City have arrived on home soil (64%). Man of the Match - Callum Paterson Callum Paterson puts Cardiff City ahead In a scrappy game lacking in quality for large periods, Paterson acted as an excellent hold-up striker for Cardiff. His physicality proved troublesome for Bednarek and Vestergaard, while his goal was what made the difference in the end.

We never gave up today and we deserved one point, but we start working hard now. \"I've seen a few good things from my team but also that in the last period we made too many horrible mistakes today.

Ashley Young's terrific opener sent United on their way (13), with Juan Mata then slotting in for his 50th Premier League goal (28). Romelu Lukaku ended his near 17-hour wait for a goal at Old Trafford (42), and though Aboubakar Kamara got one back from the penalty spot (67), Fulham's hopes diminished a minute later when Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa was sent off for a second bookable offence. Marcus Rashford rounded off the comprehensive victory late on (82), and the win lifts United up to sixth in the table, while Fulham's seventh successive away defeat sees them remain bottom - three points from safety. Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Dalot (9), Jones (6), Smalling (6), Young (8), Herrera (7), Matic (7), Mata (8), Lingard (7), Rashford (9), Lukaku (7) Subs: Rojo (6), Fred (6), McTominay (N/A) Fulham: Rico (5), Ream (5), Mawson (4), Odoi (5), Bryan (5), Anguissa (4), Cairney (5), Seri (5), Schurrle (4), Sessegnon (5), Mitrovic (4) Subs: Vietto (6), Kamara (6), Cisse (5) Man of the match: Diogo Dalot Marcus Rashford celebrates his goal with team-mates Only Fulham had kept fewer clean sheets than United going into the match, and it took just 13 minutes for the hosts to go ahead, with Young nutmegging Denis Odoi before firing in a superb effort into the far top corner from a narrow angle. United continued to dominate and pepper the Fulham box with crosses, and they were soon two in front when Rashford rolled it across for Mata, whose first-time effort nestled into the bottom corner. After Sergio Rico parried Rashford's free-kick away, United scored their third thanks to a superb corner routine. Young played it short to Mata, whose one-two with Lingard then led to a low cross for Lukaku to tap in from inside the six-yard area - the Belgian's first goal at the ground in 997 minutes. Juan Mata scored his 50th goal in the Premier League Team news Phil Jones, Ashley Young, Juan Mata and Romelu Lukaku came into United’s starting XI, with Marcos Rojo dropping to the bench. Eric Bailly, Matteo Darmian and Anthony Martial were all out. Paul Pogba remained on the bench, Fulham made five changes, with Tim Ream, Joe Bryan, Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa, Jean Seri and Andre Schurrle all coming in. The second half saw United drop down the gears, and after Chris Smalling hobbled off to be replaced by Marcos Rojo, Ander Herrera brought down Kamara in the box, with the substitute going on to slot in the penalty. A minute later, Fulham were reduced to 10 men, with Anguissa shown a second yellow for a challenge on Rashford. A goal looked to be evading Rashford - who recorded two assists - but after forcing a save from Rico, the England international got his name on scoresheet when squeezing a shot in at the near post when the Fulham goalkeeper should perhaps have done better. Marcus Rashford scored United's last goal after already recording two assists Opta stats Jose Mourinho recorded his 50th Premier League victory as Manchester United manager in what was his 92nd game in the competition at the Red Devils. Fulham have now conceded in 20 consecutive top-flight games - their longest ever run without a clean sheet in the top tier of English football. Fulham have now conceded 40 goals in their opening 16 Premier League games this season; only Barnsley in 1997-98 (43) have conceded more at this stage of a top-flight campaign since the start of the 1965-66 season. Fulham have lost 22 of their last 24 away matches against Manchester United in all competitions (W1 D1) - their only win in this sequence was a 3-1 victory in the Premier League in October 2003. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"The first half was really good. We gave no chances to Fulham. We were strong, aggressive and intense. At moments it was beautiful, collective football. The first half was perfect. \"The second half was Ranieri's fault. He made two changes that improved his team and gave us problems that we didn't have in the first half. I also think there was some fatigue in some of my players. An accumulation of factors made the second half not as good as the first. \"We were intense without the ball and with the ball. Without the ball we pressed, we kept Mitrovic away from the goal. And then intense with the ball, simple, one or two touches. It was really good.\" 3:21 Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho praised his side's 'beautiful' first-half display Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho praised his side's 'beautiful' first-half display Claudio Ranieri: \"I had to consider why in the first half we didn't play, and in the second half I was very satisfied, but our best moment was [followed by] the second yellow card for Anguissa. \"I saw the foul, it's not a foul, he touched the ball clearly, and the referee gave the yellow card. \"But this was not the problem, the problem was the first half. We didn't play, we had to play harder, stronger because United showed quality, passion, desire, everything, and we had to do the same. 2:32 Claudio Ranieri says his Fulham side lacked passion and desire in the first half against Manchester United as they were beaten 4-1 at Old Trafford Claudio Ranieri says his Fulham side lacked passion and desire in the first half against Manchester United as they were beaten 4-1 at Old Trafford Man of the match - Diogo Dalot Rashford secured a goal and two assists, while Young and Mata both recorded one goal and one assist, but Dalot's performance outlined why Jose Mourinho believes United have found their right-back for the decade to come. Diogo Dalot reduced Ryan Sessegnon to mainly defensive duties at Old Trafford The 19-year-old had Ryan Sessegnon defending practically all afternoon, but failed to record assist despite sending in four good crosses and three key passes. A total of four clearances was also joint-highest for United along with Phil Jones.

second-half comeback which saw them beat Crystal Palace 3-2 at the London Stadium. Palace held a half-time lead thanks to James McArthur's six-yard finish after West Ham's defence switched off from a sixth-minute free-kick. But three minutes after half-time, Snodgrass scored his first league goal for the Hammers since joining in January 2017 when he curled Mamadou Sakho's headed clearance inside the near post from the edge of the box. Two goals in three minutes then looked to have sealed three points, with Javier Hernandez turning in the rebound from Felipe Anderson's free-kick (62), before the Brazilian secured a goal for himself with a stunning curled effort from the edge of the box (65). Substitute Jeffrey Schlupp nodded in from a corner to set up a grandstand finish (76), but it never emerged as the hosts saw out a third straight league win for the first time since December 2016. Palace went in front with their first genuine attack of the game, when Patrick van Aanholt's free-kick from deep on the left was headed back across goal by James Tomkins, and with West Ham trying to play offside, McArthur snuck in to finish beyond Lukasz Fabianski. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (7), Zabaleta (7), Diop (8), Balbuena (7), Masuaku (6), Rice (8), Snodgrass (8), Noble (7), Anderson (8), Perez (5), Hernandez (6). Subs: Carroll (7), Diangana (6), Obiang (n/a). Crystal Palace: Hennessey (5), Wan-Bissaka (7), Tomkins (6), Sakho (6), Van Aanholt (5), McArthur (6), Kouyate (5), Meyer (5), Milivojevic (6), Zaha (4), Townsend (5). Subs: Schlupp (6), Ayew (5), Puncheon (n/a). Man of the match: Robert Snodgrass West Ham dominated much of the opening period but played into Palace's hands by delivering cross after cross which Tomkins and Mamadou Sakho dealt with without issue. Instead, the visitors were inches away from doubling their half-time lead when Luka Milivojevic's free-kick cannoned off the bar in injury time with Fabianski beaten. Felipe Anderson scored for the second time in four days West Ham hauled off Lukas Perez at the break for Andy Carroll, and as a new focal point, he made an immediate impact - although it was Snodgrass who arguably proved the greatest catalyst when he curled in a fine finish from 18 yards three minutes after the restart. The Hammers' goalscoring streak was not quite as rapid as it had been against Cardiff on Tuesday, but within 14 minutes of their first they had a second. Hernandez timed his run perfectly to stay onside when Anderson's free-kick was palmed straight back into danger by Wayne Hennessey, and he fired into the roof of the net. Team news West Ham made three changes from midweek, bringing in Lucas Perez, Fabian Balbuena and Pablo Zabaleta. Despite losing 3-1 at 10-man Brighton on Tuesday, Crystal Palace were unchanged. Anderson added a quick-fire third when West Ham moved the ball right to left in two swift passes, and with Aaron Wan-Bissaka too far away to close him down, he curled a stunning effort over Hennessey and inside the far post from almost the left corner of the area. Palace threatened a comeback out of nowhere when Schlupp nodded in Max Meyer's delivery from a short corner, but even the visitors themselves never looked like they had the belief they would grab an unlikely point - and they never came close to doing so. Opta facts West Ham have come from behind to win a Premier League game for the first time since their first match of 2018 against West Brom, ending a run of 18 league games without a win when falling behind at any stage. This was Crystal Palace's 50th defeat in a Premier League London derby in their 91st such match, the fastest London club to reach that total in the competition, overtaking Fulham's 99 games. This was West Ham's first win in a London derby in the Premier League since they beat Chelsea 1-0 on December 9th 2017, 364 days ago. Crystal Palace have picked up just 12 points after 16 Premier League games this season; only in 2017-18 (11) have they had fewer after 16 games of a top-flight season (assuming 3 pts/win). West Ham have won three consecutive top-flight matches whilst scoring 3+ goals in each game for the first time since October 1982. Robert Snodgrass scored his first Premier League goal for West Ham, and his first for any club since January 2017 for Hull against West Brom, 705 days ago. All 49 of West Ham striker Javier Hernandez's goals in the Premier League have come from inside the box; only Tim Cahill (56) has scored more with 100% coming from inside the penalty area. West Ham's Felipe Anderson has scored five goals in his last six league games, as many as his previous 34 combined for both the Hammers and Lazio. James McArthur's opener (5:41) was Crystal Palace's earliest goal scored in a Premier League game this season, with Wilfried Zaha the last to score a faster goal for the Eagles in the competition against Brighton in April 2018 (4:39). Manager reaction Manuel Pellegrini: We need to win one game to cancel out that bad start with four defeats in a row, but we must look to be in the top half going forward, and we are now in 10th, right in the middle. We have three more games to complete the first round and I hope we can continue adding points. Roy Hodgson: They scored three goals, but I didn't think they push us back, maybe in the first half more than in the second but they were leading at half-time. I don't think you ever feel confident in the Premier League unless you're two or three ahead. There might be some teams who disagree, but we never think that because we're leading that will definitely end up in three points. Man of the match - Robert Snodgrass As well as scoring his first West Ham league goal, Snodgrass put in more quality crosses (4) than anyone else on the pitch and had an excellent game. His goal came from his only shot of the match, but he also contributed three key passes and ran further than anyone else on the pitch - an impressive statistic for a player urged to lose weight by Manuel Pellegrini in pre-season.

City Chelsea ended Manchester City's unbeaten Premier League run with a 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge – a result that leaves Liverpool top. N'Golo Kante (45) stunned City by scoring with Chelsea's first attack before David Luiz - exposed against Tottenham two weeks ago - went from zero to hero by looping a header (78) into the top corner. The Blues become the first team to beat City in the league since Manchester United in April while Liverpool now lead the way by a point in the title race. Chelsea remain in fourth place following Tottenham's 2-0 win at Leicester but they have cut the gap to league leaders Liverpool to eight points. The first half was dominated by the visitors, who should have made their territorial dominance count on nine minutes but Raheem Sterling snatched at a close-range chance. Player Ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (6), Stones (6), Laporte (6), Delph (6), Fernandinho (7), B Silva (6), D Silva (6), Sane (6), Sterling (6), Mahrez (6) Subs: Jesus (5), Foden (6) Chelsea: Arrizabalaga (7), Azpilicueta (8), Rudiger (8), Luiz (8), Alonso (7), Jorginho (6), Kante (7), Kovacic (6), Pedro (6), Hazard (7), Willian (6). Subs: Barkley (7), Giroud (6) Man of the match: Cesar Azpilicueta There was only one team conjuring up any attacking opportunities but Luiz, Antonio Rudiger and Cesar Azpilicueta stood firm against constant City probing. However, just as it looked a case of when rather than if City took the lead, Chelsea hit on the counter just before the break. Team news Both teams decided to play without a recognised striker with Gabriel Jesus left on the bench for City while Chelsea went with a front three of Eden Hazard, Willian and Pedro. Luiz's long ball found Pedro, whose cross-field ball to Willian made City retreat into their own box. Willian found Hazard, who slid the ball back for Kante smash home from 15 yards. Ederson's only job of the half was to pick the ball out of his net. The goal triggered a surge in confidence for Chelsea, who were now able to handle City's high press and play into their midfield. N'Golo Kante chests the ball under pressure from Fabian Delph City mustered little in response as Kyle Walker hit a speculative free-kick that summed up their frustrations. Chelsea remained organised in their shape and ended the game as a contest with the second goal. Hazard's corner was met by Luiz who sent a looping header into the far corner of the net. Anyone thinking of already handing the title to City, may have to think again. David Luiz celebrates with Ross Barkley after scoring their second goal Man of the match - Cesar Azpilicueta This type of game was made for the Chelsea skipper. His team had to do plenty of defending and he was in his element. First, keeping Sane relatively quiet before dealing with Sterling's threat in the second half. A key moment in the match was his last-ditch block to deny Sane a clear chance on goal in the first half. Mr Reliable delivered once again. Cesar Azpilicueta Opta stats Chelsea are unbeaten in 12 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge (W7 D5), their longest run without a league defeat on home soil since a 21-game streak ending in August 2015. Manchester City suffered their first Premier League defeat in 22 games, since a 2-3 defeat to Manchester United in April. Maurizio Sarri enjoyed his first-ever victory over Pep Guardiola, ending a run of three defeats against the Spaniard in all competitions (W1 L3). Kanté's opening goal came via Chelsea's first shot of the match in the 45th minute (44:02), the longest they have had to wait for a shot in a league game at Stamford Bridge since 2006-07. With four goal involvements in the Premier League this season in 16 games (2 goals, 2 assists), Kanté has already equalled his combined goal and assist tallies from his previous two top-flight seasons with Chelsea (2 goals, 2 assists in 69 games). Manager reaction: Pep Guardiola \"They beat us in one counter-attack and one set piece. We played the way we want to play. After that, when the opponent is good it's always to congratulate them, shake hands and improve for the next game.\" Manager reaction: Maurizio Sarri \"We won today but we have to say that we were a bit lucky in the first 25 minutes because they could have scored. A little bit lucky in the first half and a very good second half. I think we have a team with some difficulties to be motivated. \"In these kind of matches it's very easy to have very good motivation and the right level of determination and aggression, but during the season you have to play also with the small teams.\" What's next?

Tottenham Leicester 0-2 Tottenham Dele Alli scored his 50th goal for Tottenham as Mauricio Pochettino's side moved back up to third in the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Leicester at the King Power Stadium. Spurs, who started the game in fifth after Arsenal's last-gasp win over Huddersfield and Chelsea's victory over Manchester City, started with Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen on the bench but Heung-Min Son's superb strike on the stroke of half-time put them on course for victory. Son was involved in his side's second, teeing up Alli, who headed home to bring up a half-century of Spurs goals and secure a routine win. Victory sees Spurs reclaim third and cut the gap to league leaders Liverpool to six points, while Leicester stay ninth. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Pereira (6), Morgan (7), Evans (6), Chilwell (6), Mendy (6), Ndidi (7), Iborra (6), Maddison (6), Gray (6), Iheanacho (5). Subs: Ghezzal (7), Albrighton (6), Okazaki (6). Tottenham: Lloris (7), Aurier (7), Alderweireld (7), Vertonghen (8), Davies (7), Dier (6), Winks (7), Sissoko (6), Moura (7), Alli (8), Son (8). Subs: Eriksen (6), Kane (6), Walker-Peters (6). Man of the match: Heung-Min Son. It was a tight affair with chances few and far between until just before the half-time interval. Wes Morgan produced an outstanding last-ditch tackle to halt Alli's burst into the penalty area, but minutes later Spurs were in front. Son received the ball 20 yards from goal from Serge Aurier and shifted it past Nampalys Mendy before curling home a sublime effort beyond the dive of Kasper Schmeichel. Ricardo Pereira runs past Alli during the match at the King Power Stadium The visitors went straight for a second after the interval and Leicester needed Morgan to deflect Son's drive wide following a poor Schmeichel clearance. Hugo Lloris then put in a poor clearance of his own but Ben Chilwell drilled wide of the upright after bursting into the penalty area. Team news Leicester made four changes from the side that 1-1 draw with Fulham in midweek. Danny Simpson, Caglar Soyuncu, Marc Albrighton and Fousseni Diabate dropped out with Ricardo Pereira, Jonny Evans, Vincente Iborra and Demarai Gray going into the starting XI. Fit-again Harry Maguire returned to the bench but there was no place in the squad for the injured Jamie Vardy. Mauricio Pochettino made five changes from the side that beat Southampton 3-1 in midweek. The big news was Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen started on the bench, while Juan Foyth and Kieran Tripper dropped out of the squad altogether. Danny Rose moved down to the bench. In came Serge Aurier, Jan Vertonghen, Dele Alli, Ben Davies and Moussa Sissoko. However, the hosts were further behind in the 58th minute. Ben Davies' pass found Lucas Moura in space and he released Son, who crossed for Alli to head in at the far post. It was the England international's 50th goal for the club - having opened his Spurs account at Leicester in 2015. Aurier wasted a free header as Spurs chased a third and, surprisingly, Eriksen and Kane were given late cameos as the visitors comfortably held on.

Since they returned to the Premier League in 2014-15, Leicester have conceded 22 goals against Tottenham in the competition, more than they have against any other opponent. Leicester manager Claude Puel has now lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (four) than any other opponent. Dele Alli's goal was his 50th in all competitions for Tottenham. Since the start of 2015-16, only Son Heung-Min (52) and Harry Kane (117) have more for the club in all competitions. Alli became the third player to score 50+ goals for Tottenham Hotspur in all competitions since 2015-16 alongside Son Heung-Min and Harry Kane; no other Premier League club has seen more than two players do so in this time. Serge Aurier has assisted as many Premier League goals in six games this season (two) as he had in 17 appearances in 2017-18 for the club. Man of the Match - Heung-Min Son Heung-Min Son scored a stunning opener for Tottenham Alli will grab most of the headlines following his 50th goal for Spurs, but Son, who has scored three goals in his last four league games, was the standout performer as Pochettino's side secured a routine win. It was a tight affair at the King Power Stadium as the clock ticked towards half-time but Son's moment of magic in stoppage time sent Spurs on their way to all three points. He also played a part in the second, picking out Alli with an inch-perfect cross to round off a superb performance.

Burnley 1-3 Liverpool Liverpool came from behind to beat Burnley 3-1 at Turf Moor, reducing the gap on leaders Manchester City to two points. Jack Cork poked Burnley into the lead on 54 minutes but it lasted just a quarter of an hour as James Milner equalised before substitute Roberto Firmino fired Liverpool ahead with his first touch. Xherdan Shaqiri's third goal of the season wrapped up the points in stoppage time as Liverpool maintained their unbeaten start to the season to remain on the coattails of the champions. Burnley remain in the bottom three after a 10th defeat of the season on Sean Dyche's 300th game in management.

Subs: Alexander-Arnold (7), Firmino (7), Salah (6). Man of the Match: James Milner Dyche demanded a response from his Burnley players after Saturday's abject defeat at Crystal Palace and that was exactly what he got as the Clarets took advantage of Liverpool's seven pre-match changes, and the loss of Joe Gomez to injury on 23 minutes. After Virgil van Dijk fired a free header straight at a thankful Joe Hart, Chris Wood saw a deflected strike loop over the bar before, from the resulting cleared corner, Phil Bardsley's rasping 25-yard drive flew just wide of the Liverpool goal. Joe Gomez was forced off with an ankle injury inside 23 minutes Burnley thought they had capped a positive first-half display with a goal on 41 minutes as Barnes' first-time volley from a Robbie Brady free-kick flashed past Alisson into the back of the net, but the effort was correctly ruled out for offside. Joe Hart saved from Daniel Sturridge early in the second half before expertly tipping a Naby Keita piledriver onto the post on 52 minutes. Team news Sean Dyche recalled Phil Bardsley, James Tarkowski, Ashley Westwood, Robbie Brady and Ashley Barnes following Saturday’s defeat at Crystal Palace. Jurgen Klopp made seven changes following Sunday’s Merseyside derby victory, with Alisson, Joe Gomez, Virgil van Dijk and Xherdan Shaqiri the only players to retain their places. Those saves laid the foundation for Burnley to take the lead as Cork poked the loose ball home from close range after Wood and Ashley Barnes colluded to make Alisson lose control of a Ben Mee knockdown from a corner. But the lead last just eight minutes as Merseyside derby hero Divock Origi offloaded the ball to Milner on the edge of the area, and the midfielder drove a crisp effort through bodies into the bottom right-hand corner. Daniel Sturridge is tackled by Phil Bardsley Jurgen Klopp introduced Mohamed Salah and Firmino soon after and the latter had an immediate impact, finishing from close range with his first touch after Van Dijk brilliantly hooked a Trent Alexander-Arnold free-kick across the face of goal. Keita had a deft back-heel cleared off the line by Bardsley on 82 minutes as Liverpool pushed for a third, while Alisson brilliantly tipped a looping Mee header onto the crossbar in the final minute. Xherdan Shaqiri celebrates scoring Liverpool's third goal But Alisson's fast thinking immediately after that save released Salah, who in turn played Shaqiri through on goal, and the Swiss rounded off a fine outing for the Reds with their third. Opta stats Liverpool have conceded just six goals in their 15 Premier League games this season - equalling the top-flight English league record at this stage of a season, alongside Man Utd in 1985-86, Arsenal in 1990-91, Chelsea in 2004-05 and Chelsea in 2008-09. Burnley have won just nine points from their opening 15 games this season. Just three of the previous 18 teams to have won nine points or fewer from their first 15 games of a Premier League season have avoided relegation: Sunderland in 2013-14, Wigan in 2007-08 and Coventry in 1995-96. Alisson has remained unbeaten in his opening 15 league matches as a Liverpool player; equalling the club record in the Premier League set by Javier Mascherano in November 2007. This was the first Premier League game that none of the trio of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino or Sadio Mane have been in Liverpool's starting XI since May 2017 versus West Ham United. Roberto Firmino scored with his first touch of the ball, two minutes and 55 seconds after coming on as a substitute for Liverpool in this match. This was the 50th game that Liverpool's James Milner has scored in overall during his Premier League career and he's not ended on the losing side in any of those matches (W39 D11 L0), which is a Premier League record. This was the 10th competitive game that Jack Cork has scored in for Burnley overall and the first time he's lost when doing so (W8 D1 L1).

Jurgen Klopp hailed his much-changed Liverpool side for their response after they went a goal down against Burnley, with the Reds picking up a 3-1 win. Jurgen Klopp: \"Burnley had a specific plan, to be really aggressive in their challenges and stuff like that, so each ball they won helped them and obviously didn't help us mood-wise. So I was really happy we could just adjust a few tactical things [at half-time]. Reacting like we reacted at a tough place like Turf Moor and Burnley, that's special. It's really good.\" Man of the Match - James Milner Liverpool were in a spot of bother at Turf Moor until 'Mr Reliable' popped up in midfield to spark a great comeback. At first glance, Milner's equaliser looked simple, but on closer inspection the technique to find the bottom corner with minimal backlift was a sight to behold.

Watch highlights as Everton draw 1-1 with Newcastle at Goodison Park. A dogged Newcastle display denied dominant Everton three points as Salomon Rondon's goal earned the visitors a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park. Rondon fired Jacob Murphy's cross home at the far post (19) in one of several rapid Newcastle counter-attacks before half-time. But Everton, who dominated possession, levelled when Richarlison was well-positioned to turn in Jamal Lascelles' inadvertent flick-on from a corner with a smart finish into the roof of the net (38). Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (6), Zouma (5), Mina (6), Digne (5), Gueye (5), Gomes (6), Lookman (5), Sigurdsson (6), Richarlison (7), Tosun (6). Subs: Bernard (6), Walcott (5), Calvert-Lewin (6). Newcastle: Dubravka (8), Lascelles (6), Schar (8), Fernandez (7), Yedlin (5), Diame (6), Ki (7), Manquillo (7), Murphy (6), Rondon (7), Atsu (7). Subs: Perez (7), Joselu (6). Man of the match: Fabian Schar In the second half, Everton had 17 touches in the Newcastle box and delivered 16 crosses in open play, without forcing visiting goalkeeper Martin Dubravka into anything too taxing as Rafa Benitez's men hung on for a battling point. Everton controlled the play in the opening stages with Newcastle happy to sit eight men behind the ball at all times, but looking to spring a counter with the hosts' full-backs both regularly out of position. Richarlison's goal was his first in more than a month for Everton And they did just that 19 minutes in, when Murphy outpaced Seamus Coleman before whipping a pacey cross across the six-yard box which Yerry Mina missed, and Rondon smashed home at the far post. Everton huffed and puffed and forced 10 corners before the break, but having supplied consistently poor deliveries in the opening half-hour Sigurdsson improved to find Richarlison, thanks to an accidental flick-on from Lascelles, and his finish was similar to Rondon's at the back stick. Martin Dubravka was in fine form before half-time but rarely called upon after the break. After half-time, Everton enjoyed near-total control but did not force Dubravka into a single save of significant difficulty. Despite winning numerous free-kicks in good positions, Lucas Digne's crossing was appalling and failed to find an Everton man once - while Newcastle still posed an occasional threat on the break. Christian Atsu forced Jordan Pickford into a stunning low save when he unleashed a powerful 16-yard drive from DeAndre Yedlin's knock down, and he should have won the game in the final minute when played through by substitute Ayoze Perez from a quick throw-in. Team news Both sides made three changes from their respective defeats at the weekend. Cenk Tosun returned in attack for Everton, with Ademola Lookman replacing Bernard and Kurt Zouma in for Michael Keane. Newcastle went 3-4-3 with Matt Ritchie replaced by Jamal Lascelles, Christian Atsu in for Kenedy and Ayoze Perez sacrified for Jacob Murphy. The draw moves Newcastle another point away from the bottom three and into 14th, while Everton regain sixth place but are ahead of Manchester United and Bournemouth only on goal difference, and have an eight-point gap to Arsenal in fifth. Opta facts Everton are unbeaten in their last eight midweek matches in the Premier League (W4 D4), since losing 0-3 at Sunderland in May 2016. Newcastle haven't won a midweek Premier League match since December 2013 (5-1 vs Stoke), drawing nine and losing nine played on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday since. Everton posted a 76.3% possession rate, their highest in a Premier League game since 2003-04. Newcastle's Salomón Rondón as netted three goals in his last four Premier League appearances, as many as he managed in his previous 18 in the competition. Everton forward Richarlison has netted three goals in his last three home Premier League appearances, one more than he scored in his previous 22. Everton's Richarlison as scored seven goals in 13 appearances in the Premier League this season, two more than he managed in 38 games for Watford (5) last season. Man of the match - Fabian Schar All three of Newcastle's centre-backs spent the night heading and kicking away anything which came into their path, but Schar's performance was the best of the lot. Five interceptions, 12 clearances and five tackles - all three the most of any player from either side - as well as six out of eight aerial challenges won capped an impressive night for the Swiss defender.

draw with Leicester in the Premier League Fulham remain bottom of the Premier League table after a 1-1 draw with Claudio Ranieri’s former club Leicester at Craven Cottage on Wednesday. Aboubakar Kamara put the hosts in front with his first Premier League goal (43) before James Maddison equalised with a neat finish in the 74th minute. Fulham had the best opportunity to win the match in the final minute of added time through Denis Odoi, but he flicked his effort from close range over the bar. The result means Fulham remain at the foot of the table on nine points while Leicester drop down to ninth. Player ratings Fulham: Rico (7), Christie (6), Mawson (6), Odoi (6), Le Marchand (7), Seri (5), Chambers (6), Kamara (7), Vietto (5), Sessegnon (6), Mitrovic (6) Subs: Cairney (6), Bryan (5), Ream (6) Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Simpson (5), Morgan (6), Soyuncu (4), Chilwell (6), Mendy (5), Ndidi (5), Albrighton (6), Diabate (5), Maddison (7), Iheanacho (5) Subs: Gray (6), Iborra (5), Okazaki (6) Man of the match: James Maddison Kelechi Iheanacho spurned a glorious opportunity to give Leicester the lead in the third minute. A mix-up between Jean-Michael Seri and Luciano Vietto allowed Maddison to slip through Iheanacho, but the Nigeria international struck his one-on-one attempt straight into the body of the grateful Sergio Rico. As Fulham slowly adapted to Ranieri's 4-2-3-1 formation, having played with a midfield diamond against Chelsea on Sunday, their first good chance of the evening landed to Calum Chambers, but the Arsenal loanee's half-volley from close range was superbly parried away by Kasper Schmeichel. Fulham took the lead through Kamara with three minutes left of the first half to play. Aleksandar Mitrovic's deft flick was latched onto by the French striker, who left 22-year-old Caglar Soyuncu on the floor before he drove his strike into the bottom corner. Team news Aboubakar Kamara and Luciano Vietto came in for Tom Cairney and Stefan Johansen. Danny Simpson, Caglar Soyuncu, Fousseni Diabate and Kelechi Iheanacho took the places of Ricardo Pereira, Jonny Evans, Demarai Gray and Jamie Vardy. Tom Cairney came on after the break and made a strong impact for the hosts. The Scotland international came close to scoring in the 69th minute, but his powerful effort skidded past the post. And even though Fulham looked likely to extend their lead, Leicester grabbed an equaliser through Maddison who met substitute Shinji Okazaki's pass before he coolly directed his shot into the bottom corner. With the clock ticking down, Rico had to make a fine double save to deny Maddison before Fulham nearly found a winner in the final minute of added time. Cairney dinked a ball into the path of the unmarked Odoi, but he could not apply the vital finish which meant Ranieri's side had to settle for a point. Opta stats Fulham's tally of nine points after 15 league games is their joint-worst ever total at this stage of a season in the Football League (assuming three points for a win), level with the nine they had in the third tier in 1993-94, a season in which they were relegated. Leicester City have now gone six league games without defeat (W2 D4) for the first time since May 2016 (12 games) when they won the Premier League title under now-Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri. Fulham have conceded 36 goals in their 15 Premier League games in 2018-19; only Barnsley (40 in 1997-98) have ever conceded more at this stage of a campaign in the competition. Leicester haven't lost any of their last five away Premier League games against newly promoted opponents (W3 D2), their best ever undefeated run away at such opposition in the competition. Aboubakar Kamara is the first French player to score a Premier League goal for Fulham (excluding own goals) since Philippe Christanval against West Ham in January 2007. Aleksandar Mitrovic has been directly involved in 60% of Fulham's 15 league goals this season (seven goals, two assists), the highest ratio for any player for a particular club in the Premier League. James Maddison has been directly involved in more league goals (seven - five goals, two assists) than any other Leicester City player this season. Man of the Match - James Maddison Leicester's James Maddison celebrates scoring their equaliser The 22-year-old midfielder was one of Leicester's main threats throughout the match. He took his goal well in the second half and would have gained an assist had Iheanacho applied a finish in the third minute following his incisive pass. Maddison also came close to scoring the winner in added time had Rico not pulled off a fine double save.

Subs: Giroud (6), Pedro (6), Kovacic (6). Man of the match: Morgan Gibbs-White Wolves, who had lost their previous six matches heading into the game, were given an early warning of the threat posed by Chelsea when N'Golo Kante's cut-back picked out Eden Hazard in acres of space at the far post. The Belgium international took the shot on first time but could not generate enough power to beat Patricio. Patricio had no chance of keeping out the visitors' opener though as Coady could only divert Loftus-Cheek's shot into the bottom corner, wrong-footing the Portuguese goalkeeper in the process. Ruben Loftus-Cheek celebrates with Chelsea team-mate Eden Hazard Willian thought he had doubled his side's lead five minutes later but Patricio scrambled across goal to make a superb one-handed save to keep out the Brazilian's free-kick. Wolves remained a threat on the counter-attack with Morgan Gibbs-White the main danger and the youngster was denied a clear shooting opportunity by a brilliant last-ditch tackle by Cesc Fabregas, before Ryan Bennett produced one of his own at the other end on Willian just before the break. Team news Nuno made three changes from the Wolves side that lost 2-1 to Cardiff last Friday. Ryan Bennett, Morgan Gibbs-White and Diogo Jota came in for Helder Costa, Adama Traore and the suspended Ruben Neves. Chelsea made five changes from the side that beat Fulham last Sunday. David Luiz, Jorginho, Matteo Kovacic, Pedro and Olivier Giroud were replaced by Andreas Christensen, Cesc Fabregas, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Willian and Alvaro Morata. Despite the scoreline, there were plenty of positives from the first half for Wolves but they could have been further behind but for a brilliant last-ditch tackle from Willy Boly to deny Alvaro Morata. The visitors were made to pay for that missed opportunity as Wolves scored two goals in four minutes to turn the game on its head. Raul Jimenez celebrates his equaliser for Wolves First, Gibbs-White did well to hold off a couple of challenges before picking out Jimenez, who drilled the ball through Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the back of the net. Then, Willian lost out to Joao Moutinho, who slid the ball through for Doherty and his low cross was converted at the back post by the unmarked Jota. Diogo Jota celebrates after Wolves take the lead against Chelsea Maurizio Sarri threw on Olivier Giroud, Pedro and Mateo Kovacic as he looked for a response from his side but Hazard shot over and Fabregas sliced off target as Chelsea chased an equaliser which never came. Opta stats Wolves have won a top-flight game played on a Wednesday for the first time since beating Chelsea 1-0 at Molineux in January 2011. Wolves have defeated 'Big 6' opposition in the Premier League for the first time since February 2011 against Manchester United (2-1) - they were winless in their previous 18 such games. Chelsea have lost consecutive away games against newly promoted sides for the first time since December 1999 (vs Watford and Sunderland). Each of Wolves' last nine league goals at Molineux have been scored in the second half. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek has scored three goals in his last three Premier League games, as many as in his previous 48 combined in the competition. Raul Jimenez has been directly involved in 53% of Wolves' goals in the Premier League this season (8/15). Man of the Match - Morgan Gibbs-White Morgan Gibbs-White (L) attempts to get away from Willian Nuno handed Gibbs-White his first Premier League start and the 18-year-old repayed his manager's faith with a performance of real promise. He was a constant threat to Chelsea with his pace as Wolves looked to counter-attack at every opportunity. It was his assists that sparked Wolves turnaround. He used his strength to hold off a couple of challenges before playing a perfectly-weighted pass for Jimenez to strike past Kepa. He was eventually replaced in the 72nd minute by Helder Costa and he left the field to a standing ovation from the Wolves fans. Opta stat Wolves' Morgan Gibbs-White (18 years and 312 days) became the youngest player to assist a Premier League goal against Chelsea since Francis Jeffers for Everton in November 1999 (18 years and 298 days). The managers Nuno Espirito Santo: \"I think everybody enjoyed it,\" he said. \"Everybody from Wolves that is. I thought it was a good performance, honestly. Even though, in the first half we were behind the result, the way we stayed organised and compact. That was totally a credit for the boys, the way they work, and the fans, the way they became so noisy and pushed the team. We got the result but we have a long way to go.\" 2:24 Nuno Espirito Santo says his Wolves side showed intensity and belief in their win over Chelsea. Nuno Espirito Santo says his Wolves side showed intensity and belief in their win over Chelsea. Maurizio Sarri: \"Of course, after this match we lost confidence but maybe it is better because sometimes my players show me they have too much confidence. It is more important to talk about our attitude after the first goal. We were not the same team as before, we were another team.\" 2:44 Maurizio Sarri says Chelsea played like a completely different team from the first half during the last 35 minutes of their defeat at Wolves. Maurizio Sarri says Chelsea played like a completely different team from the first half during the last 35 minutes of their defeat at Wolves.

2 Arsenal Manchester Utd 2 - 2 Arsenal Manchester United are now four Premier League games without a victory after a frantic 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Wednesday night at Old Trafford. Arsenal, against an entirely new United back five, took the lead early on through Shkodran Mustafi's header, which squirmed through David de Gea's hands and just dropped over the line via the goal decision system (26). Anthony Martial's close-range finish brought United level shortly after (30), before two goals in the space of a minute in the second half as Marcos Rojo's own goal from sub Alexandre Lacazette's effort (68) gave Arsenal the lead only for Jesse Lingard to score just 13 seconds after the restart (69).

Arsenal are unbeaten in 20 games in all competitions but move down to fifth. Jose Mourinho made seven changes from the draw at Southampton, saying in his programme notes that \"there isn't space for people that are not ready to give it their all\" as the likes of Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku dropped to the bench. After a dull start, Arsenal were ahead as Mustafi lost Chris Smalling from a Lucas Torreira corner, headed straight at De Gea, only for the Spaniard to let the ball loose through his hands and just over the line. De Gea has kept just two clean sheets in 15 games for United this season. Team news United made seven changes from the side that drew 2-2 at Southampton on Saturday. Pogba and Lukaku dropped to the bench, along with Fellaini, Shaw, Jones and McTominay, while Young was suspended. Coming in were Dalot for his first Premier League start, Darmian, Bailly, Rojo (making his first appearance of the season), Smalling, Martial and Lingard. For Arsenal, Guendouzi came in for the suspended Xhaka, while Aaron Ramsey made a start, in for Mkhitaryan. Alexandre Lacazette gives Arsenal the lead But United were level just four minutes later in controversial fashion through Martial, as he finished from close range after Ander Herrera's centre, but Herrera looked inches offside from Rojo's initial free-kick. The second half was lacking in chances until Lacazette's introduction with 25 minutes remaining, and the Frenchman helped put Arsenal ahead three minutes later after Rojo's mistake allowed Arsenal to break through Henrikh Mkhitaryan, and he fed Lacazette helped bundle it past De Gea via a touch from Rojo. But just seconds after the restart United were back level as Sead Kolasinac got in a mix-up with Bernd Leno, allowing Lingard to steal in and slot home under the goalkeeper. Arsenal nearly went back ahead minutes later through Aubemeyang, only to see his shot saved by De Gea as he went through on goal, and the goalkeeper looked to make up for his earlier mistake again with a fine stop from Torreira from point-blank range. Jesse Lingard in action during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Arsenal Arsenal did have the ball in the net twice late on, once through Lacazette's cheeky header and finish out of De Gea's hand as he looked to release it upfield, and then through Mkhitaryan's acute finish from an offside position. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"The team had a very good response, had a big soul. We scored four goals and drew 2-2. Even in matches like today where we play well we always shoot ourselves [in the foot]. Sometimes we miss chances with open goals, sometimes we make defensive mistakes, but a fantastic spirit and good performances.\" 1:05 Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho says they caused their own downfall Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho says they caused their own downfall Unai Emery: \"I am very proud for our work and how we responded in the 90 minutes. When we are winning it was a good moment but they equalised very quickly then we got up after their two goals.\" 0:53 Arsenal head coach Unai Emery was pleased with their 2-2 draw Arsenal head coach Unai Emery was pleased with their 2-2 draw Opta stats Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has only lost one of his 16 games against Arsenal in the Premier League (W7 D8) and remains unbeaten in home games in the competition against them (W5 D4). Arsenal are now unbeaten in their last 20 games in all competitions, their longest such run since November 2007 (28 games). Manchester United have conceded more goals at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season (10 goals in seven games) than they did in the whole of 2017-18 (nine in 18 games). Arsenal are still yet to lead a Premier League game at half time this season (D11 L4), although they haven't gone on to suffer a defeat in the competition since August (2-3 v Chelsea). Manchester United winger Anthony Martial has scored seven goals in his last seven starts in the Premier League, with three of those coming at Old Trafford. Man of the match - Lucas Torreira Just pipping Guendouzi and Lingard, Arsenal's Torreira takes man of the match for the second game in a row.

the Premier League Highlights from Tottenham's win over Southampton in the Premier League Tottenham moved up to third in the Premier League with a 3-1 win over Southampton at Wembley as new Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl watched on from the stands. After suffering a derby defeat to Arsenal on Sunday, Spurs were in ruthless mood as Harry Kane (9), Lucas Moura (51) and Son Heung-min (55) took advantage of some poor defending by Saints, who had first-team coach Kelvin Davies in charge following the sacking of Mark Hughes. Hasenhuttl takes over a side second bottom of the Premier League with just one win to their name all season, although they did hit the woodwork three times at Wembley, forced Hugo Lloris into some smart second-half saves and grabbed a late goal from Charlie Austin (90+2). Southampton's new manager Ralph Hasenhuttl watches his side face Tottenham at Wembley Hasenhuttl begins his tenure with a trip to fellow strugglers Cardiff on Saturday. This victory moves Mauricio Pochettino's men up to third, above their north London rivals, while Southampton are 18th and inside the relegation zone. Player Ratings Tottenham: Lloris (8), Trippier (7), Alderweireld (7), Foyth (7), Rose (7), Winks (7), Dier (6), Moura (7), Eriksen (7), Son (7), Kane (7). Subs: Skipp (6), Alli (6), Sissoko (6) Southampton: McCarthy (6), Yoshida (6), Stephens (6), Cedric (6), Davis (6), Ward-Prowse (6), Targett (5), Hojbjerg (6), Armstrong (6), Gabbiadini (5), Redmond (6) Subs: Austin (7), Romeu (6) Man of the match: Hugo Lloris Tottenham looked keen in the opening stages to give the home fans something to cheer after defeat to their neighbours on Sunday. Son struck a post inside four minutes but Kane didn't miss five minutes later. Christian Eriksen conjured up the goal with a very clever low cross following a short corner and Kane was on the same wavelength, nipping in at the near post. Team news Kieran Trippier, Danny Rose, Toby Alderweireld, Harry Winks and Lucas Moura all returned for Spurs while Saints made four changes with rare starts for James Ward-Prowse, Steven Davis, Matt Targett and Manolo Gabbiadini. Southampton were restricted to long-range efforts but one nearly resulted in the equaliser as Lloris had to make a world-class fingertip save to push Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's rasping 30-yard drive onto the post. There was a renewed urgency from Spurs after the break and it brought about two more goals. Moura powered home the second after latching onto a loose ball from a half-cleared corner before Son was on hand at the back post to force home after some industrious work by Kane down the right flank. Heung-min Son celebrates his goal as Spurs cruise past Saints With the game over, Spurs took their foot of the gas and Southampton gave them some worrying moments. Lloris could only watch as Nathan Redmond crashed an effort off the bar and then the goalkeeper produced saves to deny Hojbjerg, James Ward-Prowse and Austin, who also headed an effort off the bar. Eventually, they did break through when Austin charged in on goal and finished into the top corner in stoppage time. Man of the match: Hugo Lloris It's not often the goalkeeper gets the nod for the outstanding player when his team were relatively comfortable winners but some of his saves were world class. The pick of them came in the first-half from Hojbjerg, where he somehow pushed a certain goal onto the woodwork. This was a timely reminder of why he's one of the world's best. What's next? Tottenham travel to Leicester on Saturday evening while - as mentioned - Southampton have an encounter with Cardiff to look forward to."},{"date": "04/12/2019", "arena": "Vitality Stadium",

Bournemouth's win over Huddersfield in the Premier League Highlights from Bournemouth's win over Huddersfield in the Premier League Bournemouth ended a run of four straight Premier League defeats with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Huddersfield at the Vitality Stadium. Eddie Howe's side raced into an early lead with goals from Callum Wilson (5) and Ryan Fraser (22) but Huddersfield responded well, Terence Kongolo's header (38) pulling one back before the break. Huddersfield pushed for an equaliser in the second half but they found Asmir Begovic, who kept Aaron Mooy's low drive out after making a number of smart saves before the break, in excellent form as the hosts held on for all three points. Victory sees Bournemouth move above Everton, Manchester United and Leicester into sixth for 24 hours at least while Huddersfield stay 17th, one point above the relegation zone. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (9), Francis (7), S Cook (7), Ake (8), Daniels (6), Brooks (5), Lerma (6), L Cook (6), Fraser (8), Wilson (8), King (7). Subs: Stanislas (6), Mousset (n/a), Mings (n/a). Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Durm (6), Schindler (7), Jorgensen (7), Kongolo (7), Hadergjonaj (8), Hogg (7), Billing (6), Mooy (7), Pritchard (8), Depoitre (7). Subs: Mbenza (6), Sabiri (n/a). Sobhi (6). Man of the match: Asmir Begovic After consecutive defeats to Manchester United, Newcastle, Arsenal and Manchester City, Bournemouth were looking to avoid five consecutive league defeats for the first time since March 2013 when they were in League One. They made a superb start as Wilson, who was played onside by Mathias Jorgensen, beat Huddersfield's offside trap in what was a tight decision to head home Fraser's free-kick in the fifth minute. Wilson then turned provider in the 22nd minute, slipping the ball through for Fraser, who slid the ball under the onrushing Lossl to round off a slick counter-attack from the hosts. Bournemouth's Josh King, Callum Wilson and Ryan Fraser celebrate after going 2-0 up Huddersfield responded well to Bournemouth's second and the hosts needed Asmir Begovic in top form as he made three excellent saves in quick succession to keep out Alex Pritchard's close-range effort, Laurent Depoitre's header and Mooy's free-kick. Wagner's side finished the half the stronger of the two teams and they were eventually rewarded when Mooy's cross was headed on by Christopher Schindler and Jorgensen before Kongolo looped a header past Begovic. Team news Eddie Howe made two changes to the Bournemouth side that lost 3-1 at Manchester City on Saturday. David Brooks and Jefferson Lerma returned to the starting line-up in place of Andrew Surman and Tyrone Mings. Huddersfield made one change from the side that lost 2-1 to Brighton at the weekend. Laurent Depoitre cames in to lead the line in the absence of the suspended Steve Mounie following his controversial red card on Saturday. Joshua King almost extended Bournemouth's advantage early in the second half, slicing wide from the edge of the penalty area, but Huddersfield were soon back in control as they searched for an equaliser. The visitors dominated possession for long spells of the game but once again they were denied by Begovic, who kept out Mooy's low drive with his feet before the Australian saw a late effort from distance deflected wide as Bournemouth held on. Opta stats Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven home matches against Huddersfield Town in all competitions (W4 D3) since losing 0-1 in League One in August 2007. Eddie Howe's side have ended a run of four consecutive Premier League defeats, winning their first game in the competition since a 3-0 victory against Fulham in October. Since the start of last season, only Brighton (17) and Watford (16) have lost more away Premier League games than Huddersfield (15). Huddersfield have won just two of their last 19 Premier League games (D6 L11). Terence Kongolo's goal for Huddersfield was their fourth headed goal in the Premier League this season (4/10) - only Burnley (46%) and Newcastle United (55%) have scored a higher percentage of headed goals than Huddersfield (40%) in the competition this season. Ryan Fraser has provided seven Premier League assists for Bournemouth so far this season - more than any other player has provided for the Cherries in a single Premier League campaign. Callum Wilson has scored eight Premier League goals in 15 appearances for Bournemouth this season - as many as his managed in 28 games last season. Wilson has both scored and assisted in three different Premier League games this season (level with Raheem Sterling) - no player has done this on more occasions this season. Man of the Match - Asmir Begovic An honourable mention must go to Pritchard, who was involved in everything good about Huddersfield at the Vitality Stadium. However, in the end Begovic was the reason why Bournemouth finished with all three points. He kept his side's lead in tact with a number of crucial interventions in the first half. He made three in as many minutes to deny Pritchard, Depoitre and Mooy. The Bosnia international then produced another brilliant stop in the second half to keep out Mooy's low drive and he rounded off an excellent night's work when he gathered Isaac Mbenza's cross deep into stoppage-time with Huddersfield pushing for a late equaliser. It was a performance that drew praise from his manager. \"Asmir was excellent tonight,\" Howe told Sky Sports. \"We needed a big performance and he has gone a long way to getting us the three points.\" The managers Eddie Howe: \"Huddersfield were very good tonight. It was nice to go 2-0 up but they had nothing to lose and played well. We defended well. Huddersfield do a lot of things well. You could say we were slightly fortunate, but we deserve that. We scored two good goals and you think you can go on and put it to bed, but it swung. I wasn't happy with the period from 2-0 until half-time. But second-half we were more secure. A few weeks ago, we were playing champagne football but we lost our mojo and hopefully this will bring it back.\" 1:47 Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe praised his sides defensive display after they held off a Huddersfield comeback to claim a 2-1 win, their first victory in five matches Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe praised his sides defensive display after they held off a Huddersfield comeback to claim a 2-1 win, their first victory in five matches David Wagner: \"This is very frustrating. It is disappointing. To make it clear I don't think we deserved anything because you need your defence and offence to work. It was Christmas for Bournemouth because we gave away chances, presents at both ends of the pitch even if performance wise it was a top class away performance. We controlled big parts and dominated them. We had enough opportunities to score at least two. We needed to score three or four today but we didn't take them and that is why we have no rewards.\" 3:38 Huddersfield boss David Wagner was left frustrated with his side's 2-1 defeat and says Bournemouth's first goal from their free-kick was wrongly given Huddersfield boss David Wagner was left frustrated with his side's 2-1 defeat and says Bournemouth's first goal from their free-kick was wrongly given What's next? Bournemouth are back in Premier League action on Saturday when they take on Liverpool, live on Sky Sports Premier League (12.30pm). Huddersfield's next league game is also on Saturday when they travel to Arsenal (3pm)."},{"date": "04/12/2019", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 29663, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove

goals in an incident-packed first half handed 10-man Brighton a 3-1 victory over rivals Crystal Palace at the Amex Stadium on Tuesday. Glenn Murray fired the Seagulls ahead against his former club from the penalty spot on 24 minutes but that positive start was undone within four minutes by Shane Duffy's dismissal for a head-butt on Patrick van Aanholt. But Leon Balogun, introduced to shore up the Brighton defence, doubled their lead with his first touch 25 seconds after coming on, before another substitute, Murray's replacement Florin Andone, made it three in first-half stoppage time. Luka Milivojevic pulled one back from the penalty spot on 81 minutes but it was too little, too late for Palace, who failed to lay a glove on the 10 men of Brighton. The victory lifts Chris Hughton's side up to 10th in the Premier League, nine points and five places clear of Palace, who drop to 15th. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (7), Montoya (7), Duffy (3), Dunk (8), Bernardo (7), Propper (7), Bissouma (7), March (7), Gross (5), Izquierdo (6), Murray (6).

Man of the Match: Lewis Dunk Palace could not live with Brighton's intensity in the opening exchanges but created the first opening as Van Aanholt's cutback found Andros Townsend in the area, but he guided a header wide at the near post. Brighton were contentiously awarded a penalty when referee Kevin Friend adjudged James McArthur to have tripped Jose Izquierdo. Replays showed the Palace midfielder made contact with the ball before the man, but the decision stood as Murray rifled his eighth goal of the season off the underside of the bar from 12 yards. Glenn Murray celebrates with team-mates after scoring Brighton's first goal Murray was on the receiving end of a James Tomkins shoulder barge three minutes later. Referee Friend opted against pointing to the spot for the second time but, in the ensuing melee between the protesting players, he saw Duffy launch his head into the face of Van Aanholt, and showed no hesitation brandishing the red card. Hughton sacrificed Pascal Gross as Balogun entered the fray but it proved to be an inspired substitution as the centre-back's rifled volley doubled Brighton's lead. Leon Balogun celebrates his goal seconds after coming on as a substitute Murray succumbed to the shoulder injury he sustained from Tomkins' shoulder barge and Palace nearly compounded their misery as a Milivojevic shot was cleared off the line by Bernardo. But Brighton stunned Palace in the fourth minute of time added on as Murray's replacement Andone chased a long ball, capitalised on hesitancy from Wayne Hennessey and a slip from Tomkins to rifle the 10 men into a three-goal lead with his second goal for the club. Team news Glenn Murray and Martin Montoya were recalled to the Brighton starting line-up. For the third game running, Roy Hodgson named an unchanged Crystal Palace side. With a man advantage and a three-goal deficit to overturn, the onus was on Palace to get back into the game against a Brighton outfit content attacking on the counter. But few chances came their way and by the time Milivojevic had converted a penalty after Balogun brought Wilfried Zaha down in the area, the game was already out of reach for Palace. Luka Milivojevic pulls a goal back for Crystal Palace Opta stats Leon Balogun scored just 25 seconds after coming on as a substitute for Brighton with what was his first touch - the second quickest goal by a substitute in the Premier League this season after Daniel Sturridge vs West Ham (24 secs). Brighton's 3-1 win over Crystal Palace is their first ever victory in a midweek Premier League match (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday), drawing three and losing three of the previous six. Brighton have lost just one of their last 10 Premier League games at the Amex Stadium (W5 D4), winning three of their last four (D1). Brighton striker Glenn Murray has scored the opening goal in five different Premier League games this season - only Mohamed Salah (6) has done so in more. Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha has won more penalties (7) and Luka Milivojevic has scored more penalties (10) than any other player in the Premier League since last season. Florin Andone is the first Romanian player to score in consecutive Premier League appearances since Ionel Ganea in February 2004 - scoring v Arsenal and Leeds for Wolves. Brighton's Shane Duffy received his first red in league competition since August 2016 when playing for Blackburn against Cardiff. The managers 2:47 Chris Hughton says Brighton were outstanding from the very start of their 3-1 win against Crystal Palace. Chris Hughton says Brighton were outstanding from the very start of their 3-1 win against Crystal Palace. Chris Hughton: \"I thought we were outstanding. It's shame their penalty went in. You know a bad run can leave you four or five without a win. So to get two wins on the spin is big for us. We thoroughly deserved it.\" 3:27 Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson says he is very disappointed with the penalty decision that saw Brighton take the lead in his side's 3-1 defeat in the Premier League Crystal Palace boss Roy Hodgson says he is very disappointed with the penalty decision that saw Brighton take the lead in his side's 3-1 defeat in the Premier League Roy Hodgson: \"We were disappointed by the penalty decision, but we hadn't been playing well. It's disappointing to concede from the corner and the third goal gave us a mountain to climb. The players gave it their best shot and kept going.\" Man of the Match - Lewis Dunk On a night when moments of mayhem were erupting all over the pitch, Brighton's calm and composed captain led his side to one of the sweetest victories they'll arguably have this season. Dunk dealt with the loss of his partner Duffy with consummate ease and guided a back four with little experience of playing together to a defensive display 11 players would have been proud of.

Perez came in from the wilderness to score twice (49 & 54) after replacing Marko Arnautovic, who limped off with a hamstring problem. Michail Antonio added a third (61) before Josh Murphy (90+5) registered a late consolation for Cardiff. It was former Arsenal striker Perez's first Premier League goals since January 2017 as West Ham made it back-to-back wins after turning over Newcastle on Saturday. It could have been very different if Ralls had not spurned his chance from the spot just before the break at 0-0 but West Ham goalkeeper Lukas Fabianski guessed right. Team news There were two changes for the Hammers from the win at Newcastle. Arthur Masuaku and Michail Antonio came in while Jack Wilshere wasn’t in the squad. Meanwhile, Cardiff made a defensive tweak with Joe Bennett coming in for Josh Murphy. Both teams started with a confident swagger after their respective wins at the weekend but it was West Ham who created the early opening. Angelo Ogbonna had a close-range header turned over the bar by Neil Etheridge while Arnautovic had an effort cleared off the line after rampaging through the Cardiff backline. Perez celebrates with team-mates The frustration of missing that chance may have affected Arnautovic's decision-making on 35 minutes when he barged over Junior Hoilett in the box. The West Ham striker was a relieved man when Ralls' weak penalty was easily saved by Fabianski. Arnautovic's eventful evening came to end just before the break when he limped off with a hamstring injury. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (7), Masuaku (7), Ogbonna (7), Diop (7), Antonio (7), Noble (7), Rice (7), Snodgrass (8), Anderson (7), Arnautovic (7), Hernandez (7) Subs: Perez (8), Carroll (6), Diangana (6) Cardiff: Etheridge (5), Manga (6), Morrison (6), Bamba (6), Ralls (6), Bennett (6), Camarasa (6), Arter (6), Gunnarsson (6), Hoilett (6), Paterson (6) Subs: Mendez-Laing (6), Murphy (6), Harris (6) Man of the match: Robert Snodgrass His departure seemed to knock the Hammers, who looked short on ideas until Perez struck just after half-time. Robert Snodgrass produced a deft touch behind the Cardiff defence and the striker powered a finish past Etheridge, who could have done better. Confidence was now flowing for Perez after a frustrating period of his career since moving to the Premier League - he doubled up six minutes later. This time it was Arthur Masuaku who opened up Cardiff and his pass was finished by the striker - once again, Etheridge will have been disappointed with his effort. Antonio completed the scoring blitz six minutes later when flicking home a Snodgrass corner after Cardiff went to sleep from the set-piece. Apart from a scrappy late Murphy goal, Cardiff had little in response. After an impressive win at Wolves, it's back down to earth for Neil Warnock's men. Man of the match: Robert Snodgrass For all the millions spent on foreign imports in the West Ham squad, it was the guile and creativity of Snodgrass that made the difference in this encounter. His delivery was first-class and he stepped up when West Ham needed him in a difficult period of the game where the crowd were becoming restless. His pass for Perez's opener was simple but beautifully constructed. He must be playing the best football of his career at the minute. Manager reaction: Manuel Pellegrini \"We improved a lot in the second half. It was a relief. The goal relieved the pressure. That's why we scored two more goals. Cardiff are a difficult team - they only lost 1-0 against Tottenham and Everton. They work very well in the style they like to play.\" 2:43 Manuel Pellegrini praised the impact of Lucas Perez after the substitute came off the bench to score two goals as West Ham beat Cardiff 3-1 in the Premier League.

Watford 1-2 Manchester City Leaders Manchester City survived a late scare to see off Watford 2-1 at Vicarage Road on Tuesday night. City were camped in Watford's half for most of the first half and took the lead on 40 minutes as Leroy Sane chested home Riyad Mahrez's dangerous cross. Provider Mahrez then turned scorer in the second half, slotting past Foster with a controlled finish from Gabriel Jesus' cut-back (51), before Abdoulaye Doucoure made for a nervy ending with a messy late goal (85). Manchester City players celebrate Leroy Sane's opener Player ratings Watford: Foster (8), Femenia (6), Cathcart (6), Kabasele (6), Holebas (5), Doucoure (6), Chalobah (5), Hughes (5), Pereyra (6), Success (5), Deeney (6) Subs: Quina (5), Deulofeu (7), Gray (6) Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Kompany (8), Stones (7), Delph (6), Fernandinho (7), David Silva (7), Sane (8), Bernardo Silva (7), Mahrez (9), Jesus (6) Subs: Gunodgan (5), Otamendi (NA), Laporte (NA) Man of the match: Riyad Mahrez But City held on, and the result means they remain unbeaten this season and five points above Liverpool, who play at Burnley on Wednesday night. Watford are down to 11th. Predictably, City dominated the ball from the off, and were nearly ahead on 11 minutes as Roberto Pereyra's sloppy square pass allowed Sane through on goal, only for Ben Foster to race out and save superbly. Foster came to Watford's rescue again as he closed down the gap on Mahrez six yards out after the Algerian was played through beautifully by Fernandinho, and Watford had a chance of their own at the other end as Troy Deeney was denied at point-blank range by Ederson's foot. But City went ahead with five minutes of the half remaining as Mahrez, whose cross should have been turned home by David Silva 30 seconds previous, delivered a beauty for Sane to improvise and chest past the onrushing Foster from six yards. City took just six minutes of the second half to get the two-goal cushion, as Sane and David Silva combined with Jesus on the left, before the Brazilian's cut-back into the box was tucked home 10 yards out by Mahrez, his sixth goal against Watford and fourth at Vicarage Road. Leroy Sane celebrates his opener for Manchester City Team news City changed their entire back four as Pep Guardiola made six changes from the 3-1 win over Bournemouth. Walker, Kompany, Stones, Delph, David Silva and Mahrez were in, replacing Danilo, Otamendi, Laporte, Zinchenko, Gundogan and Sterling. Sergio Aguero did not travel with the City side. Watford made three changes from the 2-0 defeat at Leicester; Deulofeu, Mariappa and the suspended Capoue came out, replaced by Deeney, Kabasele and Chalobah. Mahrez's shot from just inside the box then hit Christian Kabasele's arm, but went unnoticed by referee Paul Tierney, while Jesus, in the side due to Sergio Aguero's absence, finished poorly inside the box from Mahrez's superb through ball. Man-of-the-match Mahrez was denied by Foster's fine one-handed save late on, but a rare Watford attack then resulted in a goal as Doucoure bundled over the line after seeing his first effort blocked by Kyle Walker. Troy Deeney and John Stones in action at Vicarage Road The 63th-minute introduction of Gerard Deulofeu had burst Watford into life, and they nearly grabbed a shock leveller as Deeney's header from a corner fell into the grateful arms of Ederson. Man of the match - Riyad Mahrez Mahrez stood out in a dominant City performance, for 85 minutes at least, and looks to have firmly settled into Pep Guardiola's side. He made three key passes, more than any other City player, and had an eye for goal, pulling off five of City's 15 shots in total. The managers Javi Gracia: \"I am very proud of the effort of my players, because I know it is very hard to play against this team. I think my players today deserved recognition.\" Pep Guardiola: \"We spoke right now in the locker room, we have to learn about what happened in the last 20, 25 minutes, that is the lesson. Never can you forget to play, until the last second. \"Fifteen games, 13 victories, two draws, with one at Anfield, so I am not complaining. We are qualified for the Champions League last 16, so I don't have many regrets. What happened today in the last five minutes is the normal process, and to improve. To improve, you have to live these situations.\" Opta stats Man City's goal difference of +38 is the is the best recorded by an English top-flight team after the first 15 games of a season since Sunderland in 1892-93 (+39). Manchester City have scored at least twice in their last nine games against Watford in all competitions, winning all nine by an aggregate score of 29-5. Watford have lost three in a row in the Premier League for the first time since December 2017 under Marco Silva (4 games). Manchester City have now gone unbeaten in each of their last 21 games in the Premier League (W18 D3), since a 2-3 defeat against Manchester United in April.

Fulham Chelsea 2-0 Fulham Chelsea comfortably beat Fulham 2-0 on Sunday afternoon to mark a disappointing return to Stamford Bridge for Claudio Ranieri on Derby Day. Pedro broke the deadlock for the hosts in the fourth minute following a mistake from Jean Michael Seri as Ranieri experimented with a diamond midfield. Fulham rallied in the second half with Calum Chambers coming close on a few occasions, but substitute Ruben Loftus-Cheek sealed victory for the hosts (82) after some fine combination play between Eden Hazard and Pedro. The result means Fulham remain bottom of the Premier League table on eight points. Chelsea, meanwhile, move up into third ahead of Tottenham for at least a few hours. Player ratings Chelsea: Kepa (8), Alonso (7), Azpilicueta (7), Luiz (6), Rudiger (7), Kante (7), Jorginho (7), Kovacic (7), Pedro (9), Hazard (8), Giroud (7). Subs: Loftus-Cheek (7), Morata (5), Zappacosta (6) Fulham: Rico (7), Sessegnon (6), Odoi, (5) Mawson (5), Le Marchand (5), Chambers (7), Christie (6), Seri, (5) Johansen (5), Cairney (6), Mitrovic (6). Subs: Kamara (6), Ayite (5), Kebano (5) Man of the match: Pedro After an encouraging opening from Fulham, their early momentum came to a halt due to a series of mistakes by Denis Odoi and Seri. Odoi's ponderous pass into Seri was picked off by N'Golo Kante, who slipped through Pedro to slot away Chelsea's 1000th home goal in the Premier League. Fulham strung together their best move of the first half in the 17th minute with Chambers letting a shot go from range, but Kepa Arrizabalaga was equal to the effort. Chelsea almost doubled their lead with less than ten minutes of the first half to go through Olivier Giroud after he met Eden Hazard's cross at the near post, but Sergio Rico did well to stop the first-time effort with a strong reflex save before the Spaniard made a similar stop with his legs to deny the Frenchman just before half-time. Team news Olivier Giroud replaced Alvaro Morata up front. Pedro took Willian's place in the one other change. Andre Schurrle was not in the matchday squad due to injury. The former Chelsea midfielder was replaced by Stefan Johansen. Ranieri introduced Floyd Ayite and Aboubakar Kamara to inject some pace into his side at the start of the second half, but their an equalising goal nearly came through Chambers again. He rose highest to meet a floated corner by Seri, but his near-post header was expertly batted away by Kepa. The Arsenal loanee then had another opportunity to put Ranieri's men on level terms in the 65th minute only for his swept effort to be clawed to safety by Kepa. Just moments after coming off the bench, Alvaro Morata was presented with a glorious chance to extend Chelsea's lead in the 72nd minute but he blasted his rebound, following a strong save by Rico to deny Hazard, over the bar from point-blank range. Fortunately for the former Real Madrid striker the miss did not matter too much as Chelsea extended their lead through Loftus-Cheek in the 83rd minute who finished off a flowing move, kickstarted by Hazard and Pedro, on his 50th Premier League appearance. Notes for Southgate Gareth Southgate will likely be keeping a close eye on Ruben Loftus-Cheek who has performed well under Maurizio Sarri this season. He made a fast impact after coming off the bench to score his fifth goal of the season in all competitions. Ryan Sessegnon produced a disappointing display in an unorthodox striker position alongside Aleksandar Mitrovic before he was substituted at half-time.

Fulham have conceded 35 goals in the Premier League this season - their joint-most after 14 games of a top-flight league campaign (35 in 1959-60). Chelsea are unbeaten in their previous 17 Premier League games against Fulham (W10 D7), winning each of the last four in a row. This was the 14th time that a former Chelsea manager has returned to Stamford Bridge in a Premier League game and failed to win (D5 L9), with this being Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri's third such attempt (D1 L2). Fulham have failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last 18 games in the Premier League, and are the only side yet to keep one in the competition this season. Pedro's opener for Chelsea was their 1000th home goal in the Premier League, becoming just the third club to reach this landmark in the competition after Manchester United and Arsenal. Chelsea winger Pedro has scored more Premier League goals in 12 appearances this season (5 goals from 23 shots) than he managed in 31 such games in 2017-18 (4 from 56 shots). Chelsea midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek has scored five goals in his last six appearances in all competitions for Chelsea, including in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time. The managers Maurizio Sarri: \"I think that we were a little tense. We defended a little better than in the last match, of course. \"We can do better in the offensive phase, but today the result was more important. \"We gave more attention to the defensive phase today in order to kill the match and got a very good reaction for the level of application and attention. \"Now we have to start to play our football in a better way.\" 2:25 Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri said he was pleased with how his side responded following last week's defeat to Tottenham. Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri said he was pleased with how his side responded following last week's defeat to Tottenham. Claudio Ranieri: \"We made a mistake for the first goal and then in the second half we played much better. \"We created some chances and, of course, when you play against a big champion it's something we had to do. We are improving. It's a positive step but, of course, we have to react immediately.\" 2:44 Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri has called on his players to react positively after suffering a 2-0 defeat to former club Chelsea. Fulham boss Claudio Ranieri has called on his players to react positively after suffering a 2-0 defeat to former club Chelsea. Man of the Match - Pedro Pedro put in a Man of the Match display against Fulham Pedro was instrumental in Chelsea's comfortable victory. He clinically took his chance in front of goal the first half to get his team off to a bright start and frequently provided left-back Maxime Le Marchand with plenty of problems. The former Barcelona forward continued to be dangerous in the second half and played a crucial part in the build-up to Chelsea's second goal as he exchanged some intricate passes with Hazard before creating the opening for Loftus-Cheek to capitalise on.

In a topsy-turvy north London derby, Arsenal dominated early on and took the lead through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's penalty (10), but were pegged back by Eric Dier's near-post header (30), which caused a ruckus after he celebrated in front of Arsenal fans. Spurs then stunned the Emirates as Harry Kane converted from the spot after Rob Holding foolishly left a leg in on Heung-min Son (34), but Arsenal were level after the break through Aubameyang's fine curling effort from the edge of the box (56). 1:10 Eric Dier's celebrations caused some unsightly scenes on the sidelines as Tottenham and Arsenal players clashed. Eric Dier's celebrations caused some unsightly scenes on the sidelines as Tottenham and Arsenal players clashed. Sub Alexandre Lacazette put Arsenal 3-2 ahead with 15 minutes remaining, squeezing a shot into the corner from 20 yards via a deflection, and they added a fourth two minutes later through Lucas Torreira after he raced through on goal at an angle. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates scoring Arsenal's first goal Jan Vertonghen then saw red for a second yellow late on, and the result means Arsenal leapfrog their bitter rivals Spurs into fourth place in the Premier League table, eight points off leaders Manchester City. Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (7), Mustafi (7), Sokratis (7), Holding (8), Kolasinac (7), Bellerin (7), Xhaka (7), Torreira (9), Iwobi (6), Mkhitaryan (7), Aubameyang (8) Subs: Ramsey (8), Lacazette (8), Guendouzi (NA) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Aurier (5), Vertonghen (5), Foyth (5), Davies (5), Dier (6), Sissoko (5), Eriksen (6), Alli (6), Son (7), Kane (6) Subs: Lucas (NA), Winks (NA), Rose (NA) Man of the match: Lucas Torreira Arsenal looked explosive in the early stages, with Spurs harried inside their defensive third, and from an early corner they were awarded a penalty via Vertonghen's needless handball. Aubameyang duly converted, but the pressure did not stop there. Aubameyang could not get his body right as Sead Kolasinac found him six yards out, before Alex Iwobi forced Hugo Lloris into a low block with a first-time effort from 12 yards from another Kolasinac delivery. Spurs started to settle as Son forced two saves from Bernd Leno, and the visitors then got their leveller on the half hour as Dier swept in at the near post to squeeze home Christian Eriksen's free-kick from the left. As Dier celebrated in front of the Arsenal fans, the home subs got involved, causing a melee between both sets of players, and prompting Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino to run the length of the touchline in an attempt to calm the situation. Eric Dier celebrates after equalising The stunning turnaround was complete just four minutes later as Holding needlessly tripped Son on the left of the box; Kane converted, his eighth goal in a north London derby, meaning Arsenal still have not gone into half-time ahead this season. Lloris then superbly clawed away Shkodran Mustafi's looping header in first-half stoppage time, and half-time only provided a light breather as the drama continued. Arsenal brought on Lacazette and Aaron Ramsey, and it was the latter who played a part in the equaliser, slipping into the final third and feeding Aubameyang, who curled a stunner past the rooted Lloris from 20 yards. Team news Unai Emery named the same starting the XI that faced Bournemouth last weekend, however, the big news was no Mesut Ozil in the matchday squad due to a back spasm. The only change from the Tottenham side that beat Chelsea last weekend saw Jan Vertonghen replace Toby Alderweireld in central defence. Dele Alli then blocked Mustafi's effort through a crowd off the line and Torreira blasted the rebound just wide, but Arsenal got the goal they deserved through Lacazette. Juan Foyth needlessly gave the ball to Ramsey, who fed the Frenchman in the final third, and his shot from 20 yards deflected off Dier and squeezed past Lloris. Aubameyang celebrates with Alexandre Lacazette The Emirates erupted moments later with their fourth; Aubameyang's through ball sent Torreira free at an angle on the right, and he duly found the far corner with a fine finish. \"It's shaking. This stadium is shaking,\" said Sky Sports co-commentator Gary Neville. There was a final insult for Spurs in the closing moments as Vertonghen saw red for a second yellow, but Spurs were already floored as Arsenal remain unbeaten in 19 in all competitions. Why on earth are Arsenal allowing Aaron Ramsey to leave? He's surely worth a new contract. His passion, passing and work-rate so important to Arsenal's comeback against Spurs. Delivered an immense 45 minutes. His quality and character will be expensive to replace. #afc #ARSTOT — Henry Winter (@henrywinter) December 2, 2018 The pundit - Gary Neville I've hated coming here in the last couple of years, in some ways, because there's been an apathy and an atmosphere that this great club doesn't deserve. Today it was completely different and it has shocked me. It has shocked me because Tottenham are a team I really admire and have loved watching over the last two or three years. Today they have been out-run. It was a collective display by Arsenal. There's still massive improvements to make in individual players and Unai Emery will definitely delve into the transfer market in the next two or three windows, but they have been absolutely sensational today. The managers Unai Emery: \"I think our process and today our supporters here, the atmosphere was very good and they push a lot for us. In a difficult first-half moment we keep the calm, and we said in the dressing room that we had good moments in the first half. 4:19 Unai Emery insists Arsenal connected with their fans during the victory Unai Emery insists Arsenal connected with their fans during the victory \"It's the reason every match is an important three points. For the supporters it is a special match, and for us to also because we want to give them a special match. I think they connected with the supporters today.\" Mauricio Pochettino: \"They were so fresh because eight, nine players didn't play on Thursday and they were preparing the game. It is not an excuse but when you concede 3-2 in the second half, you need energy to come back.\" 3:06 Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino felt Arsenal benefited from having rested players midweek Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino felt Arsenal benefited from having rested players midweek Man of the match - Lucas Torreira Torreira is becoming something of a fan favourite here, and his energy and dynamism in midfield pushed Spurs uncomfortably close to their penalty area in big stages at the Emirates. The Uruguayan won the ball back a whopping 12 times, four more than any other Arsenal player and more than any other player on the pitch, and he got the goal his display deserved late on Opta stats Harry Kane puts Tottenham ahead from the penalty spot Arsenal have found the net at least once in each of their last 23 home games against Spurs in all competitions, since a goalless draw in November 1998. Tottenham have dropped more points from winning positions in Premier League games against Arsenal than any side has against another in the competition (40). This was only the second Premier League match between Arsenal and Spurs to see both sides awarded a penalty, and the first since April 2002. Arsenal have scored more second half goals than any other side in the Premier League this season (24). Tottenham's Harry Kane has scored eight Premier League goals in north London derbies - no player has scored more in the competition (level with Emmanuel Adebayor). What's next? Arsenal now go to Manchester United on Wednesday night in the Premier League, while Tottenham host Southampton, also on Wednesday night."},{"date": "02/12/2019", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance":

Divock Origi sparked mayhem at Anfield as his 96th-minute winner saw Liverpool snatch a dramatic 1-0 victory over Everton in the Merseyside derby. The Belgium international, introduced on 84 minutes, headed the winner home from close range after Jordan Pickford failed to deal with Virgil van Dijk looping shot, pushing the ball onto his bar which Origi followed up. It was a cruel blow on Everton after a spirited display, capped by three clear goalscoring opportunities in the first half, had the Toffees dreaming of a first win at Anfield since 1999. 0:36 Jurgen Klopp could not hide his delight as Liverpool snatched all three points in the Merseryside derby with a last gasp winner by Divock Origi. Jurgen Klopp could not hide his delight as Liverpool snatched all three points in the Merseryside derby with a last gasp winner by Divock Origi. But, in the most dramatic fashion, Liverpool claimed the local bragging rights as Origi's winner saw the Reds close the gap on leaders Manchester City to two points. Jurgen Klopp was complimentary of Marco Silva's new-look Everton ahead of kick-off and within four minutes of kick-off, the Liverpool boss was proven right as the visitors' first chance ignited an engrossing half of football. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (8), Alexander-Arnold (6), Gomez (6), Van Dijk (7), Robertson (6), Fabinho (5), Wijnaldum (6), Shaqiri (5), Firmino (6), Mane (6), Salah (6). Subs: Keita (5), Sturridge (5), Origi (7). Everton: Pickford (4), Coleman (7), Keane (7), Mina (7), Digne (7), Gomes (8), Gueye (6), Sigurdsson (7), Walcott (6), Bernard (7), Richarlison (7). Subs: Lookman (6), Zouma (n/a), Calvert-Lewin (n/a). Man of the Match: Andre Gomes. A free-kick from the left found Yerry Mina in the six-yard box unmarked, but the Colombian's header missed the target. Liverpool responded to almost devastating effect as Mohamed Salah chipped a ball over the Everton defence seven minutes later, only for Sadio Mane to fire over. The chances kept on coming in a frenetic opening quarter as Richarlison lost his footing having burst into the Liverpool area before Roberto Firmino dragged a shot wide on the swivel. Joe Gomez clears off the line after Alisson's point-blank save from Andre Gomes Everton thought they had broken the deadlock on 21 minutes when Bernard's cross from the left was headed back by Theo Walcott to Andre Gomes, but a sharp save from Allison and then a stunning goal-line clearance from Joe Gomez rescued Liverpool. After Firmino had drawn Pickford into another save and Richarlison had tame appeals for a penalty turned down, Xherdan Shaqiri was played through on goal but, like Mina and Gomes, the Swiss missed a glorious chance to open the scoring as Pickford saved his drive. Team news Jurgen Klopp made three changes following the midweek defeat at PSG as Trent Alexander-Arnold, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri were recalled. James Milner dropped to the bench, while Dejan Lovren and the suspended Jordan Henderson missed out. Marco Silva named the same Everton side that edged past Cardiff last time out. There was yet more drama before the break as a defence-splitting Gylfi Sigurdsson reverse pass released Walcott, but Alisson further vindicated his £67m transfer fee by smothering the winger. Liverpool started the second half as well as Everton did the first as Salah curled an effort wide and Mane went close with two efforts in quick succession. Everton steadied and grew back into the game, thriving as the tension inside an expectant Anfield increased. Origi hit the crossbar from a yard out in the final minutes of normal time That expectancy spurred Liverpool on further as the recently-introduced Origi fired a knockdown against the crossbar with two minutes remaining. Everton looked to have secured a point but even more drama followed as Van Dijk's sliced volley sent the ball looping into the air. Pickford tried to tip it behind but inadvertently kept the ball in play, putting the ball on a plate for Origi took the chance to send Anfield into rapture. Andrew Robertson and Richarlison clash Opta stats Liverpool have recorded five 90th-minute winners against Everton in the Premier League; more than against any other side in the competition. Liverpool have kept 21 clean sheets against Everton in the Premier League; more than they've accumulated against any other side. Liverpool are unbeaten in each of their last 18 matches against Everton in all competitions (W9 D9) - the Reds' longest ever unbeaten run against their rivals. Liverpool have recorded 11 clean sheets in the Premier League so far in 2018 at Anfield; only in 2002 and 2006 have the Reds kept more (12). Liverpool have conceded just five goals in their first 14 Premier League games this season; only Chelsea in 2008-09 conceded fewer at this stage in a PL campaign (4 goals). Divock Origi has scored in all three of his home league appearances against Everton for Liverpool - scoring more goals against the Toffees than any other side in the competition. The managers 5:22 Jurgen Klopp explains how emotion got the better of him after Origi's derby winner Jurgen Klopp explains how emotion got the better of him after Origi's derby winner Jurgen Klopp: \"The game was with unbelievable intensity. Both teams had chances. Both goalkeepers had outstanding performances. In the end it was a very weird goal. I can't imagine the disappointment of Everton. But we got it and we will take it. It is a brilliant night.\" 4:31 Marco Silva felt defeat was harsh on his Everton side at Anfield Marco Silva felt defeat was harsh on his Everton side at Anfield Marco Silva: \"It was a tough match and a tough result for us. We don't deserve to lose. We challenged them to win the match. I think the draw possibly was the fair result. They didn't deserve it but that is football. It is our life. It is something different every day. That goal you cannot expect to happen.\" Man of the Match - Andre Gomes Defeat at Anfield was a bitter pill for all associated with Everton to swallow, but none more so than Andre Gomes. The Barcelona loanee was gracious in midfield throughout and his poise and composure on the ball provided the base for Everton's encouraging display. Gomes even had the Sky Sports pundits purring, including Jamie Redknapp, who urged Everton to snap up the Portuguese midfielder on a permanent deal. \"With a player on loan, there is usually some kind of buyout clause and they really have to take that up,\" he said.

Palace end a run of eight games without a win with a 2-0 victory over Burnley. James McArthur (16) gave Palace the lead with a left-footed cross that evaded everyone and went in off the far post and, after the hosts bombarded the Burnley goal without success for much of the second half, Townsend (77) found the top corner with a thumping strike to make sure of the points at Selhurst Park. Burnley offered little as they succumbed to a fifth defeat in six league games and only the woodwork and some wasteful Palace finishing prevented them suffering a far heavier defeat. Andros Townsend's goal sealed Crystal Palace's win over Burnley The win was Roy Hodgson's side's first at home this season and lifts them to 14th while Burnley remain in the bottom three. Max Meyer and Wilfried Zaha were lively from the first whistle for Palace and on three occasions in the first 10 minutes they threatened the Burnley goal. Zaha skipped past Matt Lowton and his fizzed ball across the box was inches away from being converted by Cheikhou Kouyate, the Ivorian midfielder's goalbound shot was then deflected wide by his own team-mate and, a minute later, Meyer's curling effort was tipped round the post by Joe Hart. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Wan-Bissaka (6), Tomkins (7), Sakho (7), van Aanholt (7), McArthur (7), Kouyate (7), Milivojevic (7), Meyer (8), Townsend (8), Zaha (8) Subs: Sorloth (N/A), Schlupp (N/A), Puncheon (N/A) Burnley: Hart (7), Lowton (5), Long (5), Mee (4), Taylor (5), Lennon (4), Defour (4), Cork (5), Gudmundsson (5), Hendrick (4), Wood (4) Subs: Brady (5), Vokes (N/A), Barnes (N/A) Man of the match: Wilfried Zaha Meyer was involved again for the opening goal, his run across the front post drew attention of defenders and goalkeeper and although he was unable to get a touch, McArthur's low left-footed cross bobbled in off the far post. Burnley were rocked by the goal and Palace could have doubled their lead soon after as Zaha found Patrick van Aanholt, who burst into the box but found the side netting with his shot. Meyer curled a left-footed shot just wide as half-time approached but if Sean Dyche hoped his side would come out fighting after the break, he was to be bitterly disappointed. Palace had seen their opponents frailties in the first period and were unrelenting in their attempts to kill them off when play resumed. Zaha forced another save from Hart after working space in the area and was then presented with an even better chance after Townsend robbed Kevin Long of possession on the halfway line and played in his strike partner, only for Zaha to fire over with just Hart to beat. Team news Roy Hodgson named the same XI that began the draw at Manchester United last week. Meanwhile, Sean Dyche brought in Johann Gudmundsson and Jeff Hendrick with Robbie Brady and Sam Vokes making way. James Tarkowski returned to the matchday squad and took his place among the substitutes. Luka Milivojevic dragged a shot wide from 10 yards and McArthur then looked certain to score, only for Charlie Taylor to deny him with a goal-saving block as the pressure continued to build. The game was almost descending into farce as Zaha bent another fine strike beyond Hart, only to see it come back off the underside of the crossbar but with 13 minutes left, Burnley's luck finally ran out. Kouyate freed Townsend down the right, the forward cut back inside and from the corner of the box, hammered a shot into the far top corner to secure the points in fine style. Opta stats Crystal Palace mustered 29 shots in the game, more than they have managed in any Premier League game since 2003/04. Burnley have enjoyed just two wins in their last 19 Premier League games (D5 L12), after winning five in a row before that run. Crystal Palace registered their first victory in their last nine Premier League games (D3 L5). Burnley haven't won any of their last 22 away top-flight matches in December (D7 L15) since a 1-0 win in December 1969 against West Bromwich Albion. In league competition, Burnley have won just one of their last 13 away matches against Crystal Palace (D6 L6). Man of the match - Wilfried Zaha Wilfried Zaha was a constant menace for Crystal Palace Nominally playing up front with Townsend, Zaha spent much of his time out on the left before driving at an increasingly nervy Burnley defence. He may not have ended up on the scoresheet - and certainly could have done better on a couple of occasions - but he did little wrong with an effort that came back off the bar and, along with Meyer and Townsend, set the tone for Palace's performance. A constant menace and if he can maintain this form, Palace should not have to wait as long for their next league win.

from behind to win 2-1 at Huddersfield. An eventful game saw its first goal inside the opening minute, when Bruno's skewed clearance landed in his own area and was headed in by Mathias Jorgensen with only 54 seconds played. Mathias Jorgensen scored just his second goal for Huddersfield Mounie was then shown a straight red by Michael Oliver for a high challenge on Yves Bissouma, which looked unintentional but left a mark halfway up the midfielder's lower leg. Brighton failed to press their advantage until the final seconds of the first half when Shane Duffy nodded in Solly March's cross (45+4), and later on he turned provider again as Florin Andone scored his first goal for the club from another header (69) which would prove to be the winner. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Hadergjonaj (6), Jorgensen (6), Schindler (7), Kongolo (6), Durm (5), Hogg (6), Billing (6), Mooy (6), Pritchard (7), Mounie (5) Subs: Depoitre (5), Smith (5), Williams (5) Brighton: Ryan (6), Bruno (6), Duffy (7), Dunk (5), Bernardo (6), March (8), Propper (6), Bissouma (6), Gross (6), Izquierdo (6), Andone (7). Subs: Murray (6), Balogun (n/a), Kayal (n/a). Man of the match: Solly March Huddersfield went into the game on a high after picking up seven points from their last three games and they started in the best possible style with a first-minute goal. Philip Billing's long throw was cleared as far as Bruno, who attempted to hook the ball clear but lifted it back into his own box, where Jorgensen stole a march on Bissouma to head beyond a stranded Mat Ryan. The hosts were cruising with Brighton as poor as they have been for some time - their passing off colour and looking devoid of ideas. But the visitors were handed a huge lifeline when Mounie left a foot in on Bissouma and was, perhaps harshly, shown a straight red by Oliver. Brighton did little to press home their advantage but, in the fourth and final minute of first-half injury-time, they levelled when a short Bruno corner was crossed by March onto the head of Duffy, who met it with a crisp header into the far corner. Team news Mathias Jorgensen returned for Tommy Smith at the back as Huddersfield reverted to their most conventional back three. Solly March replaced Anthony Knockaert in the only change from Brighton's home draw with Leicester last weekend. Brighton never really looked back following the restart and, after Huddersfield boss David Wagner chose to withdraw Alex Pritchard for Laurent Depoitre, the hosts lost most of their creativity. The Seagulls pressed for most of the second period but Huddersfield frustrated them well for 25 minutes, until Andone got across Jorgensen to nod in March's brilliant cross from the right. Florin Andone scored his first goal for Brighton to seal victory It could have been 10 versus 10 when Brighton substitute Leon Balogun was perhaps lucky not to see red for his follow-through on Erik Durm late on, but Albion held on to claim their first Premier League win when conceding first, and move up to 11th in the table. Opta facts Huddersfield have won just one of their last 10 Premier League home games, drawing two and losing seven. Brighton have scored in seven consecutive league games for the first time since February 2017, when they put together a run of nine. Huddersfield have scored in three consecutive home league games for the first time since December 2017. Brighton have won two of their last four Premier League away games (L2), as many victories as they managed in their previous 23 on the road in the competition (D6 L15). Jorgensen's strike for Huddersfield v Brighton on 55 seconds was the fastest goal scored in the Premier League since January 31st, when Christian Eriksen netted after 11 seconds for Tottenham v Manchester United. Brighton's Solly March has registered four assists in his last four Premier League appearances, two more than he managed in his previous 46 top-flight games (2). Brighton's Florin Andone is the first player to score on his first Premier League start for the Seagulls. Brighton's Florin Andone is the first Romanian to score in the Premier League since Vlad Chiriches netted for Tottenham against Fulham in December 2013. Man of the match - Solly March March's deliveries from the Brighton right were excellent and the two assists he managed were testament to the wonderful crosses he can produce on his trusty left foot. His passing accuracy in Huddersfield's half was only bettered by Davy Propper, but it was his crossing which really set him apart. What's next? Brighton host Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Tuesday night at 7.45pm, while Huddersfield travel to Bournemouth at the same time."},{"date": "01/12/2019", "arena": "The King Power Stadium",

four games. Vardy put the hosts ahead at the King Power Stadium with a penalty after 12 minutes, his third successful effort from the spot this week, after being brought down by Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster. Maddison netted a wonderful second 11 minutes later, while Watford were wasteful in front of goal and have now scored just once in their last four Premier League outings. Their afternoon got worse in the 90th minute when Etienne Capoue saw a straight red card after a studs-up challenge on Kelechi Iheanacho, with Watford now slipping down a place into 10th while Leicester have moved up to seventh.

Man of the match: James Maddison. Leicester were awarded a penalty early on as Vardy had his legs swiped out from underneath him by goalkeeper Foster. He pleaded his case with referee Graham Scott but the penalty stood, which Vardy dispatched with aplomb to put the hosts ahead. Jamie Vardy gave Leicester the lead with a penalty A vintage Leicester counter-attack then resulted in them extending their lead. Marc Albrighton strode down the right-hand side before picking out Maddison with a lofted cross. The midfielder took three touches to take the ball around Adrian Mariappa before sweeping home past Foster, who was left rooted to the spot. Leicester could have added another in the 35th minute, but Demarai Gray's shot from 25 yards whistled past the post, taking a nick on the way through for a Leicester corner. It was Watford who then hit their hosts with a counter-attack after clearing the set-piece, but Isaac Success' attempt to chip over the oncoming Kasper Schmeichel went high over the crossbar. Team news Leicester made two changes from their Premier League game last weekend, with Jamie Vardy and Wilfred Ndidi coming in. Both players started in midweek, though, along with Jonny Evans and Demarai Gray. Watford also made two changes, bringing in Jose Holebas and Isaac Success. Watford twice went close not long after the restart. Ricardo Pereira got ahead of Success to put a Gerard Deulofeu cross into the hands of Schmeichel. The goalkeeper collected the ball again not long after, with Deulofeu picking out Roberto Pereyra but his sweeping strike was straight at Schmeichel. Leicester's best chance of a half came in the 58th minute as Pereira slipped in Gray down the right of the box but the winger's thunderous strike on a tight angle smashed the crossbar before going out for a throw-in. The visitors ended the game with ten men as Capoue was given a straight red card in the final minute of normal time. He launched into a two-footed challenge on Iheanacho with his studs showing, although he did get the ball as the Leicester striker went over. But as Capoue got to his feet, referee Scott sent him off, meaning he will now miss the next three domestic fixtures. Leicester's James Maddison competes for a header with Watford's Will Hughes Opta stats Leicester City have won all five of their home Premier League matches against Watford, scoring 10 goals and conceding just once. Watford have won just one of their last 12 away matches at the King Power Stadium against Leicester in all competitions (D2 L9), a 2-1 victory in April 2013 in the Championship. Since the start of the 2014-15 season, Jamie Vardy has won more penalties in the Premier League than any other player (14). James Maddison has been directly involved in four goals in his six Premier League home games for Leicester this season, scoring three and assisting one. The managers Claude Puel: \"It was a home game and our last game at home was not enough to score and to have the good result against Burnley. It was important with the support from our fans to give them this joy, to manage our game and to win. \"It was a tough game against a strong team with quality and a direct style. To perform against this team is fantastic but it is just three points and I hope we can continue this journey.\" 5:21 Claude Puel reflects on James Maddison's stunning finish for Leicester in the 2-0 win over Watford Claude Puel reflects on James Maddison's stunning finish for Leicester in the 2-0 win over Watford Javi Gracia: \"We have been unlucky in the last few games. I prefer to keep my opinion, everyone can see what happened. That play was in front of me, I could see clearly, but it is not important what I saw. It is important that Leicester's player Iheancho said Capoue didn't touch him and then I don't say anything else. \"Yes [it is frustrating] but I think the best way is to try to improve our games, improve our performances and in the future, we will get better results.\" 3:18 Watford manager Javi Gracia says his side are creating chances but need to improve their finishing after losing 2-0 at Leicester Watford manager Javi Gracia says his side are creating chances but need to improve their finishing after losing 2-0 at Leicester Man of the match - James Maddison James Maddison celebrates after scoring Leicester's second goal It was a wonderful strike from Maddison as he truly redeemed himself after being sent off against Brighton last weekend, showing some wonderful skill to get around the Watford defence competed with a confident finish for his fourth goal of the season. He continued to show his attacking intent throughout the game, linking up brilliantly well with Vardy, and contributed well in the second half when Leicester did not see as much of the ball.

over Bournemouth on Saturday at the Etihad, their sixth league win in a row. City took the lead on 16 minutes through Bernardo Silva's shot through a crowd from 15 yards, but Bournemouth got a deserved equaliser late in the half as Callum Wilson's fine header found the top corner (44). Raheem Sterling hit the post after the break following a mazy run, but got his goal on 57 minutes, converting from close range after Asmir Begovic had spilled Danilo's shot, before Ilkay Gundogan got City's third from six yards from Leroy Sane's centre (79).

Bournemouth move down to ninth. Without the injured Sergio Aguero, City dominated the ball early on and should have been ahead through Gabriel Jesus, but his effort on the stretch at the far stick from Sane went inches wide of Begovic's post. They did go ahead a few minutes later as Oleksandr Zinchenko's fine ball in behind found Sane in the box, and despite Begovic getting there first to palm away, Silva was on hand to shoot through a crowded box and into the net. Wilson should have levelled just before his opener, failing to get onto Josh King's superb ball into the box on the stretch, but he did get his eighth of the season with a brilliant header from Simon Francis' cross a minute before the break. Team news With midweek in mind, Manchester City made five changes. Danilo, Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, Jesus and Otamendi came in, replacing Walker, Stones, David Silva, Mahrez and Aguero. Aguero didn't make the matchday 18 for Pep Guardiola's side. There were three changes for Bournemouth; Gosling, Lerma and Brooks came out, replaced by Lewis Cook, Tyrone Mings and Andrew Surman. Raheem Sterling scores Manchester City's second against Bournemouth Sterling impressed again at the Etihad, skipping past five Bournemouth players before seeing his deflected shot come off the post, but minutes later he scored his ninth goal of the season, slamming home from close range after Begovic had spilled Danilo's fierce, low shot from the right of the box. Fernandinho then placed a left-footed shot just wide of the left-hand post from the right of the area, while at the other end Wilson nearly squeezed home another leveller from Steve Cook's dangerous long throw. But after Bourmemouth had a strong penalty appeal turned down by Stuart Attwell for Fernandinho's shove on Mings, City got their two-goal cushion with 11 minutes remaining. Man of the match Sane, who caused Bournemouth's defence issues all afternoon, burst free down the left, before crossing low at the byline for Gundogan to convert simply from point-blank range. Callum Wilson celebrates equalising against Manchester City The pundit - Phil Thompson \"It was flat in the first half, although it was no real surprise that it was Raheem Sterling who got things going for them. And in the second half, Sterling was truly brilliant. He was absolutely terrific and he got his usual goal as well.\" The managers Pep Guardiola: \"In the first half it was flat, a lack of rhythm. We are good when we're playing one way, the other way everyone can beat us. But in the second half the action from Raheem and Fabian Delph helped us to take our rhythm, and the second half was much better.\" 2:52 Pep Guardiola admits Manchester City started slowly Pep Guardiola admits Manchester City started slowly Eddie Howe: \"We had moments and unfortunately for us the three goals we conceded were out of context with the game and were scrappy. They weren't goals where they cut through us with beautiful football and you kick yourself for that.\" 1:52 Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe rued his side's luck Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe rued his side's luck Opta stats Manchester City have won all seven Premier League matches against Bournemouth, scoring 24 goals and conceding only three. Bournemouth are yet to win a league match against Manchester City - in 13 meetings, they've drawn twice and lost 11. Manchester City have now gone 20 games unbeaten in the Premier League (W17 D3), since a 2-3 defeat against Manchester United in April. After losing two of their opening 10 league games this season (W6 D2), Bournemouth have lost each of their last four. Since the start of last season, Man City's Leroy Sane has provided more assists in the Premier League than any other player (20). Man of the match - Leroy Sane City exploited space behind Bournemouth's defence on the right from start to finish, and Sane, as ever, was the main outlet. He made three key passes, more than any other player, and was a constant threat to Steve Cook and Simon Francis. They'll be having nightmares for days after a relentless 90 minutes. What's next? Manchester City go to Watford on Tuesday night in the Premier League, while Bournemouth are at home to Huddersfield, also on Tuesday night."},{"date": "01/12/2019", "arena": "St James' Park,

Hernandez, starting for the first time in a month, put the Hammers ahead after 11 minutes when he finished from Robert Snodgrass' cross. The visitors spurned several chances to add to their lead before Hernandez made it 2-0 in the 63rd minute. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (5), Yedlin (5), Fernandez (5), Schar (5), Manquillo (5), Ki (5), Diame (5), Ritchie (5), Kenedy (5), Rondon (5), Perez (5) Subs: Atsu (5), Shelvey (5), Joselu (5) West Ham: Fabianski (6), Cresswell (6), Balbuena (7), Diop (7), Zabaleta (7),Noble (7), Rice (7), Snodgrass (7), Anderson (8), Arnautovic (6), Hernandez (8) Subs: Masuaku (5), Obiang (5), Wilshere (5) Man of the match: Felipe Anderson Newcastle were largely lacklustre in their hunt for a fourth straight Premier League win and Felipe Anderson's injury-time goal did not flatter the Hammers. This was the best performance in a while from Manuel Pellegrini's side, who showed greater quality in attack to secure only their second win since the start of October. Those Newcastle fans who took part in an 11th-minute \"walk-in\" protest against owner Mike Ashley arrived into the ground just in time to see West Ham take the lead. Newcastle's DeAndre Yedlin is challenged by Marko Arnautovic Snodgrass curled in a fine cross from the right and Hernandez ran behind a static defence to finish from close range. West Ham looked threatening on the break and Marko Arnautovic couldn't finish from a tight angle after taking the ball around Martin Dubravka from Anderson's through pass. Ayoze Perez had Newcastle's best chance of the first half in the 26th minute when he headed over from close range. Javier Hernandez celebrates his first goal for West Ham Perez dragged a shot wide later in the half while Salomon Rondon saw an effort brilliantly blocked by a sliding Pablo Zabaleta. Rondon also headed over from a corner in the 53rd minute, but it was downhill for Newcastle from there. Hernandez wasted two good chances to score, failing to connect with a cross from Arnautovic before firing into the side-netting when he only had Dubravka to beat. Team news Newcastle made one change from their win over Burnley as Manquillo replaced Clark. West Ham made four changes as Cresswell, Noble, Snodgrass and Hernandez replaced Masuaku, Obiang, Diangana and Antonio. Former Newcastle striker Carroll started on the bench along with Wilshere. However, the striker made amends in the 63rd minute as he slipped a low shot past the goalkeeper from Arnautovic's header over the top of the defence. Anderson was then denied by Dubravka but, after Newcastle failed to mount any sort of comeback, the Brazilian made it 3-0 in injury-time when he bundled past Fabian Schar and fired home. Opta stats Newcastle have lost their first Premier League game against West Ham since September 2015, having won three on the bounce against the Hammers prior to today. West Ham recorded their biggest Premier League victory against Newcastle at St James' Park since October 1998 (also 3-0). Newcastle have lost six of their opening eight Premier League games at St. James' Park this season (W2) - the Magpies last suffered as many defeats in their opening eight home league games of a season during the 1953/54 campaign (P8 W2 D0 L6). West Ham have kept their first away clean sheet of the season and their first on the road in the competition since their final away game of the 2017/18 campaign against Leicester (2-0). West Ham's Felipe Anderson has scored four goals in his last four Premier League games having netted just one in his opening 10 appearances in the competition for the Hammers. West Ham striker Javier Hernandez's brace was his first in the Premier League since August 2017 in a 2-3 defeat against Southampton. West Ham's Javier Hernandez has scored 48 Premier League goals with all of those strikes coming from inside of the box - only Tim Cahill (56) has scored more goals in the competition with 100% of them coming from inside of the box. Man of the match - Felipe Anderson Hernandez might have outscored Anderson, but the Brazilian produced an excellent all-around display. He was dangerous on the break, finished with the highest passing accuracy of any West Ham player who started the game and was deserving of his late goal. Pundit verdict - Matt Le Tissier \"To be fair, in the first half Newcastle created many more chances than West Ham, so they were lucky to go in 1-0 up at the break. But after Hernandez made it 2-0, Newcastle's heads dropped and the wind was really taken out of their sails. \"And it did not look like they believed they could get back in the game. And then it was all killed off in the final few minutes.\" What's next? Newcastle travel to Everton on Wednesday before a home game against Wolves next Sunday, live on Sky Sports. West Ham are at home against Cardiff on Tuesday and against Crystal Palace on Saturday."},{"date": "01/12/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30187, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton",

Manchester Utd's 2-2 draw with Southampton in the Premier League Manchester United fought back from two goals down to secure a point but their Premier League struggles continued with a 2-2 draw at Southampton. All the goals came in the first half at St Mary's and it was Southampton who raced into an early two-goal lead thanks to Stuart Armstrong's third goal in two games (13) and a stunning free-kick from Cedric Soares (20). United, who started with Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic in a back three alongside Phil Jones, put a lacklustre opening behind them with two goals in six minutes as Romelu Lukaku (33) and Ander Herrera (39) brought Jose Mourinho's side level, but they could not find a winner in what was a poor second half. Southampton held on for what could prove to be a valuable point to move up to 18th in the league and ease the pressure on manager Mark Hughes, while a point takes United - who are without a win in three Premier League games for the first time since December 2017 - up to seventh.

Man of the match: Nathan Redmond Hughes urged his side to be positive against United ahead of kick-off and his players took his advice on board as Armstrong drilled a powerful effort past David de Gea and into the far corner after being played in by Michael Obafemi. The hosts extended their advantage in the 20th minute, following Marcus Rashford's foul on Mario Lemina, Cedric striking an inch-perfect free-kick over the wall and into the top corner. Southampton's celebrations were dampened slightly when Lukaku raced onto Rashford's through ball before confidently thumping the ball into the top corner for his first goal for the club since September 15. Romelu Lukaku scores for Manchester United Six minutes later and United were back on level terms. Rashford did well to get to the byline before pulling the ball back for Herrera, whose flick found its way past Alex McCarthy at the near post. The momentum had swung back in United's favour after Mourinho's men hauled themselves back into the game, but after the interval they failed to kick on and up the tempo again. Marouane Fellaini headed wide after meeting Ashley Young's free-kick and Luke Shaw shot wide from the edge of the box but the visitors struggled to create any clear-cut opportunities to score a winner. Team news Southampton made two changes from the midweek Carabao Cup match against Leicester. Alex McCarthy returned in goal in place of Angus Gunn, while Cedric Soares replaced Matt Targett. Yan Valery made his Premier League debut, while Michael Obafemi made his first league start. Manchester United made five changes from their last-gasp Champions League win over Young Boys in midweek. Ashley Young, Scott McTominay, Ander Herrera, Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku all came into the starting line-up. Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and Fred all dropped down to the bench. Antonio Valencia and Chris Smalling dropped out of the squad. Mourinho threw on Anthony Martial in search of a third in the 77th minute but, with time running out, Southampton looked to be finishing the game the stronger of the two sides. Armstrong nodded just wide from Redmond's drilled corner, while De Gea had to be alert to keep out long-range efforts from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Redmond after Paul Pogba had inexplicably passed the ball straight to the hosts. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho during his side's 2-2 draw with Southampton Opta stats Southampton have won just one of their last 15 Premier League matches (D6 L8), winning only against Crystal Palace in September. Man Utd are without a win in three Premier League games for the first time since December 2017 (D2 L1) - the third game in both runs came against Southampton. Southampton remain the only team in the Premier League yet to win a home game this season (D5 L2). Mark Hughes has won just three of his last 25 Premier League games as a manager in the competition (W3 D9 L13). Cedric Soares is the seventh player to score a direct free-kick for Southampton in the Premier League and first since James Ward-Prowse vs West Brom in February 2018. Cedric Soares' free-kick doubled Southampton's lead at 20 minutes Romelu Lukaku's strike vs Southampton has ended a run of 12 games and 981 minutes without a goal for Manchester United in all competitions since netting against Watford in September. No player has scored more goals against Southampton in the top-flight at St. Mary's than Man Utd's Romelu Lukaku (5 - level with Olivier Giroud and Robin van Persie). Marcus Rashford has provided two assists in a single game in all competitions for Man Utd for just the second time in his career (also vs Crystal Palace in September 2017). Man of the Match - Nathan Redmond Redmond put in an excellent shift for Southampton and his pace kept United honest. Nathan Redmond gets a shot away during Southampton's 2-2 draw with Man Utd He played a part in Southampton's opener, dribbling through a number of challenges before Obafemi's pass released Armstrong. And he nearly won it for his side late on, pouncing on Pogba's error in midfield before forcing De Gea into action with a powerful strike from distance. What's next? Southampton are back in action on Wednesday when they travel to Wembley to face Tottenham in the Premier League (8pm). Manchester United are also back in Premier League action on Wednesday and face a tough test against Arsenal at Old Trafford (8pm)."},{"date": "30/11/2019", "arena": "Cardiff City Stadium", "attendance": 30213, "home_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sol Bamba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aron Gunnarsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["76"]}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Paterson", "yellows": ["71"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["66"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Lee Peltier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Smithies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["66"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Mendez-Laing", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kadeem Harris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["76"], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui Patrício", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romain Saiss", "yellows": ["66"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Conor Coady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Boly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Doherty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "João Moutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rúben Neves", "yellows": ["61"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Vinagre", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["82"]}, {"name": "Raúl Jiménez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hélder Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["66"]}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["73"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ivan Cavaleiro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["82"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Gibbs-White", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["73"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diogo Jota", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["66"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Giles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leo Bonatini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:48 Cardiff 2-1 Wolves Cardiff 2-1 Wolves Junior Hoilett's breathtaking strike saw Cardiff come from behind to beat Wolves 2-1 at the Cardiff City Stadium. Matt Doherty's close-range finish put Wolves ahead after 18 minutes, the Republic of Ireland international's second goal of the season coming on his 200th appearance for the club. However, Aron Gunnarsson's scruffy effort levelled matters for Cardiff after 65 minutes, before Hoilett's stunning long-range curler turned the game on its head 12 minutes later. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (6), Ecuele Manga (6), Morrison (6), Bamba (8), Victor Camarasa (6), Gunnarsson (8), Ralls (7), Arter (8), Hoilett (9), Paterson (7), Josh Murphy (8) Subs: Reid (6) Harris (6) Wolves: Rui Patricio (6), Saiss (6), Coady (7), Boly (6), Doherty (7), Neves (6), Joao Moutinho (6), Ruben Vinagre (6), Helder Costa (5), Traore (5), Jimenez (5) Subs: Cavaleiro (6), Gibbs-White (6), Jota (7) Man of the match: Junior Hoilett The win sees Cardiff move out of the relegation zone after recording back-to-back top-flight home wins for the first time since 1961-62, while the visitors stay 11th after extending their winless league run to six games. Cardiff have struggled defending set pieces this season and their problems continued on Friday as the home defence failed to deal with Joao Moutinho's right-wing corner early on in the encounter. An early birthday present for Neil Warnock who turns 7️⃣0️⃣ tomorrow as his @CardiffCityFC side beat Wolves 2-1 🎁🎂🍾 They have now won 3️⃣ games after conceding 1st - more than any other side in the @premierleague this season pic.twitter.com/g0QDen0PEr — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) November 30, 2018 Raul Jimenez got in front of his marker at the near post to power a header goalwards, only for Neil Etheridge to deny the Mexico international with a brilliant reaction save low down to his right. Unluckily for the Cardiff goalkeeper, though, the ball fell straight at Doherty's feet, with the wing back making no mistake with a composed left-footed strike from four yards out, the seventh time the hosts have conceded from a set play in the league this campaign. Aron Gunnarsson equalises for Cardiff Neil Warnock's team were desperately close to going in at the break on level terms, however, after Joe Ralls' corner was not properly cleared, Harry Arter's effort curled against the post with Rui Patricio beaten. Arter also very nearly equalised just after the hour-mark, but his goalbound volley was deflected behind for a corner by Conor Coady on the line, from which the home side did deservedly score from. Team news Cardiff made two changes from their 1-0 loss at Everton last weekend with Junior Hoilett and Josh Murphy replacing Kadeem Harris and Greg Cunningham. Meanwhile, Wolves also made two alterations from the side that lost at home to Huddersfield last time out, with Romain Saiss coming in for Ryan Bennett at the back, while Adama Traore replaced Ivan Cavaleiro on the left of a front three. Again, that man Arter was involved as the resulting left-wing corner found its way through to the midfielder, lurking unmarked on the edge of the area. Arter's up and under then caused panic in the Wolves defence, allowing Gunnarsson to nip in to score his first Premier League goal for five years. And with 13 minutes to go, Cardiff took the lead in spectacular fashion as Ralls' inviting ball in from the left eventually fell to Hoilett on the left edge of the area. Junior Hoilett (right) tussles for the ball at the Cardiff City Stadium The Canadian, playing as a left wing back in a reshaped back line, still had to work to do to score, however, the 28-year-old managed to beat Patricio with a sublime strike that went in off the bar to hand Warnock the ideal 70th birthday present. Match stats This was the first time Wolves have lost a league game that they opened the scoring in since February 2017 (1-2 v Burton Albion), ending a run of 44 such games without defeat Cardiff have won three of the last four Premier League home games in which they've conceded the first goal (D1), coming back to win against Fulham (4-2), Brighton (2-1) and Wolves (2-1) Cardiff have picked up nine of their 11 Premier League points this season from trailing positions, the joint-most in the division alongside Arsenal 91% of Cardiff's points in the Premier League this season have been won on home soil (10/11); the highest ratio in the competition Since the start of last season, Junior Hoilett has been directly involved in more league goals (21 - 10 goals, 11 assists) than any other Cardiff player Among defenders, only Jose Holebas (6) and Benjamin Mendy (5) have been directly involved in more Premier League goals than Wolves' Matt Doherty this season (4 - two goals, two assists) Cardiff have now conceded a joint-PL high 7️⃣ goals from set-pieces this season (joint-most with Newcastle) after Matt Doherty puts Wolves ahead on his 2️⃣0️⃣0️⃣th app for the club. pic.twitter.com/jahqDscb36 — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) November 30, 2018 Managers Neil Warnock: \"I was really proud of them tonight. We were 1-0 down at half-time - I didn't think we deserved to be, but that's how it was. I thought, second half, we were on the front foot, most of the time, really. \"Gunnars [Aron Gunnarsson] knows he made a mistake; we'd just told him about Doherty pulling off and making sure to get the second ball but he's apologised. I thought, second half, we had some good opportunities. Yes, we could get caught on the break but I thought we wanted it more tonight.\" 2:37 Neil Warnock was full of praise for his Cardiff side after they came from behind to beat Wolves 2-1 in the Premier League Neil Warnock was full of praise for his Cardiff side after they came from behind to beat Wolves 2-1 in the Premier League Nuno Espirito Santo: \"I'm cautious of the moment we have now, it's a lot of games without a win, and knowing there's only one way - stick together and work harder. \"You can't buy confidence, but I think we were better than last weekend, I thought we were in control of it and there weren't many chances for them - although set pieces were always a problem. \"The first goal is too easy the way they scored. After that, it became very difficult. It's hard when you have the lead and lose the game. Usually it's one of the things that we preserve well, but we had chances to come out and our first pass was poor. We needed more possession.\" 2:39 Nuno Espirito Santo said his side need to control the ball and manage the game better after they surrendered a lead and fell to defeat at Cardiff Nuno Espirito Santo said his side need to control the ball and manage the game better after they surrendered a lead and fell to defeat at Cardiff Man of the Match - Junior Hoilett Warnock admitted after the game that he had had a sleepless night on Thursday having decided to utilise Hoilett in an unfamiliar wing-back role against Wolves. However, the Cardiff boss need not have worried as the versatile Canada international's brilliant late goal gave his side all three points in South Wales. And what's more, it was the player's first Premier League goal for a whole six years in what was also his 50th appearance for Cardiff at home.

The Magpies had not tasted victory on Monday night on Sky Sports since 2012 but a Ben Mee own goal and Ciaran Clark header inside the opening 23 minutes set them on their way to victory. After Sam Vokes halved the deficit before half-time with a 16-yard header, Newcastle spurned two glorious chances to restore their two-goal lead as Matt Ritchie produced a miss-of-the-season contender before substitute Joselu struck the post. But Newcastle withstood a late onslaught to secure a third consecutive victory - their first away from home since April 7 - that lifts them up to 13th in the table, four points clear of the relegation zone, while Burnley remain 17th, a point above the bottom three. Player ratings Burnley: Hart (6), Lowton (5), Mee (5), Long (5), Taylor (5), Lennon (5), Defour (5), Cork (6), Brady (5), Vokes (6), Wood (5). Subs: Barnes (n/a), Hendrick (n/a).

Subs: Joselu (5), Hayden (n/a) Man of the Match: Federico Fernandez. Kick-off at Turf Moor was delayed by 30 minutes after the referee's assessor collapsed in the players' tunnel. Eddie Wolstenholme was taken to hospital conscious, but referee Anthony Taylor and the two clubs decided to delay the start after the emergency. When the two sides eventually emerged it was Newcastle that dealt with the setback better as they raced into an early lead, Federico Fernandez's curling strike from the edge of the area looping over Joe Hart via an unfortunate deflection off Mee. Burnley reacted well to falling behind as Chris Wood registered their first shot on target with a swerving effort from distance that was saved by the face of Martin Dubravka. Federico Fernandez's shot deflected in off Ben Mee as Newcastle took an early lead Newcastle doubled their advantage a minute later when Ritchie's whipped cross from a well-worked short corner was glanced in by Clark after 23 minutes. Kenedy lashed a shot wide from the edge of the box as Newcastle looked the greater threat in front of goal, but a moment of brilliance saw Burnley end a testing half on a high. Mee's long diagonal was met with force on the edge of the area by Vokes who looped a header over the poorly positioned Dubravka to half the deficit. Sam Vokes celebrates after reducing the arrears for Burnley at Turf Moor A frantic finale ensued as another long ball forward was knocked down by Vokes into the path of strike partner Wood, who saw a powerful near-post drive tipped over by Dubravka as Newcastle clung onto the lead. Newcastle should have restored their two-goal lead within four minutes of the restart when DeAndre Yedlin pounced on a loose ball and poked a cross towards Ritchie, via Hart's fingertips, at the back post but the midfielder inexcusably missed the open goal from two yards to let Burnley off the hook. Team news Sean Dyche and Rafa Benitez made a change apiece as Robbie Brady replaced Johann Berg Gudmundsson for Burnley and Ciaran Clark came in for Paul Dummett in the Newcastle defence. Wood should have punished Ritchie's howler but failed to convert three presentable chances as he shot straight at Dubravka, was denied by a last-gasp Yedlin block and blazed an Aaron Lennon cross over from 12 yards during seven frenetic second-half minutes. Newcastle failed to put the game to bed on 80 minutes as a flowing counter released Joselu, who saw a shot cannon off the frame of the Burnley goal, but it proved immaterial as Vokes headed over in stoppage-time as the Clarets' last chance to snatch a point evaporated. during the Premier League match between Burnley FC and Newcastle United at Turf Moor on November 26, 2018 in Burnley, United Kingdom. Opta stats Burnley have won just one of their last nine Premier League home games (D2 L6). Newcastle enjoyed their first win in their last 11 Premier League games played on a Monday night. 54.5 per cent of Newcastle's Premier League goals this season have been headers (6/11), a league-high proportion. Newcastle United's opener against Burnley on 3 minutes 35 seconds was their earliest away Premier League goal since Yohan Cabaye scored against Sunderland in October 2012 (2:10). Since the start of 2016-17, only Lewis Dunk (4) has scored more own-goals in the Premier League than Burnley's Ben Mee (3, level with Ryan Shawcross). Newcastle's Ciaran Clark has bagged two goals in his last four Premier League appearances, as many as he managed in his previous 25. Matt Ritchie has registered 14 league assists for Newcastle United since joining the Magpies ahead of 2016-17, more than any other player for the club. Burnley's Sam Vokes' goal was scored from 17.65 yards out, the furthest distance for a headed Premier League goal since Jamie Vardy for Leicester against Sunderland in August 2015 (18.03). The managers 2:46 Sean Dyche says he is very frustrated Burnley came away with nothing from their 2-1 defeat to Newcastle, but was pleased with a lot of aspects of their performance. Sean Dyche says he is very frustrated Burnley came away with nothing from their 2-1 defeat to Newcastle, but was pleased with a lot of aspects of their performance. Sean Dyche: \"There were some moments of real good play. Looking beyond the result, because it's a season's work, then we are starting to come back to what we think we can be. But of course, you've got to get a result, that's the business we are in. We have to earn the right, nobody gives you anything in football, we know that, performance levels aside.\" 5:13 Benitez: The players stuck to the plan Benitez: The players stuck to the plan Rafa Benitez: \"We had an idea how to play against a physical team that was strong. The effort and attitude of the players was great, they stuck to the game plan. The team are beginning to look like what we can be, but we have to get the right side of the margins because it is tight for teams like us. Landing on those right sides is so, so important.\" Man of the Match - Federico Fernandez The Argentinian was a force at the back for a Newcastle side that were made to dig deep for the victory after spurning a handful of chances at Turf Moor. The centre-back was unfortunate to have Newcastle's opener taken away from him after Mee's deflection but went on to excel at the heart of the Magpies' three-man defence with 82 touches and 69 passes, with an accuracy rate of 86.8 per cent. What's next? Both clubs are back in action in the Premier League on Saturday at 3pm, with Burnley travelling to Crystal Palace and Newcastle hosting West Ham at St James' Park."},{"date": "25/11/2019", "arena":

Bournemouth 1-2 Arsenal Bournemouth 1-2 Arsenal Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the winner as Arsenal claimed a first Premier League win in four games with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Bournemouth. Eddie Howe's side had recovered from Jefferson Lerma's remarkable own goal, the Colombian inadvertently volleying beyond his own goalkeeper from the edge of the box (30), as Josh King deservedly curled them level on the stroke of half-time (45+1). But the Gunners produced a belated moment of attacking quality midway through the second half when Alex Iwobi and Sead Kolasinac combined to afford Aubameyang a simple finish (67). Lerma almost atoned but cracked the post, while Bernd Leno made a leaping late save to preserve the fragile advantage and Gunners - now unbeaten in 17 games with a north London derby looming - held on to move to within a point of fourth-placed Chelsea. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (6), S Cook (7), Ake (6), Daniels (6), Brooks (7), Gosling (6), Lerma (5), Fraser (6), Wilson (7), King (7).

Subs: Guendouzi (6), Ramsey (n/a), Nketiah (n/a) Man of the match: Sead Kolasinac Aubameyang slides in to put Arsenal 2-1 up at Bournemouth Bournemouth have lost three in succession but they started and finished strongly, David Brooks gliding goalwards and slotting home (8), only to see the offside flag. Lucas Torreira clipped a post as the travelling fans sung his name before Aubameyang shanked behind at the back post, but Arsenal looked vulnerable in the channels with a less familiar back three. Team news Dan Gosling started his first Premier League game in two months, while Joshua King and Charlie Daniels also came in for Bournemouth. Unai Emery made two changes as Mesut Ozil was named on the bench and Alexandre Lacazette missed out (groin). The Gunners appeared to shift to a three-man defence as Sokratis Papastathopoulos came in, while Henrikh Mkhitaryan started in attack. Ryan Fraser forced a fine Leno save from a free-kick that was retaken - to Emery's annoyance - but Lerma soon gifted Arsenal the lead in bizarre fashion, sliding to intercept Kolasinac's cut-back but instead rifling beyond Asmir Begovic. Arsenal were now on top, Iwobi wasteful, but Fraser sparked a glorious home counter moments before the break and when Brooks laid into his path, King found the top corner without breaking stride. Josh King celebrates his equaliser for Bournemouth at home to Arsenal Emery's side enjoyed prolonged possession after the restart but though they had struggled for attacking fluency against committed hosts, Iwobi's slide-rule pass suddenly dissected opposition lines. Aubameyang had blazed over again just minutes earlier but the Gabon striker was afforded a tap-in at the far post when Kolasinac delivered the cross and Arsenal swagger was back again. A distraught Jefferson Lerma after his bizarre own goal put Arsenal ahead Bournemouth legs looked weary but a final push yielded a series of chances to hit back again, Junior Stanislas poised to meet Charlie Daniel's ball but scuffing a straight into Leno's hands. Lerma took aim with five minutes left, and Leno had to stretch when Sokratis dangerously stuck out a boot, but a second leveller proved elusive. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the winner for Arsenal at Bournemouth Man of the match - Sead Kolasinac Emery sprung a tactical surprise, starting with a three-man defence for the first time in the league, and though Wilson and Brooks exploited space in the early stages, Kolasinac provided plenty of his own threat as an attacking force. It was his ball from an advanced position that drew Lerma's dramatic intervention and he combined superbly with Iwobi for the matchwinner. Opta stats Arsenal have already won as many Premier League away games this season (4 of 6) as they did in the whole of the 2017-18 campaign (4 of 19). Bournemouth have lost back-to-back home games in the Premier League for the first time since August 2017, when they lost their first two of the 2017-18 campaign. Arsenal are one of only two teams still yet to lead at half time in a Premier League game this term (alongside Cardiff), however they have gone on to win eight of those 13 fixtures (D3 L2). Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in 23 goals in 26 appearances in the Premier League (18 goals, five assists). Bournemouth striker Josh King scored his 35th goal in the Premier League; 10 more than the player with the next-most for the Cherries (Callum Wilson, 25). What's next?

Highlights from Huddersfield's 2-0 win at Wolves in the Premier League. Aaron Mooy scored twice as Huddersfield surged off the bottom of the Premier League with a 2-0 victory over Wolves at Molineux. Aggressive without the ball and dangerous with it, Huddersfield looked far from a relegation-threatened side and they moved up six places to 14th thanks to two crisp finishes (6, 74) from their Australia star. After recent struggles on the road, this was Huddersfield's first away win of the campaign and just the third in their last 23 away days. It was just the second time in 23 games that David Wagner's men had scored twice in a single game and they could have had more against an out-of-sorts Wolves, who are now five without a win.

Erik Durm accelerated past Matt Doherty too easily on six minutes and his cross was caressed into the corner of the net by Mooy for his first goal in 29 Premier League games. Team news Both teams made one change from their previous Premier League encounter with Wolves bringing in Portuguese youngster Ruben Vinagre and Huddersfield replacing the injured Chris Lowe with Erik Durm. Huddersfield's midfield domination and energy should have yielded further rewards but Steve Mounie and Terence Kongolo both fluffed very promising headed chances. Adama Traore was called from the bench by Nuno Espirito Santo at the break and he injected spark and excitement into what had been a lifeless Wolves performance. His chipped cross on 57 minutes was headed towards goal by Raul Jimenez but somehow Philip Billing hooked the ball off the line. It was the first of a couple more openings for Jimenez, but the Wolves striker seemed to lack confidence with his final finish as Huddersfield hung in there. Just as Wagner's men were looking vulnerable, Mooy struck again to seal the points, taking aim with a 20-yard free-kick that skipped off the turf and flew into the net. \"Can we play you every week,\" the away fans sang. Wolves had no response. Man of the match: Aaron Mooy A monstrous display, especially when you consider he played 80 minutes for Australia on Tuesday. Wagner hailed him as \"extraordinary\" and it was hard to argue. Sublime in possession and energetic when pressing the life out of Wolves, the Australian added goals to his game to provide the visitors a deserving maximum points haul. The £10million spent by the club to secure his services from Manchester City in 2017 surely is the best bit of business the club has ever done. He's becoming legendary within the Terriers ranks. The managers 3:08 Nuno Espirito Santo was not impressed with Wolves’ performance in their 2-0 home defeat to Huddersfield, saying it might be the worst since he arrived Nuno Espirito Santo was not impressed with Wolves’ performance in their 2-0 home defeat to Huddersfield, saying it might be the worst since he arrived Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It was a bad performance. We played badly today and Huddersfield were the better team. It was not a good day for us and we didn't perform well. \"There were too many mistakes and there are things we have to improve.

We have shown good performances this season so far without enough goals and enough points but performance wise, this was more often very good. \"Today, the players got the reward and I'm so happy for them because they really deserve it. Apart from the two goals, we have another clean sheet which was important and we look very solid defensively as well.\" Opta stats There has not been a draw between Wolves and Huddersfield in any of the last 13 encounters in all competitions - two wins for Wolves, 11 for Huddersfield. Wolves have now lost each of their last three home league games, as many defeats as in their previous 30 such matches (P30 W19 D8 L3). Since their promotion to the Premier League, Huddersfield Town have lost just one of their seven meetings with newly-promoted sides, winning four and drawing three. Huddersfield Town have won an away Premier League match without conceding a goal for the first time since their first such match in the competition (3-0 v Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park).

Highlights from Brighton's 1-1 draw with Leicester in the Premier League. Substitute Jamie Vardy’s late penalty saved a point for Leicester as they overcame James Maddison’s first-half red card to draw 1-1 at Brighton. Glenn Murray's seventh Premier League goal of the season, on his 100th top-flight appearance, looked set for so long to give the hosts their third 1-0 home win of the campaign. But after Maddison's dismissal for two avoidable yellow cards, the introduction of Vardy changed the game and his strike 11 minutes from the end ensured a fair final result. Leicester are now unbeaten in four matches, while Brighton have at least ended a run of two successive defeats. Chris Hughton's side tested Leicester early on through Beram Kayal, whose tenacity and invention drew a decent Kasper Schmeichel save from just inside the area. Team news Brighton made four changes to the team which lost at Cardiff, with Pascal Gross, Bruno, Bernardo and Davy Propper coming in. Dale Stephens began a three-match suspension with Martin Montoya also out and Gaetan Bong and Solly March on the bench. Leicester had Jamie Vardy on the bench after a groin injury so he was replaced by Shinji Okazaki. amie Vardy fails to make the Leicester starting line-up, with a groin problem meaning he's only able to take a place among the substitutes instead and he's replaced in the first XI by Shinji Okazaki. James Maddison and Vicente Iborra also came in, with Wilfried Ndidi listed as a substitute and Rachid Ghezzai out altogether. Brighton's early possession paid off moments later, with Murray nodding in a simple opener after 15 minutes from Anthony Knockaert's corner ahead of Ben Chilwell and Shinji Okazaki. The away side's task soon became harder, with Maddison's booking for a clip of Knockaert's heels followed by another three minutes later for simulation under Shane Duffy's challenge. Glenn Murray gives Brighton the lead at the AMEX Stadium with a simple header With Leicester lacking a spark, Vardy was introduced in the early stages of the second half and swiftly gave them it as they suddenly displayed much more appetite in attack. Although chances were at a premium, their increased pressure eventually paid off 11 minutes from the end. Kayal survived suggestions of handball as he blocked Jonny Evans but in the aftermath, he took out Kelechi Iheanacho in the penalty area - with Vardy passing high into the net from the spot.

He gave Leicester presence up front, forced the home side into rushed decisions and ultimately scored the goal which saved a point with a fine, placed effort from the spot. If that groin injury was still troubling him in any way, it didn't show. Vardy's introduction changed the game and gave Leicester a deserved point after they struggled in the first half Opta stats Brighton have lost just one of their last nine home Premier League games (W4 D4). Since the start of last season, Leicester have both scored and conceded in a league-high 33 different Premier League games. Brighton's Glenn Murray made his 100th Premier League appearance today. At 35 years 60 days, he's the ninth oldest outfield player to reach the milestone in the competition. No English player has scored more goals in Europe's big five leagues this season than Brighton's Glenn Murray (7). Brighton defensive duo Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy both made their 50th Premier League appearances in this game, with only goalkeeper Mat Ryan (51) lining out more often for the club in the competition. Leicester have picked up four red cards in the Premier League this season, twice as many as any other side. Jamie Vardy ended a run of 468 Premier League minutes without scoring for Leicester, since netting another penalty against Newcastle in September. Since his Premier League debut in August 2014, Leicester's Jamie Vardy has scored 12 penalty goals, a figure only Sergio Aguero (17) and Harry Kane (16) can better in that period. What might VAR have changed? One key talking point came in the first half, when Pascal Gross broke clear only to be flagged offside and kept going anyway, rounding a half-hearted Kasper Schmeichel who already knew play had stopped and tapping in. Schmeichel wanted Gross booked for continuing after play had been stopped - but the whole scenario raised a perfectly valid point which might get lost given Leicester's late comeback was deserved. Replays showed Gross had been level with the last man when he was played in - and had he been allowed to continue and scored a minute or so before Maddison was then sent off, it might have made for a very different outcome. James Maddison was sent off for Leicester following two yellow cards in three minutes, the second for simulation What's next? Leicester play their rearranged EFL Cup tie at home to Southampton on Tuesday night, with Manchester City awaiting the winners in the last eight. Brighton wait a little longer for their next match, next Saturday's Premier League trip to Huddersfield."},{"date": "24/11/2019", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39139, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Jordan Pickford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Keane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yerry Mina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Digne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["73"]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["90+3"]}, {"name": "Bernard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["77"]}, {"name": "Richarlison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["90+3"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cenk Tosun", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["77"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dominic Calvert-Lewin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ademola Lookman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["73"], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Cardiff City", "lineup": [{"name": "Neil Etheridge", "yellows": ["43"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bruno Ecuele Manga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sol Bamba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Greg Cunningham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aron Gunnarsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kadeem Harris", "yellows": ["63"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["67"]}, {"name": "Victor Camarasa", "yellows": ["58"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["85"]}, {"name": "Joe Ralls", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["74"]}, {"name": "Callum Paterson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Lee Peltier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["85"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["67"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Smithies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bobby Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Hoilett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["74"], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:53 Everton 1-0 Cardiff Everton 1-0 Cardiff Gylfi Sigurdsson was the difference as Everton beat a resilient Cardiff side 1-0 at Goodison Park on Saturday to move sixth in the Premier League. The Iceland midfielder, ruled out of the international break through injury, broke the deadlock on the hour mark by tapping into an empty net after Theo Walcott's powerful shot cannoned off goalkeeper Neil Etheridge, as the Toffees sealed their fourth consecutive home victory. Marco Silva's men dominated both possession and chances but Cardiff defended well and had a late penalty appeal turned down after Greg Cunningham was brought down by Seamus Coleman 11 minutes from time. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates Everton's winner on 59 minutes The result moves Everton up to sixth in the Premier League while Cardiff remain 18th, just inside the relegation zone. The game started slowly, with Everton well in control and dominating possession, while Cardiff were happy to sit back. Neil Warnock's side defended well - Sol Bamba with some crucial interceptions and clearances - while counter-attacking with pace when possible.

The first real chance was a golden one, with Richarlison getting on the end of Sigurdsson's long-range free kick, but firing his header straight down the middle and into the hands of Etheridge, despite being completely unmarked inside the box. Everton then had another good opportunity right on the verge of half-time as Gomes burst down the left, beating Bruno Ecuele Manga, and hit a perfectly-timed low cross. It just needed someone to connect properly, but the ball bounced off Walcott's shin and out for a goal-kick. Joe Ralls and Idrissa Gueye in action at Goodison Park The second half started a lot brighter as Bernard found Sigurdsson with a perfect pass through the middle on 55 minutes, but the 29-year-old rounded Etheridge only for Bamba to clear off the line. Former Swansea man Sigurdsson then found the back of the net as Walcott burst into the box from the wing, forcing an excellent save from Etheridge, before tapping into an empty net. Team news Everton were unchanged from the team that drew with Chelsea last time out with Gylfi Sigurdsson and Andre Gomes fit to play despite being ruled out of international duty because of injuries. Loanee Kurt Zouma returned to the bench after being ineligible against his parent club. Cardiff made one change with Bournemouth loanee Harry Arter coming in for Josh Murphy in midfield. Captain Sean Morrison was okay to start despite suffering a broken nose against Brighton. Victor Camarasa tested Jordan Pickford from distance on 72 minutes before referee Paul Tierney denied the visitors a late penalty as Cunningham went down from a challenge by Coleman. Substitute Ademola Lookman could have killed the game eight minutes from time but Etheridge denied the England U21 international with a good save, while Callum Paterson's header in the 89th minute sailed over the crossbar from just a few yards out as Everton held on for all three points. Managers 2:36 Neil Warnock was left frustrated as Cardiff fell to defeat Neil Warnock was left frustrated as Cardiff fell to defeat Neil Warnock: \"Probably the most [disappointed] I've been away from home this year. We could have quite easily come away with a result, even at half time I said 'don't think about a point, let's try and win the game'. \"I can't fault the lads, they were super. Such fine margins. Before their goal, there was a foul. You can see the lad, holding his hands up to say he hasn't touched him, a clear sign that he has. \"The players have been fantastic for me. I can't fault them. It's frustrating because I know with two or three more players, if we had them in the summer, we could be far higher than this. We've still got an opportunity to prove the bookies wrong. \"It's not easy [bringing in new players], we're working on it now. We need three, maybe four. We are working on that, but it is easier said than done. The big teams have got 40, 50 million for a player. We're no way near that. We can't spend that kind of money.\" 3:14 Everton manager Marco Silva says his side showed maturity Everton manager Marco Silva says his side showed maturity Marco Silva: \"I'm really pleased. We keep taking good results, with a clean sheet, that is important. Nothing less than what we expected before the match, a tough match for sure. \"From set-pieces, throw-ins, they are really strong, so we did well. I think after 1-0, we should score the second, to be more comfortable but this is the Premier League. We were the better team on the pitch and deserved the three points. \"I know how important results are in football. It boosts our confidence. The players are working really hard. \"We change nothing [for the next few games]. We prepare the game in the same way. This is what you want to do, it is our way, and we change nothing.\" Man of the Match - Gylfi Sigurdsson Sigurdsson saw a shot cleared off the line before netting the winner Sigurdsson put in an excellent all-round performance, helping Everton break down a hard-working Cardiff defence. He produced the best chance of the first half when he found Richarlison completely unmarked from a long-range free kick, only for the Brazil international to fire his header straight into Etheridge's hands. Sigurdsson was then unlucky not to hand the Toffees the lead on 55 minutes, as Bamba cleared his shot off the line after he rounded the goalkeeper, but the Iceland star made sure of all three points when he found himself in the right place at the right time to slot into an empty net on the hour mark. Opta stats Everton are unbeaten in their last nine home top-flight games against Cardiff (W7 D2). Cardiff have scored fewer away goals than any other side in English league football this season (2). Cardiff have lost all 10 of their away Premier League games against the six sides to have been ever-present in the competition (Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Man Utd and Tottenham). Everton have lost just one of their last 10 home Premier League games (W6 D3). Everton had 71 per cent possession - their most in a Premier League game since February 2016 (76 per cent vs West Brom). Since the start of last season, Gylfi Sigurdsson has scored more goals in all competitions than any other Everton player (13). What's next?

edged a 3-2 thriller over Southampton at Craven Cottage. Fulham's defensive woes continued early on, as they went behind with just 18 minutes on the clock, after Stuart Armstrong finished well from just inside the box to score his first goal for Southampton. However, Ranieri's side kept battling away, and got themselves level with 33 minutes on the clock through Mitrovic - his first goal for 585 minutes of Premier League football - before Schurrle got on the end of a superb Ryan Sessegnon cross to turn the match on its head two minutes before half-time. The goals continued to flow, with Armstrong firing home an equaliser eight minutes after the break after some neat build-up play, but it was Mitrovic who decided the contest, brilliantly volleying the winner in the 63rd minute to get Ranieri up and running with three points, a victory that moves Fulham off the bottom into 19th, one point behind Saints in 17th. Player ratings Fulham: Rico (7), Christie (6), Mawson (6), Odoi (6), Le Marchand (6), Chambers (6), Sessegnon (8), Cairney (8), Seri (5), Schurrle (7), Mitrovic (8) Subs: Ayite (6), Johansen (6), Kamara (N/A). Southampton: McCarthy (6), Soares (6), Yoshida (6), Hoedt (5), Targett (6), Armstrong (8), Lemina (6), Hojbjerg (6), Redmond (5), Gabbiadini (5), Austin (5) Subs: Elyounoussi (6), Obafemi (6). Man of the match: Aleksandar Mitrovic Southampton were by far the better side in the opening exchanges, and really should have taken the lead as early as the sixth minute, but Manolo Gabbiadini fired straight at Fulham goalkeeper Sergio Rico, who was already on the floor, from point-blank range. Saints did not have to wait too much longer for their goal, though. A quick throw caught Fulham napping, Nathan Redmond clipped a cross to the back post, Maxime Le Marchand could only head clear as far as Armstrong, who took a touch past the defender before lashing the ball home. The goal jolted Fulham into life, as they started to chase everything down and put the pressure on Southampton, and soon enough they were level through Mitrovic. Tom Cairney spread the ball wide to Le Marchand, who curled a pinpoint cross onto the head of Mitrovic, who arched his back and diverted the header into the bottom corner. Team news Keen to laugh off his reputation for tinkering pre-match, Ranieri kept his word, and made just one change to the side beaten 2-0 at Liverpool last time out, with Jean Michael Seri in for André Frank Zambo Anguissa. For Saints, there was no Danny Ings, whose hamstring problem kept him out of the squad. Charlie Austin, likely still seething after his rather public frustration with the refereeing in Saints’s draw with Watford started. Matt Targett also came in for the suspended Ryan Bertrand. It was all Fulham for the rest of the first half, and they got their reward for their constant pressure with Sessegnon raising the roof with a superb assist. The young winger darted through two defenders before firing a sublime cross into the path of Schurrle who steered the ball into the net to put Fulham in front. The Premier League's most porous defence continued to look vulnerable, though, and soon enough Armstrong had breached it once more. The back heel from Cedric Soares was perfect for the onrushing Armstrong, who used the side of his boot to arrow the ball past the despairing dive of Rico in the home goal. Mitrovic's second was worthy of winning any game. Sessegnon again with the assist, but all the credit this time went to Mitrovic, who brilliantly controlled the volley into the net. Fulham were forced to hang on for dear life at the end, with Rico making two smart saves late on, but they hung on for only their second league win of the season. 1:47 Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri calls their 3-2 win over Southampton an important step for the players and the fans Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri calls their 3-2 win over Southampton an important step for the players and the fans Opta stats Fulham manager Claudio Ranieri has won his first league game in charge of a team in six of his last seven such attempts (L1). Mark Hughes has won just three of his 21 Premier League games in charge of Southampton (14.3 per cent), the worst win rate of any Saints manager in the competition (min. 20 games). Fulham striker Aleksandr Mitrovic has scored more headed goals than any other Premier League player this season (4). Fulham picked up their first Premier League win in 10 matches, losing seven of the previous nine (2). Fulham are without a clean sheet in their last 17 Premier League games, conceding at least twice in 15 of those. The Whites are the only side in the Premier League yet to keep a clean sheet in 2018-19. Mitrovic celebrates his equaliser Man of the match - Aleksandar Mitrovic The Serbia international has looked shorn of confidence of late, but when it comes to digging in, Mitrovic comes into his own. Both his goals were expertly taken, but made to look easy.

0 Crystal Palace Manchester Utd 0 - 0 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace missed a host of chances as they left Old Trafford with a point following a 0-0 draw with a lacklustre Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday. United were booed off at full time after Palace missed clear-cut opportunities in both halves; first, Patrick van Aanholt miscued an effort wide when one-on-one with David de Gea, while Andros Townsend did the same with 15 minutes remaining after breaking into the box. Both sides also had the ball in the net as Cheikhou Kouyate and Romelu Lukaku saw goals correctly ruled out for marginal offside decisions, and the game ended with Palace feeling like they should have left with three points. Anthony Martial in action with Aaron Wan-Bissaka Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Darmian (6), Lindelof (6), Smalling (6), Young (6), Matic (5), Pogba (5), Lingard (6), Mata (6), Martial (5), Lukaku (5) Subs: Fellaini (5), Rashford (5), Sanchez (5) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Wan Bissaka (6), Tomkins (8), Sakho (8), Van Aanholt (6), Kouyate (7), Milivojevic (6), McArthur (8), Townsend (6), Meyer (7), Zaha (7) Subs: Schlupp (NA), Ayew (NA) Man of the match: James Tomkins The result means United are seventh, 14 points off leaders Manchester City, while Palace are up to 15th, a point above the drop zone. Both sides had plenty of chances during a goalless first half, with the best arguably falling to the visitors. Returning to his former club, Wilfried Zaha saw a 25-yard effort whistle past De Gea's right-hand post, before Van Aanholt fluffed a right-footed shot wide from 12 yards, having been put through in acres of space by Zaha. Jesse Lingard then forced a fine save from Wayne Hennessey at the other end, and Palace would have gone into the half ahead but for a fine decision from the assistant referee, flagging Kouyate offside having forced home Luka Milivojevic's free-kick. The officials made another fine call after the break, this time flagging Lukaku for being inches offside as he turned home Ashley Young's parried shot, while Kouyate had a shot from range tipped away by De Gea, only for Townsend to see his rebound blocked too. Team news For United, Shaw was out, meaning Darmian came in, while Fellaini, Rashford and Herrera came out for Pogba, Mata and Lukaku, who returned after sitting on the bench in the last few games. Palace made just one change as Zaha, returning to face his old club, replaced Ayew. Luka Milivojevic fouls Jesse Lingard in the first half Palace should have won it through Townsend as he somehow piled his way through Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof and into the area, but he flashed the ball wide with on weaker right foot with just De Gea to beat. Paul Pogba was replaced with 20 minutes remaining as United pushed for a winner; Lukaku's header from a Matteo Darmian cross was well tipped away by Hennessey, and sub Marcus Rashford's shot was well blocked by James Tomkins. It ended in jeers from the home fans as United failed to turn their superior possession into chances, leaving them with an uphill task to make the top four. Opta stats Man Utd are unbeaten in their last 21 league meetings with Crystal Palace (W17 D4). This was Manchester United's 65th 0-0 draw in the Premier League - 31 per cent of them have come in the six seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson retired (20/65). Man Utd failed to score in a top-flight home meeting with Crystal Palace for the first time since October 1970 (0-1). This was Manchester United's first home Premier League clean sheet of the season, last keeping one at Old Trafford against Watford in May. Crystal Palace had 13 shots in this match, their most in an away Premier League game this season. However, just two of these were on target. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"[It's] a bad point. When the objective is to chase the top four and to close step by step the distance to these teams and you start that period of eight PL matches until the end of December, it's obviously a bad start. 2:31 Jose Mourinho praises Crystal Palace's defence but says their 0-0 draw was a 'bad point' Jose Mourinho praises Crystal Palace's defence but says their 0-0 draw was a 'bad point' \"We need to improve of course, I am disappointed with the performance. Again, you are right, it is not nice just to blame the team that is favourite in the game for not winning, it is also football to praise the opponent that came here and gave everything for that point. But we obviously have to do better. \" Roy Hodgson: \"When we defended well enough to win the ball back and break out, we broke out good. I thought we had quite a few opportunities where I'm sure Jose on the other bench would have been a bit worried. I'm very proud of the team's performance.\" 2:57 Roy Hodgson was proud of his Crystal Palace side Roy Hodgson was proud of his Crystal Palace side The pundit - Paul Merson \"Marouane Fellaini said before the match that United aren't far off the leaders, but not on this evidence. Palace were good, but Lukaku is working off chances like he's playing for a bottom-half team. \"Palace will come away feeling disappointed they haven't won the game. If they carry on playing like that, they'll be alright.\" Man of the match - James Tomkins Alongside partner Sakho, Tomkins was superb in dealing with United's attacking threat, particularly as the hosts went direct to Lukaku regularly. Tomkins made 10 clearances and four interceptions, more than any other player, as Palace got their first point at Old Trafford since 1989. What's next? United now host Young Boys in the Champions League on Tuesday night, before a trip to Southampton on Saturday in the Premier League at 5.30pm.

Henderson returned from injury as one of two changes made by Jurgen Klopp, but was given his marching orders in the 82nd minute after picking up a second yellow card, meaning he will be suspended for the game against Everton next Sunday, live on Sky Sports. But the Reds remain unbeaten in the league and kept a clean sheet, with Mohamed Salah (67) opening the scoring before Trent Alexander-Arnold (76) added the second with a wonderful free-kick. Roberto Firmino (89) scored late on after a devastating Liverpool counter-attack, and it sees them keep pace at the top with Manchester City, who beat West Ham on Saturday, while Watford slip down to ninth place. Watford had the ball in the net inside three minutes but the goal was ruled out for offside. A long ball was touched on by Troy Deeney, allowing Gerard Deulofeu to race through but, as he slotted past Alisson, the offside flag was correctly raised. Player ratings Watford: Foster (7), Femenia (7), Mariappa (6), Cathcart (7), Masina (7), Doucoure (7), Hughes (6), Capoue (6), Pereyra (6), Deulofeu (7), Deeney (6). Subs used: Success (6), Gray (4). Liverpool: Alisson (6), Alexander-Arnold (7), Van Dijk (7), Lovren (7), Robertson (6), Wijnaldum (7), Henderson (5), Shaqiri (8), Firmino (7), Mane (7), Salah (7). Subs used: Milner (5), Fabinho (5), Matip (n/a). Man of the match: Xherdan Shaqiri. The game was meandering towards the break until a flurry of late efforts. It began in the 39th minute as Salah latched onto a loose ball and slotted it into the path of Firmino, but his shot - the first on target in the game - was saved by Ben Foster. Alisson was then called into action as Deulofeu played the ball across for Roberto Pereyra, but his curling effort was saved by the leaping Liverpool goalkeeper. Xherdan Shaqiri was superb for the Reds in the first half, and another wonderful ball into the area picked out Sadio Mane who poked the ball towards goal, but Foster turned it behind for a corner. Shaqiri's subsequent effort found an unmarked Salah by the back post, but the Watford stopper did well to save the Egyptian's header. Team news Watford made three changes with Adam Masina, Etienne Capoue and Troy Deeney back in the starting XI. Liverpool made two switches, welcoming Dejan Lovren and Jordan Henderson back into the side. Liverpool broke the deadlock in the 67th minute with another goal for Salah against Watford - his sixth in three games. Firmino slipped the ball to Mane down the left before he cut it back for Salah and the Egyptian then swept past Foster, who should have done better. But Foster could do nothing about Liverpool's wonderful second from Alexander-Arnold. The 20-year-old lined up a free kick in the 76th minute as Firmino was pulled down by Adrian Mariappa 30 yards out, and curled a beautiful effort into the top corner. Six minutes later, though, Liverpool were down to 10 men. Having been booked for a push on Isaac Success on the hour mark and a number of remonstrations with referee Jon Moss, Henderson was already on thin ice. But a foul on Etienne Capoue sealed his fate as he made his way down the tunnel before Moss could get the card out of his pocket. Jordan Henderson was sent off and will miss the Merseyside derby next weekend Watford looked to take advantage of their extra man but it proved to be their undoing for the third goal as Liverpool hit them on the break. Andrew Robertson strode down the left flank before cutting the ball into the area for Mane, whose shot was saved by Foster, but the rebound was nodded home by Firmino. Opta stats Watford have lost three of their last four home top-flight games (W1), as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 15 at Vicarage Road in the Premier League (W8 D4). Liverpool are unbeaten in their opening 13 matches of a Premier League season for the first time since 2007-08. Watford have lost 16 of their 18 Premier League matches against sides starting that day in the top two of the table, beating Chelsea in September 1999 and Arsenal in January 2017. Liverpool defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has registered goal involvements in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time, assisting against Fulham before scoring against Watford. The managers 2:26 Javi Gracia says playing against Liverpool is demanding after his Watford side were beaten by three second half goals Javi Gracia says playing against Liverpool is demanding after his Watford side were beaten by three second half goals Javi Gracia: \"In the second half, they scored and I think the match was closer than the scoreline but we accept and continue. I think we played well for 65 minutes with good defensive work. Maybe we could improve our attack, but playing against Liverpool is difficult and demanding but we tried.\" 4:07 After winning 3-0 at Watford, Jurgen Klopp calls Liverpool's performance perfect and special After winning 3-0 at Watford, Jurgen Klopp calls Liverpool's performance perfect and special Jurgen Klopp: \"The performance was really good and result was perfect. Winning 3-0 at Watford is unbelievably difficult. We lost here in my first season so to win here is really special... It is one of the biggest wins in the season so far because the way of Watford is really special.\" The pundit Matt Le Tissier: \"I thought Liverpool were the better side and I thought Watford negated them in the first half without throwing too much forward, but once the first goal went in, Liverpool took control and the second was just a stunner, it was absolutely outstanding. \"Teams are less willing to open up against Liverpool given what they were doing to teams last season, but they still managed to sneak another goal after having a man sent off. Early on, they did threaten a little bit, but they didn't come out the moment Liverpool got a foothold in the game.\" Man of the match - Xherdan Shaqiri Mohamed Salah scored his sixth goal in three games against Watford Shaqiri continues to show he is a bargain buy for Liverpool and was superb in a first half that lacked much attacking threat. He continued to put cross after cross into the area - most of them of real quality - but they could not be converted. Watford clearly wanted to nullify his threat in the second half as he was much quieter but still had moments of quality when on the ball and his performance certainly should have been rewarded with a goal or assist. But it is the result that counts, and Shaqiri must be at the forefront of Klopp's thinking for two huge games on the horizon. What's next? Watford are in Premier League action next Saturday when they host Leicester, while Liverpool have two huge games coming up. The first is on Wednesday against PSG in the Champions League before hosting Everton in the Merseyside derby on Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League."},{"date": "24/11/2019", "arena": "London

to a 4-0 win against West Ham to stay top of the Premier League and keep their unbeaten start intact. Pep Guardiola's team put in a ruthless display at the London Stadium and victory was as good as confirmed in the first half thanks to strikes from David Silva (11), Raheem Sterling (19) and Leroy Sane (34). Sane (90+3) rounded off an emphatic victory deep into stoppage time as City, who made it eight wins out of eight in all competitions, stayed two points clear of Liverpool, who beat Watford 3-0 at Vicarage Road, at the top of the Premier League. For Manuel Pellegrini, his first meeting against his former side did not go to plan as West Ham stay 13th, four points ahead of the relegation zone. Silva sent City on their way with his fourth goal in as many games as Sterling's cross deflected off Arthur Masuaku and into the path of the Spaniard, who had a simple finish to beat Lukasz Fabianski from close range. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (7), Zabaleta (6), Balbuena (6), Diop (7), Masuaku (4), Obiang (6), Rice (7), Diangana (6), Anderson (6), Arnautovic (7), Antonio (7). Subs: Cresswell (7), Hernandez (6), Perez (5). Manchester City: Ederson (7), Walker (7), Otamendi (7), Laporte (7), Delph (7), Fernandinho (7), Gundogan (7), Silva (8), Sane (8), Aguero (6), Sterling (7). Subs: Foden (6), Mahrez (6), Jesus (6). Man of the match: Leroy Sane. West Ham did threaten in attack but they lacked a cutting edge in front of goal as Marko Arnautovic and Michail Antonio wasted two good opportunities. They were made to pay when Sane burst past Pablo Zabaleta before driving the ball across goal for Sterling to tap in from close range. David Silva puts Manchester City ahead at West Ham Sane himself added the third after being picked out by Sterling's cross. The German showed great composure in front of goal, feinting to shoot to take Fabian Balbuena out of the game before beating Fabianski from close range. Sterling went close to adding his second of the afternoon shortly after the break but Fabianski produced a fine block to deny the England international. Team news Manuel Pellegrini made two changes from the West Ham side that drew 1-1 at Huddersfield.Arthur Masuaku came in for the Aaron Cresswell while Michail Antonio replaced the suspended Robert Snodgrass. Andy Carroll was named on the bench after returning from injury but there was no place for Jack Wilshere. Pep Guardiola made four changes from the Man City side that beat Manchester United 3-1 before the international break. John Stones and Riyad Mahrez dropped to the bench, while Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva weren’t in the matchday squad. They were replaced in the starting line-up by Nicolas Otamendi, Fabian Delph, Ilkay Gundogan and Leroy Sane. At the other end, West Ham's poor finishing continued as Antonio, who was sent clean through by substitute Javier Hernandez, saw his shot clip the outside of the post. There were worrying signs for West Ham as Arnautovic limped off in injury time, leaving West Ham a man short for the final few minutes. And there was still time for City, who have now scored 17 goals in only four visits to Stratford, to add a fourth, Sane striking from close range to round off another comprehensive win in east London. 4 – Man City are only the second team to score 4+ goals in three consecutive @premierleague away games against the same opponent, after Chelsea at Bolton (2009-2011). Rampant. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 24, 2018 Opta stats Manchester City became the second non-London club to win six consecutive top-flight games in the capital after Portsmouth did so between 1950 and 1951. West Ham have lost all four of their meetings with Man City at the London Stadium in all competitions, scoring just once and conceding 17. Man City are only the second team to score 4+ goals in three consecutive Premier League away games against the same opponent, after Chelsea at Bolton (2009-2011). Guardiola's side are unbeaten in their last 19 Premier League games (W16 D3), conceding just eight goals in this run. Sterling has had a hand in more Premier League goals at the London Stadium than any other visiting player (6 - 1 goal, 5 assists). Silva has been involved in more goals against West Ham in all competitions than he has against any other opponent for the club (10 - 6 goals, 4 assists). Silva has scored in four consecutive competitive appearances for Man City for the first time. Managers Manuel Pellegrini: \"I'm happy with a lot of things but very disappointed with the result. Not because we lost 4-0 against Man City because you can lose against them, but the goals they scored are not acceptable. When you concede four goals you cannot win a game but we had as many chances as they had. We played in a way I think this time must continue to play in in every single game.\" 3:05 West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini says he was pleased that his side expressed themselves despite their 4-0 home defeat to Manchester City in the Premier League. West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini says he was pleased that his side expressed themselves despite their 4-0 home defeat to Manchester City in the Premier League. Pep Guardiola: \"We are delighted because after the international break that is a typical game. You can drop point after the international break for sure because the players train in another way, in another style and with another manager. They came back not at the same level as we normally have and that's why I'm so satisfied for the victory but the performance could be better.\" 2:36 Pep Guardiola says his Manchester City side were a bit fortunate to win 4-0 at West Ham. Pep Guardiola says his Manchester City side were a bit fortunate to win 4-0 at West Ham. Man of the match - Leroy Sane Leroy Sane celebrates scoring Manchester City's third goal with Kyle Walker Sane continued his fine form with another brilliant performance for Manchester City. The German returned from the international break full of confidence after scoring his first goal for his country in Germany's 3-0 win over Russia and he grabbed his second in the 2-2 draw with the Netherlands a few days later. And he picked up in the Premier League where he'd left off on the international stage, scoring twice and setting up Sterling for City's second in what was a scintillating display. What's next? Manchester City travel to Lyon in the Champions League on Tuesday (8pm) before hosting Bournemouth in the Premier League next Saturday (3pm). West Ham are back in action next Saturday when they travel to St James' Park to face Newcastle in the Premier League (3pm)."},{"date": "24/11/2019", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 55465, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Aurier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Foyth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["87"]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["78"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["87"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["78"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker-Peters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Llorente", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Moura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Kepa Arrizabalaga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Rüdiger", "yellows": ["19"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Luiz", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jorginho", "yellows": ["72"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mateo Kovacic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["58"]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["76"]}, {"name": "Álvaro Morata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["58"]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": ["45+3"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["58"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["58"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["76"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Davide Zappacosta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Christensen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:51 Highlights from Tottenham's 3-1 win over Chelsea in the Premier League. Highlights from Tottenham's 3-1 win over Chelsea in the Premier League. Spurs ruthlessly ended Maurizio Sarri's 18-game unbeaten start as Chelsea manager with an impressive 3-1 win at Wembley. An early header from Dele Alli (8) and a 25-yarder from Harry Kane (16) set them on their way, although Chelsea were denied a penalty prior to the hosts' second goal when Eden Hazard was pushed over by Juan Foyth inside the area. Chelsea briefly threatened a second-half recovery, but it never materialised. A stunning solo goal from Heung-min Son (54), embarrassing David Luiz in the process, put the London derby beyond Sarri's men despite Olivier Giroud's late header (85). Spurs' win takes them above Chelsea into third, and five points off Premier League leaders Manchester City. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Aurier (6), Alderweireld (7), Foyth (6), Davies (8), Sissoko (7), Dier (7), Eriksen (9), Alli (8), Son (8), Kane (8). Subs: Lamela (6), Winks (n/a). Chelsea: Kepa (7), Azpilicueta (5), Rudiger (4), Luiz (3), Alonso (5), Jorginho (4), Kante (5), Kovacic (4), Willian (6), Morata (5), Hazard (6). Subs: Pedro (6), Barkley (7), Giroud (7). Man of the match: Christian Eriksen Sarri had mentioned before the match his concern about Chelsea's poor performances in the opening 15 minutes of games, and the Blues' start would have done little to allay his fears. Tottenham flew out of the blocks and scored with eight minutes gone when Alli met Christian Eriksen's free-kick at the near post with a glancing header which Kepa's palmed save should have kept out. Son should have made it two almost immediately when his one-two with Eriksen was played back into his path with a beautiful lofted through-ball from the midfielder, but he blasted over when clean through. Chelsea had some strong claims for a penalty moments later when Hazard was shoved by Foyth inside Spurs' penalty area, but Martin Atkinson waved play on. Team news Tottenham named four new faces from the 1-0 win over Palace a fortnight ago. Christian Eriksen and Heung-min Son returned, with Eric Dier in for Victor Wanyama and Serge Aurier for the injured Kieran Trippier. Maurizio Sarri opted against making any Chelsea changes on the back of their unbeaten start. Their frustration would not be helped by Spurs' second, forged when Kane spotted a gap inside Kepa's near post from 25 yards. The goalkeeper, perhaps unsighted by Luiz's decision to move out of the way of the shot, did not even move as it flew past him. Then nine minutes into the second half, Son picked up a lovely Alli pass down the outside on the halfway line before outpacing Jorginho on the right flank. He bamboozled Luiz with a simple turn inside and fired at Kepa's far post to complete a sensational solo goal. What would VAR have changed? Had Martin Atkinson had the luxury of VAR, he would likely have given Chelsea a penalty when Hazard was brought down by Foyth with the score 1-0 at the time. Had that been given, and Chelsea levelled up Alli's opener, it would have been a very different game. Alli and Kane then passed up opportunities to humiliate Chelsea further by missing presentable opportunities before Giroud grabbed himself a first league goal of the season - but little fanfare to go with it - by heading in Cesar Azpilicueta's cross late on. Chelsea will harbour more concern for the condition of star man Hazard, who ended a largely quiet game by coming off the worse from a tackle late on and spent the final minutes limping around Wembley. Man of the match - Christian Eriksen There were a number of players who would have had a good call to be named as the best on the pitch, and they all wore Tottenham shirts. Eriksen's free-kick was nodded in by Alli for the opener But Eriksen's seven key passes, a league high across the season to date, and two of them resulting in assists, left him standing out from the crowd. Tottenham have missed the rhythm his spectacular passing radar gives them, as well as his set-piece delivery. They could have easily scored more from dead balls than just the Alli header from his early free-kick, and his return pass for Son's miss was stunning. Match facts Tottenham have won three of their last four Premier League games against Chelsea (L1), as many as they had in their previous 20 against them in the competition (W3 D9 L8). Chelsea suffered their first league defeat of the season, last losing on the final day of the 2017-18 campaign (0-3 vs Newcastle). Tottenham have won consecutive league games against Chelsea for the first time since August 1987. Since Mauricio Pochettino has been in charge, Tottenham have won more Premier League London derby matches than any other side (22). Tottenham's Dele Alli has scored more goals against Chelsea in all competitions than he has against any other side (6). Tottenham striker Harry Kane has scored 25 goals in Premier League London derbies, putting him joint-sixth in the all-time list in the competition (level with Robin van Persie). Son Heung-min's strike was his 50th goal for Tottenham in all competitions, in what was his 154th appearance for the club. Chelsea's Olivier Giroud became only the second player in Premier League history to score 20 goals as a substitute (Jermain Defoe 24). What's next? Both sides are back in European action in midweek, with Spurs hosting Inter Milan on Wednesday in a must-win Champions League match at 8pm. Chelsea have already wrapped up qualification from their Europa League group, but can seal top spot against PAOK on Thursday at the same time."},{"date": "11/11/2019", "arena": "Anfield",

Liverpool 2-0 Fulham Liverpool 2-0 Fulham Goals from Mohamed Salah and Xherdan Shaqiri condemned Fulham to their sixth successive Premier League loss in Liverpool's 2-0 victory on Sunday. Salah's 34th goal at Anfield gave Liverpool a first-half lead (41) just seconds after Aleksandar Mitrovic had his headed goal controversially ruled out for offside at the other end. Shaqiri extended Liverpool's advantage early in the second half (53) to ensure Jurgen Klopp's side recorded their 10th league win of the season and puts further pressure on the managerial future of Slavisa Jokanovic. The result means Liverpool stay two points behind leaders Manchester City while Fulham remain three points adrift at the foot of the Premier League table. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Van Dijk (6), Gomez (6), Robertson (7), Wijnaldum (6), Fabinho (7), Shaqiri (9), Salah (8), Mane (7), Firmino (8) Subs: Henderson (6), Milner (6), Keita (N/A) Fulham: Rico (8), Christie (5), Mawson (5), Odoi (4), Le Marchand (5), Chambers (5), Sessegnon (5), Cairney (6), Anguissa (5), Schurrle (5), Mitrovic (6) Subs: Seri (6), Vietto (5), Johansen (N/A) Man of the match: Xherdan Shaqiri Liverpool started the half brightly as Shaqiri was denied by Sergio Rico from outside the box in the 13th minute before Salah's point-blank effort was well saved by the Valencia loanee moments later. Although Liverpool were enjoying plenty of possession, with Rico called into action again to deny Salah in the 21st minute, Ryan Sessegnon spurned a glorious chance to give Fulham the lead when he dragged his one-on-one effort wide. Liverpool did take the lead shortly before half-time but it arrived in controversial circumstances. Mitrovic nodded in a Tom Cairney cross but he was adjudged to be offside just 13 seconds before Liverpool went up the other end, following some quick distribution from Alisson, and Salah slotted the ball home. Replays suggest Mitrovic may have been kept onside by Andrew Robertson before it was chalked off by referee Paul Tierney. Team news Joe Gomez, Fabinho, Xherdan Shaqiri and Roberto Firmino replaced Joel Matip, James Milner, Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge in the starting XI. For Fulham, Jean Michael Seri, Luciano Vietto and Timothy Fosu-Mensah dropped out of the team. Cyrus Christie, Alfie Mawson and Calum Chambers entered the lineup. Liverpool started the second half confidently and they doubled their lead in the 53rd minute when Robertson's fine cross was volleyed in by the unmarked Shaqiri at the far post. With Fulham pushing numbers forward, they left gaps at the back which Robertson almost exploited as he fired a shot on goal from range on the counter-attack, but Rico was there once again to bat the ball away. Fulham failed to create any significant chances late on as the match fizzled out with the west London club recording their seventh loss in a row in all competitions. For Liverpool, their unbeaten run extends to 11 matches in the league. Notes for Southgate Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez both put in solid defensive shifts for Liverpool as they kept a clean sheet. Alexander-Arnold, in particular, caused plenty of problems down the right flank while also capably dealing with the attacking threat of Ryan Sessegnon. Opta stats Liverpool have picked up 30 points from their opening 12 Premier League games (W9 D3 L0) - their joint-best total at this stage in the competition (level with 2002-03). Fulham have conceded 31 goals from their first 12 Premier League games this season; only Barnsley in 1997-98 conceded more goals at this stage of a Premier League campaign (35). Fulham have taken one point from their last 19 Premier League games against the 'big six' sides (W0 D1 L18), losing all four games this season by an aggregate score of 2-13. Liverpool have won all nine home Premier League games under Jurgen Klopp against newly-promoted teams, scoring 27 goals and conceding just three. Man of the Match - Xherdan Shaqiri Shaqiri was at his best against Fulham Shaqiri was drafted into the starting lineup and he made the most of it as he was instrumental in central areas.

highlights Chelsea 0-0 Everton - highlights Chelsea stretched their unbeaten Premier League start to 12 games but had to settle for a point after failing to breach Everton during a goalless draw at Stamford Bridge. Maurizio Sarri's side were nullified by disciplined visitors during the first half but the scoreline belied their dominance after the interval as Jordan Pickford, the goalframe and the offside flag left them frustrated. Marcos Alonso had the game's best chances but though the stage seemed set for Ross Barkley against his former club, the late substitute could only lash wide from distance and a home breakthrough remained elusive. The Blues would have returned to the summit, for a few hours at least, but the result leaves them third in the table behind Manchester City and Liverpool, with Everton staying in ninth place. Sarri will rue the missed opportunity but his start to Premier League management is now a record one, the Italian surpassing Frank Clark's 11 unbeaten run with Nottingham Forest from August to October 1994. Player ratings Chelsea: Arrizabalaga (6), Azpilicueta (7), Rudiger (7), Luiz (6), Alonso (7), Kante (6), Jorginho (6), Kovacic (7), Willian (6), Morata (5), Hazard (7). Subs: Fabregas (6), Barkley (6), Pedro (6). Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (7), Keane (7), Mina (8), Digne (7), Andre Gomes (6), Gueye (7), Walcott (6), Sigurdsson (7), Bernard (6), Richarlison (6). Subs: Jagielka (6), Lookman (6), Calvert-Lewin (n/a). Man of the match: Yerry Mina Willian during the Premier League match against Everton After the Chelsea Pensioners had led remembrance tributes, the visitors to west London started brightest on the pitch, Andre Gomes heading narrowly over and Bernard fizzing wide following threatening Lucas Digne deliveries. A ball over the top narrowly evaded Alvaro Morata's lunge but Chelsea continued to be thwarted by well-drilled opponents, as well as by Everton goalkeeper Pickford when Yerry Mina's foul on Eden Hazard gave Alonso a dead-ball chance. The sides had failed to muster a shot on target as the break loomed but Alonso lashed a venomous first (41) when he peeled away to meet Willian's free-kick on the volley, the angle tight but Pickford forced to palm away. Team news Ross Barkley was named as a substitute as Chelsea made eight changes to the side which began the win at BATE Borisov on Thursday, with Kepa Arrizabalaga, Jorginho and Eden Hazard the players retained. Richarlison shrugged off an ankle injury to start for Everton, with Colombia defender Yerry Mina making his full debut. Antonio Rudiger battles for possession with Lucas Digne Morata's hopeful penalty appeal was dismissed before a flashpoint between Bernard and Antonio Rudiger saw both players booked as the half ended with a frisson but still no breakthrough. Pickford was called upon again just seconds after the restart, Morata under pressure from Mina but almost converting Hazard's lofted cross, and as the game opened up, Kepa Arrizabalaga tipped over from Gylfi Sigurdsson. As Barkley warmed up to some jeers from the travelling supporters, Willian dithered and then fired wide, while Pickford scrambled to push over Hazard's deflected shot in a breathless passage of play. Alonso drilled against the far post (65) as a Chelsea opener impossibly remained elusive but Morata could have no complaints when he tapped in soon after but saw the offside flag. The Spaniard was further aggrieved when a tussle with Michael Keane brought no Everton punishment and a flurry of substitutes were made in vain, Barkley's entrance promising but failing to deliver late drama. Eden Hazard and Lucas Digne in action at Stamford Bridge Opta stats Chelsea have remained unbeaten after their opening 12 games to a season in the top-flight for only the second time, also doing so in 2014-15 when they went on to win the Premier League. Chelsea and Everton have now played out eight goalless draws in the Premier League; only Everton v Liverpool (nine) has seen more in the competition's history. Everton are now winless in their last 24 Premier League visits to Chelsea (D11 L13), their outright second longest run without a win away at any opponent in their league history after a 36-game streak at Leeds United between April 1953 and December 2001. This was Chelsea 21st Premier League clean sheet against Everton; against no other opponent have they managed more in the competition (also 21 v Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur. This was Everton manager Marco Silva's first goalless draw in the Premier League since August 2017 with Watford against Brighton, having previously gone 32 games without one in the league. Man of the match - Yerry Mina The Colombia international posted some impressive stats on his full debut and boss Marco Silva was impressed. \"He showed his quality,\" Silva said. \"Even without the ball he did what we planned in terms of our defensive organisation and process.\" Mina might have caught Hazard with a meaty challenge that Sky Sports' Graeme Souness thought fortunate to bring yellow rather than red but he was a vital robust presence as Chelsea failed to score at home for the first time this season. .@Everton's Yerry Mina v @ChelseaFC. - Made first @premierleague start - Won 100%

Wolves Arsenal extended their unbeaten run to 16 matches as Henrikh Mkhitaryan's late equaliser salvaged a 1-1 draw with Wolves at the Emirates on Sunday. Ivan Cavaleiro took advantage of an error by Granit Xhaka to put Wolves ahead in the 13th minute. Arsenal were flat and it looked like they were heading for their first defeat since August 18, especially after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang spurned a superb chance in the 73rd minute. Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (8), Bellerin (7), Holding (6), Mustafi (6), Kolasinac (6), Torreira (6), Xhaka (5), Iwobi (5), Ozil (5), Aubameyang (5), Lacazette (5) Subs: Guendouzi (5), Ramsey (5), Mkhitaryan (6) Wolves: Rui Patricio (6), Bennett (6), Coady (7), Boly (7), Doherty (6), Joao Moutinho (6), Neves (6), Jonny (6), Helder Costa (7), Jimenez (6), Ivan Cavaleiro (7) Subs: Jota (5), Traore (5), Gibbs-White (5) Man of the match: Bernd Leno However, substitute Mkhitaryan levelled in the 86th minute with a cross that curled into the far corner and Morgan Gibbs-White ​​​​​​hit the bar for Wolves in injury-time. While the result ends a run of three straight defeats for Wolves, they will probably feel they should have taken more from the game. The visitors took the lead after 13 minutes when Xhaka dummied in his own half and gave the ball away to Cavaleiro. He passed forward for Raul Jimenez, who crossed into the middle for Cavaleiro to finish. Ivan Cavaleiro scores the opening goal of the game Alexandre Lacazette saw a close-range shot blocked in the 22nd minute, but otherwise Arsenal struggled to break down an organised Wolves defence. It was the visitors who looked the more likely to score next as Bernd Leno saved twice from Helder Costa and Jimenez dragged wide from around 20 yards out. Arsenal looked off their game and even after the break they struggled to assert any extra pressure. Alexandre Lacazette battles for possession with Conor Coady Lucas Torreira saw a dipping shot tipped over by Rui Patricio, but it took Arsenal until the 71st minute to create a clear opening as Hector Bellerin blazed over from the penalty spot. Shortly afterwards, Aubameyang was guilty of a glaring miss as he swept a shot against the post from eight yards out. Team news Arsenal made one change from their draw with Liverpool last weekend as Alex Iwobi replaced Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Wolves stuck with the same XI that lost against Tottenham. Diogo Jota was denied by Leno on the counter, before Arsenal levelled when Mkhitaryan's cross from the left went over everyone in the box and flew into the far corner. Wolves had chances to restore their lead in injury-time but Leno saved from Adama Traore and then Gibbs-White saw a curling shot hit the bar and bounce down on the line with almost the final kick of the match. Opta stats After winning each of their first six matches against Wolves in the Premier League, Arsenal have only won one of the last three such meetings (D2). Since a run of four wins in six matches in the Premier League (D2), Wolves are now winless in each of their last four games in the competition (D1 L3). Arsenal, along with Cardiff, are the only two sides in the Premier League yet to be leading at half-time in any of their matches so far this season. Arsenal have drawn three successive matches at home in all competitions for the first time since August 2012. Henrikh Mkhitaryan has scored his first goal at home for Arsenal in the Premier League since March, when he netted against Watford. Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka has made five errors leading to goals since his Premier League debut, no other outfielder in the competition has made more in that time (also Simon Francis). Ivan Cavaleiro's opener was the first ever time Wolves have taken the lead against Arsenal in a Premier League match, having never been in front at any point in the eight previous meetings in the competition before today. Man of the match - Bernd Leno Were it not for Arsenal goalkeeper Leno then Wolves would probably have won this match. He twice denied Costa in the first half, threw himself at the feet of Jimenez to stop him shooting, and then saved from Jota and Traore late in the game. The managers Unai Emery: \"It's not a good draw, but they deserve it because they work very well and were very competitive and organised for the transition. The first goal made it more difficult for us, but we worked and took risks in the match to try to win. \"We had chances and I think the team deserved the draw and then one moment you think we can win with risk and they also had chances. But in the 90 minutes the draw is probably how it looked on the pitch.\" 3:43 Unai Emery said Arsenal deserved a draw and it was probably a fair reflection of the match.

Subs: Lukaku (6), Mata (5), Sanchez (5) Man of the Match: David Silva City made most of the early running as Bernardo Silva flashed a 20-yard effort just wide, and thoroughly deserved their opener on 12 minutes. Raheem Sterling's fine cross to the back post was kept alive by Bernardo Silva, Aguero looked to be hauled to the ground by Chris Smalling, but as referee Anthony Taylor let play go on, Silva squeezed home right-footed from eight yards. David Silva celebrates putting Manchester City ahead It felt like the floodgates would open, but United restricted City to few chances before the break, even if their defensive efforts restricted any attacking bite. The second did come, just three minutes into the second half, as United lost the ball in midfield and allowed Aguero a run at Victor Lindelof. After a lovely one-two with Riyad Mahrez, Aguero thundered one over David De Gea from a tight angle to the right of goal. Team news Paul Pogba was missing from Manchester United’s matchday squad. The Frenchman did not travel after missing training on Friday with a strain. Marouane Fellaini started in his absence while Marcus Rashford replaced Alexis Sanchez in United’s other change. Pep Guardiola made two changes after City’s midweek demolition of Shakhtar Donetsk as Sergio Aguero and Benjamin Mendy returned. United's comeback from 2-0 down here in April would have still been fresh in many City's players' minds, and they halved the deficit as half-time sub Romelu Lukaku was brought down by Ederson, allowing Martial to slot home a penalty, his sixth goal in seven. Romelu Lukaku is fouled in the penalty area by Ederson The visitors struggled to create much thereafter, and City wrapped it up in the 86th minute as Bernardo Silva's cross caught United napping, allowing Gundogan to take the ball down and turn past David de Gea following a 44-pass move, the most in the Premier League since September 2015. Opta stats There were 44 passes in the build-up for Manchester City's third goal - the most for a goal in the competition since Juan Mata scored for Man Utd against Southampton in September 2015 (45). This is the first time since 1990/91 that Man Utd have lost as many as four of their opening 12 games in a top-flight season. This is the first time since 1977/78 that Man Utd have a negative goal difference after 12 games of a top-flight season. Only Fulham (0) have kept fewer clean sheets than Manchester United (1) in the Premier League this season. Man City's Sergio Aguero has scored eight Premier League goals against Manchester United - only Alan Shearer (10) has more against the Reds in the competition. There were just 30 seconds between Romelu Lukaku coming on as a sub for Man Utd, and winning the penalty that made it 2-1. Anthony Martial became the fifth French player to score in five consecutive Premier League games, after Eric Cantona, Nicolas Anelka, Thierry Henry and Olivier Giroud. David Silva has scored in three consecutive home games in all competitions for Man City for the first time. This was Man Utd boss Jose Mourinho's 300th Premier League game as manager - despite defeat today, he's won more games than any other manager in their first 300 in the competition (189). The managers 3:19 Pep Guardiola says Manchester City were completely deserving of their 3-1 victory against Manchester United at the Etihad. Pep Guardiola says Manchester City were completely deserving of their 3-1 victory against Manchester United at the Etihad. Pep Guardiola: \"We deserved the victory, we played better last season than this season, especially in the first half. The first half we played a little bit with fear. But we made a good performance in a top game against a top, top team, we cannot forget what they have done in the past few weeks. I am happy for the result.\" 5:20 Jose Mourinho says all three goals conceded in Manchester United's 3-1 defeat at Manchester City were mistakes made by his team. Jose Mourinho says all three goals conceded in Manchester United's 3-1 defeat at Manchester City were mistakes made by his team. Jose Mourinho: \"I think it is not a bad performance at all. It was a performance with mistakes and we paid for it. All three goals are our mistakes. Against a team like City, if you make mistakes you will get punished.\" Man of the match - David Silva Another City win, another masterful David Silva performance. His 56 passes in the opposition half says it all; he is desperate to be in those dangerous areas, passing the ball forwards constantly, where it really hurt United on Sunday. When he doesn't pass it on, he looks to run past players, and his reading of the game is second to none. Even without the ball, his movement through the lines caused United problems, and he routinely found space. Is this Silva at his peak? It feels like the peak has lasted years and years… What's next? Manchester City now go to West Ham after the international break on Saturday, November 24 at 3pm, while United host Crystal Palace at the same time in the Premier League."},{"date": "10/11/2019",

win against Brighton in the Premier League Highlights from Cardiff's 2-1 win against Brighton in the Premier League Sol Bamba's dramatic 90th-minute strike gave Cardiff a vital 2-1 win over 10-man Brighton in the Premier League on Saturday. After Bamba himself and Calum Paterson had both hit the woodwork in a goalmouth scramble, the defender slammed the second rebound into the roof of the net to hand Cardiff a valuable three points. Lewis Dunk's header had earlier put Brighton ahead (6), Paterson replied for Cardiff with another close-range header (28), before Brighton were reduced to 10 men as Dale Stephens saw red for a rash challenge on Greg Cunningham (33). Callum Paterson scores a header to equalise for Cardiff Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (6), Manga (5), Morrison (6), Bamba (7), Cunningham (6), Camarasa (7), Gunnarsson (6), Harris (7), Ralls (6), Murphy (6), Paterson (7).

Brighton took an early lead through Dunk's header, turning home at the far post from close range after losing Cardiff defender Sol Bamba from Solly March's dangerous free-kick. But the hosts were level with a header of their own through Paterson, nodding into the net from three yards after Kadeem Harris, making his first Premier League start, caused issues for Brighton down the right flank as his deflected cross looped into the striker's path. And Brighton's task was made harder after Martin Atkinson dismissed Stephens, who had raised his studs in a challenge with Cunningham on the halfway line. Team news Cardiff made three changes to the side that lost to Leicester last weekend. Joe Ralls returned in place of the suspended Harry Arter, while Kadeem Harris and Greg Cunningham came in for Bobby Reid and Joe Bennett. Two changes for Brighton after the defeat at Everton; Alireza Jahanbakhsh did not recover from his hamstring injury in time to feature, and was replaced by Anthony Knockaert. Martin Montoya started ahead of captain Bruno at right-back, and Lewis Dunk took the captain's armband in his absence. Lewis Dunk celebrates Brighton's goal against Cardiff Harris impressed throughout, and hit the bar with a 25-yard left-footed curler in the second half, and though Cardiff pressured throughout the second period, the next best chance fell to Brighton. Cutting inside from the left, Jose Izquierdo's fierce effort moved in the air and forced Neil Etheridge to awkwardly tip over the bar. Then came the melee which won it for Cardiff. First, Bamba's overhead kick bounced off the post, then Paterson's rebounded strike was superbly deflected onto the bar by Dunk, only for Bamba to react and turn into the net from six yards through the crowd. Opta stats This is the second time a Neil Warnock side have won in the 90th minute of a Premier League game and the first time since September 2006 (Phil Jagielka for Sheff Utd vs Middlesbrough). Brighton have won just one of their last 20 Premier League matches away from home (D5 L14), with that victory coming against Newcastle last month. Cardiff have conceded the first goal of the game on more occasions than any other team in the Premier League this season (9). 11 of Lewis Dunk's 13 league goals for Brighton have been headers.

That's why the fans, who were unbelievable, are still with us.

We've seen it on numerous occasions and Bamba is in an offside position. That's the frustration and anger. For me it's a comfortable and easy decision to make.\" Man of the match - Kadeem Harris On his first Premier League start, 25-year-old Harris gave Cardiff added bite on the attack, helping create the first goal and nearly scoring a stunner of a second after the break. Harris also made a team-high three key passes, and challenged Brighton's backline with five crosses, more than the entire Brighton side. What's next?

highlights Huddersfield 1-1 West Ham - highlights Felipe Anderson struck late on to secure a hard-earned point for West Ham against Huddersfield at the John Smith's Stadium. Huddersfield enjoyed the perfect start when Alex Pritchard became their first player to score a home goal this season with a well-taken effort after six minutes. However, Anderson drew the visitors level with 16 minutes remaining when he smashed a left-footed shot into the roof of the net following a goalmouth scramble. The result means that Huddersfield remain in the relegation zone while West Ham stay13th after failing to capitalise on Brighton's slip-up against Cardiff.

Just a minute later West Ham had a fantastic opportunity of their own when Marko Arnautovic found himself in acres of space inside the Huddersfield half after being picked out by Grady Diangana but his low strike was diverted past the post by an onrushing Jonas Lossl. Huddersfield fans have had to wait a long time to see one of their own players score a goal at the John Smith's stadium, 726 minutes to be precise, but they finally had a goal to cheer about when Pritchard capitalised on some sloppy defensive play by West Ham to fire beyond Fabianski from the edge of the box. Huddersfield's David Wagner says once they get luck going their way they'll gain more points. The hosts nearly doubled their advantage on the quarter hour mark when Phillip Billing's intended cross from the left wing sailed over Fabianski's head and thundered off the inside of the far post, but they were dealt a blow just before half-time when Chris Lowe had to be replaced after suffering a shoulder injury. Team news Both David Wagner and Manuel Pellegrini named unchanged teams after seeing their teams win last weekend. Huddersfield were much the better side in the first half and Manuel Pellegrini made a change at the break to stem the tide with Javier Hernandez introduced for Diangana. The Mexican international almost made an immediate impact just after the restart when his shot was blocked by Lossl before he headed the rebound onto the roof of the net. Eventually, West Ham did draw level through Anderson's third goal in two games. There was an almighty scramble inside the Huddersfield area with Hernandez and another substitute Michail Antonio both denied by blocks before the loose ball dropped to Anderson who fired a shot into the top corner beyond four Huddersfield defenders on the line. 3 - Felipe Anderson has scored three goals in his last two Premier League games, as many as he managed in his previous 24 appearances in the big five European leagues.

Opta stats Huddersfield haven't scored more than once in any of their last 22 Premier League games, netting just nine goals in total in that run. Six of West Ham's seven Premier League goals against Huddersfield have been scored in the second half of games. West Ham have kept just one clean sheet in their last 15 Premier League away games, a 2-0 win at Leicester in May. Alex Pritchard is the first Huddersfield player to score at home in the Premier League in 726 minutes of action, since Tom Ince scored against Watford back in April. Huddersfield's Jonathan Hogg registered his first league assist in 112 appearances, since setting up goals for Huddersfield against Bolton in the Championship in December 2014. Man of the match - Alex Pritchard Alex Pritchard had managed just one goal and one assist from 32 Premier League games for Huddersfield prior to the game, but he registered his first strike of the season to hand his side a deserved early lead. Goals remain an issue for Huddersfield but Pritchard's partnership with Steve Mounie, which generally saw him buzzing after the target man's flick ons, showed plenty of signs of promise. The managers David Wagner: \"It was a good game, both sides wanted to win, both sides wanted to create offensive situations. I think in the first half, we were the team with more clear-cut chances, we deserved the lead for sure and it was a great goal from Pritchard. 2:43 Manuel Pellegrini reflects on West Ham's 1-1 draw with Huddersfield as Felipe Anderson scores a late equaliser. Manuel Pellegrini reflects on West Ham's 1-1 draw with Huddersfield as Felipe Anderson scores a late equaliser. \"We had further opportunities with Mounie's one-on-one, we hit the inside of the post, hit the bar from Mounie, we had a penalty incident which I think was a clear pen when Zanka was fouled from the corner. Unfortunately, it was a game where we didn't have the luck to score more than one goal.\" Manuel Pellegrini: \"I'm happy because we didn't play well. Maybe before the game the media and a lot of people thought [West ham would beat] Huddersfield because they have only won one game, but I said before that in the Premier League there are no easy games, every team plays with intensity.

goalless draw in the first home game since Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's death on a difficult and emotional day at The King Power. Thousands of Leicester City fans marched pre-match on Saturday to honour former owner Srivaddhanaprabha and four others, who were killed when their helicopter crashed following Leicester's previous home match against West Ham. A two-minute silence was held among other tributes before kick-off where Vichai's son Aiyawatt laid a wreath in front of a full house at the King Power, who held commemorative scarves with the words \"Forever In Our Hearts.\" On the pitch, Leicester created ample opportunities in the first half as Jamie Vardy had an effort cleared off the line and Rachid Ghezzal hit the crossbar. However, they ran out of steam on an emotional week for all concerned with the club. Joe Hart saves from Demarai Gray in a goalless game at the King Power Following the pre-match tributes that visibly moved many of the fans, Leicester started with plenty of pace. Wilfred Ndidi's skidded an effort wide while Vardy's drilled strike was cleared off the line by Matt Lowton. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Chilwell (6), Morgan (6), Evans (6), Pereira (6), Mendy (6), Ndidi (6), Albrighton (7), Ghezzal (5), Gray (6), Vardy (6) Subs: Ihaenacho (4), Okazaki (6) Burnley: Hart (7), Lowton (7), Long (7), Mee (7), Taylor (7), Gudmundsson (6), Defour (6), Cork (6), Lennon (6), Vokes (5), Wood (5) Subs: Brady (6), Hendrick (6) Man of the match: Matt Lowton Marc Albrighton was a constant threat down the right and clipped a cross in which was headed onto the crossbar by Ghezzal as Leicester pinned Burnley deep inside their own half. Joe Hart then had to produce a fine save to thwart Demarai Gray's effort after Vardy linked well with the winger. Burnley came into the game in the second period but carried little attacking threat. Chris Wood should have done better when he volleyed a Robbie Brady cross over the bar from 12 yards. The emotions of the week seemed to be taking its toll on the Leicester players in the closing stages but they almost won the points when Shinji Okazaki's header dropped inches wide. The crowd hold a two-minute silence ahead of the game Opta stats Leicester City are unbeaten in eight home league matches against Burnley (W4 D4) since losing 0-1 in November 2007 in the Championship. Burnley have failed to score in a joint-league-high six Premier League games this season. Leicester mustered 22 shots in the game, the most they have attempted in a Premier League game without scoring since they returned to the top-flight in 2014/15. Burnley manager Sean Dyche has never won a league match at the King Power Stadium (W0 D3 L3), taking charge once with Watford and five times with the Clarets. Leicester failed to score in a Premier League game this season for the first time, with every side now failing to score in at least one top-flight game this season. Man of the match: Matt Lowton Burnley had to do a lot of defending, especially in the first-half. Lowton epitomised their steel and solid organisation with a determined display that included a clearance off the line from a Vardy strike and various brave clearances from one of 12 corners Leicester sent into the Burnley box. He also managed to keep rampaging Leicester full-back Ben Chilwell very quiet. Matt Lowton was solid throughout Manager reaction: Sean Dyche \"The respect shown was overwhelming. It does reconnect on how important football is to communities. The Leicester community have been amazing for their respects shown.\" Manager reaction: Claude Puel \"There's a lot of pride for my players because they played a strong game against a good team and defended very well. \"We created a lot of chances with the best intensity. Our performance was brilliant in the first half with lots of chances, we hit the post and the bar. We are unlucky in the end, a little disappointed, of course, because we wanted to honour our chairman with a win.\" 5:25 Following the 0-0 draw with Burnley, Leicester's Claude Puel says he's proud of his players after a difficult period for the club.

Salomon Rondon double secured Newcastle a second successive victory in the Premier League, with the 2-1 win condemning Bournemouth to back-to-back defeats. Rondon's first league goal for Newcastle (7) sent the hosts on their way, and the Venezuelan headed in a fabulous second (40) to stretch their lead. A knee injury midway through the half for Bournemouth left-back Adam Smith brought about eight minutes of stoppage time, and Jefferson Lerma (45+6) headed the visitors back into contention. However, Newcastle valiantly held on in the second half, and the victory lifts them up to 14th in the table ahead of the international break, while Bournemouth remain sixth. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Yedlin (7), Fernandez (7), Schar (7), Dummett (7), Ritchie (6), Ki (6), Diame (6), Kenedy (7), Rondon (8), Perez (6) Subs: Hayden (6), Clark (6), Atsu (6) Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Francis (6), S.Cook (6), Ake (6), Smith (6), Ibe (5), Lerma (6), L.Cook (5), Fraser (6), Brooks (6), Wilson (5) Subs: Daniels (6), Gosling (6), Defoe (6) Man of the match: Salomon Rondon Salomon Rondon celebrates his second goal for Newcastle against Bournemouth Rondon got Newcastle off to a perfect start, tapping in a rebound after his initial effort was parried back into his path by Bournemouth goalkeeper Asmir Begovic. Shortly after, a Federico Fernandez challenge on David Brooks went unpunished inside the Newcastle area, and the game was then halted for eight minutes as Smith was treated for a knee injury, having innocuously gone down after feigning a free-kick in his own half. Bournemouth left-back Adam Smith was stretchered off after receiving treatment for eight minutes After the delay, an unstoppable Rondon header from Kenedy's cross gave Newcastle daylight, and they could have stretched their lead further but for two superb Begovic saves, first denying Kenedy before preventing Callum Wilson - fresh from his first England call-up - from flicking the ball into his own net. Team news Fabian Schar, Sung-Yueng Ki and Ayoze Perez came in for injured trio Jamaal Lascelles (shoulder), Jonjo Shelvey (muscle injury) and Yoshinori Muto (calf). Just the one Bournemouth change for Bournemouth with Junior Stanislas replaced by Jordon Ibe in the starting XI. Bournemouth clawed their way back into the match in the sixth minute of stoppage time, with Lerma heading in from a corner after Martin Dubravka had denied Steve Cook from point-blank range. Jefferson Lerma headed Bournemouth back into contention against Newcastle Ayoze Perez fired narrowly wide just before half-time, and 10 minutes into the second half Rondon headed wide as he searched for his hat-trick. Jordon Ibe squandered a golden opportunity to level when firing over for Bournemouth, and after Begovic parried substitute Christian Atsu's effort, Rondon was denied his third late on when Begovic's boot kept out the low strike. Notes for Southgate Callum Wilson had a quiet afternoon at St James' Park, with just one attempt - a header that flew over. He almost scored at the wrong end, too, but Begovic kept his header out to spare the striker's blushes. Opta stats Newcastle United have won consecutive Premier League games for the first time since April when they won four in a row. Bournmeouth lost their first away game in all competitions against Newcastle since Feburary 1990 (0-3), having won two and drawn once before today. Bournemouth have lost their last two Premier League games having lost just two of their previous 12 (W8 D2 L2).

He knows he has to improve his match fitness, but he was doing really well, working hard and trying to fight with the defenders and give some time to the rest of the players coming to support him. \"That was pretty good. He showed what he can do, and has given us something different. I was happy with Joselu, Ayoze and Muto but he's a different kind of striker. It's always good that kind of competition for us.\" Eddie Howe: \"We're disappointed with the first half in particular - a slow start for us. You know when you come here, that's going to get the crowd in the game. \"It was a difficult opening period for us and we never stamped our authority on the match.

of the season at St Mary's as Watford came from behind to earn a 1-1 draw on Saturday. Manolo Gabbiadini made the breakthrough after 20 minutes, the Italian's first top-flight goal in front of his own fans since scoring against Newcastle United 13 months ago. Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (6), Soares (6), Yoshida (6), Hoedt (6), Bertrand (6), Armstrong (6), Lemina (6), Hojbjerg (7), Redmond (7), Gabbiadini (8), Ings (6) Subs: Ward-Prowse (6), Austin (7), Obafemi (6) Watford: Foster (7), Holebas (7), Cathcart (6), Mariappa (6), Femenia (7), Chalobah (7), Hughes (6), Doucoure (6), Deulofeu (6), Success (6), Pereyra (6) Subs: Deeney (8), Gray (6) Man of the match: Manolo Gabbiadini However, after Charlie Austin had a goal controversially disallowed for offside midway through the second half, the visitors claimed a share of the spoils thanks to Holebas' deflected effort eight minutes from time. As a result, Mark Hughes' side remain 17th in the table having won just once at home in the league this year, while Watford move up to seventh. Southampton's players celebrate opening the scoring against Watford The Saints may have come into this game on a seven-match winless run, but after Gerard Deulofeu failed to beat Alex McCarthy when through on goal with an early chance, the hosts took control. Ben Foster had to be alert to keep out Wesley Hoedt's initial close-range header, but the visitors were not so lucky from Nathan Redmond's next corner. What would VAR have changed? There is no doubt that had VAR been in operation at St Mary’s, then not only would Watford have been awarded a 58th-minute penalty after Ryan Bertrand impeded Nathaniel Chalobah in the box. However, the Video Ref would also have noticed that Charlie Austin’s strike did not take a deflection off Maya Yoshida on its way into the net midway through the second half. The full back's delivery from the left was actually poor, allowing Roberto Pereyra the chance to clear his lines. However, the forward was caught in possession in the area by the alert Danny Ings, before the recalled Gabbiadini nipped in to fire his side ahead. Javi Gracia's team thought they should have had a penalty just before the hour-mark when Nathaniel Chalobah - making his first start in over a year - was hacked down in the box by the already-booked Ryan Bertrand, only for referee Simon Hooper to deem it a fair challenge. Troy Deeney celebrates Watford's late equaliser There was more controversy after 66 minutes following a fine run by Redmond, who found Austin just inside the area, with the substitute then beating Foster with the help of a slight deflection off a Watford player. However, after consulting assistant Harry Lennard, Mr Hooper - in only his fourth Premier League game - decided incorrectly that it was Southampton defender Maya Yoshida, standing in an offside position, who had diverted Austin's shot past Foster and so was interfering with play. Team news Southampton made three changes from the side that lost 6-1 at champions Man City last time out, with Jack Stephens, James Ward-Prowse and Shane Long being replaced by Maya Yoshida, Stuart Armstrong and Manolo Gabbiadini. Meanwhile, Etienne Capoue missed out due to suspension, with Nathaniel Chalobah replacing him in midfield in the visitors' only change from last weekend's 1-0 loss at Newcastle. And that decision became even more unpopular with the Saints faithful when Watford levelled matters late on after James Ward-Prowse made a hash of a clearance, allowing Holebas to beat McCarthy with the help of a wicked deflection off Cedric Soares.

Opta stats Southampton have lost just one of their last 11 matches against Watford in all competitions (W5 D5) Southampton have failed to win any of their first six at home in a single league season in the top four tiers of English football for the first time Watford have failed to keep a clean sheet in 11 of their last 12 Premier League away games Watford's Jose Holebas has been directly involved in more Premier League goals this season than any other defender (2 goals, 4 assists) Southampton's opening goal was their first in the Premier League that wasn't from the penalty spot in 615 minutes since Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg netted vs Brighton in September Watford's players celebrate their late equaliser at St Mary's Managers Mark Hughes: \"Unfortunately the officials have cost us dearly today. At 1-0 to the good we get an opportunity, it is a clear goal, Charlie dispatches a chance in their box. \"A clear goal and not one of their players appealed for offside, we are celebrating it is 2-0 and the game is over in my view. \"Then all of a sudden the officials deem fit to play a hand for some reason, imagination or whatever, I have no idea.\" 3:42 Mark Hughes was left frustrated after Charlie Austin had a goal controversially ruled out for offside as Southampton drew 1-1 with Watford Mark Hughes was left frustrated after Charlie Austin had a goal controversially ruled out for offside as Southampton drew 1-1 with Watford Javi Gracia: \"I didn't see it from my position, it's impossible to know what happened. But after asking Chalobah he told me it was clear and maybe changed the game from that moment. But I prefer to support the referee's decision, it's difficult their job.\" 3:08 Watford's Javi Gracia says a point is fair following their 1-1 draw away at Southampton Watford's Javi Gracia says a point is fair following their 1-1 draw away at Southampton Pundit - Phil Thompson \"This was astonishing (Austin's disallowed goal). This is not right. Everybody goes celebrating and there's not one of the Watford players who think there's anything untoward. \"The ball gets pulled back towards the edge of the box, Charlie Austin strikes the ball and it takes a bit of a deflection. \"You have Yoshida, who was standing what you consider at the far post or just outside and he makes absolutely no attempt to go anywhere near the ball. \"The ball is probably about a yard away from him and if anything, he just watches the ball sail past him into the back of the net. It's a goal. \"Simon Hooper gets this totally wrong - or he's taken information from his assistant on the side and who is further away. Looking at his angle, he might think he's interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision. \"He's not. He's to the side of Ben Foster so he's not impeding his view. If he is being given information, he should overrule him because he can see Yoshida is not making any attempt to play the ball or impeding. \"It's a perfectly good goal. It's an easy decision that he (the referee) shouldn't get wrong.\" Man of the Match - Manolo Gabbiadini It has been a long time coming for the striker, but on Saturday he finally managed to find the net in the Premier League at St Mary's, 391 days after he last managed to do so against Newcastle. That poacher's strike after 20 minutes appeared to give the Italy international - recalled in place of Shane Long - a much-needed boost in confidence. And as a result, he was his side's best player on the south coast as he constantly stretched the Watford defence all afternoon long, while also looking a constant threat in front of goal. 391 - Southampton’s Manolo Gabbiadini scored his first Premier League goal at St. Mary’s stadium since October 2017 vs Newcastle, 391 days ago.

win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League Juan Foyth bounced back from a difficult Premier League debut to score the winner as Tottenham battled to a 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday. The 20-year-old, who gave away two penalties against Wolves last weekend, headed home from close range in the 66th minute at Selhurst Park to secure a fourth win in a row in all competitions for Spurs. Palace, without injured forward Wilfried Zaha, struggled to create chances, with substitute Alexander Sorloth spurning their best opening in injury-time when he was denied by Hugo Lloris. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Van Aanholt (6), Tomkins (6), Sakho (6), Wan-Bissaka (6), McArthur (5), Milivojevic (5), Meyer (5), Townsend (5), Ayew (5), Kouyate (5) Subs: Kelly (5), Sorloth (5), Schlupp (5) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Davies (7), Foyth (7), Alderweireld (7), Trippier (5), Wanyama (7), Sissoko (7), Alli (6), Moura (5), Lamela (6), Kane (5) Subs: Aurier (6), Son (5), Winks (5) Man of the match: Juan Foyth Spurs have now won seven of eight away Premier League matches this season while Palace are yet to win at home and have lost six of their last seven games in all competitions. Palace looked to be up against it from the start due to the absence of Zaha, having not won a Premier League game without him in the starting line-up since September 2016. However, the hosts did show some promising early signs as Lucas Moura headed away from an open Cheikhou Kouyate in the box and then Andros Townsend shot into the side-netting. Jordan Ayew battles with Juan Foyth Spurs lost Kieran Trippier to injury in the 24th minute, but were soon in the ascendancy. Dele Alli headed wide from Ben Davies' cross and Harry Kane then forced Wayne Hennessey into a save with a shot from 25 yards out. Spurs looked in control of the game before the break, only for Palace to battle back at the start of the second half and see James Tomkins spurn a good chance when he headed wide at the back post from a corner. Moussa Sissoko and Jordan Ayew battle for the ball But it was from a Spurs corner that the deadlock was eventually broken in the 66th minute. Kane's header was deflected up into the air and, as Jordan Ayew waited for the ball to drop, Foyth leapt and headed in from close range. Palace applied pressure in the final 10 minutes but Lloris saved a 20-yard shot from Jeffrey Schlupp and then denied Sorloth in injury-time after the striker was presented with a clear sight of goal in the box. Opta stats Crystal Palace have lost seven consecutive top-flight matches against a single opponent for the first time ever. Tottenham have won 1-0 in each of their last five Premier League meetings with Crystal Palace, the longest run of consecutive identical results between two sides in the history of the competition. 26 of the last 27 goals scored in Premier League games between Crystal Palace and Spurs have been netted in the second half - there has been one first half goal scored in the last 15 meetings. Crystal Palace are the only side this season yet to score a home Premier League goal excluding penalties. Tottenham have won more away Premier League games in 2018 than any other side (12). Only once have Spurs won more top-flight away games in a single calendar year (17 in 1960). Tottenham have had 146 different goalscorers in the Premier League, more than any other team in the competition's history (excl. own-goals). Juan Foyth is the third Argentinean player to score for Spurs in the Premier League, after Erik Lamela and Mauricio Taricco. Man of the match - Juan Foyth After conceding two penalties on his debut last weekend, this was a strong response from Foyth. He had a couple of nervy moments early in the game but was otherwise solid and popped up at the crucial moment to head in the winner. What's next? Crystal Palace travel to Manchester United on Saturday, November 24 and then host Burnley on December 1. Spurs host Chelsea after the international break on November 24. They then play Inter Milan in the Champions League on November 28 before facing Arsenal on Sunday, December 2, live on Sky Sports."},{"date": "05/11/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium",

Fulham A Timothy Fosu-Mensah own goal gave Huddersfield a 1-0 home win over Fulham, who replaced the Terriers at the bottom of the Premier League. Huddersfield's first home goal since April 14 was enough to give them their first win since the same day, and came from a stroke of good fortune when Fosu-Mensah diverted Christopher Schindler's header from a Chris Lowe cross beyond Sergio Rico. Fulham managed only a solitary shot on target throughout the whole 90 minutes at the John Smith's Stadium to further crank up the pressure on manager Slavisa Jokanovic, whose £100m summer spending has returned only five points from 11 games. Huddersfield players celebrate after Timothy Fosu-Mensah's own-goal Huddersfield, meanwhile, celebrated David Wagner's third anniversary in charge by moving above Fulham in the table with victory, and remain inside the relegation zone only on goal difference behind 17th-placed Newcastle. Philip Billing turned the heat up on a frosty opening in West Yorkshire by smashing the ball against the crossbar from 25 yards with 15 minutes gone as Huddersfield dominated early proceedings against a nervous Fulham, without puncturing their defence. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Jorgensen (6), Schindler (7), Kongolo (6), Hadergjonaj (6), Mooy (6), Hogg (7), Billing (7), Lowe (7), Pritchard (6), Mounie (6). Subs: Depoitre (5), Mbenza (n/a), Bacuna (n/a). Fulham: Rico (6), Fosu-Mensah (5), Odoi (6), Le Marchand (5), Sessegnon (6), Seri (6), Zambo (5), Cairney (5), Vietto (5), Mitrovic (5), Schurrle (5). Subs: Christie (6), McDonald (5), Johnsnen (6). Man of the match: Jonathan Hogg And with the hosts still very much on the front foot, Alex Pritchard tested Rico before the half-hour mark when his deflected drive was palmed away for a corner. Moments later, tension turned to joy when Schindler's header from Lowe's cross deflected off Fosu-Mensah into the far corner for the hosts' first home goal in 659 minutes. Florent Hadergjonaj had a strong shout for a penalty shortly before the break when he appeared to have his legs taken away by Ryan Sessegnon, but referee Anthony Taylor denied the Terriers a chance to double their goal tally from 12 yards. Team news David Wagner made three changes from Huddersfield's 3-0 defeat at Watford last weekend, with Erik Durm, Isaac Mbenza and Laurent Depoitre dropping out and Terrance Kongolo, Steve Mounie and Florent Hadergjonaj coming in. Fulham's only new face was Maxime Le Marchand, who replaced Tim Ream in defence. Fulham introduced Cyrus Christie and Kevin McDonald at half-time, and the changes did liven up proceedings, but beyond forcing a number of corners in the first quarter of an hour of the second period, the visitors made few inroads on their hosts. At the other end Aaron Mooy fired over from Steve Mounie's flick-on and Pritchard did likewise from a half-cleared corner, while in a rare attack Fulham had the ball in the back of the Huddersfield net from a crisp Andre Schurrle volley, but Aleksander Mitrovic was ruled offside in the build-up. And in the end, the hosts did not need to add to their one-goal lead as they hung on for their first win of the season, and condemned Fulham to the bottom of the Premier League table. Opta facts Huddersfield ended a run of 14 Premier League games without a win (D5 L9), Fulham are the only Premier League side yet to keep a clean sheet in the competition this season, last registering a top-flight shut-out in April 2014 (1-0 at home to Norwich). Terriers are the last side in the top four tiers of English football to register a league victory this season. Fulham have conceded 29 goals after the first 11 games of this Premier League campaign; no side has ever shipped more at this stage in the competition (also Southampton in 12/13). Fulham's haul of five points from their opening 11 games this season is their worst-ever tally at this season of a top-flight campaign. Fulham defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah's own goal ended a run of 658 minutes without a home Premier League goal for Huddersfield, since Tom Ince scored against Watford in April. Since the start of last season, only Manchester City, Tottenham and Leicester (five each) have benefited from more opposition own-goals in the Premier League than Huddersfield (four). Man of the match - Jonathan Hogg Hogg was, well, a terrier in midfield for Huddersfield, making more tackles (seven) than anyone else on the pitch, and winning back possession for the hosts 13 times. Jonathan Hogg was crucial as Huddersfield limited Fulham to a single shot on target He also managed a shot on target and was involved with the most duels out of any Huddersfield player (17). Reaction David Wagner: \"It's huge for us. We have now the winning feeling back, and a clean sheet as well. For sure, it is one of the most important wins we have had in the last three years, because after 10 games without a win and some unlucky situations, everyone needed to get the belief back and we have done that today. \"We are back in the race after 11 games of the season. If you look at the fixtures we have had, they have not been the easiest, and if you look at the ahead of us there are teams around our position coming up, and they will be open games. We were the team who really wanted to win today, and I'm delighted for the players.\" Slavisa Jokanovic: \"We didn't deserve much today. In the first 45 minutes we did not have intensity, and it did not give us enough space to move the ball. We were passing it without any sense. We put another midfielder in for the second half, but still missed the quality. 3:38 Slavisa Jokanovic said his Fulham side weren't good enough in their Premier League defeat to Huddersfield. Slavisa Jokanovic said his Fulham side weren't good enough in their Premier League defeat to Huddersfield. \"I convince myself [I am right for the job] and that's it, I don't need to convince other people or think about that, I am thinking about myself and my team. The season is a long one, after 11 games Crystal Palace were bottom last season with four points. Everything is open, we are not at our best level at the moment, and we need to improve.\" What's next? Huddersfield host West Ham at the John Smith's Stadium on Saturday at 3pm, while Fulham have an unenviable task of travelling to Anfield to face Liverpool in the early kick-off on Sunday at 12pm."},{"date": "04/11/2019", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53916, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

"2:57 Man City 6-1 Southampton Man City 6-1 Southampton Manchester City cruised back to the top of the Premier League after thrashing Southampton 6-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday afternoon. The victory was built on three goals in the opening 18 minutes as Wesley Hoedt's own goal (6) was followed by Sergio Aguero's 150th Premier League goal (12) and David Silva's half-volley (18). Danny Ings' 30th-minute penalty gave Southampton temporary respite, but Raheem Sterling scored in first-half injury-time to restore City's three-goal advantage. The England international netted his second of the game in the 67th minute before Leroy Sane struck in injury-time to ensure Pep Guardiola's team move two points clear of Liverpool at the top of the table ahead of next Sunday's Manchester derby. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (7), Stones (6), Laporte (7), Mendy (6), Fernandinho (7), B Silva (8), D Silva (9), Sane (9), Sterling (9), Aguero (8) Subs: Kompany (6), Foden (6), Delph (6) Southampton: McCarthy (6), Soares (5), Stephens (6), Hoedt (5), Bertrand (5), Redmond (6), Ward-Prowse (5), Hojbjerg (6), Lemina (6), Long (6), Ings (7) Subs: Obafemi (6), Elyounoussi (6), Armstrong (6) Man of the match: Raheem Sterling Southampton defender Hoedt inadvertently started a flurry of first-half goals when he steered Sane's low cross into his own net from two yards with Sterling lurking in an offside position. Six minutes later, Aguero secured his landmark 150th league goal for City when he tapped in Sterling's low delivery from close range after good work from Bernardo Silva. City skipper David Silva scored the third in the 18th minute when Sterling's floated cross was half-cleared by the head of Jack Stephens and the Spaniard lashed in a half-volley. David Silva put Manchester City 3-0 up inside 18 minutes against Southampton Southampton had not scored in their previous five Premier League games, but ended that run when John Stones was caught out by Ings and Ederson brought him down just inside the area. The striker coolly sent the goalkeeper the wrong way with his penalty. Team news Pep Guardiola made one change from Monday night’s Premier League win at Tottenham, as goalscorer Riyad Mahrez was replaced by Leroy Sane. Southampton made three changes from the 0-0 draw with Newcastle as Pierre-Emile Hobjerg, James Ward-Prowse and Shane Long replaced Oriol Romeu, Mohamed Elyounoussi and Charlie Austin. But Sterling scored City's fourth with a low shot in the second minute of first-half added time when Cedric Soares tried to see the ball out of play and Aguero won the ball back to cross for his team-mate to score. Southampton forwards Ings and Shane Long had chances after the break, but Sane hit the post with a fierce effort before Sterling scored the fifth on 67 minutes, receiving the ball from Aguero and shooting low across Alex McCarthy. Sane completed the rout in injury-time when Sterling found him on the edge of the area and he cut onto his left foot before shooting past McCarthy to move the champions top of the pile in style. Sergio Aguero put Manchester City 2-0 up Opta stats Manchester City are unbeaten in their last 43 Premier League games when kicking off at 3pm (W37 D6). Southampton are winless in nine games at the Etihad Stadium (D1 L8) since winning their very first game there in April 2004. Manchester City have scored five or more goals in a single Premier League game for the 12th time under Guardiola. Ings' penalty for Southampton was their first goal in 505 minutes of Premier League football, and subsequently ended Manchester City's run of 630 minutes without conceding a goal in the competition. Aguero scored his 150th Premier League goal in his 217th appearance - only Alan Shearer (212 games) has scored 150 in fewer games in Premier League history. Sane has assisted 18 Premier League goals since the start of last season, more than any other player in the competition. Sterling scored his 50th goal in all competitions for the club in what was his 153rd game and 126th start. Hoedt has now scored two own goals in this season's Premier League, more than any other player in the division. Man of the Match - Raheem Sterling Raheem Sterling celebrates with Kyle Walker after putting City 5-1 up For long spells, Manchester City were irresistible going forward and while all of their attacking players deserve credit, Sterling outshone them all. His two goals show how much his finishing has improved under Guardiola and he provided assists for both Aguero and Sane as well as influencing the early own goal from Hoedt. His tireless running off the ball ensures opportunities will always fall his way and he is emerging as one of the in-form players of this Premier League season. Guardiola described him as \"so, so sharp\" at full-time. Notes for Gareth Southgate Southgate was in the stands at the Etihad Stadium to witness a man-of-the-match display from Sterling, though Stones was at fault as Ings got the wrong side of him to earn Southampton's penalty and Walker looked to be struggling with fitness at times. Southampton goalkeeper McCarthy conceded six times, but could hardly be blamed for any of them and will hope the shaky defence in front of him won't damage his hopes of being in the squad which is named on Thursday.

twice as Chelsea reclaimed second spot in the Premier League with a 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge. The Spain international continued his recent upturn in form as he scored in each half before Pedro sealed the win that extends Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season to 11 games. Andros Townsend equalised for Palace early in the second half but Roy Hodgson's men were unable to prevent a fifth defeat in six that leaves them 14th in the table. The victory keeps Chelsea within two points of leaders Manchester City and sees Maurizio Sarri equal the record for the most games without defeat by a new Premier League manager. Player ratings Chelsea: Kepa (7), Alonso (6), Luiz (6), Rudiger (6), Azpilicueta (6), Kante (7), Jorginho (6), Barkley (6), Pedro (8), Morata (8), Willian (6).

Man of the Match: Alvaro Morata. Chelsea took an age to find their rhythm in an opening quarter which belonged to Palace's Wilfried Zaha, who stamped his authority on the game with a demonstration of his threat on the counter. Max Meyer blazed Palace's first chance over on 20 minutes before a last-gasp block from David Luiz prevented the midfielder from finding the target, after an intricate through pass from Zaha. Alvaro Morata celebrates his opening goal against Palace However, Palace's failure to punish a lethargic Chelsea came back to haunt them on 33 minutes, as Pedro's pass inside found Morata, who took a touch before rifling the ball past Wayne Hennessey. Chelsea thought they had scored a quickfire second two minutes later, but Willian's close-range effort was correctly ruled out for offside. Team news Chelsea were unchanged from their victory at Burnley but Eden Hazard returned to the bench as he continued his recovery from a back injury. Max Meyer replaces Jordan Ayew in Crystal Palace’s only change from their 2-2 draw with Arsenal. Morata could have doubled his tally on 39 minutes but he glanced a header onto the roof of the goal after Marcos Alonso's knock-back from a Willian free-kick. Palace were level eight minutes into the second half as a neat exchange between James McArthur and Townsend released the Palace forward through on goal, and he clinically found the bottom corner of Kepa Arrizabalaga's goal. Andros Townsend celebrates after equalising for Crystal Palace Hennessey brilliantly tipped a goal-bound Luiz header over on 63 minutes as Chelsea sought to regain the lead. Two minutes later, though, the Palace goalkeeper was beaten for a second time. Ninety seconds after coming on, Chelsea substitute Eden Hazard won and delivered a free-kick into the Palace area which bobbled around before Morata applied the finishing touch - his sixth goal in his last six games. Pedro's fourth goal of the season sealed Chelsea's victory Two quickly became three as Alonso's diagonal cross picked out the run of Pedro, who got in on the act by slotting home on 70 minutes. It was plain sailing from there on for Chelsea, the only negative being that Morata spurned the chance to secure his second hat-trick for the club as Hennessey read his lofted finish in a stoppage-time one-on-one. Opta stats Chelsea are undefeated in their opening 11 Premier League matches of this season (W8 D3 L0) - they won the league in the previous two seasons they achieved this (2005-06 and 2014-15). Maurizio Sarri is unbeaten in his first 11 Premier League games as Chelsea manager - this is the joint-longest unbeaten start by a Premier League manager, equalling the record set by Frank Clark in 1994. Crystal Palace have taken just five points from their last 10 Premier League matches (W1 D2 L7). Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata has scored four goals in his last four Premier League games - one more than in his previous 23 appearances in the competition combined (3). Crystal Palace's Andros Townsend has scored three Premier League goals against Chelsea - more than he has against any other opponent. Eden Hazard assisted Alvaro Morata's second goal for Chelsea just 91 seconds after coming on as a substitute. Pedro has ended on the winning side in 39 of the 40 home top-flight matches he's scored in during his career (26 of 27 with Barcelona, 13 of 13 with Chelsea), drawing the other with Villarreal in January 2010.

Roy Hodgson said he couldn’t fault his players fighting performance in their 3-1 defeat to Chelsea and was disappointed that the rewards for their efforts were not greater. Roy Hodgson: \"I was proud of the way the players kept at it and kept fighting towards the end. I don't think we were under the cosh by any stretch of the imagination. We were not confronted with lots of chances and opportunities, I thought we kept them at bay pretty well.\" Man of the Match - Alvaro Morata Alvaro Morata scores his second of the game to put Chelsea 2-1 up After a barren start to the season, Morata appears to have finally found his feet under Sarri. He led the line with an assured level of conviction, something which has been scarce in his game in recent months, and essential for a Chelsea side without Eden Hazard from the start. The composure with which Morata took his fifth and sixth goals in his last six club matches was a welcomed sight for a player steadily rebuilding his confidence. What's next?

Rashford scored a stoppage-time winner as Manchester United came from behind to snatch a dramatic 2-1 victory at Bournemouth on Saturday. The England international rifled home from close range two minutes into time added on as a remarkable late turnaround saw United overcame a resilient Bournemouth defensive display. Bournemouth flew out of the traps and took a deserved lead on 11 minutes thanks to Callum Wilson's sixth goal of the season, but Anthony Martial's fifth goal in five hauled a lacklustre United level against the run of play on 35 minutes. United laid siege to the Bournemouth goal in the second half but the resolute Cherries, typified by two incredible goal-saving blocks from Nathan Ake and David Brooks, looked to have secured Eddie Howe's men a point. But Rashford struck in the closing stages to secure a victory that sees United move into seventh in the Premier League. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (7), S. Cook (6), Ake (8), Smith (6), Stanislas (6), L. Cook (6), Lerma (6), Fraser (7), Brooks (7), Wilson (8). Subs: Gosling (5), Ibe (5), Surman (n/a) Away Team: De Gea (7), Young (6), Smalling (6), Lindelof (6), Shaw (5), Matic (5), Fred (4), Pogba (6), Mata (6), Sanchez (8), Martial (8). Subs: Herrera (6), Rashford (6), Lingard (5). Man of the Match: Nathan Ake United were as awful as Bournemouth were brilliant in the opening half an hour. Unable to cope with the pace and power of the hosts, United were fortunate not to concede inside four minutes as Ryan Fraser fired a low effort straight at David de Gea, after being released by Wilson. Brooks and Adam Smith linked up in the United area to set up Junior Stanislas on 11 minutes. He saw a shot deflect behind off Luke Shaw, but Bournemouth were not to be denied much longer. Callum Wilson wheels away after firing Bournemouth into the lead After United had cleared the resulting corner, a brilliant through pass from Lewis Cook played Stanislas in behind the advanced Shaw and he crossed for Wilson to slot home. 10 - No player has been involved in more @premierleague goals this season than Callum Wilson (6 goals, 4 assists - level with Eden Hazard). Perfect. #BOUMUN — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) November 3, 2018 The United goal lived an enchanted life as Bournemouth pushed for a deserved second. The lively Brooks glanced a header onto the roof of the net before De Gea was called into action to cut out Stanislas' curling strike on 23 minutes. But United's first purposeful attack triggered a change in momentum. Martial darted in off the left flank on 33 minutes, cut the ball back to Fred and, although the Brazilian's effort was blocked by Ake, the visitors finally found a foothold. Anthony Martial equalised for United The equaliser came just two minutes later as Ashley Young threaded Alexis Sanchez in behind the Bournemouth defence and his cutback was clinically dispatched by Martial. Bournemouth re-emerged from the interval on the front foot as Brooks' deft back-heel drew a save from De Gea on 50 minutes, but United quickly grabbed the initiative in a dominant second-half display. Team news Having started last week’s victory over Everton on the bench, Romelu Lukaku was dropped completely from the Manchester United squad. Alexis Sanchez returned to the starting line-up in United’s only change, with Marcus Rashford dropping to the bench. Junior Stanislas replaced Charlie Daniels in Bournemouth’s only change from their victory at Fulham. Asmir Begovic bailed Bournemouth out on three occasions in quick succession: preventing Martial from latching onto a lofted Juan Mata pass, thwarting Shaw's near-post drive and tipping a Sanchez header over the bar as United piled on the pressure before the hour. Bournemouth's rearguard action reached new heights on 64 minutes, with Ake and Brooks brilliantly preventing Rashford and Paul Pogba from converting rebounds after Young struck the angle of post and bar with a sumptuous free-kick. Marcus Rashford's second goal of the season sealed the victory But United's relentless pressure finally told as Pogba's cross found Rashford and he smashed the ball home two minutes into injury time, leaving Bournemouth with no time to respond. Opta stats Marcus Rashford has scored two 90th-minute winning goals in Premier League games for Man Utd - no player has netted more for the club (level with Paul Scholes and Robin van Persie). Bournemouth lost at home for the first time in seven Premier League games (W4 D2), since losing to Manchester United in April (0-2). No team has come from behind to win more points in the Premier League this season than Manchester United (7, level with Arsenal and Leicester). Notes for Southgate Callum Wilson gave Gareth Southgate another reminder of his abilities in front of goal after scoring for the sixth time in the Premier League this season to make the breakthrough at the Vitality. In fact, no other player has been involved in more top-flight goals this campaign than the Bournemouth striker’s tally of 10. Manchester United have kept just one clean sheet and conceded 18 goals after 11 Premier League games this season. At this stage last season they had registered eight clean sheets and shipped just five goals. Jose Mourinho is unbeaten in his 21 Premier League meetings with English managers with Manchester United, winning 17 and drawing four. In 11 Premier League appearances this season, Bournemouth's Callum Wilson has already equalled his tally of goal involvements from last season (10), achieved in 28 games. Manchester Utd's Anthony Martial has scored in four appearances in a row in the Premier League for the first time ever (5 goals in total), netting with the Red Devils' first shot on target of the game. Man of the Match - Nathan Ake The Bournemouth centre-back was an absolute colossus at the back as Bournemouth came within seconds of securing a credible point. Martial and Sanchez got no change out of the Dutchman in the first half, laying the foundation upon which the hosts dominated. United turned the screw in the second period and would have won by a healthier margin had it not been for Ake's intervention, particularly his goal-line block to deny Rashford. The managers 0:22 Eddie Howe describes the frustration felt at seeing his side defeated late on Eddie Howe describes the frustration felt at seeing his side defeated late on Eddie Howe: \"It was a tough one for us. A lot of aspects of our play were very good, especially in that opening period. The discussion at half-time was of course that we weren't winning, but deserved to be winning by more than one. They made some good substitutions and the game was different.\" 2:00 Jose Mourinho praised his Manchester United side for their character in coming from behind at Bournemouth, but feels instability still remains Jose Mourinho praised his Manchester United side for their character in coming from behind at Bournemouth, but feels instability still remains Jose Mourinho: \"It was a first half that could, should be, game over, 5-2, 6-2 easily, and in the second half until we scored I had the feeling we were a very unlucky team because we should score three, four, five goals. We were really poor, defensively awful.\" What's next? Bournemouth make the trip to Newcastle for their last game before the international break at 3pm next Saturday. United, meanwhile, head to Juventus in the Champions League on Wednesday before travelling to across Manchester for the derby against City on Renault Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier

Cardiff City 1-0 on an emotion-filled day at the Cardiff City Stadium. There were tears and tributes ahead of kick-off to remember Srivaddhanaprabha and the four other people who were killed in a helicopter crash last weekend. Victor Camarasa hit the bar for the visitors with a free-kick in the first half before Cardiff defender Sol Bamba escaped a red card for a goal-line save with his arm.

Cardiff were unable to rally and there were moving scenes after the final whistle as Leicester players, most of whom are travelling to Thailand after the match for Srivaddhanaprabha's funeral, stood in front of the away supporters and applauded for 10 minutes. 3:02 There were emotional scenes prior to kick-off as the whole stadium paid their respects There were emotional scenes prior to kick-off as the whole stadium paid their respects Some fans held up messages, while others struggled to hold back their emotions. Leicester manager Claude Puel had said ahead of the match he wanted to find a \"good balance between emotion and concentration\", but it was emotion that ruled ahead of kick-off. Players and supporters wore T-shirts honouring Srivaddhanaprabha and Cardiff fans passed a Thai flag with the crests of both clubs into the away end before an impeccably-observed minute's silence. Leicester players wore tribute T-shirts during their warm-up All of the Leicester players and staff stood on the centre circle for the minute's silence, with goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel appearing emotional and there were tears among the away supporters. Considering the events off the pitch, it was little surprise that the first half was largely low key. 1:48 Leicester players unveiled a 'Thank you Vichai' banner after the match as they stood with their fans Leicester players unveiled a 'Thank you Vichai' banner after the match as they stood with their fans Camarasa hit the bar with a free-kick in the 31st minute, shortly after Harry Maguire had gone off with an injury. Leicester improved as the half wore on and Wilfred Ndidi headed wide from a corner in the 37th minute. A Thai flag was passed around the ground before kick-off However, the biggest talking point came in injury-time when Jamie Vardy's shot was tipped onto the bar by Bamba's outstretched arm. Referee Lee Probert, whose view appeared to be blocked, waved away Leicester's strenuous appeals for a penalty. Leicester players had appeals for a penalty ignored But the Foxes did take the lead after the break when Chilwell crossed for Gray to finish from close to the penalty spot. Gray was booked for his tribute to Srivaddhanaprabha, but only after impassioned celebrations from the Leicester players in front of their supporters. Team news Harry Arter started for Cardiff after recovering from an ankle injury, replacing Junior Hoilett. Leicester made five changes, with Wes Morgan returning from suspension and Demarai Gray making his first start since September. Danny Simpson was on the bench for the first time this season. Cardiff never really threatened to get back into the match and Leicester should have scored again as Jonny Evans missed a header from close range and Vardy was denied by Neil Etheridge late on. Opta stats Cardiff have enjoyed just one win in their last 15 Premier League games, drawing three and losing 11. Leicester are the only side to score in each of their Premier League games this season (11 games). Cardiff have failed to score in six Premier League games this season, a joint-divisional high along with Huddersfield and Southampton. Leicester have won seven of their last nine Premier League games against promoted sides (D1 L1). Leicester have won three of their last five Premier League away games (L2), as many victories as they had managed in their previous 12 on the road in the competition (D1 L8). Demarai Gray has registered goal involvements in consecutive Premier League for only the second time ever (scoring v Cardiff and assisting v West Ham), and the first time since December 2017. Man of the match - Demarai Gray In a difficult game, it was Gray's moment of composure that proved the difference. The 22-year-old finished well from Chilwell's cross to secure victory and spark celebrations. The managers Claude Puel: \"It was a difficult game to prepare and difficult to play. From the first minute to the last we kept out concentration and our desire and we played well. We deserve the result and it's a fantastic opportunity to honour our chairman and it was fantastic coming here with our fans and staff. Now it's just the first step and I hope we can manage the next week with the same feeling but it will be difficult because we have the funeral and come back in the middle of the week and then have to prepare for the game against Burnley, the first game at home.\" 3:55 Leicester City manager Claude Puel says his side found a good balance between emotion and concentration Leicester City manager Claude Puel says his side found a good balance between emotion and concentration Neil Warnock: \"It was a strange afternoon. It has been all week, surreal almost. I'm disappointed with the result as I thought the lads gave everything. I thought we started well but one or two decisions didn't go our way. Just before the goal I thought there was a foul on [Josh] Murphy and he has been giving fouls like that all afternoon. The lads gave everything, it's just that bit of quality in the final third.

Chris Hughton's side had won their last three games heading into Saturday's clash, but were outplayed from the outset, with Richarlison (26) scoring his first in wonderful style. Lewis Dunk (33) levelled for Brighton, but five minutes after the break Seamus Coleman scored his first goal in almost two years - and an error from Dunk then allowed Richarlison (77) through on goal for his second. Everton stay in ninth place with 18 points while Brighton drop down to 12th, with the Seagulls yet to win at Goodison Park in any competition after seven visits. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (6), Coleman (7), Keane (7), Zouma (7), Digne (7), Gomes (7), Gueye (7), Walcott (7), Sigurdsson (7), Bernard (7), Richarlison (8).

Subs used: Knockaert (6), Bissouma (4), Andone (4). Man of the match: Richarlison. Gylfi Sigurdsson had two great chances to give Everton an early lead. He skewed a shot across the face of goal before firing an effort into the side-netting after a wonderful cross from Lucas Digne. But Everton did make the breakthrough in the 26th minute. It was a marvellous breakaway from a Brighton corner, with Sigurdsson - who had started the initial break before playing a give-and-go with Bernard - slotting the ball into the path of Richarlison, who lifted the ball over Mat Ryan and into the top of the net. Seven minutes later, though, and Brighton were level. Alireza Jahanbakhsh played a short corner to Solly March along the left wing, and he then lofted the ball into the box for Dunk to nod home his first goal of the season. Team news Both managers named the same 18-man squads from their last Premier League outings, including the same starting XIs. Idrissa Gueye hit the post in the opening three minutes of the second half, with Everton adding their second not long afterwards. It came from nothing as a tussle between Andre Gomes and Beram Kayal saw the ball poked into the path of Coleman, who fired home low and hard to put the hosts back ahead. It was his first goal since scoring against Crystal Palace in January 2017. Everton continued to see the better of possession and added their third in the 77th minute after a mistake from Dunk. His loose pass for Shane Duffy was intercepted by Richarlison, who turned around the Republic of Ireland international and rounded the oncoming Ryan before slotting home into the empty net. Seamus Coleman netted his first goal since January 2017 Jordan Pickford was called into his only save of the game with three minutes to play. After Everton failed to properly clear a Brighton free-kick, Anthony Knockaert slipped the ball down the right flank for Jahanbakhsh, but his effort on the angle was pushed over the crossbar by Pickford's fingertips. Yerry Mina also made a five-minute debut for Everton at the end of the game - having not featured since his move from Barcelona in August due to injury - and was given a warm reception by the Goodison Park crowd. Notes for Southgate England manager Gareth Southgate was watching on at Goodison Park, and will have had his eye on Michael Keane and Theo Walcott, who started for Everton. His No1 Jordan Pickford had little to do, although did make a good save when called into action. Brighton defender Lewis Dunk had a mixed afternoon - scoring but making a mistake for Richarlison's second - while Glenn Murray would not have done too much to force himself into Southgate's thinking. The managers Marco Silva: \"It was a pleasure to see how we played and how we won the game. Honestly, we really deserved the three points and, in my opinion, it was our best performance at home this season. 3:32 Marco Silva calls Everton's 3-1 win over Brighton their best home performance this season Marco Silva calls Everton's 3-1 win over Brighton their best home performance this season \"The only thing I didn't like was the corner when they scored to make it 1-1 because they didn't have a chance to score and Jordan (Pickford) made just one save at the end of the match. We controlled the match with the ball, without the ball we did well, but in that moment, we have to do better.\" Chris Hughton: \"It was a tough game for us. We're up against a team who have spent big but brought quality players in and at times that really showed today. 2:44 Brighton boss Chris Hughton says his side need to be better to beat side's that have 'spent big on quality players' after their 3-1 defeat to Everton in the Premier League Brighton boss Chris Hughton says his side need to be better to beat side's that have 'spent big on quality players' after their 3-1 defeat to Everton in the Premier League \"We had to dig deep and got ourselves back in the game. We had a really good period at the end of that second half, but at 1-1, we had to start the second half better than we did. Certainly, we needed to make sure we didn't concede as early as we did.\" Opta stats Richarlison scores his first goal of the afternoon for Everton Everton have enjoyed four wins in their last five Premier League games (L1), as many victories as they managed in their previous 14 in the competition. Brighton have managed just one win in their last 19 Premier League away games, drawing five and losing 13. All 11 of Everton forward Richarlison's Premier League goals have come under manager Marco Silva (11 in 33 apps under Silva, 0 in 14 apps under Javi Gracia). 10 of Lewis Dunk's 12 league goals for Brighton have been headers. Man of the match - Richarlison Richarlison scored twice during the game at Goodison Park It was another fine performance from the Brazilian forward, who netted his fifth and sixth goals of the Premier League season. He was a menace in attack, drawing a number of fouls from the Brighton players, and took both goals well. His first was a superb strike while the second showed some great positioning and anticipation to get onto a poor pass. What's next? Both teams are live on Sky Sports next weekend, with Brighton going to Cardiff on Saturday for a lunchtime kick-off before Everton travel to Chelsea on Renault Super Sunday."},{"date": "03/11/2019",

"report": "2:52 Newcastle 1-0 Watford Newcastle 1-0 Watford Newcastle recorded their first Premier League victory of the season as Ayoze Perez scored in a 1-0 win over Watford on Saturday. Having failed to win any of their opening 10 league games of a season for just the second time in their history, the relief around St James Park' was clear to see when the striker headed home (64). Rafa Benitez's men had to ride their luck at times as Roberto Pereyra hit the crossbar and Gerard Deulofeu was especially wasteful with his finishing in the first half. The victory, which lifts Newcastle out of the relegation zone, may have come at a cost though as Benitez lost Jamaal Lascelles, Jonjo Shelvey and Yoshinori Muto to injuries. Gerard Deulofeu reacts after missing a chance against Newcastle Watford started brightly and Adrian Mariappa should have punished Newcastle's sloppy marking but he fired wide from eight yards out. Deulofeu skewed a shot wide from close range after a great run from Jose Holebas but was even more wasteful minutes later when spurning a one-on-one with Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka. Team news Both teams made one change from their previous games with Solomon Rondon replacing Ayoze Perez up top for Newcastle and Jose Holebas came in fro Adam Masina for Watford. After the break, it was still Watford doing the more creative work in the final third as Newcastle had to adapt to losing both Shelvey, Lascelles and Muto to injuries. A Watford goal would have knocked Newcastle for six but Pereyra's curling 50th-minute effort came back off the crossbar and Craig Cathcart headed over when well placed. Player Ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Dummett (7), Lascelles (6), Fernandez (7), Yedlin (7), Shelvey (6), Diame (7), Ritchie (6), Kenedy (8), Rondon (6), Muto (6) Subs: Perez (7), Ki (8), Schar (7) Watford: Foster (6), Femenia (6), Mariappa (6), Cathcart (6), Holebas (6), Doucoure (6), Capoue (6), Hughes (6), Deulofeu (5), Pereyra (7), Success (5) Subs: Okaka (5), Gray (6), Chalobah (5) Man of the match: Kenedy Newcastle remained in the game and with 25 minutes remaining edged in front. Ki Sung-yueng - Shelvey's replacement - curled in a majestic set-piece which was glanced into the net by Perez. The relief around St James' was clear to see. Benitez's men closed the game out in relatively solid style but Stefan Okaka should have equalised for Watford in stoppage time but blazed over from eight yards out. Opta stats Newcastle earned their first victory in all competitions against Watford since a Championship game in February 2010, ending a run of five consecutive defeats against the Hornets. A league-high share 57% of Newcastle's Premier League goals this season have been headers (4/7). Watford mustered 16 shots in this match, but just one of these was on target. 13 of their attempts came in the opening 45 minutes. Pérez scored his first goal in 11 Premier League games for Newcastle, since netting twice against Chelsea on the final day of the 2017-18 season. This was Rafael Benitez's 50th win as Newcastle manager in all competitions, in his 116th game in charge of the Magpies. Man of the match: Kenedy The Brazilian - more known for his silky skills rather than tough tackles - epitomised Newcastle's approach with an all-action and hugely determined display. He was always an outlet for the hosts going forward but it was his defensive work that caught the eye with his standout moment coming in the closing stages when he sprinted back 40 yards to make a last-ditch tackle on Andre Gray, who looked set to equalise. Kenedy Pundit reaction: Charlie Nicholas \"If Watford had gone in at half-time in front, then Newcastle would've been in trouble. But gradually they ground it out, with all the substitutions. \"It was dogged determination that got them through this. The player who stood out was Diame. He's not always been at it, but I thought today he was very, very impressive. \"When this team is nervous, they have to sit in and get their discipline sorted out. But the substitutions worked for them. \"They showed determination, but it could've been so different. Deulofeu is so frustrating. One day he's brilliant and at other times, he's laughable. \"Now Newcastle are out the bottom three. It was a massive win for them.\" What's next? Newcastle are back at St James' Park next Saturday when Bournemouth visit while Watford have another away day, this time at Southampton."},{"date": "03/11/2019", "arena": "London Stadium",

4-2 Burnley Felipe Anderson scored twice as West Ham overcame Burnley 4-2 in a pulsating game at the London Stadium. Marko Arnautovic put the hosts in front after capitalising on James Tarkowski's mistake before Johann Gudmundsson equalised against the run of play on the stroke of half-time. West Ham regained the lead as Anderson finished off a free-flowing move but Burnley pegged them back again as Robbie Brady set up fellow substitute Chris Wood for their second goal. With six minutes remaining, Anderson's goal put West Ham in front for a third time and after Wood hit the bar, Javier Hernandez sealed the points in stoppage time with an emphatic finish. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (6), Zabaleta (6), Diop (6), Balbuena (6), Cresswell (6), Rice (7), Obiang (6), Snodgrass (6), Anderson (8), Diangana (8), Arnautovic (7) Subs: Antonio (6), Hernandez (7), Ogbonna (N/A) Burnley: Hart (7), Lowton (6), Tarkowski (5), Mee (7), Taylor (6), Gudmundsson (7), Defour (6), Westwood (7), Lennon (5), Vokes (5), Vydra (5) Subs: Brady (7), Wood (7), Barnes (6) Man of the match: Felipe Anderson Manuel Pellegrini had labelled the game as 'must-win' and his side certainly started the game positively, with Arnautovic putting them in front on 11 minutes after robbing Tarkowski and then sliding the ball beyond his former teammate Joe Hart. Marko Arnautovic seized upon a sloppy mistake by James Tarkowski to hand West Ham the lead It was almost 2-0 to the hosts when Anderson's goal-bound effort was miraculously kept out by Ben Mee, while the lively Grady Diangana should have been awarded a penalty after a trip from Steven Defour. Instead, it was Burnley who got the game's second goal as Gudmundsson broke the offside trap and finished beyond Lukasz Fabianski after latching on to Ashley Westwood's defence-splitting pass. West Ham continued to dominate after the restart and Anderson regained their lead with a fine finish on 68 minutes following good link-up play by Arnautovic and Diangana. Diangana was sent flying by a dreadful challenge from Tarkowski after he picked out Anderson and the England international was cautioned for the challenge, which perhaps warranted further punishment. Team news Manuel Pellegrini made three changes to the team that drew with Leicester last weekend. Pedro Obiang replaced the suspended Mark Noble in midfield while Aaron Cresswell and Mark Arnautovic were recalled for Arthur Masuaku and Javier Hernandez.Sean Dyche also named three changes as Aaron Lennon, Ashley Westwood and Matej Vydra came in for Robbie Brady, the injured Jack Cork and Jeff Hendrick. The visitors showed their character again, though, by equalising 10 minutes later. Just two minutes after coming on, Brady whipped in a corner for Wood to head into the corner of the net. A couple of minutes later, West Ham missed a gilt-edged chance to go in front for a third time when Anderson's curling strike kissed the far post. However, the Brazilian made amends shortly after when his shot took a huge deflection off Mee to leave Hart with no chance. There was further drama when Wood - who scored twice in the corresponding fixture last season - saw a header crash off the bar but in the end, it was West Ham who grabbed the sixth and final goal of the game when Hernandez slammed a shot into the roof of the net after being picked out by Michail Antonio. Opta stats West Ham have won six of their nine Premier League meetings with Burnley (D1 L2). Burnley have won just once in their last eight Premier League away games (D2 L5), losing four of the last five. Burnley have failed to keep a clean sheet in nine of their last 10 Premier League games, shipping at least twice in six of those contests. Felipe Anderson has netted more goals today (2) than he did in his first 10 Premier League appearances for West Ham (1). Anderson is the first Brazilian player to net a brace for West Ham in the Premier League. Burnley's Chris Wood has been directly involved in five goals in three Premier League games versus West Ham (4 goals, 1 assist). Since the start of last season, Johann Berg Gudmundsson has been directly involved in 16 Premier League goals (4 goals, 12 assists) - more than any other Burnley player. West Ham's Marko Arnautovic is now the highest goalscorer in all competitions at the London Stadium (9 goals). Only Jermain Defoe (24) and Olivier Giroud (19) have scored more goals as substitute in Premier League history than West Ham striker Javier Hernandez (17). Notes for Southgate Declan Rice seems to be growing in influence with each passing week and was impressive at the base of West Ham's midfield once again. Whether Gareth Southgate feels he needs him right now considering his similarities to Eric Dier, is another matter but he certainly looks a prospect, as does Grady Diangana. James Tarkowski, meanwhile, endured a torrid afternoon, making a costly mistake for West Ham's opener and he was fortunate to not see red for a wild challenge on Diangana in the build-up to West Ham's second goal. Man of the match - Felipe Anderson Grady Diangana ran him close, but Felipe Anderson's two goals proved to be the difference between the two teams on the day. In the build-up to the game, Manuel Pellegrini called on Anderson to show more, saying he was 'not happy' with the contribution of West Ham's record signing. Those words certainly had the desired effect as Anderson was an influential figure from start to finish, scoring twice, hitting the post, forcing a remarkable goal-line save from Ben Mee and playing his part in the build-up to the fourth goal in stoppage time. Anderson had 103 touches in total - 25 more than any other player on the pitch - which highlights his involvement in what was a crucial win for the club. What's next? West Ham travel to the John Smith's Stadium to take on Huddersfield next Saturday while Burnley play a second consecutive away game against Leicester City at the King Power, also on Saturday."},{"date": "03/11/2019", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59993, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Bernd Leno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

Emirates on Saturday Liverpool hit the woodwork twice through Roberto Firmino and Virgil van Dijk during a frantic but goalless first half and had a fair goal from Sadio Mane disallowed for offside. The visitors took the lead through James Milner (61) after Bernd Leno had pushed a Mane cross into his path, but Arsenal drew level through Lacazette's sweet finish from 12 yards (82). James Milner put Liverpool ahead Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (5), Bellerin (6), Mustafi (5), Holding (7), Kolasinac (7), Xhaka (6), Torreira (8), Mkhitaryan (6), Ozil (6), Aubameyang (6), Lacazette (7) Subs: Iwobi (7), Ramsey (6), Welbeck (NA) Liverpool: Alisson (5), Alexander-Arnold (5), Gomez (7), Van Dijk (8), Robertson (7), Fabinho (4), Milner (7), Wijnaldum (6), Salah (6), Firmino (6), Mane (6) Subs: Shaqiri (NA), Matip (NA) Man of the match: Virgil van Dijk The result means Liverpool temporarily go top of the Premier League ahead of Manchester City's clash with Southampton on Sunday, while Arsenal remain unbeaten in 14 games. The first half was played at breakneck speed with several chances for both sides. Henrikh Mkhitaryan got up above an uncertain Alisson to head just wide of goal from a deep cross, before Liverpool went up the other end and had the ball in the net. Milner's ball over the top of Arsenal's defence found Firmino, who poked the ball against the post only for the ball to fall into Mane's path. He tapped home, but the flag was up, despite Mane being offside from the first phase of play, but behind the ball for Firmino's effort at goal. Team news Arsenal made two changes following the 2-2 draw at Palace; Kolasniac and Mkhitaryan came in, replacing Guendouzi and Iwobi. Xhaka moved from left-back to midfield. For Liverpool there were three changes; Lovren, Moreno and Lallana came out, replaced by Robertson, Gomez and Milner. Lovren was out of the squad completely due to injury. Alexandre Lacazette fails to beat Alisson Leno then saved well from Van Dijk after the defender took the ball down well in the area and shot, before Lacazette struck just wide from an angle at the other end. Lacazette then had a goal correctly disallowed himself for offside, and Liverpool should have gone into the break ahead as Leno's missed punch allowed Van Dijk to glance towards goal and off the post. Arsenal fell behind just after the hour mark as Mane's left-wing cross was tipped away by Leno into the path of Milner, and the midfielder composed himself to drill into the net from 15 yards for his 50th Premier League goal. James Milner's driven effort from the edge of the box gave Liverpool the lead Moments later Lucas Torreira could only shoot straight at Alisson as the play opened up in front of goal, while Firmino and Van Dijk went close with headers from corners as Arsenal struggled to deal with Liverpool from set pieces. Arsenal got their leveller with eight minutes remaining as substitute Alex Iwobi played Lacazette through on goal; as he half-rounded Alisson, he turned back to goal and found the far corner with a sweet finish after taking a touch to compose himself 12 yards out. Man of the match - Virgil van Dijk A tough choice between Van Dijk and Lucas Torreira, but the Dutch defender just steals it with another superb display. Van Dijk was dominant as Liverpool came under siege numerous times in the first half, and even showed his quality in the opposition box, going close with a fierce header in the second half. Furthermore, his passing accuracy was 94.4 per cent, far and away the best in the Liverpool team and also a game-high. This deserved a clean sheet, but it wasn't to come. Opta stats Liverpool are unbeaten in their opening 11 matches to a Premier League campaign for the first time since the 2007/08 campaign. Arsenal have won more points from losing positions than any other Premier League side in 2018/19 (8). Arsenal are winless in their last seven Premier League meetings with Liverpool (D3 L4). Arsenal have not led at half-time in any of their 11 Premier League matches so far this season. However, the Gunners have scored more goals after the break than any other side (19). What's next? Arsenal now face Sporting Lisbon in the Europa League on Thursday evening at 8pm, while Liverpool go to Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League group stage at 5.55pm on Tuesday."},{"date":

Wolves 2-3 Tottenham Wolves 2-3 Tottenham Harry Kane scored for the first time in four league games as Tottenham moved into fourth with a nervy 3-2 win over Wolves at Molineux. Two quickfire Spurs first-half goals looked to have done the damage, with Erik Lamela slotting beyond Rui Patricio (27) and Lucas Moura left unmarked to head in a second three minutes later, although Raul Jimenez's strike shortly after should have cut the deficit but was wrongly chalked off for offside. Kane avoided setting his longest run without a league goal in more than three years by netting at the second attempt on the hour to seemingly put the game to bed, but Wolves struck back instantly with Ruben Neves' penalty, before Jimenez added another from the spot with 11 minutes to go to set up a tense finish. But Hugo Lloris was untested in the final moments of the game as Spurs claimed a much-needed victory and remain a point above their tally at this stage last season, with 24 from 11 games. Player ratings Wolves: Patricio (7), Bennett (6), Coady (6), Boly (7), Doherty (6), Neves (7), Moutinho (7), Jonny (6), Cavaleiro (5), Jimenez (7), Costa (7). Subs: Gibbs-White (7), Bonatini (6), Traore (5). Tottenham: Lloris (7), Trippier (5), Alderweireld (5), Foyth (5), Davies (6), Sissoko (6), Dembele (N/A), Winks (6), Moura (7), Kane (7), Lamela (8). Subs: Son (6), Eriksen (6), Sanchez (5). Man of the match: Erik Lamela The game's slow early rhythm was not helped by a long enforced stoppage when Mousa Dembele was forced off with injury, and the only save either keeper made in the opening 25 minutes came when Patricio kept out Kane's effort from the edge of the box. But their next attack would prove more clinical, and was started and finished by Lamela, who drifted off the right before exchanging passes with Heung-Min Son and firing through Patricio's legs. Wolves were clearly still reeling after conceding the opener, having dealt with Tottenham well until that point, but allowed them to grab a quick second when Kieran Trippier was given space to cross for an unmarked 5ft 8in Moura to nod in at the far post, with the hosts' considerably larger three defenders all letting him go. Before the break, they collectively made up for that error as Jimenez swept home Moutinho's pull-back - but the Portuguese midfielder was wrongly pulled up as offside by the near assistant referee, despite being half a yard behind Toby Alderweireld. Team news Wolves made a change for the second game in a row, having stuck with the same team for their first nine league games. Ivan Cavaleiro was preferred to Adama Traore. Tottenham made two changes from their last league game, with Harry Winks in for Eric Dier and Juan Foyth handed a league debut and Davinson Sanchez on the bench. Wolves grew their momentum after the break and tested Lloris with strikes from Jimenez and Neves, but Spurs showed their clinical touch again to secure a three-goal lead when Kane fired past Patricio from the angle after the goalkeeper had kept out his initial effort. And that goal would end up proving crucial, after Wolves mounted a fightback which began when Foyth clattered into Jimenez inside the box after Trippier had been caught out trying to nutmeg Leo Bonatini. Neves stepped up from the spot to pull a goal back, and Wolves were soon given another penalty when Foyth was again penalised for hauling down Jonny. There was no chance for Neves to double his tally for the night this time, and Jimenez instead stepped up and fired into the opposite corner. What would VAR have changed? At 2-0 down, a Wolves comeback goal could have made all the difference at Molineux in front of a crowd who were still well behind their team. Joao Moutinho was wrongly judged to be offside when setting up Raul Jimenez for a chance he put beyond Hugo Lloris - and the goal would have stood were VAR available. Who knows how the game would have ended then? But with 11 minutes to find an unlikely equaliser, Wolves never really tested Lloris after Mauricio Pochettino brought on a third central defender in Davinson Sanchez, and the hosts were condemned to their third straight league defeat. Man of the match - Erik Lamela Lamela was a thorn in the Wolves defence for much of the game. There were no faultless performances at Molineux but the Argentine looked full of the kind of confidence you get from four goals in seven games from midfield. He was a threat throughout, and his movement helped him to forge a fine chance to grab a second for himself, though his touch let him down in the end. Opta facts Tottenham have won 24 points from their 11 Premier League games this season, only in 2011-12 (25) have they picked up more at this stage of a single campaign in the competition. Wolves have won none of their last 25 Premier League matches against sides starting the day in the top half of the table (D10 L15). Spurs have only lost two of their last 17 away games in the Premier League (W12 D3), winning each of the last four in a row. Tottenham are unbeaten in their last 39 Premier League games against promoted sides (W36 D3). Spurs' Erik Lamela has had a hand in 11 goals in his last 12 appearances in all competitions (8 goals, 3 assists). Tottenham's Harry Kane has scored 27 goals in his last 27 away Premier League games. Tottenham's Harry Kane has scored against 27 of the 28 teams that he's faced in the Premier League, with the only exception being Cardiff City (3 apps). Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves' penalty goal was his first league goal scored inside the box in English football, with his previous seven coming outside the box. What's next? Tottenham need to beat PSV on Tuesday night at 8pm to keep their Champions League qualification hopes alive, while Wolves travel to Arsenal at 4.30pm on Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League."},{"date": "29/10/2019", "arena": "Wembley Stadium", "attendance": 56854, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals":

Tottenham 0-1 Man City Tottenham 0-1 Man City Riyad Mahrez's early goal gave Manchester City a 1-0 win over Tottenham at Wembley to send them back to the top of the Premier League. Mahrez's close-range finish gave the champions the victory after Kieran Trippier's mistake (6), and the former Leicester man raised his hands to the sky in celebration, afterwards dedicating the goal to Foxes owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha following his tragic death. David Silva somehow missed from close range after the break, and Spurs missed their big chance late on as Erik Lamela struck over the bar from 10 yards with the goal gaping. 2:16 An emotional Mahrez paid tribute to Leicester owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.

Much of the talk pre-game was of the state of the Wembley turf following the NFL fixture on Sunday, and City chose to bypass a worn-out central area for their early opener. Ederson's long punt caused problems for Trippier, who got caught under the ball and allowed Raheem Sterling to ease into the area, before Mahrez slotted home his centre from eight yards. Toby Alderweireld and Bernardo Silva battle for the ball Harry Kane then struck narrowly over from 25 yards, Toby Alderweireld directed an unmarked header straight at Ederson, while at the other end Mahrez's effort from a tight angle was tipped onto the post by Hugo Lloris. David Silva missed a glorious chance to make it 2-0 after the break from Bernardo Silva's square ball, bizarrely choosing to take a touch from six yards with the majority of the goal to aim at. Team news Spurs made just one change from the win over West Ham, with Moussa Dembele coming in for Harry Winks, while Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen were on the bench. There were two City changes; Raheem Sterling and Kyle Walker returned, with Vincent Kompany and Leroy Sane dropping out. Much of the pre-match talk centred around the Wembley pitch after Sunday's NFL fixture Eventually, Sterling saw his effort blocked and Spurs survived, much to the anger of Pep Guardiola in the dugout. Sergio Aguero should have done better as he struck straight at Lloris from 10 yards in space, and Spurs were somehow still in it with 10 minutes remaining as Erik Lamela skied over from 10 yards with just Ederson to beat from Dele Alli's pass. The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"[Manchester City] is a team that is focused on trying to win titles, we are focused on different things, not only to win games, but still the gap is not big, but we have to respect the gap and we have still not achieved the level of Manchester City.\" 2:22 Mauricio Pochettino said the early goal made things difficult but praised his side's performance Mauricio Pochettino said the early goal made things difficult but praised his side's performance Pep Guardiola: \"In the big events, especially in the Champions League, we need to be more clinical in this situation because sooner or later we are not going to win.\" 3:53 Pep Guardiola says his side need to be more clinical and concedes their missed chances almost cost them victory Pep Guardiola says his side need to be more clinical and concedes their missed chances almost cost them victory The pundit Gary Neville on MNF: \"The impressive things is City's defending. Their record is fantastic. We wondered a year ago whether Stones could step in along with Laporte - they've only conceded one goal as a pairing. Guardiola has bled them into this team gently. If they stay fit and grow together they could be something special. Laporte was outstanding tonight. Not conceding goals gives you so much confidence.\" 4:46 Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher went head to head over Tottenham's spending Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher went head to head over Tottenham's spending Man of the match - Aymeric Laporte Neville was impressed, but the Spurs strikeforce weren't. Laporte, alongside Stones, refused to let the hosts through, and put in a masterful performance both positionally and in the air. His seven clearances was a team-high, as City's fine defensive form continues with the French centre-half. Opta stats Manchester City became the first non-London side to win five consecutive Premier League games in the capital, with all wins coming in 2018 (against Arsenal twice, Spurs twice and West Ham). Two of Tottenham's four Premier League defeats at Wembley have been at the hands of Manchester City. Manchester City have conceded just three goals in their first 10 Premier League games this season - in top-flight history, only one team have conceded fewer in their first 10 games of a season (Chelsea in 2004/05, two conceded). Spurs have lost two home Premier League matches in a calendar year against a single opponent for the first time since 2005, when they lost twice against Chelsea at White Hart Lane. What's next?

Player ratings Burnley: Hart (8), Lowton (7), Taylor (6), Cork (6), Tarkowski (6), Mee (6), Gudmundsson (7), Hendrick (6), Defour (6), Vokes (6), Brady (6) Subs: Barnes (6), Wood (5), Westwood (6) Chelsea: Kepa (6), Rudiger (7), Luiz (7), Alonso (7), Azpilicueta (7), Jorginho (7), Kante (8), Barkley (9), Pedro (6), Willian (8), Morata (8) Subs: Fabregas (6), Loftus-Cheek (7), Giroud (7) Man of the match: Ross Barkley Burnley rarely threatened after a bright opening 10 minutes which saw the returning Robbie Brady volley just wide and they remain on nine points, just three clear of the relegation zone. Chelsea looked set for a tough day in the Lancashire sunshine as Burnley snapped into tackles and pegged back their visitors, but Sarri's side warmed to their task and after Hart had leapt to tip Morata's instinctive header wide, Willian then bent a shot onto the post. Moments later Chelsea were ahead, as N'Golo Kante fed Barkley, the England midfielder's super touch releasing Morata (22) into the box and his cool finish left Hart with no chance for his fourth goal of the season. Alvaro Morata opened the scoring on 22 minutes James Tarkowski then headed over from eight yards as Burnley sought an immediate response, but it was Chelsea who continued to dominate despite losing Pedro to injury on 30 minutes - the Spaniard replaced by Loftus-Cheek. Hart was then forced into a second superb save - charging out to deny Morata after Jorginho's exquisite chip had beaten the offside trap - but he could do nothing about Barkley's 25-yard strike - the midfielder driving forwards and drilling home with his left foot on 57 minutes. Team News Burnley welcomed Robbie Brady back into their side for the first time since last December. He replaced the injured Aaron Lennon in the Clarets’ only change. Chelsea were without the injured Eden Hazard once again as Maurizio Sarri made eight changes to the side that beat BATE in the Europa League. Kepa, Willian and Pedro were the only players to start both games, with Thursday’s hat-trick hero Ruben Loftus-Cheek forced to accept a place on the bench. Willian added a third five minutes later, cutting inside and bending a shot past Hart into the corner, although it looked to take a nick off a defender's knee on the way through. And Chelsea saw the game out in style - with Hart making his third world-class save to tip Olivier Giroud's header onto the post before Loftus-Cheek added to his Europa League hat-trick with a bundled finish in added time. 2:30 Sean Dyche says his side played quite well but were punished by a top Chelsea side in their 4-0 defeat in the Premier League. Sean Dyche says his side played quite well but were punished by a top Chelsea side in their 4-0 defeat in the Premier League. Opta stats Burnley have won just two points from their last 13 home Premier League games against the 'big six', drawing two and losing 11 since a 2-0 win over Liverpool in August 2016. Chelsea are unbeaten after the first 10 games of a top-flight season for just the fifth time in their history alongside 1964-65, 1966-67, 2005-06 and 2014-15 - they went on to win the title in the two most recent occasions. Chelsea's Ross Barkley has scored in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time in his career and is the first Englishman to do this for Chelsea since Frank Lampard in 2013. Ten of Willian's 27 Premier League goals for Chelsea have come from outside the box (37 per cent); more than any other Chelsea player since Willian made his debut in October 2013. After scoring a hat-trick in the Europa League on Thursday, Ruben Loftus-Cheek scored his second Premier League goal for Chelsea in 25 appearances, 939 days since his first against Aston Villa in April 2016. Man of the match - Ross Barkley Ross Barkley continues to show his importance to this Chelsea side with a goal and an assist. The Blues were excellent from front to back and both Alvaro Morata and Willian were equally eye-catching, but Barkley's hand in the crucial opening two goals that killed the game earns him the award. His touch for Morata's opener was perfect and with Burnley eager to get back into it at the start of the second half, he took control and drilled home a brilliant second. 2:02 Maurizio Sarri felt his side controlled their match with Burnley and was particularly pleased to see Alvaro Morata get on the score sheet. Maurizio Sarri felt his side controlled their match with Burnley and was particularly pleased to see Alvaro Morata get on the score sheet. The managers Sean Dyche: \"On reflection, we've played two top sides the last two weeks and they've delivered top performances, and it's very difficult when they do that. You need them to have a quiet day and you to have a top day and I don't think today we were a million miles away with our performance, but we got punished four times and three of those were very good play from them.\" Maurizio Sarri: \"For 10 minutes it was very difficult at the beginning. Then we started to play very well and we managed the match well, better than other matches. I am very happy for Alvaro, for Loftus-Cheek again. I am disappointed for Giroud because today he could have scored and he needs a goal. But everything is okay we played very well, in full control for 80 minutes apart from the first 10.\" What's next? Burnley travel to the capital to take on West Ham at 3pm next Saturday, while Chelsea host Derby County in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday ahead of a Premier League London derby with Crystal Palace on

Highlights from Crystal Palace's draw against Arsenal in the Premier League. Arsenal's 11-game winning run came to an end at Crystal Palace, who scored from the penalty spot twice in a pulsating 2-2 draw on Super Sunday. Luka Milivojevic, who missed a penalty in the defeat at Everton, put Palace in front from 12 yards (45+1) but a stunning free-kick from Granit Xhaka (51) and a controversial Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang goal (56) - Alexandre Lacazette appeared to handle in the build-up - seemed to put Arsenal on their way to a record-breaking 12th straight win in all competitions. However, Wilfried Zaha teased Xhaka into a debatable foul inside the box and Milivojevic stayed cool once again (83) to register Palace's first point at Selhurst Park this season. The players sported black armbands with both clubs paying respect to those affected by the helicopter crash at Leicester City. Player Ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Van Aanholt (7), Tomkins (6), Sakho (7), Wan-Bissaka (8), Milivojevic (7), McArthur (6), Kouyate (6), Townsend (6), Zaha (8), Ayew (6) Subs: Meyer (6), Sorloth (6), Puncheon (6) Arsenal: Leno (6), Bellerin (6), Mustafi (5), Holding (6), Guendouzi (6), Torreira (7), Xhaka (6), Ozil (6), Iwobi (6), Lacazette (6), Aubameyang (7) Subs: Welbeck (6), Lichtsteiner (5), Ramsey (6) Man of the match: Wilfried Zaha Palace started brightly with Zaha hitting the post and Andros Townsend firing wide after a free-flowing move down the left wing. The opening goal came just before the break when Shokrtran Mustafi needlessly tripped Cheikhou Kouyate inside the area. Milivojevic made amends for his miss at Goodison Park, finding the bottom corner with a perfect penalty. Team news Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang returned to the starting line-up in one of two changes made by Unai Emery as Matteo Guendouzi was handed a start. Roy Hodgson brought Andre Ayew back into the fold to lead the line. Arsenal responded after the break and were level inside six minutes, Xhaka thumping home a free-kick past Wayne Hennessey from the corner of the box. Granit Xhaka celebrates scoring against Crystal Palace The visitors were galvanised by the goal and found their stride. Five minutes later they were ahead, but it was shrouded in controversy. Lacazette appeared to use his hand to guide the ball towards Aubameyang, who forced the ball towards goal. It looked borderline whether it had crossed the line but goalline technology proved it had by just 11 millimetres. Matteo Guendouzi challenges Andros Townsend Arsenal could not find the required quality on the counter to get a decisive third goal and Zaha, who had been a constant menace, provided the game-changing moment with seven minutes remaining. He teased Xhaka into dangling a leg inside the area and a penalty was awarded. Milivojevic again stepped up and powered an effort into the corner. Opta stats Crystal Palace's opening goal from Milivojevic ended a run of 417 minutes without scoring a league goal at home. Seventy-five per cent of Arsenal's Premier League goals this season have come in the second half (18/24). Since the start of last season, Crystal Palace have won more penalties (13) and scored more penalties (10) in the Premier League than any other side. Since the start of 2016-17, Arsenal have conceded more penalties (18) and penalty goals (17) in the Premier League than any other side. Milivojevic has both taken the most (11) and scored the most (9) penalties in the Premier League since the start of 2017-18. Arsenal have not been leading a game at half-time in the Premier League this season (losing two and drawing eight). Aubameyang has been directly involved in 22 goals in his 23 Premier League appearances with Arsenal. Man of the match: Wilfried Zaha Pure class. His close control, dribbling ability and clever passing provided Palace with a platform to force Arsenal out of their comfort zone. At one point, he wriggled free of four Arsenal defenders inside the centre-circle. He was fouled seven times during the match, provided three key passes and won the all-important penalty with a smart piece of play. Since the start of 2014/15, only Jamie Vardy (13) has won more penalties in the Premier League than Zaha (11 - level with Raheem Sterling). What's next? Palace travel to Middlesbrough in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday before an away trip to Chelsea on Super Sunday.

Romelu Lukaku was named on the United bench for just the third time since he joined the club from Everton, but the hosts were ahead at half-time without him thanks to Paul Pogba's rebound from a controversial saved penalty (27) following Idrissa Gueye's trip on Martial.

A minute's silence was held before the game, the last at Old Trafford before Remembrance Sunday, and also for the events in Leicester on Saturday night. Martial scored his fourth goal in three Premier League games The early stages saw both sides miss unmarked headers; Andre Gomes nodded straight at David de Gea from a corner, while Juan Mata headed Ashley Young's cross into the ground and into the grateful hands of Pickford. Martial forced a good save out of Pickford from long range, and was then brought down in the area by Gueye for the penalty, though the Everton man did look to get a touch on the ball. Pogba stepped up with a trademark approach slower than ever, saw his attempt wonderfully saved by Pickford to his right, but slid home the rebound with ease. Team news Romelu Lukaku was dropped to the bench for only the third time at United, replaced by Fred. Everton, meanwhile, were unchanged following their win against Crystal Palace. Paul Pogba put Manchester United ahead after scoring the rebound from his saved penalty United were 2-0 up just after the break through Martial's fourth goal in three Premier League games, curling a first-time beauty into the far corner from 20 yards after Pogba's square ball. Everton's Bernard rounded De Gea but struck into the side-netting moments later, Marcus Rashford forced a good save out of Pickford's with his feet from an angle, and Pogba did the same as the chances kept flowing. United allowed Everton a passage back into the game with 13 minutes remaining as Pogba needlessly gave the ball away in midfield, before Chris Smalling upended Richarlison. Sigurdsson duly converted, sending De Gea the wrong way. Lukaku did eventually come on but glanced a clear header wide before Everton got their goal, while Martial missed a one-on-one chance to get his second in stoppage time before United saw the game out. Luke Shaw battles with Richarlison in the first half Opta stats Manchester United have scored 100 Premier League goals against Everton, more than they have managed against any other side. Everton are without a win in their last 30 Premier League away games against the 'big six' (D9 L21), since a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford against Manchester United in December 2013. Chris Smalling made his 300th competitive appearance for Manchester United - of current Red Devils' players, only David de Gea (328) and Antonio Valencia (335) have registered more. Paul Pogba has been involved in 31 Premier League goals since the start of 2016-17 (14 goals, 17 assists); more than any other Manchester United player. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"I think [Martial] coped well with this development process. He took quite a long time to understand what we want from him, took quite a long time for his brain, and also his body, to be ready to play the way we want him to. \"But at the moment he is solid, playing very well, and even if he doesn't score, his performance is a solid performance for the team, and that's what we need. So I'm very happy with Anthony.\" 5:10 Jose Mourinho felt his side were in control throughout and played very well at times Jose Mourinho felt his side were in control throughout and played very well at times Marco Silva: \"Every time we had the ball we created problems for them, the game was really balanced, and in that moment, for me it looks like no penalty. It's clear. \"My player told me it's clear he touched the ball. It's a difficult sensation for us, because when you come here to play a strong side, one moment like that starts to make things easy for our opponent.\" 3:26 Marco Silva doesn't believe the penalty awarded for a foul on Martial should have been given Marco Silva doesn't believe the penalty awarded for a foul on Martial should have been given Man of the match - Anthony Martial He has rejected the first offer for a new contract, and that looks like a good decision. If Martial keeps performing like this, he will turn his doubters into supporters, and receive a far more lucrative deal if he stays at Old Trafford.

highlights Brighton 1-0 Wolves - highlights Glenn Murray was Brighton's match-winner again as his second-half strike saw his side beat Wolves 1-0 at the Amex on Saturday. The veteran striker, 35, was in the right place at the right time to side-foot home his 100th goal for the club three minutes after the break. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (8), Bruno (7), Duffy (7), Dunk (7), Bong (6), Kayal (7), March (6), Stephens (6), Jahanbakhsh (6), Izquierdo (6), Murray (9) Subs: Knockaert (6), Bissouma (6) Wolves: Patricio (6), Doherty (8), Bennett (7), Boly (7), Coady (6), Jonny (6), Neves (6), Moutinho (6), Traore (6), Jimenez (6), Costa (6) Subs: Jota (6), Cavaleiro (7), Bonatini (6) Man of the match: Glenn Murray That was enough to move Brighton up to 11th after a third straight Premier League win for the first time - and the first time in the top flight since 1981 - while Wolves stay ninth in the table following a second defeat in a row. In a cagey first half, it was the visitors who dominated proceedings, with Matt Doherty a willing runner down the right. And the wing back really should have opened the scoring just past the half-hour mark after a neat one-two with Raul Jimenez on the edge of the area, only to place his shot just past the post. Glenn Murray (centre) is congratulated after scoring his 100th Brighton goal. Murray is the guest on Goals on Sunday this weekend. However, despite all their possession, it was Brighton who nearly went in ahead at the interval, only for Shane Duffy to somehow miss the target after being picked out at the far post by Solly March's right-wing corner. But that miss was soon forgotten as the home team took the lead right at the start of the second period, with who else but Murray the man to make the breakthrough. What would VAR have changed? There is a good chance the VAR would have awarded Wolves a penalty after Jose Izquierdo handled Matt Doherty’s fierce drive in the box after 13 minutes, with the Colombian’s hands clearly raised to block the shot. Murray, who was a doubt for the game after suffering concussion at St James' Park last weekend, was involved in the build-up to the home team's winner after flicking the ball on for the marauding Bruno. The Brighton skipper came charging into the area and there was the unmarked Murray to convert at the far post for his sixth league goal of the season, more than any English forward. Team news Brighton were unchanged with top scorer Glenn Murray starting up front after suffering concussion at Newcastle last weekend, while Bruno was also fit after a back problem Meanwhile, Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo made a change to his starting line-up for the first time this season as record-signing Adama Traore came in for last season's top scorer Diogo Jota. However, Chris Hughton's team were still grateful for a brilliant reflex save by Mat Ryan in stoppage time to keep out Ryan Bennett's close-range strike, meaning Brighton had recorded a third successive top-flight clean sheet for the first time in the club's history. Notes for Gareth Southgate He maybe 35 years old, but Glenn Murray is the highest-scoring Englishman in the Premier League this season and surely deserving of at least a look by the Three Lions boss. Meanwhile, Lewis Dunk produced another impressive display at the back to ensure the hosts kept a third top-flight clean sheet in a row. Opta stats Wolves have lost back-to-back league games for the first time under Nuno Espirito Santo, with the club previously doing so back in April 2017 Brighton have won each of their seven top-flight games against Wolves; the best 100 per cent record for a team against a single opponent in English top-flight history After losing just one of their first eight games of the Premier League season (W4 D3), Wolves have now lost two games in a row Brighton striker Glenn Murray has scored six goals in his last eight starts in the Premier League, with five of those coming at the AMEX Stadium At the age of 38 years and 26 days, Brighton defender Bruno is the oldest player to assist a Premier League goal since Jussi Jaaskelainen (38y 257d) on New Year's Day 2014 for West Ham against Fulham Brighton scored with their only shot on target of the game, with Glenn Murray doing so in the 48th minute Managers Hughton: \"That was our most resilient performance since last week! We would prefer not to make a habit of having to defend really well against a good Wolves team, but it is a trait that brings the best out of a team. We can play better though. \"I spoke to the players after about how difficult it is for a team like us to get three wins in a row - to get three wins and clean sheets on the bounce is very, very difficult for a club like us at this level. But we need to try and use the things we are good at and try and be better in our next games.\" 4:57 Chris Hughton was proud of his side's resilience as Brighton secured their third straight Premier League victory with a 1-0 win against Wolves Chris Hughton was proud of his side's resilience as Brighton secured their third straight Premier League victory with a 1-0 win against Wolves Nuno: \"The result was definitely not what we expected. The boys worked for it and the performance was good. It was better (than last week) and a good reaction. \"But we must improve on the final touch, we created many chances, we deserved to put inside the net and today was not the day. \"A lot (disappointed with the goal), from a throw-in, small details change realities and the reality of this game was changed by the detail of the throw-in that we conceded a goal. \"The reality is we did enough to deserve…. but credit to Brighton, they defended and threw bodies on the line of the ball.\" 1:48 Nuno Espirito Santo claimed his Wolves side deserved more from the game as they lost 1-0 to Brighton Nuno Espirito Santo claimed his Wolves side deserved more from the game as they lost 1-0 to Brighton Man of the match - Glenn Murray Where would Brighton be this season without their 35-year-old frontman? The deadly finisher was on hand to score his side's second-half winner on the south coast. And in a contest in which the home team barely created any clear-cut openings, they can be relieved that their fox in a box was there to stab home the only goal of the game for a second home match in a row.

highlights Fulham 0-3 Bournemouth - highlights Two goals from Callum Wilson and a David Brooks strike helped Bournemouth defeat 10-man Fulham 3-0 at Craven Cottage. Wilson converted a 14th-minute penalty and added a second five minutes from time, after David Brooks (72) had given the Cherries a cushion. Fulham ended the game with 10 men after Kevin McDonald received a second yellow for fouling Brooks soon after the second goal. Slavisa Jokanovic's struggling side, who had only one shot on target, stay 18th, while Bournemouth remain sixth.

The Bournemouth striker dusted himself off to send debutant Rico the wrong way in the 14th minute. Aboubakar Kamara reacted quickly to a heavy touch from Asmir Begovic in the Bournemouth area to dispossess the goalkeeper only to then immediately throw himself to the floor in the hope of getting a penalty even though Begovic's leg was nowhere near the striker, who was rightly booked. Callum Wilson celebrates scoring his second and Bournemouth's third goal against Fulham Fulham struggled to create chances before the break, with the best chance falling to Andre Schurrle who fired a volley from the edge of the box which was palmed to safety by Begovic. Team news There were three changes for Fulham as Sergio Rico, Fosu-Mensah and Kamara came into the team, with Bettinelli, Chambers and Johansen dropping out. Rico was making his Premier League debut for Fulham.Charlie Daniels replaced Josh King for Bournemouth in Bournemouth’s only change. With the hosts chasing the game in the 72nd minute, Brooks made the most of the extra space in the final third, latching onto a pass from Ryan Fraser and slotting the ball between Rico's legs. Soon after he got the better of McDonald, forcing him to bring him down when heading towards goal to earn his second booking of the match. Wilson was another to enjoy the space on offer to Bournemouth's attackers, especially when they had the one-man advantage, as he ran beyond the defence to get onto the end of another Fraser pass and fire powerfully beyond Rico from 12 yards. Man of the match - Ryan Fraser The Scottish midfielder seemed to have a hand in everything positive Bournemouth did in the game as few could deal with his speed and intelligent passing, which created two of the goals. The managers Slavisa Jokanovic: \"I am confident in myself always. \"I am working here three years, I know very well the players I have in my hand. \"This is hard work, this is not easy for me, for the team. We need to be brave, we need to push forward, play better football and to win the games.\" 1:58 Eddie Howe praised the performance of his Bournemouth side after their 3-0 win at Fulham, but still believes there's room for improvement Eddie Howe praised the performance of his Bournemouth side after their 3-0 win at Fulham, but still believes there's room for improvement Eddie Howe: \"It's not perfect, there are definitely things we could have done better. \"I thought it was a much better performance than the one against Watford where we won 4-0 and got a lot of plaudits but there were aspects of the play that day which were below where we would want to be but today was a lot better and most aspects of the play were great. \"The three clean sheets in a row are huge for us and that's given us a real boost around the team.\" Notes to Southgate Callum Wilson looked clinical in front of goal as he scores twice, with one coming from the spot and the other after he got the better of the defence. His movement and willing was rightly rewarded with two goals. Opta stats Fulham have lost four consecutive league games for the first time since August 2014, when they were in the Championship. Bournemouth have won four of their last six away games in the Premier League (L2), as many as they had in their previous 27 away trips in the competition. Fulham have conceded 28 goals in the Premier League this term, the joint-most after 10 games in competition history (also Barnsley in 1997-98 and Southampton in 2012-13). Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson has been directly involved in 10 goals in his last 11 appearances in the Premier League (six goals and four assists). Bournemouth midfielder David Brooks has scored three goals in his last four league appearances, as many as he had in his previous 35. Fulham are the only side to have conceded in 100 per cent of their games in the Premier League this season (10/10). What's next?

Instead, late goals from substitute Xherdan Shaqiri (84) and Mane (87) sealed a win to send Liverpool - unbeaten in the league this season - top, until Manchester City face Tottenham on Monday Night Football at least. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (6), Van Dijk (8), Moreno (6), Lovren (6), Alexander-Arnold (6), Fabinho (7), Wijnaldum (6), Lallana (6), Firmino (6), Mane (8), Salah (8) Subs: Shaqiri (8), Milner (6). Cardiff: : Etheridge (6), Bennett (6), Bamba (6), Morrison (7), Manga (6), Murphy (6), Paterson (7), Gunnarsson (7), Camarasa (6), Hoilett (6), Reid (6). Subs: Damour (6), Harris (7), Zahore (N/A). Man of the match: Mohamed Salah Liverpool flew out of the blocks and put Cardiff under pressure right from the off, taking the lead with just nine minutes on the clock. Mane's initial effort from just inside the box was charged down, Georginio Wijnaldum was then also denied by a fine block, but Salah was on hand to slot home from the tight angle to net his 51st goal for Liverpool. Cardiff - who stay 17th in the table - were at sixes and sevens as they struggled to cope with Liverpool at their relentless best. Virgil van Dijk almost added an immediate second, but his header came out off the post, before Salah was denied by Cardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge on the slide outside his box. The only downside to Liverpool's play was that they were trying to be overly intricate in the final third, with Cardiff just about hanging on. Adam Lallana did almost net that second on the stroke of half-time, but saw his header cleared off the line by Cardiff captain Sean Morrison. Team news Jurgen Klopp mixed it up in midweek, and did so again for the visit of Cardiff. Klopp made six chances from the side that stuttered to victory at Huddersfield, with Dejan Lovren and Virgil van Dijk again the preferred centre-back pairing, but this time flanked by Alberto Moreno, who made his first start of the season for Liverpool. It was an entirely new midfield for Liverpool, with Adam Lallana dropping back to join Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum, making way for their stellar forwardline of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. Just the one change for Cardiff, with Harry Arter replaced by Junior Hoilett. Cardiff came out for the second half with added impetus, but could not create that killer opening, and their lack of potency was punished when Mane made space for the shot himself, before firing an unstoppable strike into the net from the edge of the box to double Liverpool's advantage. Liverpool took their foot off the gas after Mane's goal, which allowed Cardiff to get themselves back in it through Paterson. Junior Hoilett's low cross was deflected closer to Allison's goal by Van Dijk, Paterson stole a march, before prodding the ball home. Liverpool had gone 918 Premier League minutes without conceding at Anfield. It was not long, though, before Liverpool made sure of the victory with Shaqiri - who made a huge difference after coming off the bench - finishing off his first goal for Liverpool smartly after being picked out by Salah in the box. Salah then provided a sumptuous pass for Mane, who raced through before lofting the ball over Etheridge to put the icing on the cake with his 50th Premier League goal. 2:46 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was 'really happy' with the 4-1 win over Cardiff which sent them top of the Premier League. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was 'really happy' with the 4-1 win over Cardiff which sent them top of the Premier League. Opta stats Liverpool have won 26 points in their opening 10 Premier League games this season (W8 D2 L0), their joint-best start to a Premier League season (also 26 in 2008-09). Since the start of last season, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has been involved in 33 goals in 24 Premier League appearances at Anfield (23 goals, 10 assists). Cardiff completed 120 passes in this match - just nine more than Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum managed during the game (111). Mohamed Salah has scored 33 goals in 35 matches at Anfield for Liverpool in all competitions. Sadio Mane has ended on the winning side in all 19 matches he's scored for Liverpool at Anfield in all competitions Mohamed Salah celebrates his goal against Cardiff City Man of the match - Mohamed Salah All talk of this supposed Salah blip must be well and truly put to bed now. He was calm in the finish for Liverpool's opener, but when his team were under the cosh late on, two fantastic passes undid Cardiff and ensured Liverpool secured that victory they needed to head back to the top of the table. The pass with the outside of his boot for Shaqiri's goal was pinpoint, but the vision to pick out Mane for the clincher was as good an assist as you are likely to see. Four goals in three games, two assists in four minutes - Salah is back.The managers 2:29 Neil Warnock praised his Cardiff side for their efforts in the 4-1 loss to Liverpool, insisting their performances are getting better. Neil Warnock praised his Cardiff side for their efforts in the 4-1 loss to Liverpool, insisting their performances are getting better. The managers Jurgen Klopp: \"The boys are really disappointed with the goal we conceded. It will happen one day. In that period we were a bit sloppy, losing the ball here, losing the ball there. Cardiff could live with 1-0 or 2-0, as they know a set-piece can put them back in the game. But they did not get back in the game because we closed it with two wonderful goals. We are really happy - 26 points after 10 games is exceptional - so we are really happy.\" Neil Warnock: We just made the wrong decisions in the first half. We had a great six or seven opportunities when running into their half, but we made the wrong decisions. I said at half-time, we have got a chance if we get the next goal, but unfortunately we didn't do that. \"We kept going, and you could tell by the quiet of the crowd that there was a game on, but to concede two late ones like that is a blow. The players gave it their best shot, and that is all you can ask really.\" What's next?

Premier League table as two teams bereft of confidence played out a 0-0 draw at St Mary's. Southampton, who remain 16th and two points outside the relegation zone, came closest to breaking the deadlock with Mohamed Elyounoussi, Mario Lemina and Shane Long all spurning good chances. The Magpies failed to have a shot on target all game, with a wayward effort from Jonjo Shelvey one of few attempts of any note. Mark Hughes' Saints have now gone five home games without a goal, while this represented a third goalless draw away from home for Newcastle this season. Mark Hughes was unable to inspire his side to a home win on Saturday Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (6), Cedric (7), Bertrand (7), Stephens (7), Hoedt (7), Romeu (6), Lemina (7), Elyounoussi (6), Redmond (6), Ings (6), Austin (6). Subs: Long (5), Ward-Prowse (6), Gabbiadini (6). Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Dummett (7), Lascelles (8), Fernandez (7), Yedlin (8), Shelvey (6), Diame (6), Ritchie, (6) Kenedy (6), Perez (5), Muto (7). Subs: Ki (6), Atsu (n/a), Rondon (5). Man of the match: Jamaal Lascelles There was a humorous moment in the first half when Rafa Benitez accidentally knocked his glasses off, but there was very little the Newcastle boss would have missed in the way of goalmouth action. Southampton were the brighter side, and should have taken the lead after just three minutes when Ryan Bertrand's mishit shot fell at the feet of Elyounoussi but Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka did well to smother his shot with Charlie Austin waiting unmarked for the square pass. Saints were untroubled by their opponents and again came close when Bertrand latched onto Nathan Redmond's pass before finding Lemina, but his flicked effort struck the foot of the near post. Charlie Austin thumps the ball into an empty net, but his effort was disallowed Team news Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg was one of Southampton's better players during last weekend's 0-0 draw at Bournemouth, but he was not in the matchday squad, due to illness. Oriol Romeu took his place in midfield alongside Mario Lemina after overcoming a knee problem. It was an unchanged starting XI from last weekend for Newcastle, but fit-again Salomon Rondon was named among the substitutes at St. Mary's. In the third minute of added time at the end of the opening period, Bertrand was again the provider as his corner was met by Jack Stephens, but Dubravka dived to his left to keep out the defender's header. Southampton signalled their intentions early in the second period as Bertrand's cross found Danny Ings, but his shot was blocked by his own team-mate Austin, summing up Saints recent woes in front of goal. Shelvey then blazed over, having chopped inside two home defenders, before Austin was correctly penalised for a foul on Dubravka which resulted in his simple finish being chalked off. Newcastle continued to defend resolutely as both Cedric Soares and Redmond had efforts blocked, and as the game ticked into stoppage time, Long missed a gilt-edged chance from Cedric's cut-back as he dragged his shot wide. Notes for Southgate Bertrand and Shelvey have both spoken this week of not giving up hope on their England careers, but neither excelled to the point of threatening a surprise recall when the squad meets again in November. Bertrand was full of energy going forward while Shelvey was full of endeavour, but both were outshone by Lascelles. The Newcastle captain has been touted for an England cap before, despite playing in a struggling side, and on this evidence Southgate will take heart from knowing that if he suffers a defensive crisis at centre-back, Lascelles would be ready to answer the call. Man of the match - Jamaal Lascelles For all of Newcastle's toothlessness going forward against a side not known for their attacking, Lascelles was imperious at the back. The defender was solid throughout alongside his partner Federico Fernandez as Saints' attempts to create a head of steam in the second half were thwarted by a sea of turquoise shirts marshalled by their captain. Jamaal Lascelles was the game's stand-out player for his dogged defending The managers Mark Hughes: \"We were the side that was trying to win the game over the 90 minutes. I thought that we had the better chances, and Alex McCarthy hasn't had a shot to save. \"It's back-to-back clean sheets, and that's something we've been working on just to tighten up our defensive platform which will allow us to be a little bit more confident at the top end.\" 3:03 Mark Hughes believes his side deserved to win against Newcastle, but praised his players' performances. Mark Hughes believes his side deserved to win against Newcastle, but praised his players' performances. Rafa Benitez: \"I think we have to consider the circumstances, going away from home at the bottom of the table, getting a clean sheet and a point. \"They pushed hard in the second half so we did well to keep our clean sheet. A bit of better possession at times would've led to clearer chances, but it was difficult.\" 2:34 Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez says he has to take the positives of a clean sheet and point away from home but concedes his side need to do better following their draw with Southampton.

Roberto Pereyra gave Watford the lead with a superb solo goal in the 10th minute and Gerard Deulofeu made it 2-0 with a fine individual effort of his own nine minutes later. Huddersfield had a few good opportunities to respond in the first half, with Philip Billing hitting the woodwork from distance. But Isaac Success sealed Watford's victory when he tapped in with 10 minutes left to register the Hornets' sixth Premier League win of the campaign as Huddersfield's second-season struggles go on.

Huddersfield, meanwhile, drop down to 20th and bottom. Watford got off to a flying start when Pereyra delivered a fine goal to hand the hosts the initiative. The Argentina international drifted in from the left flank and nonchalantly weaved his way around four Huddersfield players before slotting the ball past Jonas Lossl. The hosts' attack proved too much for the Huddersfield back three once again nine minutes later. Deulofeu beat Chris Lowe and Jonathan Hogg in one-against-one situations and then smashed his shot into the net from a tight angle to open his account for the season. Team news Javi Gracia named the same team that beat Wolves 2-0 at Molineux. For Huddersfield, Florent Hadergjonaj dropped to the bench and Isaac Mbenza came into the starting XI. Huddersfield responded positively through long-range strikes from Lowe, and Billing eight minutes before half-time, but both spectacular efforts were met with fine fingertip stops from Ben Foster in the home goal. Isaac Success added Watford's third in the 80th minute Watford could have wrapped the game up five minutes into the second half when Deulofeu broke into a one-on-one situation, but the former Barcelona forward was unable to direct his shot on goal after jinking past the onrushing Lossl. Javi Gracia's men continued to apply the pressure on Huddersfield as Pereyra back-heeled the ball into the path of Will Hughes, but he was unable to dig his shot out which allowed Lossl to make the stop. Watford in fine form Watford now boast 19 points from 10 games - bettering their 17 at the same stage of the 1982-83 campaign, where they finished second. With Huddersfield tiring, Watford did eventually finish off their impressive display with a third goal 10 minutes from time when Success tapped home after he latched onto a fine Kiko Femenia pass, a strike which condemned Huddersfield to their eighth loss this season. Opta stats Watford have won eight of their 13 home Premier League matches under manager Javier Gracia (D2 L3).

Huddersfield Town have failed to win any of their 10 league games this season (W0 D3 L7), the third time they've failed to win their first 10 league games of a season (also 1987-88 and 1997-98). Watford's tally of 19 points from their 10 Premier League games this season (W6 D1 L3) is their best ever tally after 10 games of a top-flight season. Huddersfield have hit the woodwork more times (6) than they've scored goals (4) in the Premier League this season. Huddersfield are winless in 15 games in all competitions (D5 L10), their worst run since November 2000 (19 games without a win).

Ndidi netted a fortunate late leveller for Leicester in a 1-1 draw against West Ham, who had Mark Noble sent off in the first half. Fabian Balbuena had put the Hammers into a first-half lead (30) but their momentum was lost when Noble was dismissed eight minutes later for an ugly lunge on Ndidi. Leicester dominated the second period but couldn't find a way through a brave West Ham defensive performance until Ndidi's 25-yard effort deflected into the top corner via the backside of Balbuena. Angelo Ogbonna missed a glorious chance in injury time for the Hammers but the game ended on a sour note as Leicester full-back Daniel Amartey was carried off, requiring gas and air, after suffering what looked a serious leg injury. The late equaliser spared boss Claude Puel further scrutiny, who decided to drop Jamie Vardy from his starting line-up despite the striker declaring himself \"back to full strength\" on Instagram a day after suffering a stomach complaint in the defeat at Arsenal. Player Ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Amartey (6), Soyuncu (6), Maguire (6), Chilwell (7), Ghezzal (6), Iborra (6), Ndidi (6), Maddison (6), Iheanacho (6), Albrighton (6) Subs: Vardy (5), Okazaki (6), Gray (6) West Ham: Fabianski (7), Zabaleta (7), Balbuena (8), Diop (7), Noble (3), Masuaku (7), Anderson (6), Rice (8), Snodgrass (6), Diangana (6), Chicharito (6) Subs: Antonio (7), Cresswell (6), Ogbonna (4) Man of the match: Declan Rice West Ham controlled the game after a fast start by Leicester and got their noses in front on the half hour. Felipe Anderson found Declan Rice from a set-piece and his header across the area was met by Balbuena but his diving header hit the inside of a post. The defender reacted quickest to the rebound though and fired home from close range. Fabian Balbuena (C) celebrates with team-mates after scoring the opening goal of the game Leicester looked lost for ideas but the game changed when Noble was dismissed. The West Ham captain slid in recklessly on Ndidi's shin and referee Michael Oliver was on the spot quickly to brandish the red card. With Leicester now having an extra-man, Puel sent on Vardy at half-time but he didn't look his sharpest in front of goal, heading over a fabulous chance on 58 minutes. Team news Jamie Vardy – despite declaring himself fit to start –was dropped in one of four changes. Caglar Soyuncu, Vincent Iborra, Rachid Ghezzal and Marc Albrighton returned. Marko Arnautovic was ill and misses the game. He was one of three changes with the injured Andriy Yarmolenko and Aaron Cresswell also dropping out. Leicester pinned West Ham back and Lukas Fabianski made a fine double save to deny Marc Albrighton before Harry Maguire then saw a header clip the top of the crossbar. Despite their endeavour, Leicester didn't create a golden chance and Hammers substitute Angelo Ogbonna let them off the hook on 85 minutes, heading wide from eight yards out. Ndidi punished the visitors as the clock ticked into added time when his strike from range took a huge deflection off Balbuena and flew into the top corner. There was still time for Ogbonna to blaze over from close range and Amartey to be carried off on a stretcher needing oxygen after twisting his lower leg. Opta stats West Ham have picked up just eight points from their opening 10 league games this season; only twice before in the Premier League have they had fewer at this stage (seven in 2009-10, six in 2010-11). West Ham have now lost eight points from leading positions in this season's Premier League, more than any other side. West Ham manager Manuel Pellegrini has never lost in four visits to Leicester for Man City and West Ham combined (W2 D2 L0), his joint-best unbeaten record away against a particular opponent whilst managing English sides (also four away at Newcastle). Balbuena is the fifth different Paraguayan player to score in the Premier League (excluding own goals), and the first since Antolin Alcaraz for Wigan against Blackburn in May 2012. Noble's red card was his fifth in the Premier League for West Ham, the most of any player for the club, overtaking Steve Lomas on four. Ndidi's goal for Leicester was his first in the Premier League since May 2017 against Watford, 539 days ago. All three of his goals in the competition have come at the King Power Stadium. Each of Leicester's last three league goals against West Ham scored in the second half have come in the 86th minute or later and have altered the result of the match (also Andy King in April 2015 and Leonardo Ulloa in April 2016). Man of the match: Declan Rice England manager Gareth Southgate would've liked what he saw from the stands. The West Ham midfielder, who has played three times for Ireland but withdrew from their squad to consider whether he wanted to represent England instead, put in yet another powerful display in front of the back four. In West Ham's dominant spell in the first half, Rice was key, nullifying the skills of James Maddison, who found space limited. After Noble's dismissal Rice almost played as a third centre-back but - along with Balbuena - made some important clearances. What's next? Leicester host Southampton in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday evening before travelling to play Cardiff in the Premier League on Saturday. Meanwhile, West Ham play Tottenham in a tasty Carabao fixture on Wednesday."},{"date": "22/10/2019", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59886, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup":

Highlights from Arsenal's 3-1 win over Leicester in the Premier League Mesut Ozil and substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang inspired Arsenal to a 3-1 victory over Leicester on Monday Night Football and a 10th win in a row in all competitions. The Foxes capitalised on a positive start at the Emirates when Ben Chilwell's shot deflected in off Hector Bellerin in the 31st minute. However, Ozil's well-taken goal on the stroke of half-time proved to be the catalyst for an Arsenal comeback. Player ratings Arsenal: Leno (6), Bellerin (7), Mustafi (6), Holding (6), Lichtsteiner (6), Mkhitaryan (6), Torreira (7), Xhaka (6), Ozil (8), Iwobi (7), Lacazette (6) Subs: Guendouzi (6), Aubameyang (8), Ramsey (5) Leicester: Schmeichel (5), Amartey (5), Evans (5), Maguire (5), Chilwell (6), Pereira (5), Mendy (5), Ndidi (6), Maddison (5), Iheanacho (6), Vardy (5) Subs: Albrighton (5), Ghezzal (5), Okazaki (5) Man of the match: Mesut Ozil Aubameyang was introduced in the 61st minute and scored twice inside five minutes, finishing from Bellerin's cross and then tapping in after a slick passing move. Ozil played a key role in both goals and his man-of-the-match display was instrumental in an impressive victory, which came on former manager Arsene Wenger's 69th birthday and moves the Gunners back into fourth in the Premier League. Mesut Ozil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrate Arsenal's stunning third goal It looked like Arsenal's winning streak would be tested when, inside the opening six minutes, Kelechi Iheanacho saw a shot deflected over and then had a curling effort saved by Bernd Leno. Arsenal were open at the back and loose in possession and were fortunate not to concede a penalty when the ball hit Rob Holding's hand in the box. Leno then made a sharp low save to keep out a header from Harry Maguire before Leicester's pressure eventually was rewarded, Chilwell bursting up the left flank, taking the ball past Bellerin with a brilliant first touch and then finishing with the help of a deflection off the Spaniard. Ben Chilwell celebrates with James Maddison after Leicester's opening goal But the goal belatedly sparked Arsenal into life and they levelled before the break. Ozil played out to Bellerin on the right and then coolly finished the return pass into the box with a side-footed shot across goal and into the far corner. The goal proved to be pivotal as Arsenal dominated after the break. Alex Iwobi takes on Daniel Amartey Leicester's only opportunity came in the 57th minute when Wilfred Ndidi beat Leno to a corner but headed against the bar from 10 yards out. Aubameyang was introduced a few minutes later and soon put Arsenal ahead when he finished from close range after Bellerin played across the face of goal from Ozil's perfectly-weighted pass. Team news Unai Emery made two changes to his side that thrashed Fulham 5-1 before the international break. Mesut Ozil returned in place of Danny Welbeck while Stephan Lichtsteiner replaced injured full-back Nacho Monreal. Jonny Evans replaced the suspended Wes Morgan for Leicester. Ozil was involved again in Arsenal's slick third goal, dummying for Alexandre Lacazette and then chipping a return pass across goal for Aubameyang to finish. Lacazette should have added to the scoreline but was denied at close range and then missed the target from a low cross. Opta stats Arsenal have won 10 consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since October 2007 (a run of 12). In all competitions, Leicester are winless in their last 26 visits to Arsenal (P26 W0 D6 L20) since winning 2-0 in the top-flight in September 1973. Leicester are winless in their last eight Premier League away games in London (D3 L5), losing the last three in a row. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been directly involved in 21 goals in his 22 Premier League games for Arsenal (16 goals, 5 assists). Arsenal have scored more Premier League goals via substitutes this season than any other team (6). Mesut Ozil became the highest scoring German player in Premier League history (30 goals). Mesut Ozil has scored three goals in his last four Premier League appearances, as many as he bagged in his previous 22 in the competition. Hector Bellerin scored his first own goal in the Premier League in what was his 133rd appearance in the competition. The Spanish defender also provided two assists in a PL game for the fourth time in his career. Man of the match - Mesut Ozil Captaining Arsenal from the start for the first time in the Premier League, Ozil delivered a masterful display. He made a cool side-footed finish for the first goal look easy, before playing a key part in the second and third goals. This was one of his best performances in an Arsenal shirt for a while.

Everton struggled to find space against the well-drilled Palace backline, taking 27 minutes to test Wayne Hennessey when Sigurdsson's near post effort was pushed clear. The best chance of the first-half fell to Cheikhou Kouyate but he flicked his header from close range off the underside of the crossbar. Team news Andre Gomes made his long-awaited Everton debut after his loan move from Barcelona in the summer while Seamus Coleman returned after missing the last five games. Roy Hodgson started without a recognised centre forward as Andre Ayew was dropped for Cheick Kouyate in their only change from the home defeat to Wolves. Palace were growing in confidence and were handed a golden opportunity to take the lead when Seamus Coleman tripped Zaha just inside the area on the hour mark. Milivojevic has scored nine of his 10 penalties for Palace but squandered this one as his effort down the middle of the goal was blocked by Pickford's leg after he dived to his left. The save should've sparked a response from Everton but Palace kept their heads and defended their box with great strength with Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Mamadou Sakho particularly impressive. Jordan Pickford saves Luka Milivojevic's penalty Everton needed fresh blood and Silva sent on Tosun, Lookman and Calvert-Lewin. In truth, a winning goal didn't look likely until Sakho switched off from a Lookman cross and Calvert-Lewin guided a header home with three minutes left. Palace then pushed up higher in search of a leveller but got caught by a long ball over the top which was gathered by Tosun and he powered a low finish past Hennessey. 1:59 Reaction from goalscorers Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Cenk Tosun penalty-saving hero Jordan Pickford after Everton’s late 2-0 win over Crystal Palace Reaction from goalscorers Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Cenk Tosun penalty-saving hero Jordan Pickford after Everton’s late 2-0 win over Crystal Palace Opta stats Everton have won three straight Premier League matches for the first time since January 2017. Crystal Palace are now winless in four Premier League matches (D1 L3), their longest such sequence since March (run of seven games). Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson is now winless in all eight of his Premier League visits to Everton (D1 L7), against no other side has he managed more away games in the competition without winning at least once (also eight v Tottenham). For the first time since August 2017 (Man Utd v Leicester - Rashford, Lingard and Fellaini), three substitutes were directly involved in a goal in the same Premier League game (Calvert-Lewin, Lookman and Tosun for Everton today). Calvert-Lewin and Tosun are the first two Everton substitutes to score in the same Premier League game since March 2014, when Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith netted against Fulham. Milivojevic's penalty miss was his first in the Premier League for Crystal Palace since December 2017 v Manchester City, and just the second penalty he has failed to convert in 11 attempts in the competition. Since the beginning of last season, only Manchester City's Raheem Sterling (six), has won more Premier League penalities than Crystal Palace's Zaha (five). Notes for Southgate Dominic Calvert-Lewin showed his predatory skills to notch the winner. When you consider the lack of depth in England’s forward ranks he could be close to earning a call-up if he gets a run of goals and games under his belt. Meanwhile, Aaron Wan-Bissaka impressed a full-back for Palace, not putting a foot wrong against the threat of Bernard while Jordan Pickford showed why he's England's No.1. Man of the match: Jordan Pickford He called his penalty save \"a game changer\" and it was hard to argue. The England stopper has now saved three of his last six penalties in the Premier League, not forgetting either his famous stop in England's penalty shootout win over Colombia in the World Cup. Although Palace didn't really test his shot stopping in open play, he was always switched on to their attacks as shown when charging off his line to stop a Zaha charge in the first-half. He's Mr Reliable for club and country. Manager reaction: Marco Silva \"Sometimes you make changes and everything goes well, like this afternoon. \"The other times you try and it's not the same but in that moment it was important for us, we changed the formation with the substitutes and they did well.\" 3:18 Marco Silva is pleased with his side’s squad depth, after substitutes Cenk Tosun and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored late goals as Everton beat Crystal Palace 2-0 at Goodison Park Marco Silva is pleased with his side’s squad depth, after substitutes Cenk Tosun and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored late goals as Everton beat Crystal Palace 2-0 at Goodison Park Manager reaction: Roy Hodgson \"The first goal was a massive blow after defending so well. \"Also, the chance to put ourselves in a commanding position and not take it from the penalty. It's hard to stand here as a loser again - I could have been standing here as a winner or someone who has coached their team to a positive point but they scored the goals and we didn't.\" 2:58 Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace were close to a positive result against Everton but a missed penalty and two late goals means they leave Goodison Park with nothing Roy Hodgson says Crystal Palace were close to a positive result against Everton but a missed penalty and two late goals means they leave Goodison Park with nothing What's next?

in the Premier League Highlights from Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Manchester United in the Premier League Ross Barkley's stoppage-time equaliser denied Jose Mourinho's Manchester United victory at Chelsea following a heated 2-2 draw. Substitute Barkley turned home in the 96th minute from close range, prompting Chelsea second assistant Marco Ianni to run across Mourinho's path in celebration, which angered the United manager and in-turn sparked scuffles on the sidelines and in the tunnel. Chelsea had taken the lead through Antonio Rudiger's header from Willian's corner (21) thanks to some suspect marking, but United equalised after the break as Anthony Martial finished fiercely from close range following pinball in the box (55). 0:42 Jose Mourinho reacted angrily after a member of the Chelsea staff appeared to celebrate provocatively in front of him following their equaliser Jose Mourinho reacted angrily after a member of the Chelsea staff appeared to celebrate provocatively in front of him following their equaliser Martial then struck again to stun Chelsea (73), curling into the bottom corner from inside the box following a swift counter-attack, before Barkley's last-gasp leveller caused an eruption on the sideline. Juan Mata was a surprise inclusion in Mourinho's side, and though they started solidly enough, one defensive lapse had Chelsea ahead midway through the half. Player ratings Chelsea: Kepa (6), Azpilicueta (7), Luiz (5), Rudiger (7), Alonso (5), Jorginho (6), Kante (6), Kovacic (6), Willian (6), Morata (5), Hazard (7).

Subs: Herrera (6), Pereira (6), Sanchez (6). Man of the match: Ashley Young From Willian's corner, Rudiger found himself free of Paul Pogba, directing a fine header into the bottom corner from 10 yards. Pogba ranted and raved, seemingly claiming Victor Lindelof's own marking of David Luiz had blocked his path to stick with Rudiger. Chelsea dominated the ball from there, claiming 60 per cent of it in the first half, and could have been two up just after the break had Alvaro Morata made better connection with his low effort from just inside the box. Team news For Chelsea, Ross Barkley dropped to the bench alongside Olivier Giroud. Alvaro Morata came in after his goal against Southampton. There were two changes for Man Utd; Victor Lindelof came in for Eric Bailly, and Juan Mata replaced Scott McTominay. Anthony Martial celebrates scoring Manchester United's equaliser with Ashley Young United went 55 minutes without a shot on target, before two in 20 seconds resulted in an equaliser. First, Mata's deflected effort was well beaten away by Kepa Arrizabalaga, but after the ball was turned back goalwards by Ashley Young and deflected into Martial's path, the Frenchman made no mistake from 10 yards. David Luiz's unmarked header from a Willian cross was then glanced wide, N'Golo Kante forced a fine save from David de Gea 20 yards out, but United then broke to take the lead. Mata found himself free on the right, squaring to Marcus Rashford and then onto Martial, who curled a fine effort into the far bottom corner from 15 yards.

There were wild celebrations among Chelsea fans, but a nasty scene on the touchline. Chelsea coach Ianni burst out of the bench and pumped his fists in Mourinho's face, prompting the manager to go after him in the tunnel. A few minutes passed before the situation calmed, and Mourinho then shook hands with Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri, explaining what had happened. Manager Reaction Maurizio Sarri: \"I've seen the match from the bench, and now I have to study it. I thought we played a very good first half, but weren't very good in the second half. \"We have not played our football, and in a physical match United were better than us. It's better to learn in training than in a match, but the match after the international break is always very difficult. The players go to play in another team, another football, another target, then they come back and they're still in other situations.\" 3:53 Maurizio Sarri says he will deal with his staff's over celebration after Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Manchester United Maurizio Sarri says he will deal with his staff's over celebration after Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Manchester United On the late fracas: \"If I spoke with the member of staff and I have to be very hard, then I cannot come here and tell everything, otherwise with my staff I am not credible. \"I am not really happy. After I spoke to Jose, I understood we were on the wrong side of the situation.\" Jose Mourinho: \"We were the best team on the pitch. If you say before the match that we'll get a point at Stamford Bridge, that's a good result because it's so difficult for teams to win here. \"After the game, the way the game was, it's an awful result for us and phenomenal result for them. 5:47 Jose Mourinho says Maurizio Sarri's second assistant Marco Ianni has apologised to him following their altercation after Chelsea's equaliser Jose Mourinho says Maurizio Sarri's second assistant Marco Ianni has apologised to him following their altercation after Chelsea's equaliser \"I'm not annoyed with anything, and what happened was with Sarri's assistant, and Sarri was the first one to come to me and say he would resolve the problem internally with him. \"After that, his assistant came to me in Sarri's office and apologised, and I said if he really felt it that way, of course, I accept. Forget it, because I also made lots of mistakes in my career.\" Man of the match - Ashley Young Young had one of the toughest jobs in the Premier League in dealing with Eden Hazard and the Belgian could not get the better of the full-back for most of the afternoon. Things got even more difficult for the 33-year-old with a first-half booking, but he made more tackles (5), more interceptions (5) and regained possession more times (10) than anyone else on his team. Opta stats Chelsea have lost just one of their last 17 home Premier League games against Manchester United (W10 D6 L1), a 2-3 defeat in October 2012. Chelsea are unbeaten in their last 65 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge in which they've been ahead at half-time (W54 D11), last losing against Arsenal in October 2011 (5-3). Ross Barkley's goal was the latest Man Utd have conceded in the Premier League since October 2009, when David Ngog also scored against them at 95:27 for Liverpool. Chelsea's Ross Barkley has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since November 2015 for Everton. What's next?

Highlights: Bournemouth 0-0 Southampton Southampton were left to rue a series of missed chances as they held Bournemouth to a goalless draw at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday. Mark Hughes will feel his side ought to have wrapped up all three points with Charlie Austin, Stuart Armstrong and Manolo Gabbiadini, in the closing stages, all guilty of misses. The result checked Bournemouth's fine start to the campaign but, six years to the day since Eddie Howe made his return with the club in the third tier, it is a measure of how far they have come that they will feel disappointed at taking only a point off their south-coast rivals. Charlie Austin and Nathan Ake clash heads in one of several stoppages Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Francis (7), S. Cook (7), Ake (7), Smith (6), Lerma (6), L. Cook (6), Fraser (6), Brooks (6), King (6), Wilson (6). Subs: Gosling (6), Ibe (6), Stanislas (6). Southampton: McCarthy (6), Soares (6), Stephens (7), Hoedt (7), Bertrand (6), Hojbjerg (8), Lemina (6), Redmond (7), Elyounoussi (6), Austin (6), Ings (6). Subs: Long (6), Armstrong (6), Gabbiadini (6). Man of the match: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg Bournemouth remain sixth in the table while Southampton stay 16th, a point outside the relegation zone. Southampton went into the game having scored just six Premier League goals this season but it was the hosts who produced a very scratchy performance, taking until the 73rd minute to produce their first attempt on target as Alex McCarthy saved comfortably from Nathan Ake's header. Howe's men had a good chance inside two minutes as Adam Smith burst forward from left-back to take a return pass from Callum Wilson, but he fluffed his shot from six yards out. Saints settled thereafter and had the best of the opening period with Austin wasting a great opportunity. The striker, on his return to Hughes' starting line-up, was put through on goal by Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg but, after shaking off Ake, he ran the ball out of play as he attempted to round Asmir Begovic. Southampton were the better side but were held to a draw by Bournemouth Team news Eddie Howe named an unchanged side following their 4-0 thrashing of Watford at Vicarage Road, with Ryan Fraser overcoming his hamstring concern to start. Hughes dispensed with the three-man back line with Jan Bednarek coming out of the side which lost 3-0 at home to Chelsea last time around. Maya Yoshida was replaced by Jack Stephens while Charlie Austin replaced Manolo Gabbiadini. Mohamed Elyounoussi came into a 4-4-2 formation. On the hour mark, Joshua King had a good opening after substitute Junior Stanislas found Wilson with a cute reverse pass, but the Norway international fluffed his effort at the near post to sum up Bournemouth's attacking threat on the day. Hughes sensed victory was there for the taking, replacing Austin and Danny Ings with Shane Long and Gabbiadini for the final 10 minutes. It was Long's knock-down from Cedric Soares' cross that should have been converted by Armstrong, but the winger produced a complete air-shot with Begovic bearing down on him. Bournemouth were then very nearly made to pay for their lethargy in the third minute of stoppage time as Gabbiadini headed over from Nathan Redmond's cross with the goal at his mercy. The managers Eddie Howe: \"Maybe an early goal when we were well on top would've helped that but it didn't come. Thankfully today, we kept the clean sheet. \"We knew it was going to be very tough but the expectation for us was of course to win. The next best thing is to not get beat. For us to achieve back-to-back clean sheets is a good platform to go into the next game. 1:26 Eddie Howe says Bournemouth and Southampton cancelled each other out Eddie Howe says Bournemouth and Southampton cancelled each other out Mark Hughes: \"Three of the back four have been with us for the past 12 days, so the international break has really helped us. If results go against you then people start to doubt what you say, but I've been really pleased with what we've produced in the majority of the games. \"Today, everybody at the game saw that we're a very accomplished side. We more than matched Bournemouth, we just needed a little bit more luck to get the ball over the line.\" 2:11 Mark Hughes says Southampton put in an accomplished performance Mark Hughes says Southampton put in an accomplished performance Man of the match - Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg In a game of very few stand-out performers, Hojbjerg produced a cultured performance at the heart of a very organised Southampton team. Hughes made three changes following a ragged performance against Chelsea, but Hojbjerg looks set to be the one constant in his team this campaign, showcasing both sides to his game in an industrious display. On three occasions he tested Begovic with cleanly-struck volleys and on the one notable occasion he conceded possession, he was back doing his defensive duties to nullify Stanislas with a perfectly-timed challenge. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg was one performer whose standards didn't drop Opta stats Bournemouth have lost just one of their last nine home Premier League games (W5 D3) and are unbeaten in their last six at the Vitality Stadium (W4 D2). Southampton have failed to score in four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since October 2004. Bournemouth have kept consecutive Premier League clean sheets for the first time since November 2017. In all competitions, Southampton have lost just two of their last 15 games against Bournemouth (W8 D5 L2).

Fulham Cardiff 4-2 Fulham Cardiff City moved off the bottom of the table after recording their first win of the Premier League season with a 4-2 home victory over Fulham. Andre Schurrle opened the scoring for the visitors after just 11 minutes with a stunning 35-yard strike, only for Cardiff to hit back with two goals in quick succession. Josh Murphy firstly levelled matters with a neat finish on the quarter-hour mark, before the recalled Bobby Reid gave the home side the lead just five minutes later. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (6), Manga (7), Morrison (6), Bamba (7), Bennett (7), Camarasa (7), Arter (7), Murphy (8), Gunnarsson (8), Paterson (7), Reid (9) Subs: Richards (6), Damour (6), Harris (7) Fulham: Bettinelli (6), Odoi (6), Chambers (6), Le Marchand (6), Ream (6), McDonald (6), Johansen (6), Seri (5), Schurrle (7), Sessegnon (7), Mitrovic (6) Subs: Mawson (6), Ayite (6), Vietto (6) Man of the match: Bobby Reid In a ding-dong first half, though, Ryan Sessegnon equalised for Fulham 11 minutes before the break with his first Premier League goal. However, Neil Warnock's team would not be denied as second-half strikes from Callum Paterson (65) and substitute Kadeem Harris (87) gave the hosts a much-needed three points. As a result, Cardiff moved above their opponents and up to 17th in the table, while Fulham dropped to 18th having now conceded a league-high 25 goals this campaign. With both sides in desperate need of a win, it was no real surprise that the first 45 minutes produced four goals in South Wales, the first a wonder strike from Schurrle. Cardiff's players celebrate their fourth goal of the game The German was given far too much time and space to size up his options, although he still had work to do to beat Cardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge with a long-range effort that flew into the top right-hand corner of the net. Cardiff responded to that early setback, though, as Murphy latched on to Sol Bamba's ball down the left channel, before powering into the box and beating Marcus Bettinelli with a low shot into the far corner of the net, albeit with the help of a slight deflection. Notes for Southgate It has been an memorable week for Southgate as he fielded one of England's youngest-ever line-ups in Monday's 3-2 win in Spain. And the Three Lions boss will surely have noted Ryan Sessegnon’s impressive display in Cardiff after the England U21 international became Fulham’s youngest ever goalscorer in the Premier League aged just 18 years 154 days. The hosts were soon ahead after Schurrle got caught in possession just outside his box, before Reid was slipped through on goal, with the forward doing well to slide the ball under the advancing Bettinelli. It was not long though before Fulham got back on level terms as Aleksandar Mitrovic's lovely backheel released Sessegnon, who kept his cool to become the first player born in 2000 to score a Premier League goal. Team news Cardiff midfielder Joe Ralls was suspended after getting sent off at Spurs before the international break, with Aron Gunnarsson replacing him for his first match of the season as the hosts made two changes from that defeat at Wembley.The other saw Bobby Reid come in for Junior Hoilett in attack. The visitors made three changes from their 5-1 loss at home to Arsenal last time out. Cyrus Christie, Andre-Frank Anguissa and Luciano Vietto dropped to the bench, replaced by Calum Chambers, Kevin McDonald and Stefan Johansen. But it was Cardiff who claimed all three points, with Paterson grabbing their crucial third goal midway through the second half after neat build-up play down the right between Aron Gunnarsson and Bruno Ecuele Manga. The marauding right-back centred low into the box and Paterson swivelled before finding the bottom corner of the net, with Harris then sealing the win late on after good perseverance by Victor Camarasa. What would VAR have changed? The VAR may have upgraded the yellow referee Kevin Friend gave Fulham defender Calum Chambers for pulling back Murphy when through on goal. Opta stats Cardiff have won their first Premier League game since April 2014 (vs Southampton), ending a run of 12 matches without a victory Fulham have failed to keep a clean sheet in their last 23 Premier League away games; the longest such run since QPR between October 2011 and November 2012 (also 23 games) Cardiff have scored 4+ goals in a top-flight game for the first time since September 1961 vs Chelsea (5-2) Sessegnon is also Fulham's youngest ever goalscorer in the Premier League (18 years 154 days) Cardiff's Josh Murphy scored in consecutive home league appearances for the first time in his career Fulham's Andre Schurrle has scored 73% of his Premier League goals in away games (11 of 15) Man of the Match - Bobby Reid The pacy Reid - who only joined Cardiff in the summer - was a constant thorn in Fulham's side with his willing running in behind the visitors' back line all afternoon long, in particular causing Denis Odoi any number of headaches. However, it was the striker's composed finish after 20 minutes that really turned the match on its head, a memorable moment for the 25-year-old as it was his first-ever Premier League goal. Managers Neil Warnock: \"We have played well the last few games really, without any reward,\" he said. \"We made silly mistakes, even today we made silly mistakes. \"But all credit to the boys, they have played some good stuff today, good goals, could have had more and just great to get that three points. It is such a thing on your back, especially with all the pundits, so we needed a win. \"Everybody knew that and I thought the character shone through in the second half, which I was delighted with.\" 2:43 Neil Warnock says Cardiff's character shone through as they beat Fulham 4-2 in the Premier League Neil Warnock says Cardiff's character shone through as they beat Fulham 4-2 in the Premier League Slavisa Jokanovic: \"I can find the solution,\" said Jokanovic after the full-time whistle. \"My job is to keep working and fighting to find the solution. \"Last year people were against us, but we found a way to improve ourselves and be more competitive. \"We showed some positive things, but the negative things are killing us. I will keep going and keep working for my best XI.\" 2:39 Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic says they conceded easy goals and made many mistakes during their 4-2 defeat at Cardiff Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic says they conceded easy goals and made many mistakes during their 4-2 defeat at Cardiff What's next?

the top of the Premier League by beating Burnley 5-0 as Kevin De Bruyne returned from injury on Saturday. The Belgian played the final 30 minutes after two months out, by which time City had the game sewn up after goals from Sergio Aguero (16), Bernardo Silva (54) and Fernandinho (56), while Riyad Mahrez (83) and Leroy Sane (90) added late gloss to the scoreline. Bernardo Silva's effort was a controversial one, though, as Burnley's players had stopped playing after seemingly believing referee Jon Moss had blown his whistle, while David Silva's pass for the goal looked to be out of play. The Premier League champions now hold the record for the longest unbeaten run of Premier League games on Saturdays at 3pm, taking their tally to 35 in a row. For Burnley, their mini-revival of three games unbeaten hit the buffers but easier challenges than this lie ahead for Sean Dyche's men. Player Ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Kompany (6), Stones (7), Laporte (7), Mendy (7), Fernandinho (8), B Silva (7), D Silva (8), Mahrez (8), Sane (7), Aguero (7) Subs: De Bruyne (8), Foden (7) Burnley: Hart (6), Lowton (5), Tarkowski (5), Mee (5), Taylor (6), Gudmundsson (5), Cork (5), Hendrick (5), Lennon (5), Defour (5), Vokes (5) Subs: Westwood (5), Wood (5) Man of the match: David Silva On his first return to Manchester City as an opposition player, Joe Hart received a warm reception from the home galleries but got no special treatment from his former team-mates. Aguero was on hand to power home past Hart after 16 minutes following some silky approach by David Silva. Team news Kevin De Bruyne returned from over two months off – he was on the bench. Perhaps surprisingly, Raheem Sterling was dropped for Leroy Sane while Kyle Walker was out injured. For Burnley, Sean Dyche has made two changes from the draw at Huddersfield with Steven Defour and Jeff Hendrick returning to the team. John Stones had to be alert to block away a goal-bound Jeff Hendrick effort on 35 minutes but it was City playing all the forward-thinking football. Clear-cut chances were hard to come by, although Aguero did fire wide from a tight angle just before the break. Burnley always had a puncher's chance but the all-important second goal ended their hopes of an unlikely result - but it was soaked in controversy. On 54 minutes, Sane went down in the area after what looked like a foul, which drew referee Moss to put the whistle to his lips but not commit to a decision. Burnley's defenders then stopped to seemingly accuse Sane of diving but David Silva was alive to the situation and kept the ball alive on the by-line. The ball looked to be out of play but was missed by the officials and his pass was smashed home in style by Bernardo Silva. The Burnley players surrounded the referee but the goal was given. Sean Dyche's Burnley were beaten heavily on Saturday afternoon Burnley never really recovered from that moment and Fernandinho thumped home a third with a powerful side-footed effort two minutes later. De Bruyne, back earlier than expected from knee ligament damage sustained in August, added further quality to City and Mahrez bent in a sumptuous fourth goal from 25 yards with seven minutes left before Sane wrapped things up in injury time. Man of the match: David Silva Amazingly, he came into the game with no assists this season but had created the second-most chances of any player in the league (22). He was at his creative best again here. There were to be no goals for the City legend but he unlocked the door twice to break his duck in terms of assists. That is 77 Premier League assists for the club in 255 appearances. Opta stats This was Manchester City's 23rd Premier League victory by a 5+ goal margin - 10 of them have been under manager Pep Guardiola. This was just Burnley's fourth Premier League defeat by a margin of five or more goals - half of them have been against Manchester City. There were just 115 seconds between Manchester City's second and third goals in this game. Man City's David Silva provided more than one assist in a Premier League game for the 12th time - only Ryan Giggs (17), Cesc Fabregas (17) and Thierry Henry (13) have done so in more. Aguero has scored seven goals in seven games in all competitions against Burnley - including netting in all four appearances against them at the Etihad. David Silva has assisted Aguero more often than any other Manchester City player in all competitions, with the Spaniard's assist for him today his 20th. Manager reaction: Pep Guardiola \"It's always hard after the international break as you don't know what's going to happen. In the first-half we created chances and Joe Hart made some incredible saves. But the second half was much better - it's always hard after the international break to get into a rhythm. But we had players on the bench to change our pace but when we scored the second and third goals it was easier. We played seriously and had a good game.\" 1:59 Pep Guardiola says Manchester City's goals were outstanding as they beat Burnley 5-0 at the Etihad. Pep Guardiola says Manchester City's goals were outstanding as they beat Burnley 5-0 at the Etihad. Manager reaction: Sean Dyche \"It's a strange goal for the second, which is inevitably the killer and the change in the game. Someone goes down with the tiniest of touches in the manner like they've been hit in the side. That's nearly given by the ref, then not given and waved away. Then the ball goes out of play, they cross it and then they score from it. Then at 2-0 down it's really difficult. We lost focus as we were so involved with the officials.\" 4:48 Burnley's Sean Dyche thinks Man City's Vincent Kompany should have seen red in the first minute during their 5-0 defeat.

Newcastle 0-1 Brighton Newcastle dropped to the bottom of the Premier League table after a fifth home defeat in a row in a 1-0 loss to Brighton. A nasty clash of heads saw Glenn Murray stretchered off and taken straight to hospital, delaying the match for around eight minutes early on, but it was not long before the visitors got themselves in front after Beram Kayal diverted Jose Izquierdo's strike into the net in the 29th minute. Newcastle pressed for that leveller, but were either frustrated by some fine goalkeeping from Mat Ryan, or their own wayward finishing. In truth, Brighton saw out a first away league win in almost a year with relative ease. Two points from nine matches sees Newcastle continue their worst-ever start to a top-flight season, with boos audible from all around as Newcastle dropped below Cardiff to sit bottom of the table. Brighton climbed one place to 12th after a second successive win. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Fernandez (6), Lascelles (6), Yedlin (5), Diame (5), Ritchie (5), Dummett (6), Shelvey (6), Kenedy (5), Perez (5), Muto (5). Subs: Joselu (5) Brighton: Ryan (8), Bruno (7), Bong (6), Duffy (7), Dunk (6), Stephens (6), Kayal (7), Jahanbakhsh (6), Murray (6), Izquierdo (7), March (7). Subs: Locadia (6), Bernardo (6), Bissouma (6) Man of the match: Mat Ryan The match started at a decent pace, with Ayoze Perez forcing a fine save out of Ryan from point-blank range early on, before Murray went up for a high ball with Federico Fernandez, clashed heads, and seemed to lose consciousness as he hit the ground. After lengthy treatment on the pitch, Murray was stretchered off, but the club later confirmed he had regained consciousness and was talking. That seemed to slow the tempo of the match in the aftermath, until Brighton took the lead in somewhat fortuitous circumstances. Shane Duffy headed a corner back to the edge of the Newcastle penalty area, Jose Izquierdo - making his first start of the season - arrived right on cue, drilled for goal, it took one deflection, before then coming off Kayal and finding the net. That final nick took the effort away from Martin Dubravka in the home goal. Team news Paul Dummett made his first start since the end of September after recovering from a hamstring injury, with Javier Manquillo dropping to the bench. Otherwise, Newcastle were unchanged from the side beaten at Manchester United last time out. Brighton's Davy Propper was missing with an ankle problem, Dale Stephens was passed a fitness test and started, while Jose Izquierdo made his first start of the season for the visitors. Anthony Knockaert dropped to the bench. The chances kept coming and going for Newcastle, with Jonjo Shelvey denied by another fine save from Ryan, before Kenedy fired for goal, only to see the ball skim the top of the crossbar and fly over the top. After the break, Newcastle put plenty of crosses into the box, but created very few real openings of note. Kenedy's decision to try a rabona shot at goal, when in a good position, which he got badly wrong, summed up their afternoon's efforts. Brighton could have made the result much more comfortable, but Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Yves Bissouma could not convert when clean through. Nonetheless, they held on to pile the misery on the St James' Park masses. Players help paramedics carry a stretcher following a clash of head between Glenn Murray and Federico Fernandez Opta stats Newcastle are just the fourth team in English top-flight history to lose their first five home league games of the season. Brighton had just two shots on target in this match - their goal in the 29th minute and then a saved shot two minutes into second-half injury time. Newcastle attempted 27 shots without finding the net - their most in a Premier League game without scoring since February 2014 (28 vs Sunderland). Beram Kayal became the second Israeli player to score a Premier League goal for Brighton (after Tomer Hemed). No club has had more players from Israel score in the competition (Bolton, Liverpool and West Ham also two). Jose Izquierdo (far right) wheels away from goal after giving Brighton the lead Man of the match - Mat Ryan The Australian international frustrated Newcastle in this fixture last season, and again provided stubborn resistance in the north east. His save early on to deny Perez was crucial, while his overall command of his penalty area, handling from crosses and distribution were on point. What's next? Newcastle travel to Southampton next Saturday, while Brighton host Wolves."},{"date": "20/10/2019", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56921, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup":

the London Stadium to extend their winning run in the Premier League to four matches. With just a minute to go until half-time, Lamela netted what proved to be the winner with a glancing header into the far corner after being picked out by a cross from Moussa Sissoko. West Ham did have the ball in the net with five minutes to go through Javier Hernandez, but it was correctly ruled out after Marko Arnautovic had drifted into an offside position. Mauricio Pochettino did not look particularly happy at full-time after witnessing another scrappy performance from his side, but the win lifts them into the top four and just two points behind league leaders Manchester City. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (6), Zabaleta (6), Balbuena (6), Diop (7), Cresswell (6), Anderson (5), Rice (7), Noble (6), Snodgrass (6), Yarmolenko (6), Arnautovic (7) Subs: Diangana (6), Hernandez (6), Antonio (6) Spurs: Lloris (9), Trippier (6), Alderweireld (8), Sanchez (6), Davies (6), Sissoko (7), Dier (6), Winks (7), Lamela (8), Lucas (7), Kane (5) Subs: Dembele (6), Llorente (5), Eriksen (N/A) Man of the match: Hugo Lloris A defeat to Brighton before the international break punctuated West Ham's good run of form but a draw and win against Chelsea and Manchester United respectively in their previous two games at the London Stadium, meant that they entered this match in confident mood, with Arnautovic firing a shot straight at Lloris inside the opening five minutes. It took a while for the game to come to life but a clash between the Brazilian Lucas Moura and the Argentinian Pablo Zabaleta on 15 minutes which left the latter with a gash above his right eye did result in the tempo being belatedly picked up. Zabaleta wasn't the only West Ham player to suffer discomfort in the first half, as AndrIy Yarmolenko departed on a stretcher just before half-time after suffering a nasty looking ankle injury. 10 - Erik Lamela has been directly involved in 10 goals in his last nine games in all competitions (7 goals, 3 assists). Form. #WHUTOT — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 20, 2018 On the stroke of half-time, Spurs took the lead through the lively Lamela. Sissoko did well to deceive Felipe Anderson on the right wing before sending a cross in with his left foot that required just a faint touch from Lamela to beat Lukasz Fabianksi. A minute later, Spurs almost doubled their lead when Lamela's cross-shot was spilled by Fabianski into the path of Davinson Sanchez, but the Colombian's effort was blocked by the West Ham 'keeper. Team news Manuel Pellegrini made two changes with Aaron Cresswell and Robert Snodgrass replacing Arthur Masuaku and Pedro Obiang. Mauricio Pochettino also made two changes as Erik Lamela and Ben Davies came in for Son Heung-Min and Danny Rose. The hosts started the second half in the ascendancy and Arnautovic thought he had equalised when he headed an Aaron Cresswell cross towards the top corner three minutes after the restart. However, Lloris darted across his goal-line to tip the ball over with an acrobatic save that left Arnautovic stunned. Hugo Lloris made a string of fine saves in the second half The battle between Arnautovic and Lloris continued and on the hour mark the Frenchman won out again, this time diverting a low shot from the Austrian wide of the post. Moments later, Arnautovic let his frustration get the better of him, clashing with Sanchez down by the touchline before receiving a yellow card for a rash sliding challenge on Kieran Trippier. Notes for Southgate There wasn't too much for Gareth Southgate to get excited about, despite the number of England players on show. Harry Kane was extremely quiet and barely had a chance all game, while Kieran Trippier's delivery lacked its usual precision. Eric Dier was solid in defensive midfield, while Harry Winks and Declan Rice - a potential option for Southgate in the future - caught the eye in midfield. A flare was let off in the home end and West Ham's bubble machine prematurely switched on when Hernandez had the ball in the net on 85 minutes only for it to be disallowed for offside, before Lloris triumphed over Arnautovic again in stoppage time, flying from his goal to make a block after West Ham's talisman had wriggled free of Sanchez inside the box. Opta stats West Ham have earned seven points from their opening nine games of the season, their worst return at this stage since 2010-11 (six points) when they finished bottom. Tottenham Hotspur have won five consecutive top-flight London derbies for the first time since January 1961, a season in which they won the First Division. West Ham are winless in eight Premier League London derbies since beating Chelsea in December 2017 (D5 L3). Spurs have won nine of their last 12 Premier League away games (D1 L2), including five of their six on the road this season. West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini has lost consecutive Premier League games without his sides scoring a goal for the first time. Erik Lamela has scored five goals in eight games in all competitions for Spurs this season, one more than he managed in 33 games last season. Man of the match - Hugo Lloris Hugo Lloris' status as Spurs' first-choice goalkeeper was questioned in the aftermath of his high-profile gaffe against Barcelona in the Champions League, but his performance at the London Stadium showed why Mauricio Pochettino has kept the faith in him. Despite their lofty position in the Premier League, Spurs have barely clicked into gear yet this season and they needed their World Cup-winning captain to be on top form to deny West Ham a point or more at the London Stadium. He made hat-trick of top saves to frustrate Marko Arnautovic. The first was the best of the lot as he stretched to tip over a header bound for the top corner, before he diverted a low shot round the post shortly after. Then in stoppage time, he rushed out to block a certain equaliser to ensure the win. What's next? Spurs must now focus on a must-win Champions League game against PSV on Wednesday in Eindhoven, before taking on Manchester City on Monday 29th October, live on Sky Sports. West Ham, meanwhile, are in action against Leicester City at the King Power Stadium next Saturday and then host Spurs again in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday, October 31."},{"date": "20/10/2019",

Watford Watford scored twice in 58 seconds to win 2-0 at Molineux and bring an end to Wolves' six-game unbeaten run in the Premier League. The Hornets produced a perfect response after losing 4-0 to Bournemouth two weeks ago, and there was less than a minute between Etienne Capoue (20) and Roberto Pereyra's (21) strikes that sealed the win for the visitors. While Wolves improved in the second half, they rarely tested Ben Foster and had just one shot on target - a back-heel from Willy Boly that was saved easily by the Watford goalkeeper. Watford move above Wolves by a place and a point in the table - going into seventh on 16 points - and end their four-game wait for a Premier League victory. Player ratings Wolves: Patricio (6), Bennett (5), Coady (5), Boly (5), Doherty (5), Moutinho (6), Neves (6), Jonny (5), Costa (7), Jiminez (6), Jota (6). Subs used: Vinagre (6), Cavaleiro (6), Traore (5). Watford: Foster (6), Feminia (7), Cathcart (7), Mariappa (7), Capoue (7), Masina (7), Doucoure (8), Hughes (7), Pereyra (8), Deulofeu (7), Success (6). Subs used: Gray (4), Prodl (n/a), Wilmot (n/a). Man of the match: Abdoulaye Doucoure. After a quiet start, the game burst into life in the 20th minute. Pereyra picked out Abdoulaye Doucoure at the top left corner of the box, and he touched the ball back into the path of the waiting Capoue who hammered the ball home from around 30 yards - sending it through the legs of Conor Coady - and leaving Rui Patricio rooted to the spot. Watford doubled their lead just 58 seconds later. They won the ball back with lightning speed after the restart, with Gerard Deulofeu bursting towards goal before finding Doucoure. He then slid the ball into the feet of Pereyra down the left of the box, with the Argentine producing a marvellous chipped finish to send the ball over Patricio and into the top far corner. Team news Wolves named the same XI for the ninth successive Premier League game. Watford made four changes with Troy Deeney (hamstring) and Andre Gray missing out on the XI. Adrian Mariappa, Adam Masina, Gerard Deulofeu and Issac Success came in. Wolves' only real chance of the first half came in the 40th minute as Diogo Jota slotted the ball into Raul Jiminez's but the forward could only drag the ball wide of the far post. Doucoure nearly added to his two assists with a goal not long after, but his effort was collected well by Patricio. The hosts improved in the second half and saw the better of possession, but never really tested Foster, with many chances running wide of going over the crossbar. In the 62nd minute they did work the goalkeeper as Joao Moutinho's free-kick was nodded down into the path of Boly, but his attempt to back-heel the ball home was saved down low. Seven minutes later and Watford should have added their third. Isaac Success slotted the ball into the path of Doucoure but some wonderful tracking from Ruben Neves allowed him to get across the body of the Watford midfielder to stifle his shot, with Patricio also of his line to help smother the ball wide. Roberto Pereyra celebrates after scoring Watford's second goal Substitutes Ruben Vinagre and Ivan Cavaleiro brightened the game up for Wolves in the second half. With 12 minutes to play, another wonderful cross from the former that was headed towards goal by Cavaleiro, but it went over the crossbar as Wolves suffered their second defeat of the Premier League season. Opta stats This was Wolves' first loss in 15 games in all competitions at Molineux since losing against Nottingham Forest in the Championship in January. Watford have won two of their last four away games in the Premier League (D1 L1), more than had in their previous 16 games combined (W1 D2 L13). Wolves have named the same starting XI in each of their opening nine games of the season, extending the Premier League record for this feat. Roberto Pereyra's goal was his first away league goal for Watford since scoring against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October 2017 - each of his previous seven goals had been at Vicarage Road. Etienne Capoue celebrates with Abdoulaye Doucoure after scoring his team's first goal Man of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure It was a toss-up between Doucoure and Pereyra for the accolade, but the former produced two wonderful assists and had the best chances to score a third for Watford during the game at the end of the first half and in the middle of the second. Along with Capoue, he helped smother the Wolves midfield as they struggled to get forward in the first half, and showed his cool head as they improved after the break. Ultimately, the reigning 'player of the season' had a huge hand in Watford's win. What's next? Wolves will travel to Brighton in the Premier League next Saturday while Watford welcome Huddersfield."},{"date": "20/10/2019", "arena": "The John Smith's Stadium", "attendance": 24263, "home_team":

1-0 at the John Smith's Stadium Watch highlights as Liverpool beat Huddersfield 1-0 at the John Smith's Stadium Mohamed Salah's first goal in five club games was enough to steer Liverpool to a 1-0 victory against a Huddersfield side who remain without a win after nine Premier League games. Liverpool's only shot on target all match proved to be the winner as Salah latched on to Xherdan Shaqiri's through ball (24) to score his 50th goal in English football. Jonathan Hogg hit the woodwork soon after, but it was as close as Huddersfield came to levelling, with David Wagner's side now without a home goal in five league games this season. The result leaves Huddersfield in 19th on three points, while Liverpool move back up to second behind leaders Manchester City on goal difference. Player ratings Huddesfield: Lossl (6), Zanka (6), Schindler (6), Lowe (6), Hadergjonaj (6), Hogg (6), Billing (6), Mooy (7), Durm (7), Pritchard (6), Depoitre (6) Subs: Mounie (6), Mbenza (6), Diakhaby (N/A) Liverpool: Alisson (6), Gomez (7), Van Dijk (7), Lovren (7), Robertson (7), Milner (6), Henderson (6), Lallana (6), Shaqiri (6), Sturridge (6), Salah (7) Subs: Wijnaldum (6), Fabinho (6), Firmino (6) Man of the match: Dejan Lovren Mohamed Salah proved decisive as Dejan Lovren helped Liverpool to a sixth Premier League clean sheet in nine matches With Jurgen Klopp handing Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana their first starts of the season, it was a slow start to proceedings at the John Smith's Stadium as Liverpool struggled with their link-up play in the final third. However, that was corrected midway through the half, as Shaqiri found Salah in a pocket of space before the Egyptian poked it across Jonas Lossl to score his fourth goal of the season. Mohamed Salah ends his longest wait without a goal for @LFC with his 1st goal in 5 appearances to put them ahead at @htafcdotcom. He had never previously gone longer than 3 appearances without a goal. pic.twitter.com/rEOB2r7Bdd — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) October 20, 2018 Salah's strike was ultimately the only shot on target all half, though Huddersfield did come close when Hogg's fierce strike from 25 yards hit the post. And the home side will feel they were denied a first-half penalty when the ball brushed both James Milner's thigh and hand, and soon after they saw a goal ruled out for offside when Alex Pritchard strayed just off before dinking an effort over Alisson. After the break, a header from the backtracking Laurent Depoitre forced Alisson into his only save of the match 10 minutes into the second half. Team news Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk were fit to start for Liverpool, but Sadio Mane (hand) and Naby Keita (hamstring) were not in the squad. Adam Lallana made his first start of the season in place of Georginio Wijnaldum, Daniel Sturridge started ahead of Roberto Firmino, while one Huddersfield change saw Florent Hadergjonaj come in for Rajiv van La Parra. The game continued at a leisurely pace, and it was Salah who then spurned Liverpool's best chance of the half when stroking an effort wide of Lossl's far post. Huddersfield's big opportunity came with 10 minutes to go, but after Virgil van Dijk and Dejan Lovren failed to clear a cross, Steve Mounie could only fire over from 10 yards out. Notes for Southgate Joe Gomez impressed defensively for Liverpool, while Adam Lallana returned to the fold as he looks to build up his match fitness. Jordan Henderson went off at half-time with a tight hamstring, while chances were few and far between for Daniel Sturridge. Trent Alexander-Arnold remained on the bench. Liverpool: Won 7 of opening 9 PL games for 1st time since 08-09 10 pts better off than this stage last season 6th clean sheet in 9 games - joint most in PL, with Man City 200th away PL win pic.twitter.com/aNBd6vpflw — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) October 20, 2018 Opta stats Liverpool have become just the fourth Premier League side to win 200 Premier League games away from home after Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal. Liverpool are unbeaten in 13 matches in all competitions against Huddersfield (W10 D3 L0) and haven't conceded a single goal in any of their last eight against the Terriers. Huddersfield have managed just two shots on target across their three Premier League games against Liverpool. Huddersfield have failed to score in their last seven home Premier League games since Tom Ince netted in a 1-0 victory for the Terriers against Watford back in April - only Manchester City (8 in 2006-07) have ever had a longer such run in the competition. Huddersfield have become just the second side in Premier League history to fail to score in any of their opening five home games of a season after Everton in 1998-99. Man of the match - Dejan Lovren Dejan Lovren made 11 clearances, two tackles and two blocks against Huddersfield Highlights of the match are unlikely to make Liverpool's end-of-season showreel, but three points is still three points. They were clinical when it mattered, and resolute in defence once more, recording a sixth clean sheet in nine league matches. At the heart of Liverpool's defence was Dejan Lovren, who made 11 clearances, two tackles and two blocks to keep Huddersfield at bay. The managers David Wagner: \"If it's the case that luck over a season evens out, then we're going to have a lot of luck in the next 29 games. \"It's true we have problems scoring goals, but it's also true that we're performing at a very high level. \"We're creating opportunities and have the spirit and the passion and desire to limit an opponent like Liverpool.\" 0:57 David Wagner rues Huddersfield's lack of goals following the 1-0 defeat to Liverpool David Wagner rues Huddersfield's lack of goals following the 1-0 defeat to Liverpool Jurgen Klopp: \"The basis we have created so far is brilliant - 23 points.I don't think I (have) had that before after nine games. And still space for improvement - good as well. So let's get home and work on improving. \"It was not that bad. It's maybe the first period in my life that we are winning average matches. That's true.\" 1:15 Jurgen Klopp praises Liverpool's 'brilliant' start to the season but says there is still room for improvement after riding their luck at Huddersfield Jurgen Klopp praises Liverpool's 'brilliant' start to the season but says there is still room for improvement after riding their luck at Huddersfield What's next?

display in a 5-1 victory at Fulham. Fulham started brightly but were caught on the counter by Arsenal, with Lacazette finishing superbly in the 29th minute to break the deadlock, before Andre Schurrle levelled things up on the stroke of half-time. The in-form Lacazette restored Arsenal's lead four minutes into the second half, before Ramsey nonchalantly finished off a flowing move to add a third in the 67th minute, 38 seconds after coming off the bench. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang then got in on the act 11 minutes from time to add a fourth, before he completed the rout in stoppage time as Arsenal moved level on points with Tottenham, while Fulham sit just above the relegation zone in 17th after a second successive league defeat. Player ratings Fulham: Bettinelli (7), Christie (5), Odoi (4), Ream (5), Le Marchand (5), Seri (6), Anguissa (6), Vietto (7), Schurrle (7), Ryan Sessegnon (5), Mitrovic (5). Subs: Kamara (6), McDonald (5), Johansen (N/A). Arsenal: Leno (8), Bellerin (8), Holding (7), Mustafi (7), Monreal (8), Torreira (8), Xhaka (7), Mkhitaryan (8), Iwobi (8), Welbeck (8), Lacazette (9) Subs: Aubameyang (9), Ramsey (8), Guendouzi (N/A). Man of the Match: Alexandre Lacazette. Arsenal were sloppy in the opening exchanges, and gifted Fulham the first chance of the match, but Bernd Leno denied Luciano Vietto with a smart stop. The visitors grew into the match, and soon got themselves in front through Lacazette. Alex Iwobi fed Nacho Monreal down the left flank, Monreal was afforded far too much time to pick out his man, he fed Lacazette, whose brilliant first touch took him away from his marker before firing home. Fulham responded well but were wasteful in front of goal until Schurrle stepped up with another fine finish. Vietto's through pass was perfect, Schurrle still had plenty to do, but expertly lofted the ball over the onrushing Leno to restore parity. Team news Fulham made two changes from their 3-0 defeat at Everton, with Cyrus Christie and Maxime Le Marchand replacing injured duo Joe Bryan and Timothy Fosu-Mensah. Petr Cech's injury meant Bernd Leno made his first Premier League start in goal for Arsenal. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Aaron Ramsey both dropped to the bench while Mesut Ozil was not in the squad due to a back spasm, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Alex Iwobi and Danny Welbeck starting. After the break, however, Fulham had no answer to Arsenal's array of attacking talent, with Lacazette netting the first of four second-half goals, beating Marcus Bettinelli, who had just pulled off a remarkable save to deny Hector Bellerin, with a fierce strike from distance. Arsenal's third was a contender for goal of the season, and reminiscent of Arsenal of old. There were flicks, slick through passes and brilliantly-timed runs, culminating in substitute Ramsey flicking the ball into the bottom corner from Aubameyang's centre. Aubameyang had quite the impact from the bench, as he then helped himself to a late double of his own. His first was a superb finish, as he swivelled sharply in the box and fired into the bottom corner, before he slotted home a fifth after carving Fulham open once more in stoppage time to complete a fine afternoon's work. Notes for Southgate Danny Welbeck created more chances than anyone on the pitch at Craven Cottage, helping himself to one assist. Marcus Bettinelli cannot be blamed for any of Arsenal's goals and actually made some fine saves, while Ryan Sessegnon really struggled to cope with Arsenal's pace. Opta stats Arsenal have won nine consecutive matches in all competitions for the first time since April 2015. Arsenal have a 51.5% win rate in Premier League London derbies (124/241) - the best in the division. In contrast, Fulham have the lowest win rate in these games (20.7% - 25/121). Fulham are the only side in the Premier League yet to keep a clean sheet this season, while no side has conceded more in the competition than the Cottagers (21). Arsenal have won four of their last five away Premier League matches (L1), as many as they'd won in their previous 19 on the road. This is Fulham's joint-lowest points haul after the first eight Premier League games in a season (also 5 pts in 2005-06). Aaron Ramsey scores Arsenal's third goal with a backheel into the far corner Man of the match - Alexandre Lacazette There were plenty of candidates for this award, but Lacazette just shades it for the quality of his goals, at crucial times. That is now five in five league games for Lacazette, who is very much the focal point of the Arsenal attack now, having suffered an injury-plagued first season at the club. His second was particularly well-timed, with Fulham in the ascendancy after their equaliser just before the interval. Arsenal now have a striker they can depend on, and are reaping the rewards. What's next? Arsenal host Leicester next after the international break, live on Monday Night Football, while Fulham travel to Cardiff."},{"date": "07/10/2019", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 27077,

exciting start to the Premier League season with a 3-0 win over Southampton on Super Sunday. Barkley, who was recalled to the England squad in midweek, was handed his third start of the season and set up Eden Hazard for the opener (30) before scoring himself from close range (57) - his first goal for the club. Alvaro Morata made it 3-0 (90+2) as Southampton struggled to make the most of some clear openings, including a jaw-dropping miss from Danny Ings from three yards out. The victory keeps Chelsea unbeaten and moves them to the joint-top of the Premier League, level on points with Liverpool and Manchester City.

But it was the hosts that should have struck first when Ings somehow fired over from inside the six-yard box after some great play down the left by Ryan Bertrand. Olivier Giroud had a strong penalty shout turned down after being caught late by Wesley Hoedt but they surged ahead minutes later. Team news Mark Hughes makes three changes from the 2-0 defeat at Wolves. Maya Yoshida, Jan Bednarek and Manolo Gabbiadini came in as Southampton switched to three at the back. Ross Barkley started in place of Mateo Kovacic for Chelsea. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg was robbed in possession by Barkley and he played through a perfect ball for Hazard, who smashed a shot past Alex McCarthy. Southampton switched to a 4-4-2 after the break and grabbed the initiative but Bertrand volleyed over at the back post when well positioned. Chelsea, always a threat with Hazard, doubled the advantage on 57 minutes. Notes for Southgate The recalled Ross Barkley has surely played his way into threatening the England starting line-up for games against Croatia and Spain with a confident and classy display. Ryan Bertrand and Nathan Redmond didn't make the squad but looked lively when combining down the left while goalkeeper Alex McCarthy did little wrong. Willian sent in a free-kick that was acrobatically hooked across goal by Giroud and Barkley was quicker to the loose ball than the Southampton defenders. Nathan Redmond crashed a long-range effort off the bar, but it was Chelsea to get the third goal when Morata, who had missed a glorious chance minutes earlier, skilfully finished off a flowing move instigated by Hazard in injury time. Alvaro Morata celebrates his goal against Southampton at St Mary's Opta stats Chelsea have won their last six Premier League games against Southampton, since losing 3-1 under Jose Mourinho in October 2015. This was the ninth home Premier League game since the start of last season that Southampton have failed to score in - only Huddersfield (12) have failed to score in more home Premier League games in that time. Hazard has been involved in 11 goals in 15 appearances against Southampton for Chelsea in all competitions (6 goals, 5 assists). Hazard scored and assisted in a Premier League game for the first time since October 2016 - which was also at St. Mary's against Southampton. In the last three seasons, Southampton have taken just seven points from their 26 Premier League games against 'big six' opposition (P26 W0 D7 L19). Man of the match: Ross Barkley Hard pushed by Hazard for the outstanding player award, Barkley became the first Englishman to score and assist in a Premier League game for Chelsea since Frank Lampard in December 2013. Producing those game-changing moments has always been an area of criticism aimed at Barkley but he was cool when it mattered on the south coast. Plus, his contribution in midfield with the ball was impressive, boasting a successful pass rate of 94 per cent. Gareth Southgate will have been beaming. Ross Barkley celebrates with team-mates after doubling Chelsea's lead Manager reaction: Maurizio Sarri \"We played a very good match. I am very happy for our fans because I think our support today was excellent. I'm very happy for the players - but we can do more. \"In the defensive phase we can do more. In the second half we have given them two or three opportunities.\" Manager reaction: Mark Hughes \"I was disappointed with the way we played. \"We didn't really affect them as readily as we talked about, in terms of being on the front foot, having intensity to our play and making sure we made it difficult for them.\" What's next? After the international break, Chelsea host Manchester United, live on Sky Sports Premier League, while Southampton travel to Bournemouth."},{"date": "07/10/2019", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance":

late penalty as Manchester City missed the chance to end Liverpool's unbeaten start to the season in a 0-0 draw at Anfield on Super Sunday. The Algeria international had the chance to snatch all three points for the champions after Virgil van Dijk tripped Leroy Sane in the area on 85 minutes, but he smashed the ball over from 12 yards as the much-anticipated top-of-the-table clash ended level. Liverpool looked to have City's number in a blistering opening 10-minute spell but Pep Guardiola's men settled, limiting the Reds to few chances as both sides' flawless starts to the season remained intact. The point lifts City top and Liverpool up to third in the Premier League on goal difference, with City's position heading into the international break consolation after failing to end their 18-game winless run at Anfield. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (7), Gomez (7), Van Dijk (6), Lovren (7), Robertson (7), Milner (5), Wijnaldum (7), Henderson (7), Salah (6), Mane (6), Firmino (6). Subs: Keita (6), Sturridge (5). Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (6), Stones (7), Laporte (7), Mendy (6), Fernandinho (8), B Silva (6), D Silva (7), Mahrez (5), Sterling (6), Aguero (6). Subs: Jesus (5), Sane (5). Man of the Match: Fernandinho Keen to add to their three victories over the champions last season, Liverpool flew out of the blocks. Mohamed Salah had the first opening inside four minutes as he latched onto a Joe Gomez header and skipped inside a defender, but he fired wide at Ederson's near post. Sadio Mane looked to have set up Salah for the opener with an inch-perfect cross three minutes later, after bursting past Bernardo Silva to get into the area, but the outstretched leg of Benjamin Mendy bailed City out, hacking the ball to safety. The trademark of Liverpool's powerful start was their ability to win the ball back high up the field - the first time City manage to replicate that, they created their first chance as Fernandinho slipped Raheem Sterling in down the right channel, and his shot was blocked behind for a corner. City's first prolonged spell of pressure yielded a strong appeal for a penalty on 20 minutes. Gomez's sliced clearance fell for Aguero in the area where he was clumsily bundled to ground by Dejan Lovren but referee Martin Atkinson was unmoved. James Milner is replaced by Naby Keita after picking up and injury Liverpool suffered a blow just before the half-hour mark with the loss of James Milner to injury and that, coupled with the hosts' inability to maintain their break-neck start, allowed City to get a foothold in the game. City's perseverance playing out from the back almost cost them dear nine minutes after the interval as Liverpool regained possession in opposition territory. Milner's replacement, Naby Keita, and Mane both tried to get shots away in quick succession but some last-gasp City defending scrambled the ball clear. Team news Jurgen Klopp made two changes following Liverpool’s midweek Champions League defeat as Dejan Lovren and Jordan Henderson replaced Trent Alexander-Arnold and Naby Keita. There were four changes to the City line-up as John Stones, Benjamin Mendy, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez were recalled. City saw another appeal for a penalty turned down on the hour when Fernandinho was penalised for a push on Van Dijk instead of the Dutchman's handball. The sense of injustice galvanised City, who created their best chance of the game a minute later. After David Silva threaded Mahrez through on goal, the Algerian outfoxed Andrew Robertson to fashion space and get a shot away but flashed a left-footed effort a yard wide. Virgil Van Dijk fouls Leroy Sane on the penalty area Liverpool rallied but their clinical final touch continued to evade them as Salah blazed an effort into the Kop, after latching onto Robertson's long through ball on 69 minutes, and substitute Daniel Sturridge failed to get enough power on a header 10 minutes later. City's third penalty appeal proved successful after Van Dijk's lunge on Sane, but Mahrez's woeful attempt let Liverpool off the hook as City surrendered two points. How crucial those points are, come the end of the season, remains to be seen. Opta stats Liverpool extended their home unbeaten run against Manchester City to 18 games in all competitions (W12 D6), with their last such defeat coming in May 2003 (1-2). Pep Guardiola has won just one of his last eight managerial meetings with Jurgen Klopp in all competitions (D3 L4), and is winless in the most recent four (D1 L3). Liverpool's return of 20 points is their joint-most after eight games of a Premier League campaign, having also done so in 1996-97 and 2008-09. Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 14 home games against 'top six' opposition in the Premier League, winning six and drawing eight of these fixtures. With Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City all yet to suffer a league defeat this term, this is just the second time in Premier League history that as many as three teams have gone unbeaten in their opening eight games of a single season (also 2011-12, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Newcastle United). Man of the Match - Fernandinho City suffered heavy defeats on their last two trips to Anfield. They say things come in threes, and perhaps they would have done had Fernandinho not been on the pitch. The Brazilian epitomised everything Guardiola would have wanted from his side - grit, determination and the capacity to disrupt Liverpool. The managers 5:33 Jurgen Klopp has called Liverpool to be given a break after they ended a gruelling three-week scheduled with a 0-0 draw against Man City. Jurgen Klopp has called Liverpool to be given a break after they ended a gruelling three-week scheduled with a 0-0 draw against Man City. Jurgen Klopp: \"It was a very intense game, two very well organised sides sticking to the plan. The start of the brilliant, spot on from the first second, we caused them a lot of problems. We had fantastic situations but couldn't finish unfortunately but stayed in the game over 90 minutes.\" 2:56 Pep Guardiola praised Riyad Mahrez's courage despite the Algerian late missed penalty at Anfield. Pep Guardiola praised Riyad Mahrez's courage despite the Algerian late missed penalty at Anfield. Pep Guardiola: \"We played so well. If you want to analyse the result, it is okay, it could be better. But at the end, the managers need to analyse what we have done and what we need to do. That is the most important thing.\" What would VAR have changed? Lovren's rash challenge from behind on Aguero was certainly worth another look, with the Liverpool centre-back failing to make contact with the ball as Aguero was sent tumbling. VAR could have been consulted to establish whether Mane kicked out at Fernandinho. The pair clashed in the 33rd minute, with the City midfielder adjudged to have fouled his Liverpool counterpart. When on the ground, Mane appeared to lash out, thrusting his legs into the air and towards the face of Fernandinho. Referee Atkinson looked on the incident favourable for Liverpool, with both players spoken to about their conduct. What's next? Both clubs resume their Premier League campaigns after the international break. Liverpool travel to Huddersfield for a tea-time kick-off on Saturday, October 20, while Manchester City host Burnley earlier that day at 3pm."},{"date": "06/10/2019", "arena": "Turf Moor",

for a Premier League win after a 1-1 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday. On the back of successive league wins, Sam Vokes' superb header put Burnley ahead against the run of play (20), but Huddersfield were level with a header of their own through Christopher Schindler (66). It was Huddersfield's first goal from open play this season, but they couldn't find a winner despite having the better of play, and remain 18th, without a win this season. Burnley's Sam Vokes opens the scoring against Huddersfield Player ratings Burnley: Hart (6), Lowton (5), Tarkowski (7), Mee (7), Taylor (6), Gudmundsson (7), Cork (6), Westwood (5), Lennon (5), Vokes (7), Barnes (6) Subs: Wood (5), Hendrick (5), Vyrdra (NA) Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Durm (6), Zanka (6), Schindler (7), Lowe (6), Hogg (6), Mooy (7), Van La Parra (6), Billing (6), Pritchard (6), Depoitre (6) Subs: Mounie (5), Mbenza (5), Hadergjonaj (NA) Man of the match: James Tarkowski The result leaves Burnley 12th, five points above the drop zone. Huddersfield had the majority of the ball and the chances in the first half; Jonathan Hogg blazed over in space on the half volley, James Tarkowski did superbly to block from Laurent Depoitre, but Burnley made them pay on 20 minutes. Picking the ball up on the right, Johann Gudmundsson delivered a fine cross to the back post for Vokes, who did well to direct a header back across goal and past Jonas Lossl from 10 yards. Team news Just the one change for Burnley after the 2-1 win at Cardiff; Barnes was preferred to Vydra in attack. Huddersfield also made just one change from the side that lost 2-0 against Spurs; Van La Parra came in, replacing Kongolo. Burnley's Sam Vokes (right) celebrates scoring against Huddersfield Aaron Mooy forced a good save out of Joe Hart from range after the break, before Vokes' flick from Gudmundsson's mis-hit was gratefully collected by Lossl at the other end, but it was Huddersfield who got the goal their pressure deserved. Latching onto Chris Lowe's deep cross into a crowd of players, Schindler rose highest to glance a fine header past Hart into the far corner from 10 yards. Huddersfield had 68 per cent of possession and 10 corners to Burnley's one, but struggled in the final third against the hosts, who were booed off at full time. Rajiv van La Parra is challenged by Matthew Lowton Opta stats Burnley have taken seven points from their last three Premier League games (W2 D1), after picking up just three points in the 10 before that (D3). Huddersfield are without a win in their last 12 league games (D5 L7); they last endured a longer winless streak in the league in a run of 17 games ending in November 2000. Sam Vokes has scored in consecutive Premier League games for Burnley for the first time since August 2017. Four of Sam Vokes' last five Premier League goals for Burnley have been headers with three of those assisted by Johann Berg Gudmundson. Man of the match - James Tarkowski On a day where Burnley's defence were tested more than they would have predicted, Tarkowski made a staggering 13 clearances, five more than any other player. Alongside Ben Mee, the England man was superb on an afternoon where Burnley's defence can be a lot of prouder of their work than their attack. He looked to have a slight hip injury late in the game, but both Sean Dyche and Gareth Southgate will be glad to see him finish the 90 minutes. What's next?

it four wins from their last five Premier League matches with a 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace, who are still yet to score at home this season. Matt Doherty scored the winner in the 54th minute, firing past Wayne Hennessey at the near post after a one-two with Raul Jimenez. Palace threatened an equaliser but Rui Patricio made a fantastic double save to deny Max Meyer and Jeffrey Schlupp. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Van Aanholt (5), Tomkins (5), Sakho (5), Wan-Bissaka (6), Milivojevic (6), McArthur (5), Schlupp (5), Townsend (5), Ayew (5), Zaha (5) Subs: Meyer (5), Kouyate (5), Sorloth (5) Wolves: Patricio (7), Doherty (7), Boly (7), Coady (7), Bennett (7), Jonny (6), Neves (6), Moutinho (6), Costa (5), Jota (5), Jimenez (6) Subs: Cavaleiro (5), Saiss (5), Traore (5) Man of the match: Rui Patricio Ivan Cavaleiro crashed a shot against the bar at the other end but Wolves held out to move up to seventh in the Premier League. Wolves have now gone unbeaten in six successive top-flight games for the first time since 1979 while Palace's scoring struggles at Selhurst Park have seen them pick up just one point from four home matches. Roy Hodgson's side made an encouraging start to the contest as they pinned Wolves back inside their own half. Aaron Wan-Bissaka is challenged by Diogo Jota However, aside from a cross from Wilfried Zaha that was fizzed across the face of goal, Palace created little, and it was the visitors who went closest to breaking the deadlock. Jimenez dragged a shot wide on the counter and was then denied by a superb one-handed save from Hennessey. Schlupp fired over from inside the box in the 34th minute before Diego Jota sliced off target at the other end. Matt Doherty scored the only goal of the game Doherty gave Wolves the lead after half-time, cutting in from the right, playing a one-two with Jimenez and then finishing past Hennessey. Palace came close to levelling as Jordan Ayew headed over from a corner and Patricio saved in quick succession from Meyer's sweetly-struck volley and Schlupp's follow-up shot. Team news Crystal Palace made one change as Jeffrey Schlupp replaced Max Meyer. Wolves became the first team in Premier League history to name the same starting XI for the opening eight games. Schlupp then saw a close-range effort blocked by Willy Boly, but there was no late surge from Palace after Cavaleiro struck the bar with a first-time shot from inside the box. Opta stats Crystal Palace are one of just two Premier League sides yet to score a home goal this season (4 games), along with Huddersfield. Prior to this season (Crystal Palace and Huddersfield), top-flight sides had failed to score in their first four home games of a season only twice before; West Brom in 1921-22 and Everton in 1998-99. Wolves have won four of their last five top-flight games, as many victories as they managed in their previous 40. Wolves have conceded just one goal in their last seven games in all competitions, after shipping eight in the four before that. Wolves wing-back Matt Doherty has been directly involved in three goals in his last four league appearances (one goal, two goals), as many as he managed in his previous 20. Each of Wolves' last eight Premier League goals have come in the second half, with just one of their nine overall this season coming before the break. Man of the match - Rui Patricio Hennessey's save from Jimenez in the first half was one of the best of the season so far, but Patricio's double save in the second half ultimately helped Wolves win the game. He did well to keep out Meyer's volley but his quick recovery was crucial in denying Schlupp on the rebound. He also kept out shots from Luka Milivojevic and Townsend to record another clean sheet. Pundit reaction Charlie Nicholas: \"Somewhere along the line Roy Hodgson has got to change this situation because it's too predictable playing with just Jordan Ayew through there. It was too predictable when Christian Benteke was there. My concern is Crystal Palace cannot wait until January to find goals. \"They have to go and adapt their team to create more chances. I don't think they've got the personnel. They're too predictable and because they are predictable they'll hardly ever create enough chances to win a football match.\" What's next? Crystal Palace are live on Sky Sports on successive weekends after the international break as they travel to Everton on October 21 and then host Arsenal on October 28.

Sigurdsson's sensational 77th-minute strike earned Everton a 2-1 win over 10-man Leicester City at the King Power Stadium. Richarlison gave the visitors the lead after seven minutes as he tapped home from Bernard's cross but Ricardo Pereira levelled with five minutes remaining of the first half. Wes Morgan was sent off for a second bookable offence just after the hour-mark and it proved the turning point as Everton made the numerical advantage count. Sigurdsson collected Kurt Zouma's pass before bending an unstoppable right-foot shot into the top corner to notch his 50th Premier League goal and help Everton move up to 11th, level on points with Leicester. Richarlison celebrates putting Everton in front at Leicester Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Chilwell (7), Morgan (5), Maguire (6), Pereira (6), Amartey (5), Mendy (6), Ndidi (6), Maddison (5), Iheanacho (6), Vardy (6).

Subs: Tosun (6), Schneiderlin (n/a), Calvert-Lewin (n/a) Man of the match: Gylfi Sigurdsson Silva handed Bernard his first Premier League start and his decision was vindicated when the Brazilian cut inside Daniel Amartey and found Richarlison, who tucked the ball inside the post for his fourth goal of the season. Everton missed the opportunity to extend their lead after 30 minutes as Theo Walcott lost his footing while attempting to dribble past Harry Maguire before Jamie Vardy flicked a shot wide when put clean through moments later. Ricardo Pereira celebrates his equaliser against Everton Team news Leicester were unchanged from their 2-0 win at Newcastle, meaning that Kelechi Iheanacho retained his place behind Jamie Vardy. Marco Silva made one change to his side following the 3-0 win against Fulham as Bernard came in for his first Premier League start at the expense of Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who dropped to the bench. Leicester levelled when Everton were caught out from their own attacking corner. Pereira played a one-two with Kelechi Iheanacho before turning Jonjoe Kenny inside out and firing inside Jordan Pickford's near post. Leicester made the brighter start to the second period, with Ben Chilwell cutting inside before curling his shot a yard wide, but Claude Puel's men lost all momentum when Morgan was dismissed. The captain had already been booked for an early foul on Richarlison when he caught the Everton forward once more, leaving referee Andre Marriner with little choice but to brandish a second yellow. Silva looked to find a winner as Cenk Tosun was introduced, moving Sigurdsson deeper - and the move paid dividends. The Iceland international picked up the ball 30 yards out before turning inside James Maddison and unleashing a sublime shot beyond Schmeichel into the top corner. Southgate's England watch Harry Maguire – It was an off-colour first half from the Leicester centre-back as he was sloppy in possession and fortunate not to be punished on more than one occasion. But in Wes Morgan’s absence, Maguire grew in stature as his valiant attempts to protect a point were only in vain thanks to Sigurdsson’s brilliance. James Maddison – Fresh from his first senior call-up, this was a quiet afternoon for Leicester’s creator-in-chief. He produced one fine pass for Jamie Vardy that the Leicester striker was unable to convert before he lashed at his only chance soon after Everton had re-established their lead. Hooked with 10 minutes remaining. Jordan Pickford – The Everton stopper had a much quieter afternoon than he might have expected given the quality in Leicester’s attacking third, but on the one occasion he was truly tested, the 24-year-old will feel he ought to have done better. Pereira found the near post with ease to drag Leicester level. Man of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson Sigurdsson is now showing signs of the player for whom Everton forked out £45million two summers ago. The Icelander had already linked up well with Bernard during a lively start from the Toffees, and with Leicester reduced to 10 men, captain Tom Davies was withdrawn and handed the captain's armband to Sigurdsson. He took on the responsibility to grab all three points for his side with a venomous shot into the top corner, his fourth goal in as many games to propel Everton into the top half of the table. Sigurdsson's strike was his 19th Premier League goal from outside the box since The managers Claude Puel: \"We played 10 against 11, but I think we had a feeling to go back and protect our box. It was not a good attitude from us, because we needed to continue playing our game. \"We defended too deep and conceded a fantastic goal. We suffered, and tried to push at the end, we nearly scored in injury time [Daniel Amartey missed a free header from close range] but it was too late.\" 4:37 Claude Puel admits he was left frustrated after watching his side lose Claude Puel admits he was left frustrated after watching his side lose Marco Silva: \"I've told our players we have many things we need to improve. We have quality inside. \"Until now, I didn't have all my players available to work, but with all of them we will be stronger for sure. \"Now is a good moment for the international break, and it won't be easy for us to work with so many players away. After, we will come back strong and have a tough match against Crystal Palace, but we have to do things our way.\" 4:24 Marco Silva was pleased with his side's first Premier League away win of the season Marco Silva was pleased with his side's first Premier League away win of the season Pundit reaction Paul Merson: \"Morgan's red card was pivotal because Everton went on to win the game. The game was in the balance when he got sent off. \"One yellow was a certainty but two yellows, I thought it was very harsh.

months handed Spurs a narrow 1-0 victory over Cardiff who had Joe Ralls sent off at Wembley. The winning goal came after just eight minutes when Dier side-footed into the corner from close range after Davinson Sanchez's header had deflected into his path. Cardiff had their chances to equalise, particularly through Josh Murphy whose goalbound effort was cleared off the line by Toby Alderweireld, but Ralls' sending off for a knee-high foul on Lucas Moura after an hour proved costly. The result means that Spurs have moved into third place in the Premier League table while Cardiff have slipped to bottom following Huddersfield's draw against Burnley. Player ratings Spurs: Lloris (7), Trippier (6), Alderweireld (7), Sanchez (7), Rose (6), Winks (8), Dier (7), Sissoko (6), Lucas (6), Son (6), Kane (6) Subs: Wanyama (6), Lamela (6), Davies (N/A) Cardiff: Etheridge (7), Manga (7), Morrison (7), Bamba (6), Bennett (6) , Ralls (5), Arter (6), Camarasa (6), Hoilett (6), Murphy (7), Paterson (7) Subs: Ward (N/A), Harris (N/A), Reid (N/A) Man of the match: Harry Winks Fresh from their disappointing defeat to Barcelona in midweek, Spurs started the game on the front foot and raced into an early lead. Kieran Trippier's cross into the box was met by the head of Sanchez and although the Colombian's effort was blocked by Sol Bamba, the ball dropped perfectly to Dier inside the six-yard-box to finish the rebound. Cardiff struggled to deal with Spurs' set-pieces early on and Sanchez almost doubled the home side's lead after a quarter of an hour when his shot was blocked by Neil Etheridge after the ball had dropped his way via a Lucas Moura run. After responding slowly to going behind, Cardiff had a great opportunity to equalise on 23 minutes. Josh Murphy showed remarkable pace to breeze past Danny Rose and latch onto a Calum Paterson flick-on and although he was able to lift the ball over Hugo Lloris, Alderweireld beat Junior Hoilett to the bouncing ball to hack it off the line. Team news Mauricio Pochettino made three changes to the team beaten by Barcelona in midweek. Danny Rose, Eric Dier and Moussa Sissoko came into the side with Ben Davies, Victor Wanyama and Erik Lamela making way. Neil Warnock made two changes to the team that lost to Huddersfield with Joe Bennett and Junior Hoilett replacing Greg Cunningham and Kenneth Zohore. Either side of the break, Spurs had numerous chances to finish off the visitors. Lucas missed two gilt-edged opportunities to settle the contest before the interval. First, he missed a header from a Trippier cross and then side-footed a Heung-min Son cut-back wide, while Harry Kane and Lucas again were denied by interventions from Etheridge and Sean Morrison just after the restart. Just before the hour-mark, Cardiff's hopes of getting something from the game were dealt a huge blow when Ralls was given a straight red for a cynical lunge on Lucas by the halfway line. After the Brazilian had knocked the ball past him, Ralls hacked him down with a dangerous challenge that caught him by the knee. Kane was booked for his angry reaction to the foul. Despite being reduced to ten-men, it was Cardiff who actually had the best opportunity to score in the final half hour when Morrison's header from a Victor Camarasa free-kick forced Lloris into a smart save down to his right with the ball ricocheting off the post before being cleared by Alderweireld. Opta stats Tottenham are unbeaten in their last 38 Premier League home games against promoted sides (W35 D3). Cardiff are winless in their first eight games to a league season for the third time, and first since 1989-90 in the old Division Three. Tottenham have scored at least once in each of their last 19 Premier League home games, the longest current run in the competition. Cardiff remain the only side Tottenham striker Harry Kane has faced but not scored against in the Premier League. The England forward had six shots today, more than any other player in the match. 546 - Eric Dier has scored his first Premier League goal in 546 days, since netting against Watford at White Hart Lane in April 2017. Scrap. #TOTCAR — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 6, 2018 Tottenham's Eric Dier scored his first Premier League goal in 546 days, since netting against Watford at White Hart Lane in April 2017. Joe Ralls' red card was only Cardiff's second in the Premier League, with Juan Cala against Sunderland in April 2014 the other. Man of the match - Harry Winks It was a disjointed display from Spurs who badly missed both Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen between the midfield and attacking lines. during the Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Cardiff City at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on October 6, 2018 in London, United Kingdom. One player who did look to link things together throughout was Harry Winks. No player on the pitch completed more than his century of passes with 68 of those coming in Cardiff's half, while only Kieran Trippier had more touches. Following a lengthy lay-off with ankle injuries, Winks has now put together a run of starts and he seems to be growing with every game.

Wales international David Brooks opened the scoring before King converted a spot-kick - Christian Kabasele was sent off for conceding the penalty - and he added a third with a well-placed header from Callum Wilson's cross. The Cherries scored a fourth early in the second half when Wilson flicked over Ben Foster from close range to seal a miserable afternoon for Javi Gracia's side. The result moves Bournemouth up to fifth in the Premier League after back-to-back wins, while Watford drop to eighth after failing to register a victory in their last four games. Player ratings Watford: Foster (5), Femenia (5), Cathcart (4), Kabasele (3), Holebas (5), Doucoure (5), Capoue (6), Hughes (5), Pereyra (5), Gray (5), Deeney (5) Subs: Mariappa (5), Deulodeu (6), Success (6) Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Francis (7), S.

David Brooks scored his second goal in two games for Bournemouth King raced down the left, picking out Wilson, who forced a fantastic save out of Foster before the 21-year-old burst forward to put the ball into an empty net. The Hornets wasted a golden chance to level the scoring soon after, with Jose Holebas picking out Craig Cathcart from a corner, but the unmarked defender blazed his free header well wide. The key moment of the match came when Kabasele was shown a second yellow just after the half-hour mark - when he pulled down King inside the box - and the Norwegian sent Foster the wrong way from the resulting penalty, slotting into the bottom-right corner. Team news Watford's only change saw Kiko Femenia come in for Marc Navarro at right back, while Gerard Deulofeu returned to the bench, looking to make his first Premier League appearance of the season. Bournemouth, meanwhile, stuck with the same XI that beat Crystal Palace on Monday. Ex-Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe replaced young striker Lys Mousset on the bench. Bournemouth began to dominate with their one-man advantage, and after Brooks fed Wilson down the right, the striker found King inside the box, who headed past Foster for his second and the Cherries' third in the 45th minute. Wilson confirmed Bournemouth's record top-flight away win just two minutes into the second half when he flicked over Foster from Ryan Fraser's cross on the left, and the Cherries cruised on to secure all three points by seeing out the game in comfortable fashion. Managers Eddie Howe: \"We're very pleased with the result. Really tough place to come, Watford have been in very good form themselves this season. It wasn't the perfect performance, but it was efficient, and we got a great result. \"I think we're capable of beating anybody when we're on the top of our game. I don't think we were on top of our game today, so that's good because there's room to grow and improve. \"But the results show we are in a really good place at the moment, a great position in the league, and we need to keep our feet firmly on the floor and keep pushing. \"Hopefully they won't [start talking about us]. We like to stay very much in the background and as underdogs. We'll just go about our work in a very controlled way and not get ahead of ourselves.\" 2:07 Eddie Howe says his Bournemouth side believe they can beat anyone Eddie Howe says his Bournemouth side believe they can beat anyone Javi Gracia: \"Today was a bad day. A strange afternoon. We started trying to do our best, but from the beginning, I think they played better than us, and after we play with ten players, it was very difficult for us. \"The players kept going in the second half with a good attitude, but it was very difficult. \"Today is the first game where we feel we're not at a good level. In the rest of the games, we have competed very well. \"Today, it has been different and we need to know that to improve for the next game. I'm sure the players in the next game will have a better performance.\" 2:52 Watford boss Javi Gracia admits it was a difficult afternoon for his side Watford boss Javi Gracia admits it was a difficult afternoon for his side Opta stats Bournemouth's 4-0 win at Watford is their biggest ever away top-flight victory. Bournemouth are just the second different side to beat Watford by 4+ goals in a Premier League match at Vicarage Road, after Man City (0-5 in May 2017 and 0-6 in September 2017). Since returning to the Premier League in 2015-16, Watford have been shown more red cards than any other side in the competition (13). Bournemouth have kept a clean sheet on the road in the Premier League for the first time since January, ending a run of nine without one. Watford have conceded 19 penalties in the Premier League since the start of the 2015-16 season; only West Ham (22) have given away more. Bournemouth have scored four goals away from home in a Premier League game for only the second time, and first since August 2015 (4-3 at West Ham). Bournemouth's Josh King has scored 34 goals in the Premier League - only four Norwegians have scored more in the competition (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Steffen Iversen, John Carew and Tore Andre Flo). Bournemouth's David Brooks has scored in successive league games for the first time in his career. Man of the Match - Joshua King Joshua King has scored four Premier League goals this season It could have gone to Wilson or Brooks, but King was the standout player for his two goals and winning the penalty that saw Watford go down to ten men, which massively changed the game. The ex-Manchester United striker placed his spot-kick perfectly, keeping a cool head to send Foster the wrong way, while he did well to connect with Wilson's cross for his second. King's all-round play was superb and he was the focal point of most Bournemouth attacks, while also feeding balls to the likes of Wilson, Brooks and Fraser. He now has scored four goals in eight Premier League games - two behind Eden Hazard - and one behind Sergio Aguero, Harry Kane, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Glenn Murray. Notes for Southgate Watford’s Nathaniel Chalobah didn’t even make it off the bench, while Will Hughes failed to impress in the 4-0 defeat as he was brought off in the 55th minute. For Bournemouth, Wilson bagged his third goal in eight Premier League games, while Lewis Cook enjoyed a good game in the centre of midfield in what was only his second top-flight start of the season. What's next? Bournemouth host south-coast neighbours Southampton at the Vitality Stadium on October 20 (3pm kick-off) when the Premier League returns after the international break. Watford travel to Wolves on the same day at Molineux. That game will also get underway at 3pm."},{"date": "06/10/2019", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74519, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Bailly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["19"]}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Shaw", "yellows": ["45+2"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott McTominay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["45"]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Pogba", "yellows": ["63"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["67"]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Victor Lindelöf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["67"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["19"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fred", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["45"], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Martin Dubravka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javi Manquillo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": ["58"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Diamé", "yellows": ["69"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["68"]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["88"]}, {"name": "Yoshinori Muto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["78"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Schär", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jacob Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["68"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Hayden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["88"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Atsu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["78"], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "3:00 Manchester Utd 3-2 Newcastle Manchester Utd 3-2 Newcastle An under-pressure Jose Mourinho saw his Manchester United side fight back from two goals down to earn a dramatic 3-2 win against Newcastle at Old Trafford on Saturday. Substitute Alexis Sanchez grabbed the winner with a dramatic 90th-minute header, giving the hosts what had seemed like an unlikely victory and sending Old Trafford wild. The pre-match talk was dominated by Mourinho's future, with Man Utd insisting they will remain patient with their manager, dismissing reports he would be sacked after the game. Anthony Martial had brought the hosts level with 14 minutes remaining Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (6), Shaw (6), Bailly (5), Smalling, Young (4), McTominay (5), Pogba (7), Matic (4), Rashford (5), Martial (7), Lukaku (6) Subs: Mata (7), Fellaini (6), Sanchez (7) Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Manquillo (5), Lascelles (5), Fernandez (5), Yedlin (6), Ritchie (5), Shelvey (6), Diame (5), Kenedy (6), Perez (5), Muto (6) Subs: Murphy (5), Atsu (NA), Joselu (NA) Man of the match: Paul Pogba But the talk intensified as Mourinho's side got off to the worst possible start, tamely allowing Newcastle to race into a two-goal lead through Kenedy (8) and Yoshinori Muto (10), the first time they have conceded two goals inside 10 minutes at Old Trafford in the Premier League. Nemanja Matic missed a sitter early in the second half, but sub Juan Mata halved the deficit with a fine free-kick (70) to give United hope, and they duly levelled shortly after through Anthony Martial's finish (76) before Sanchez's winner. The result leaves United in eighth place, four points off the top four, while Newcastle are 19th with just two points from eight games this season under Rafa Benitez. Team news Valencia wasn't named in the United squad, while Young, McTominay and Martial returned to the starting XI. Andreas Pereira was back on the sub's bench. For Newcastle, Muto, Fernandez and Manquillo came in following the defeat by Leicester. Jose Mourinho reacted to going behind by taking Eric Bailly off for Juan Mata The home fans welcomed Mourinho positively before the match, but the mood soon flattened as Newcastle took the lead through Kenedy, curling left-footed into the far post after a simple ball from Ayoze Perez found him one-on-one with the stranded Ashley Young. It was 2-0 just two minutes later through Muto, turning and smashing past David de Gea from 12 yards for his first Newcastle goal. Man Utd fans replied defiantly, singing: \"We love United, we do,\" while Newcastle fans mocked Mourinho with a rendition of: \"You're getting sacked in the morning.\" Mourinho reacted, hooking Eric Bailly for Juan Mata after just 19 minutes, and they should have pulled one back through Marcus Rashford, whose close-range header from Romelu Lukaku's cross fell inches wide. Newcastle could have just as easily been 3-0 up as De Gea saved well from Muto's point-blank header after finding acres behind the back line, before two strong penalty appeals at both ends were waved away by Anthony Taylor for handballs against Young and Muto. Paul Pogba and Chris Smalling react after Newcastle's second goal Boos were heard at the break, Marouane Fellaini then replaced Scott McTominay for the second half, but United's back three consisted of Chris Smalling, Nemanja Matic and Pogba early after the restart. Matic aptly produced a defender's finish after Pogba's deflected shot was saved by Martin Dubravka, blazing over the rebound from six yards when it seemed harder to miss. Mata made amends, curling home a superb free-kick from 25 yards, before Dubravka came to Newcastle's rescue twice in a minute, beating away Fellaini's half-volley effort and then producing an even better stop from Smalling's close-range strike. The hosts were level with 14 minutes remaining after a world class move; Martial slipped the ball into Pogba, whose backheel flick gave Martial space to fire past Dubravka and into the bottom left corner from 15 yards. Mo Diame saw a header cleared off the line by Lukaku at the other end, but the pressure on the Newcastle goal began to intensify. Criticised for his performances since joining the club in January, Sanchez popped up with the dramatic winner, heading home Young's cross from eight yards. Ashley Young looks to rally his team-mates after a poor start Man of the match - Paul Pogba Special mentions should go to trio Juan Mata, Marouane Fellaini and Alexis Sanchez, who contributed superbly from the bench, but on balance, Pogba shone. His flick for Martial's equaliser was world class, he rarely misplaced a pass, with an accuracy second only to Mata, and most importantly, he worked. He ran 11.47km, second only to Matic, and made a team-high 14 sprints. There's room for improvement, but it's a start. The managers Jose Mourinho: \"I am 55 years old. It is the first time I see man-hunting. I can cope with it. I can live with it. Some of the boys, in spite of them not being the man that is hunted, they are not coping well with it,\" he told BT Sport. Rafa Benitez: \"We have more or less the same squad, we changed some players. We did well [last season] because we were consistent, and we are working from the beginning until the end, very hard, and I think we will do the same.\" Opta stats Man Utd registered their seventh Premier League win after being 2+ goals down at half-time, four more than any other team. Paul Pogba has had a hand in 29 Premier League goals under Jose Mourinho at Man Utd (13 goals, 16 assists), more than any other player. This is Newcastle's joint-worst-ever start to a top-flight season after eight games in terms of points (3), after 1888/89, 1977/78 and 2015/16 (3pts for a win). Newcastle are winless in their eight Premier League games this season - only in 1898-99 (first 10) have they gone longer without a win from the start of a top-flight campaign.

Murray made the breakthrough in the 25th-minute lead with his fifth Premier League goal of the season, and 99th in total for Brighton. Team news Brighton made three changes from last weekend’s 2-0 loss at Man City, with Iran forward Alireza Jahanbakhsh handed a first league start, while Bruno and striker Glenn Murray both returned to their starting XI. West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini, meanwhile, stuck with the same team that beat Man Utd last Saturday. Chris Hughton's side then held on to record a much-needed victory that sees them move up to 12th in the table, while West Ham fall to 15th after a fifth defeat in eight league matches this season. Manuel Pellegrini's team arrived on the south coast full of confidence after beating Manchester United 3-1 last time out, and that showed in the early exchanges as the in-form Marko Arnautovic went close after a cleverly worked free-kick. However, it was Brighton who opened the scoring when Andriy Yarmolenko carelessly lost possession on halfway, allowing Beram Kayal to scamper free down the left wing. From the Israeli's cross, the unmarked Murray side-footed home his sixth goal in his last four games against West Ham. The home team comfortably held that advantage until half-time, but it was a different West Ham who came out after the interval as they looked to build on their recent good form against opponents intent on defending their slender lead. Just before the hour-mark, Paraguay centre-back Fabian Balbuena somehow glanced Felipe Anderson's left-wing corner inches wide of the far post, although despite all the visitors' possession, it was actually Brighton who then came closest to grabbing the next goal. For once, though, that man Murray's radar malfunctioned as the 35-year-old twice headed over when well placed.

Opta stats West Ham have lost all three of their Premier League meetings with Brighton, losing with a different manager each time (Bilic, Moyes and Pellegrini) Glenn Murray has scored 12 Premier League goals for Brighton in 2018 - the only Englishmen with more this calendar year are Harry Kane (17) and Jamie Vardy (14) Only Eden Hazard (6) has scored more Premier League goals in the 2018-19 season than Brighton striker Glenn Murray (5) Brighton's Spanish full-back Bruno became just the second outfield player in the last five seasons to start a Premier League game aged 38 or older, along with Gareth McAuley West Ham have lost seven of their last 10 away Premier League games (W2 D1) 27% of Brighton's wins in the Premier League have been against West Ham (3 of 11) .@GM_83’s last 5 apps v West Ham: Today - ⚽️ Feb 2018 - ⚽️ Oct 2017 - ⚽️⚽️ Jan 2016 - ❌ Feb 2015 - ⚽️⚽️ pic.twitter.com/9Jca3Ov46a — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) October 5, 2018 Managers Chris Hughton: \"It is a little bit difficult to get the right combinations. The two centre halves have played so many games together and I just thought after the last couple of games that we needed Bruno's composure on the ball. \"In the end, though, it probably was not about composure, it was about trying to defend well on that side because I thought they were very strong on the flanks. \"The centre halves are as brave as each other, but when you are in that sort of mode, you know you have to throw your body on the line. And it takes that to get a result.\" 5:19 Chris Hughton felt Brighton rode their luck during their 1-0 win against West Ham on Friday Night Football Chris Hughton felt Brighton rode their luck during their 1-0 win against West Ham on Friday Night Football Manuel Pellegrini: \"We didn't play the first half in the way we must do. We were unlucky to lose it though, we created three clear chances in the second half, they had one and scored. In the second half we dominated, created chances but couldn't score. \"We had another team in front of us who played well. They didn't create too much either in the first half but they played with a higher pace and recovered more balls, but I think it was not a game we should have lost.\" 1:39 Manuel Pellegrini said West Ham were unlucky to lose 1-0 to Brighton as he felt the Hammers created the majority of chances but were unable to convert any of their chances Manuel Pellegrini said West Ham were unlucky to lose 1-0 to Brighton as he felt the Hammers created the majority of chances but were unable to convert any of their chances Man of the Match - Lewis Dunk Brighton's defence has not been as solid as it was last season, but their back four was back to its best against West Ham on Friday Night Football. There can be no coincidence either that this was the first time the home side's favoured back line played together, with Dunk an inspiration in particular as West Ham went in search of an equaliser. The 26-year-old, who earlier in the day had penned a new five-year deal, made five clearances and regained possession seven times, more than any of his team-mates. As a result, the home team kept a first clean sheet of the campaign and at a vital time. Notes for Southgate Gareth Southgate is short of strikers at the moment and he can only have been impressed with Glenn Murray’s tireless display up front for the hosts. In fact, the only Englishmen to score more Premier League goals in 2018 than the Brighton forward are Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy. Declan Rice’s performance in midfield for the visitors may have passed the England boss by, though, as the West Ham youngster prepares to decide which country to play for. What's next? Brighton take on Newcastle United at St James' Park when the Premier League returns to action after the international break. West Ham, meanwhile, face Tottenham Hotspur at the London Stadium, with that game also taking place at 3pm on Saturday, October 20."},{"date": "01/10/2019", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance":

Bournemouth 2-1 Crystal Palace Bournemouth maintained their best start to a Premier League season with a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football. David Brooks opened the scoring with a peach of a left-footed strike (5) but Palace improved after the break and levelled through Patrick van Aanholt (55), despite him looking a yard offside. The spoils looked set to be shared, but Junior Stanislas hit the winning goal from the penalty spot (86) after referee Mike Dean had spotted an elbow from Mamadou Sakho on Jefferson Lerma. Eddie Howe's men are unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League games against teams outside the big-six. Team news Eddie Howe made two changes from the 4-0 Premier League loss at Burnley last time out with Lewis Cook and Simon Francis returning while Max Mayer replaced Cheikhou Kouyate in Palace’s only change from their 0-0 draw with Newcastle. The Londoners lacked a cutting edge in the final third as their tally of just five goals in their seven league matches will be a worry for Roy Hodgson moving forward. Palace had kept clean sheets in their last three games in all competitions but it took the creative Bournemouth attackers just five minutes to open up the visitors. David Brooks gave Bournemouth the lead Adam Smith sped down the left and crossed for Callum Wilson, who held the ball up before setting up Brooks. He hadn't scored from any of his 12 shots so far this season but buried this one into the top corner with a top-class strike - his first goal since joining for £11.5million from Sheffield United. Player Ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Francis (6), Ake (8), Smith (7), S Cook (6), L Cook (6), Lerma (6), Brooks (7), Fraser (7), Wilson (6), King (6) Subs: Gosling (6), Stanislas (7) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), van Aanholt (7), Tomkins (6), Sakho (6), Wan-Bissaka (7), Milivojevic (6), Meyer (6), McArthur (6), Townsend (6), Zaha (6), Ayew (6) Subs: Schlupp (6), Kouyate (6), Sorloth (6) Man of the match: Nathan Ake After a lacklustre first-half showing, where they hardly tested Asmir Begovic, Palace responded by stepping up the intensity in their play and were level on 55 minutes. Wilfried Zaha - quiet up until this point - found a clever pass to the galloping Van Aanholt, who looked half a yard offside. The flag stayed down though and the full-back sent a soaring right-footed strike into the net, which was his fifth goal in his last 11 appearances. Patrick van Aanholt celebrates scoring for Crystal Palace against Bournemouth Neither team were settling for just a point and it was the hosts who produced the decisive, match-winning moment. From a set-piece, Sakho stupidly raised an arm into the face of Lerma and Dean had no hesitation in pointing to the spot. Substitute Stanislas had only been on the pitch for three minutes but he stayed cool to fire his team to all three points with his first touch. Man of the match: Nathan Ake The Dutchman channelled the spirit of the on-looking Frank De Boer in the Monday Night Football studio with a faultless display at the heart of the Bournemouth defence. Co-commentator Andy Hinchcliffe was purring over his contribution to the game. He said: \"There is so much to admire about Bournemouth going forward but Ake hardly put a foot wrong. He was good on the ball, made clearances, made blocks and he led his back four really well. A superb all-round performance.\" England watch England U20 World Cup winning captain Lewis Cook made his first Premier League start of the season and was tidy in possession but faded as the game went on. The most impressive Englishman on the pitch was Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who coped with Ryan Fraser for large parts and was cool with his distribution. Opta stats Bournemouth have won a Premier League game on a Monday for the first time, in their sixth attempt (D1 L4). Crystal Palace have won just one of their last six top-flight games (D1 L4), after winning each of the four before that. At 21 years and 84 days, David Brooks is the youngest player to score for Bournemouth in the Premier League. Callum Wilson has been directly involved in four goals in his last four home Premier League games for Bournemouth (1 goals, 3 assists), one more than he managed in his previous 12 (3). Since the start of last season, Crystal Palace's Patrick van Aanholt has scored six Premier League goals; among defenders, only Marcos Alonso has more (8), with Nacho Monreal also on six. Wilfried Zaha has had a hand in 10 goals in his last 12 Premier League appearances (8 goals, 2 assists), one more goal involvement than he managed in his 32 games before that (9). Bournemouth's Junior Stanislas has scored in three consecutive Premier League home games for the first time since November 2009 with West Ham. 3:13 Nathan Ake says Bournemouth have started the season well but they must now maintain momentum, following their 2-1 win against Crystal Palace. Nathan Ake says Bournemouth have started the season well but they must now maintain momentum, following their 2-1 win against Crystal Palace. Manager reaction: Eddie Howe \"It was a difficult second half for us. I thought Crystal Palace played well and we took a bit of a while in that half to get in our stride. Once we did, we had some great chances towards the end of the game and it's a massive win for us. \"They've got some very good players in the attacking areas and we just got pinned back. Our two strikers didn't become a force in the game at that moment. It was all hands to the pump to keep them out and, if anything, the goal they scored released that pressure for us. \"We made a tactical switch and we were able to build on that and finish the game really strongly.\" 4:56 Eddie Howe says it was a huge victory for his side following their 2-1 win against Crystal Palace, and praised the way Bournemouth finished the game so strongly. Eddie Howe says it was a huge victory for his side following their 2-1 win against Crystal Palace, and praised the way Bournemouth finished the game so strongly. Manager reaction: Roy Hodgson \"I thought we played well in the second half and it's disappointing to end up on the losing side for a penalty we gave away right at the end. That's disappointing, of course. \"Both the free-kick and the penalty were errors on our part and we paid a high price for it. We shouldn't have given a free-kick away and I've told Alex that. \"It was an unnecessary push in the back so I'm disappointed about that and the penalty… I don't know that Mama deliberately tried to catch him with his elbow.\" 3:38 Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson says it is disappointing to end up on the losing side after his side played so well in the second half of their 2-1 defeat to Bournemouth.

back-to-back wins for the first time since April with a 2-1 victory at struggling Cardiff on Super Sunday. Second-half strikes from Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Wales international Sam Vokes were enough to secure the win for Sean Dyche's men, who now find themselves 12th in the table having overcome a difficult start to the campaign. Josh Murphy broke his Cardiff duck with his first Premier League goal to equalise on the hour, but Vokes' winner confirmed a fourth consecutive defeat for Neil Warnock's side. It means Cardiff, who remain second-bottom in the Premier League, are without a win from their first seven games back in the top flight. The hosts applied good early pressure on the Burnley goal, with Ben Mee forced to deflect a wicked Murphy cross wide before Callum Paterson's ball narrowly evaded the Cardiff winger in an encouraging opening four minutes. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (5), Cunningham (4), Morrison (5), Bamba (5), Manga (5), Arter (5), Ralls (5), Camarasa (6), Murphy (7), Paterson (6), Zohore (5). Subs: Ward (5), Madine (5). Burnley: Hart (7), Lowton (5), Tarkowski (4), Mee (6), Taylor (6), Cork (6), Westwood (7), Gudmundsson (7), Lennon (5), Vydra (6), Vokes (7). Subs: Wood (5), Long (6). Man of the Match: Joe Hart Murphy, operating down the left, remained Cardiff's biggest threat. Having played a one-two to get into the area on 18 minutes, he tried to catch Joe Hart out at his near post, but his effort crashed off the woodwork. Victor Camarasa released Kenneth Zohore through on goal with a clever flick-on four minutes later, but the striker's shot deflected behind. Cardiff had the ball in the back of the net from the resulting corner but Sean Morrison was penalised for climbing all over Kevin Long. Sam Vokes and Joe Ralls jostle for possession at the Cardiff City Stadium Another flick, this time from the impressive Paterson, presented Zohore with another chance on 41 minutes, and the Dane's near-post poke drew a fine save from Hart. Morrison then kept the ball from the corner that followed, nodding it back into the area where Paterson's looping header was cleared from under his own crossbar by Matej Vydra. Team news Neil Warnock made four changes following Cardiff’s defeat to Manchester City. Kenneth Zohore made his first start since August 25, while Sol Bamba, Callum Paterson and Josh Murphy also returned. Fresh from their first win of the season against Bournemouth, Sean Dyche named an unchanged Burnley side. Vokes' appeals for a penalty four minutes into the second half were correctly overruled by referee Martin Atkinson, who saw the Burnley forward clip his own heels after racing clear of Morrison. But Burnley were not to be denied much longer as Gudmundsson, after outmuscling Greg Cunningham to reach a deep Ashley Westwood cross, squeezed a header past Neil Etheridge to give the visitors the lead. Josh Murphy equalised for Cardiff with his first goal for the club Cardiff spurned a glorious chance to respond immediately as Camarasa flashed a volley over. But the lead would only last another seven minutes as Camarasa and Bruno Manga combined down the right before setting up Murphy, who arrived on the scene perfectly to rifle home the equaliser. Murphy was denied a spectacular second as Hart brilliantly tipped his curling 20-yard effort over the bar. Three minutes later, though, Burnley were back in front as Vokes stooped to meet Gudmundsson's cross and applied the finishing touch to a flowing counter-attack. Notes for Southgate With England’s Nationals League double-header against Croatia and Spain just over a fortnight away, injury to Burnley defender James Tarkowski will have concerned Gareth Southgate. Tarkowski, who started England’s 1-0 friendly victory over Switzerland earlier this month, appeared to injure his right shoulder inside 10 minutes but manager Sean Dyche confirmed it was a groin injury that forced the centre-back off after 27 minutes. Opta stats Cardiff have failed to win each of their opening eight games of a season in all competitions for just the second time (W0 D2 L6), following the 1964/65 season. Cardiff are winless in their last 11 games in the Premier League (D3 L8), conceding 26 goals and scoring just six themselves in this run. Burnley have recorded back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time since April, having gone 10 games without a victory prior to their 4-0 win against Bournemouth last week. This was Burnley's first victory over Cardiff in all competitions since April 2007 (2-0), having failed to win any of the previous 13 (D9 L4). With Cardiff, Newcastle and Huddersfield all yet to win, this is just the third time in Premier League history that as many as three teams have failed to record a victory through their opening seven games of a campaign (also in 2004/05 and 2012/13). Since the start of last season, Johann Berg Gudmundsson has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than any other Burnley player (14 - three goals and 11 assists). Each of Cardiff's four goals in the Premier League this season have been assisted by defenders (two by Sean Morrison and one each for Bruno Manga and Joe Bennett). What would VAR have changed? Cardiff had a shout for handball in first-half stoppage-time when an attempted overhead kick from Paterson appeared to strike the arm of Matthew Lowton. However, under VAR review, the benefit of the doubt would more than likely have been given to the defender, who was protecting his face at such close proximity. Man of the Match - Joe Hart Chants of 'England's No. 4' emanated from the Cardiff home support behind the goal Hart was protecting in the second half, but he took that in his stride with the same degree of surety with which he kept a potentially rampant Cardiff side at bay. Burnley were made to work for their victory, and no-one put a bigger shift in than Hart. His overall presence in the area when Cardiff sought a second equaliser was telling, not to mention his spectacular stop to deny Murphy's curling effort. What's next? Both teams resume their Premier League campaign next Saturday at 3pm. Cardiff travel to Wembley to take on Tottenham, while Burnley host Huddersfield at Turf Moor."},{"date": "29/09/2019", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56938, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham

West Ham's 3-1 win over Manchester United in the Premier League West Ham piled more pressure on Jose Mourinho with a 3-1 victory over Manchester United at the London Stadium. Paul Pogba returned after his midweek spat with Mourinho, but it took just five minutes for things to unravel as record signing Felipe Anderson scored his first West Ham goal with a deft near-post flick. A miserable first half for the visitors was compounded two minutes before the break when Andriy Yarmolenko's shot took a wicked deflection off Victor Lindelof to double the Hammers' lead. Marcus Rashford halved the deficit just after the underwhelming Pogba had been substituted on 70 minutes, but Marko Arnautovic extinguished any hopes of a comeback with his fourth goal of the season four minutes later. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (8), Zabaleta (8), Balbuena (7), Diop (7), Masuaku (7), Rice (7), Noble (8), Obiang (7), Anderson (8), Yarmolenko (7), Arnautovic (8). Subs: Snodgrass (5), Diangana (n/a), Antonio (n/a). Man Utd: De Gea (5), Young (5), Lindelof (4), Smalling (4), Shaw (5), Matic (5), Fellaini (5), McTominay (5), Pogba (4), Martial (5), Lukaku (5). Subs: Fred (4), Mata (4), Rashford (6). Man of the Match: Mark Noble West Ham's first home league victory since the final day of last season lifts them to 12th in the table. Manchester United drop to eighth - eight points off leaders Liverpool having played a game more - after equalling their worst start to a Premier League season. All the talk ahead of kick-off concerned Pogba and Mourinho after a turbulent week off the pitch, but an industrious West Ham display laid Manchester United's on-field troubles bare. Mark Noble's incisive through pass released Pablo Zabaleta, who was marginally offside, in behind Ashley Young, and the full-back's low cross was brilliantly diverted past David de Gea by Anderson inside five minutes. Felipe Anderson makes it 1-0 with a back-heel effort The visitors steadied after falling behind but attempts on goal were sporadic. Anthony Martial headed a Young cross wide from an offside position before a Romelu Lukaku header clipped the outside of the post midway through the first half. Just as had been the case against Everton and Chelsea, a resolute defensive display proved key for West Ham, who doubled their lead with a touch of fortune. Team news Marko Arnautovic replaced Michail Antonio in West Ham’s only change from their goalless draw with Chelsea. Jose Mourinho made four changes to the Manchester United side that drew with Wolves as Ashley Young, Nemanja Matic, Scott McTominay and Anthony Martial started. Paul Pogba also started despite his midweek spat with his manager. Alexis Sanchez, Jesse Lingard and Antonio Valencia were missing, with Mourinho citing “options” for their absence. Yarmolenko gathered the ball in the area, fashioned a yard of space to get a shot away and his effort struck Lindelof at close range before looping over the helpless De Gea. A stunning point-blank save from Lukasz Fabianski to claw a Marouane Fellaini header off the line preserved West Ham's two-goal lead on 64 minutes. Paul Pogba walks past Jose Mourinho after his second-half substitution Six minutes later Mourinho withdrew the ineffective Pogba but United were on the board within 60 seconds as substitute Rashford brilliantly diverted a corner beyond Fabianski with a near-post flick. But any momentum gained from that strike lasted just four minutes as Noble's brilliant through ball dissected the Manchester United defence and released Arnautovic, who drilled a low shot past De Gea to wrap up the victory and pile more misery on Mourinho. Opta stats Manchester United have won just 10 points in the Premier League this season; they last picked up fewer points from their opening seven games of a top-flight campaign in 1989/90 (7). West Ham beat Manchester United by a 2+ goal margin in a league game for the first time since October 1982 (also 3-1). Manchester United have scored three Premier League own-goals in 2018, more than any other side. Felipe Anderson is only the second Brazilian to score for West Ham in the Premier League, after Ilan Araujo, who scored four for the club in 2010. Manchester United's David De Gea has kept just one clean sheet in his opening seven Premier League games this season having kept six shut-outs in his first seven last season. Manchester United attacker Marcus Rashford has had a hand in four goals in six Premier League appearances against West Ham (1 goal, 3 assists). In 2018, only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (24) has been directly involved in more Premier League goals than Marko Arnautovic (17 - 10 goals, 7 assists). Man of the Match - Mark Noble Manchester United lined up with four recognised central midfielders - including the returning Pogba - in their team, but it was West Ham's captain who stole the limelight. Noble was the heartbeat of the latest improved Hammers performance but did so much more than leg-work in the middle of the park, as seen with his incisive assist for Arnautovic's game-clinching strike. What would VAR have changed? Things could have been different had Zabaleta been flagged offside in the build-up to West Ham's opening goal. But pinning Manchester United's defeat on that decision would be disingenuous to the Hammers, who were well worth their victory. This game did not hinge on that goal. Manchester United's troubles at present run much deeper than that. What's next? West Ham travel to Brighton on Friday Night Football - live on Sky Sports Premier League. Manchester United resume their Champions League campaign at home to Valencia on Tuesday before hosting Newcastle at Old Trafford at tea-time on Saturday."},{"date": "29/09/2019", "arena": "Emirates

Cathcart's own goal and a Mesut Ozil second gave Arsenal a flattering 2-0 victory over Watford for a seventh win in a row. Alexandre Lacazette's pressure on Cathcart saw him turn Alex Iwobi's cross beyond Ben Foster with nine minutes to go at the Emirates, before which the visitors had enjoyed the better of the chances. Will Hughes had volleyed an early chance wide, Andre Gray had a one on one saved by substitute goalkeeper Bernd Leno and an Isaac Success effort glanced the post with the scores goalless. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (6), Bellerin (7), Holding (5), Mustafi (5), Monreal (6), Torreira (6), Xhaka (7), Aubameyang (6), Ozil (6), Ramsey (5), Lacazette (6) Subs: Leno (7), Iwobi (7), Welbeck (5) Watford: Foster (7), Navarro (6), Cathcart (6), Kabasele (7), Holebas (7), Hughes (6), Capoue (6), Doucoure (7), Pereyra (7), Deeney (7), Gray (6) Subs: Success (7), Femenia (n/a) Man of the match: Jose Holebas But once unconvincing Arsenal went ahead they quickly added another, Lacazette turning provider and Ozil firing home (83) to give Arsenal a seventh consecutive win, and fifth in the Premier League. Watford's confidence has not been shaken since their perfect start to the campaign was ended by a draw and a defeat from their last two games, and they pressed Arsenal from the off at the Emirates. But they could have been behind within five minutes, when Christian Kabasele's cumbersome challenge in the box caught Lacazette. The forward gallantly tried to stay upright but stumbled over a second later - and it was enough for referee Anthony Taylor to wave for a goal kick. Team news Arsenal made one change from the side that beat Everton, with Rob Holding replacing Sokratis. For Watford, Daryl Janmaat's injury meant Javi Gracia was forced to change his line-up for the first time this season, and chose Marc Navarro to replace him. Hughes failed to take advantage of that let-off when he planted a volley wide from the edge of the box minutes later, when he should have found the target given the time he had to shoot. Alexandre Lacazette is challenged in the Watford penalty area An end-to-end game ebbed and flowed but Arsenal spent much of the game lacking imagination, and their best chance of the half came from a Watford mistake when Lacazette caught Cathcart in possession, before racing through and missing the far corner. Petr Cech was forced off with a hamstring injury just before half-time and his replacement Leno needed to be in good form after it, denying Deeney's toe-poke from a Jose Holebas free-kick with a brilliant diving save. It was his decisiveness rather than his reflexes which would then thwart Gray, when he raced off his line to narrow the angle when the striker was played through one-on-one and shot straight at him. What would VAR have changed? Ultimately, it would not have had an effect on the result, but had Anthony Taylor had a chance to review the decision not to give Lacazette an early penalty he would have changed his decision. But he was nowhere near keeping out Success' effort when the Arsenal defence again went to sleep and allowed him to find space in behind, and was relieved to see the forward's dinked effort brush the far post before going out. Arsenal's sighs of relief soon turned to cheers of delight when Iwobi's cross struck Cathcart's leg and bounced into his own goal, before Ozil doubled the lead from a rapid break with the visitors pushing forward for an equaliser. Notes for Gareth Southgate Will Hughes had a quiet time on the Watford right, and failed to really affect the game. Troy Deeney showed his excellent link-up skills, making a number of chances and using his strength well. Those goals extend the Gunners' winning run under Unai Emery for their longest run of Premier League victories since August 2017, but for the second weekend in a row their performance did not live up to the result. Match stats Watford have won only one of their last 15 away league games, drawing two and losing 12. Since returning to the top-flight in 2015/16, Watford have scored seven own-goals, more than any current Premier League side. Arsenal have scored 10 Premier League goals in the second half this season, a joint-high tally along with Manchester City. Bernd Leno is the eighth German player to play for Arsenal in the Premier League (also Gnabry, Lehmann, Malz, Mertesacker, Mustafi, Ozil and Podolski); only Manchester City have seen more German players in the competition (10). Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil has scored two goals in his last three Premier League games, as manay as he managed in his previous 18. Since the start of last season, Alexandre Lacazette has been directly involved in 22 Premier League goals for Arsenal (16 goals, 6 assists), five more than any other player. Man of the match - Jose Holebas Holebas was the creator of a lot of Watford's good moments, including that Deeney toe-poke, and put in more good crosses (4) than anyone else on the pitch, while also keeping Bellerin and Aubameyang quiet for the most part. His crossing ability is not too widely known outside of Vicarage Road, but he is capable of sending in inviting, whipped deliveries from the left, and more than adept from dead balls too as he showed at the Emirates. Managers Unai Emery: We are improving each match and that's giving us information to develop tactically and keep improving, but winning is the most important thing. 3:03 Unai Emery says he is confident that Arsenal will continue to improve after the Gunners secured their seventh successive win under their new coach with a 2-0 win against Watford. Unai Emery says he is confident that Arsenal will continue to improve after the Gunners secured their seventh successive win under their new coach with a 2-0 win against Watford. But when we are winning, we need to demand to continue to improve because there were a lot of things in the 90 minutes today which need to improve, but a lot of things we are doing well too. Javi Gracia: We had a lot of chances, clear chances, but we didn't score and it was the same as in one of our previous games, if you don't score after dominating the game. 2:00 Javi Gracia says he is proud of his team's performance and believes they deserved far more out of their Premier League match with Arsenal. Javi Gracia says he is proud of his team's performance and believes they deserved far more out of their Premier League match with Arsenal. We had more chances more clear chances, more shots, more shots on target, and feel really good but at the end we didn't deserve the result. What's next?

The first half was a mostly drab affair, but Marco Silva's half-time team talk worked as Everton burst into life and Sigurdsson made up for missing a 51st-minute penalty with a curling opener five minutes later. Cenk Tosun (65) nodded home from close range to double the lead before Sigurdsson (89) scored his second late on to give Everton their first clean sheet this season. Fulham have still never won a league game at Goodison Park, and remain in 16th place, while Everton move up to 11th spot with nine points. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Kenny (7), Keane (7), Zouma (7), Digne (7), Gueye (7), Davies (6), Sigurdsson (8), Walcott (7), Calvert-Lewin (7), Richarlison (7). Subs used: Tosun (6), Bernard (5), Schneiderlin (n/a). Fulham: Bettinelli (6), Fosu-Mensah (n/a), Sessegnon (6), Odoi (5), Ream (7), Bryan (5), Seri (5), Anguissa (5), Schurrle (6), Vietto (5), Mitrovic (4). Subs used: Christie (5), Cairney (4), Ayite (n/a). Man of the match: Gylfi Sigurdsson. Fulham were forced into an early substitution after Timothy Fosu-Mensah landed heavily on his elbow, and he was replaced by Cyrus Christie in the eighth minute. The visitors had a good chance to take the lead five minutes later as Ryan Sessegnon pulled the ball back for Andre Schurrle at the top of the area, but he lifted his strike just over the crossbar. Marcus Bettinelli was twice called into action not long afterwards. He kept out an effort from Kurt Zouma near the back post after Lucas Digne's well-delivered free-kick, although the offside flag was raised against the Frenchman. Bettinelli then denied Theo Walcott, who fired from just outside the area, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin unable to convert the loose ball. Team news Everton made no changes to their XI from last weekend. Fulham made four changes with Denis Odoi, Tim Ream, Joe Bryan and Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa coming into the side. The latter three players were the only to keep their places from the midweek Carabao Cup win against Millwall. The best chance of the first half came in the 43rd minute. After some patient build-up from Fulham, Jean Michael Seri drove towards the box before flashing the ball through the area. Sessegnon was incoming at the back post and with only Jordan Pickford to beat, he agonisingly put his chipped effort onto the underside of the crossbar before it went wide. Everton came racing out of the traps in the second half and, after a big miss from Richarlison, the hosts were awarded a penalty in the 50th minute. Denis Odoi nudged Calvert-Lewin over in the area and Sigurdsson stepped up to take it, but saw his effort ping onto the crossbar. Gylfi Sigurdsson scored twice in Everton's 3-0 win But he redeemed himself six minutes later with a wonderful strike to break the deadlock. Sigurdsson slipped in Jonjoe Kenny, who did well to keep the ball in play on the right and cut it back into the area. Odoi cleared, but only as far as the Iceland international, who curled a beautiful effort around his marker and into the bottom corner. Ten minutes later, and substitute Tosun doubled the lead. Kenny was involved again, playing Walcott in down the right of the area before the latter put a superb ball across the face of goal. Tosun was waiting at the back post to nod home at point-blank range and score just his second goal at Goodison Park. Everton continued to dominate and got a deserved third with a minute of normal time to play. Seconds after coming on as a substitute, Bernard broke down the field - bamboozling Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa on the left flank - before cutting the ball back for Sigurdsson at the top of the area. He then swept the ball home, leaving Bettinelli rooted to the spot as Everton comfortably took all three points. Notes for Southgate Jordan Pickford kept a clean sheet in the same week he signed a new six-year deal with Everton, and did well when he was tested, albeit rarely. Michael Keane kept Aleksander Mitrovic quiet all game, which has been a rare feat this season. Tom Davies and Dominic Calvert-Lewin had a fairly quiet game, while Theo Walcott produced a wonderful assist for Cenk Tosun's goal. For Fulham, Marcus Bettinelli had a tough after in goal and could arguably have done for Everton's third. Ryan Sessegnon was another youngster who had a quiet afternoon, although should have scored in the first half. Opta stats Everton have won their last 22 top-flight home games against Fulham - a record in English top division football. Fulham haven't kept a clean sheet in any of their last 22 away Premier League games, the longest ongoing run in the division (current clubs only). Fulham have lost four straight league games against Everton for the first time ever. Everton winger Theo Walcott has had a hand in four goals in his last five Premier League home games (2 goals, 2 assists), as many as he managed in his previous 13 in the competition. Cenk Tosun celebrates scoring Everton's second goal The managers Marco Silva: \"In the second half, I told them we had to be more aggressive and play with more calm during some moments. They did that and I think a good example is when we missed the penalty, Gylfi and the squad, they reacted to win balls in our offensive part of the pitch. \"It was the perfect result to win 3-0 and the first clean sheet for us is important as well.\" 2:54 Everton manager Marco Silva believes his side are growing in confidence after they won 3-0 at home to Fulham Everton manager Marco Silva believes his side are growing in confidence after they won 3-0 at home to Fulham Slavisa Jokanovic: \"We dominated for the first 45 minutes... We had clear chances to score a goal. The second half, we didn't play well enough and we didn't find the chances. \"In the second half, we paid a really expensive price. We must learn and continue with the process and start to be more competitive. To concede in the games is not acceptable and it is going to be really hard for us.\" 2:49 Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic criticised his side's finishing after they wasted first-half chances in their match against Everton, going on to lose 3-0 Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic criticised his side's finishing after they wasted first-half chances in their match against Everton, going on to lose 3-0 Man of the match - Gylfi Sigurdsson While very few players covered themselves in glory in the first half, Sigurdsson was one of the driving forces behind Everton's brilliant second-half showing. He showed real character to go and score twice after missing a penalty which would knock the confidence of most players. But two superb finishes - especially his first - followed and since 2011/12, Sigurdsson has netted 18 goals from outside the box in the Premier League, a haul only Philippe Coutinho can better (19). Saturday showed how effective he can be when he is at his attacking best. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates his goal in front of the Everton fans What's next? Next up for Everton is Southampton in the Carabao Cup third-round tie on Tuesday before travelling to Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday.

Stadium for the second season running to hand Spurs a 2-0 win over Huddersfield and lift his side into the top four. Much has been made of Kane's indifferent form at the start of this season but he looked as sharp as ever when leaping high to head home Kieran Trippier's pinpoint cross from the right after 25 minutes. Less than 10 minutes later, Kane grabbed his and Spurs' second from the penalty spot after Florent Hadergjonaj had upended Danny Rose with a clumsy challenge. Spurs have now won their last three matches in all competitions following a three-game losing streak and head into their midweek clash against Barcelona in good spirits, while Huddersfield remain without a Premier League win this season. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (7), Durm (6), Schindler (5), Zanka (5), Kongolo (6), Lowe (6), Billing (6), Mooy (6), Hogg (5), Pritchard (5), Depoitre (6) Subs: Hadergjonaj (4), Mbenza (6), Mounie (N/A) Spurs: Gazzaniga (7), Alderweireld (7), Sanchez (6), Vertonghen (6), Trippier (8), Dier (6), Dembele (6), Rose (7), Son (6), Lucas (7), Kane (9) Subs: Wanyama (6), Winks (6), Sissoko (N/A) Man of the match: Harry Kane The visitors rather sleepwalked their way into the game but they still had two great opportunities to score inside the opening 10 minutes. Rose was almost the unlikely provider of the game's opener when he headed a Trippier cross just wide, before Kane's attempted chip moments later was well smothered by Jonas Lossl. It wasn't long before Spurs did go in front, however. After being forced wide inside the area, Lucas laid the ball off to Trippier who whipped a devilish ball into the box for Kane to power a header into the ground and beyond Lossl. It was the seventh goal that Trippier has assisted for Kane since the start of last season - more than any other combination in the division. 7 - Since the start of last season, no player has provided more Premier League assists for another player than Kieran Trippier has for Harry Kane (7). Synergy. pic.twitter.com/zJvaFOe4s9 — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) September 29, 2018 To compound matters, Terence Kongolo was forced off injured in the immediate aftermath of Kane's opener and his replacement Hadergjonaj gave away a soft penalty just a few minutes after coming on when he tangled with Rose. Kane stepped up, sent Lossl the wrong way and smashed his penalty into the net to move into fifth place in the club's all-time top scorers list with 145. Team news David Wagner made two changes to his side with Spurs academy graduate Alex Pritchard and club captain Jonathan Hogg replacing Rajiv Van La Parra and Elias Kachunga. Mauricio Pochettino made one alteration as Davinson Sanchez came in for Christian Eriksen who was absent with an abdominal injury. Huddersfield were inches away from pulling one back in first-half stoppage time and, had they done so, the whole complexion of the game may well have changed. Chris Lowe's delivery from the byline was met with a thundering volley from Laurent Depoitre but the Belgian was mightily unfortunate to see his effort bounce off the underside of the bar and out, with goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga well beaten. The second half largely passed by without incident although Gazzaniga had to be on his toes to keep out a goalbound effort from substitute Isaac Mbenza late on, while Son Heung-Min and Lucas were both guilty of squandering decent counter-attacking opportunities for the away side. Notes for Southgate Gareth Southgate has steadfastly backed his captain Harry Kane amid question marks over his form but he will have been heartened to see him score twice regardless. There were plenty of other promising performances too with Kieran Trippier a constant menace with his delivery on the right and Danny Rose rampaging down the left. Eric Dier demonstrated his versatility by playing central midfield and in defence, while Harry Winks was also given a 45-minute run-out. Spurs held onto their win pretty comfortably in the end, although Mauricio Pochettino will be concerned at having to bring off both Jan Vertonghen and Mousa Dembele at half-time ahead of their huge midweek game against Barcelona, with Dele Alli ruled out and Christian Eriksen doubtful. Man of the match - Harry Kane It looked more like the Harry Kane of old as the Spurs striker appeared fresher, stronger and sharper throughout. The manner in which he raced onto Toby Alderweireld's hopeful long ball early on made a mockery of recent claims that he isn't fit, even though he was unable to cap the run with a goal. Harry Kane doubled Tottenham's lead from the penalty spot He didn't allow that miss to play on his mind, though, and scored an excellent header soon afterwards to continue his burgeoning telepathic relationship with Kieran Trippier - a combination that is as promising for England as for Spurs. Kane capped his display with yet another emphatic penalty and it would be difficult to find a more accomplished finisher from such situations than the Spurs No.10. Opta stats Huddersfield have failed to score in all four of their Premier League home matches this season. Only twice in top-flight history has a team failed to score in their opening five home matches of a season (West Brom in 1921/22 and Everton in 1998/99 - both five games). Tottenham have lost just two of their last 15 Premier League away games, winning 10 of those matches (D3). Tottenham are unbeaten in each of their last eight games in all competitions against Huddersfield (W5 D3). Huddersfield have failed to win any of their first seven league games in a single campaign for the first time since 1997/98. Tottenham have scored in 32 of their last 33 Premier League games, failing to net only at West Brom back in May (0-1). Tottenham's Harry Kane is now the top scorer at the John Smith's Stadium in the Premier League with four goals in two appearances. Harry Kane became Tottenham's fifth highest scorer of all time, bagging 145 goals in 221 appearances for the Lilywhites. The managers David Wagner: The guys gave everything, they had a real go, they fought, they stuck together and played well. 3:48 David Wagner could not fault his players for their performance despite losing 2-0 at home to Tottenham. Wagner feels that if they continue to play how they did against Spurs, then the results will follow.

Consistently we're performing very well in games and in training and I'm completely fine with our performances. It's all about performing, working hard and then you will get your rewards, sooner or later. I'm unsure if the first or second half was better from our side, it isn't normal that a team who plays Tottenham who are not in the top six plays like we did today. Mauricio Pochettino: The game was so difficult, they were so aggressive from the beginning, it's a team that is fighting for wins and their fans were unbelievable in how they pushed the team. 1:48 Mauricio Pochettino praised his players’ performance and was particularly pleased to have kept a clean sheet as Tottenham beat Huddersfield 2-0.

The pundit - Matt Le Tissier \"Kane's all-round game was pretty good, and proved the match-winner again. The header was terrific, Trippier's cross was asking to be headed in, and Kane looked confident taking the penalty too, as he did with England. Spurs didn't create huge amounts, but at 2-0 it was comfortable for them. 4:02 Matt Le Tissier agreed that it could be 'Mission Impossible' for David Wagner and Huddersfield after watching their 2-0 home defeat to Tottenham. Matt Le Tissier agreed that it could be 'Mission Impossible' for David Wagner and Huddersfield after watching their 2-0 home defeat to Tottenham. \"It's looking like [mission impossible] for Huddersfield. It has been a bit of a struggle, they looked poor when I watched their first game, and I think it is going to be a long season for them.\" What VAR would have changed The one contentious incident in the game occurred right at the very start when Chris Lowe was upended by Lucas Moura after just four minutes. Craig Pawson didn't give anything, although replays showed that it was a definite foul. After one or two replays, it was still unclear whether the challenge was inside or outside the area, as Lowe's foot may or may not have been on the line on the edge of the penalty box. Not only would VAR have corrected Pawson's decision, it would have also made a definitive judgement on whether Huddersfield should have had a free-kick or a penalty. Either way, Huddersfield will feel aggrieved at not getting anything. What's next? Huddersfield are next in action on Saturday when they travel to Turf Moor to take on Burnley.

highlights Man City 2-0 Brighton - highlights Raheem Sterling scored one and made another as Manchester City eased past Brighton 2-0 at the Etihad in the Premier League on Saturday. The win puts champions City back at the top of the Premier League on goal difference ahead of Liverpool, who drew 1-1 at Chelsea in the later Saturday kick off. Sterling tapped home his fourth of the season at the far post (29) from Leroy Sane's cross, and Sergio Aguero added a second (65) from Sterling's unselfish assist just as Pep Guardiola was due to sub the Argentine off. The result also means City are still unbeaten in the Premier League this season, while Brighton are now without a win in six in all competitions and sit 14th. Sergio Aguero celebrates putting Manchester City 2-0 up Player ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (7), Laporte (7), Otamendi (7), Zinchenko (7), Fernandinho (7), B Silva (7), Sterling (9), D Silva (7), Sane (7), Aguero (8) Subs: Gabriel Jesus (5), Mahrez (6), Foden (NA) Brighton: Ryan (7), Montoya (5), Duffy (6), Dunk (7), Bong (5), Bissouma (5), Kayal (5), March (5), Propper (5), Knockaert (5), Locadia (5) Subs: Murray (5), Jahanbakhsh (NA), Izquierdo (NA) Man of the match: Raheem Sterling As expected, City dominated the ball in the first half, and their first clear chance brought the opener. After City won the ball on halfway, Aguero released Sane on the left, and his fine ball across the face of goal was tapped home at the far post by Sterling. Mat Ryan was then tested twice in quick succession, first from Sterling's shot on the right of the box from an angle, and then again from Fernandinho's fierce long-range strike. City should have extended their lead just after the break as Aguero saw a shot blocked brilliantly by Duffy, before David Silva's strike on the rebound from 15 yards was tipped away by Ryan again. Team news City made two changes from the side that beat Cardiff 5-0 last weekend, with Zinchenko and David Silva in for Delph and Gundogan. Brighton also made two changes; Murray and the injured Stephens came out, replaced by Kayal and Locadia. Sergio Aguero of Manchester City celebrates scoring his side's second goal With Gabriel Jesus on the touchline waiting to replace him, Aguero started and finished a fine move for City's second. Picking the ball up deep, he skipped past three challenges, fed the unselfish Sterling, and received the ball back 12 yards out to slot home. That was his last action, as Guardiola stuck to his original plan. Brighton offered very little in the final third, but did have a strong late appeal for a penalty waved away after Fernandinho looked to have handled from a corner. The pundit Charlie Nicholas: \"Very routine. The first goal calmed City down. They were in control but took too many touches - it was too slow at times. The service was slow to Aguero, and Guardiola must be getting frustrated with why the team is taking too many touches, when they could release it quicker. \"Boredom can creep in [for City fans], people can take so much talent for granted and get used to it. But also a lot of teams just come and defend too, this was predictable, and perhaps [City fans] don't like the predictability of what happens here. When you've got players on song here, it's worth paying to see them. Today it was just a little bit slow, but about getting the three points.\" The managers Pep Guardiola: \"It is important to be solid in our games. We have the same points as last season, but the contenders are better, in terms of results. That is normal. When we achieve up one level, everybody does everything to catch up. That is normal. 2:41 Guardiola says he was proud of Manchester City's 'patient' performance Guardiola says he was proud of Manchester City's 'patient' performance \"Arsenal is coming back, Tottenham with wins in a row, Chelsea, Liverpool, so it is important to be focused on what we have to do.\" Chris Hughton: \"What we have to be is realistic, and certainly our supporters are. We've played seven games, four against the top six, two other games away from home, with one at Watford, who have started so well. When we are evaluating where we are at the moment, we have to take that into context.\" 3:24 Brighton boss Chris Hughton says his side have to be realistic and take into context their opponents so far Brighton boss Chris Hughton says his side have to be realistic and take into context their opponents so far Opta stats Since winning back to back Premier League away games against West Ham and Swansea last November, Brighton have collected just five points in 17 away Premier League games (P17 W0 D5 L12). Since losing to Leicester City in December 2016, Manchester City haven't lost any of their last 35 Premier League games against teams starting the day in the bottom half (P35 W31 D4 L0). Raheem Sterling has been involved in 35 Premier League goals for Man City since the start of last season (22 goals, 13 assists), a figure bettered only by Mo Salah (46) and Harry Kane (38). What would VAR have changed? Judging by the award of a penalty for France in the World Cup final against Croatia, Brighton would have almost certainly been given a spot kick late on for Fernandinho's handball. The Brazilian handled inside the box from Kayal's corner, with the ball travelling a fair distance before reaching him. Referee Lee Mason thought otherwise. Man of the match - Raheem Sterling Aside from his goal and assist, Sterling was a menace for Brighton's defence all over the pitch. He made four key passes, a joint team-high, completed 98.6 per cent of his passes, another team-high for an outfield starter, and got involved in more duels (15) than anyone. This was vintage Sterling, and gave City energy in what was at times a pedestrian encounter. What's next? City go to Hoffenheim in the Champions League on Tuesday at 5.55pm, before a huge Premier League clash with Liverpool on Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports at 4.30pm.

enough for Leicester to secure a 2-0 victory at winless Newcastle. Vardy broke the deadlock from the penalty spot on the half-hour mark to net his second goal in as many games after returning from suspension, giving his side the lead going into the interval. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was in the stands for the first time in 16 months - on the day Peter Kenyon was reported to be plotting a takeover bid for the club - but he could only look on as Maguire made sure of the away victory in the 73rd minute. The final whistle was greeted by a chorus of boos from all around St James' Park as Newcastle remain in the bottom three, having lost their first four home league games for the first time in their history. Leicester are up to seventh after their second successive league win. Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Clark (5), Lascelles (6), Yedlin (4), Diame (5), Ritchie (5), Atsu (6), Shelvey (6), Kenedy (5), Perez (5), Joselu (3). Subs: Muto (6), Murphy (6), Manquillo (N/A) Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Chilwell (7), Morgan (7), Mendy (6), Maguire (7), Amartey (6), Ndidi (7), Pereira (7), Maddison (8), Vardy (7), Iheanacho (7). Subs: Albrighton (6), Iborra (N/A). Man of the match: James Maddison The home side had the better of the opening exchanges, with Ayoze Perez denied by a fine block from Wilfred Ndidi, before the same man played in Joselu, who delayed far too long before Maguire slid in to make the interception. Mo Diame then headed wide from a good position, before Newcastle were masters of their own downfall once more, with DeAndre Yedlin handling in the box to concede a 30th-minute penalty. Vardy stepped up to fire an unstoppable penalty past the despairing dive of Martin Dubravka in the Newcastle goal, increasing the feeling of vitriol around St James' yet further. Team news As expected, Salomon Rondon missed out through injury, with Joselu leading the line for Newcastle. Ciaran Clark in for Federico Fernandez was the only other change for the home side. The only change for Leicester from their win over Huddersfield last weekend saw skipper Wes Morgan back in the side after serving a one-match suspension, with Jonny Evans dropping to the bench. After the break, Newcastle continued to offer very little as an attacking force, with Leicester firmly in command despite their narrow advantage in the scoreline. Maguire, who had earlier embarrassingly missed two attempts to volley for goal, then made sure of the three points for Leicester, heading home from an inch-perfect James Maddison corner. Newcastle had a few half chances to at least make a game of it late on, with Joselu missing the most threatening opportunity, but his wayward finish summed the home side up, as it appears fans in the north east are in for a long season of struggle. Notes for Southgate The England coach was in the stands, and will feel justified in his decision to journey to the north east. Harry Maguire got on the scoresheet and was resolute in defence, while James Maddison showed why he is tipped for the top by so many. Jonjo Shelvey will want to forget this game in a hurry, however. Opta stats Leicester have won three consecutive away games in all competitions against Newcastle for the first time since November 1965. Since the start of last season, no team has lost more home Premier League games than Newcastle (11, level with Huddersfield). Newcastle failed to land a single shot on target against Leicester in the second half. Leicester's James Maddison has been directly involved in five goals in his last six Premier League games (three goals, two assists). Leicester City's Harry Maguire has scored two goals in seven Premier League appearances this season, the same total he bagged in 38 games for the Foxes in 2017-18. 3:03 Rafa Benitez was not happy with his side after another defeat Rafa Benitez was not happy with his side after another defeat Man of the match - James Maddison The highly-rated youngster's touch was a class apart at St James'. Having created five chances for team-mates in the match - one more than Newcastle created as a team - Maddison will have given England coach Gareth Southgate, sat in the St James' Directors' Box, plenty to ponder. Maddison's cross for Maguire's second was absolutely sublime. The Pundit - Paul Merson \"Newcastle looked lost. No energy, no pace. They never looked like getting back in the game, and that's not Newcastle. I can't remember Schmeichel making one save. Their one shot on target was when Shelvey tried to lob him from 60 yards - he got back and he caught it. \"Worrying, worrying times for Newcastle. The crowd went mad when Ritchie went off, and for Shelvey, when he looks up, there's nobody making runs. That's a problem, and he's finding it hard now. I think they're in big, big trouble. \"I think Benitez is hanging on in there. I think he could be in trouble in a couple of weeks - I really do. I can't believe what I watched today.\" What's next?

Player ratings Home Team: Patricio (7), Doherty (8), Bennett (6), Coady (6), Boly (7), Jonny (7), Neves (7), Moutinho (7), Costa (6), Jota (7), Jimenez (6) Subs: Traore (6), Cavaleiro (7), Bonatini (N/A) Away Team: McCarthy (6), Cedric (6), Vestergaard (4), Hoedt (6), Bertand (5), Redmond (6), Hojbjerg (6), Lemina (6), Elyounoussi (6), Ings (6), Austin (5) Subs: Armstrong (5), Gabbiadini (6) Man of the match: Matt Doherty Wolves' victory lifts them up to eighth, a point outside the top six, while Southampton drop to 15th. Wolves settled quickest on a bright day in the Black Country and had a flurry of opportunities in the first 15 minutes as their front three began to find space between the Southampton defence and midfield. Doherty headed wide from a free-kick but the best chance fell to Jonny, whose right-footed effort from 15 yards was pushed away by Alex McCarthy, after the ball had fallen to him following good play from Helder Costa to free Doherty on the right. Southampton gradually worked their way into the match and ended the half the better side and could easily have been in front but for a good stop from Rui Patricio to deny Mohamed Elyounoussi when the winger was put in by Nathan Redmond clipped pass. Team news After making nine changes for the defeat on penalties to Leicester in midweek, Wolves revert to the same XI that have started each of their six previous league games. Southampton recalled Danny Ings, who was ineligible for the game at Liverpool last weekend, as Mark Hughes made three changes. Charlie Austin and Mohamed Elyounoussi also came in, with Shane Long (toe), Oriol Romeu and Matt Targett dropping out. After a scrappy opening to the second period, it was Southampton who seized the initiative and kept Wolves penned inside their own half. Danny Ings saw his shot blocked after a quick turn in the box and substitute Stuart Armstrong forced a save from Patricio from a similar position by the right corner of the six-yard box. Wolves held on though and it was two substitutes of their own who proved decisive. Traore attacked the box and fired in a cross, Hoedt cut it out but slipped in doing so, allowing Jimenez to play the ball into the path of Cavaleiro, who thumped the ball high into the net. Jonny scored Wolves' second late on to seal the win Jimenez was denied a goal when McCarthy dived at full-stretch to flick the header over the bar with a fantastic save but the Saints goalkeeper was beaten again by the end, Doherty brushing past Armstrong weak challenge and finding Jonny, who overcame a poor first touch to ram the ball home. Man of the match - Matt Doherty Wolves were a long way form their best despite the result at Molineux but in Doherty they have a player they know they can rely on, even when things aren't clicking for the rest of the team. The wing-back was always available down the right and was involved in almost every positive moment for Wolves going forward, including providing the assist for the second goal. Defensively he was solid too, helping to keep Nathan Redmond quiet. An all-round impressive, if understated, display. The managers 2:07 Nuno Espírito Santo felt it was a tough but deserved win for his Wolves side against Southampton in the Premier League Nuno Espírito Santo felt it was a tough but deserved win for his Wolves side against Southampton in the Premier League 4:12 Mark Hughes said that Southampton’s defeat was difficult to accept as he felt that they were in control for most of the game Mark Hughes said that Southampton’s defeat was difficult to accept as he felt that they were in control for most of the game Opta stats Ivan Cavaleiro scored less than two minutes after coming on Wolves are now unbeaten in five league matches (W3 D2 L0), their best run in the top-flight since November 1981 (also five unbeaten). Southampton have taken just 13 points from a possible 45 under Mark Hughes in the Premier League (P15 W3 D4 L8). Wolves' Ivan Cavaleiro scored on his Premier League debut just 94 seconds after coming on as a substitute. This was only Wolves' 10th Premier League victory by more than one goal, and their first since winning 3-1 against Wigan Athletic in November 2011. What's next? Wolves have a week to prepare for their next fixture, away at Crystal Palace at 3pm next Saturday while Southampton travel to Merseyside for a Carabao Cup third-round tie against Everton on Wednesday.

1-1 draw between Chelsea and Liverpool in the Premier League Daniel Sturridge scored a stunning late equaliser as Liverpool fought back to claim a 1-1 draw against Premier League title rivals Chelsea in an absorbing contest at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening. Eden Hazard fired in the opening goal after 25 minutes, just days after coming off the bench to secure a 2-1 Carabao Cup win for Chelsea at Anfield. Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino had shots blocked on the line and Xherdan Shaqiri sliced wide from 12 yards out as Liverpool's hopes of extending their perfect start to the Premier League season faded. Player ratings Chelsea: Kepa (6), Alonso (6), Azpilicueta (6), Luiz (7), Rudiger (7), Kante (6), Jorginho (6), Kovacic (7), Willian (6), Hazard (7), Giroud (5) Subs: Moses (5), Morata (5), Barkley (5) Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (6), Van Dijk (6), Gomez (6), Robertson (6), Wijnaldum (6), Henderson (6), Milner (6), Mane (5), Salah (5), Firmino (5) Subs: Keita (5), Shaqiri (5), Sturridge (7) Man of the match: David Luiz However, they managed to salvage a draw thanks to a stunning 89th-minute strike from former Chelsea striker Sturridge, who curled a 30-yard shot over Kepa Arrizabalaga. The result sees both sides remain unbeaten in the Premier League, but Manchester City now lead the way at the top of the table ahead of their clash with Liverpool next Sunday, live on Sky Sports. Daniel Sturridge celebrates his superb late goal Liverpool, who were aiming to win their first seven games of a top-flight campaign for only the second time, looked the more threatening side in the early stages as Salah twice failed to test Kepa with shots from outside the box. Sadio Mane then sliced wide before Chelsea created their first opening; David Luiz playing a fabulous long pass over the top for Willian, who was denied by Alisson. Chelsea took the lead in the 25th minute after some intricate build-up play in midfield resulted in Mateo Kovacic releasing Hazard, who finished into the far corner with a low strike. Salah went close to equalising when he took the ball around Kepa and then saw a shot cleared off the line by Antonio Rudiger. Mohamed Salah and Olivier Giroud compete for possession Liverpool enjoyed more of the possession in the second half but were frustrated as Kepa made a sharp save to keep out a low shot from Mane. Hazard spurned an excellent chance to make it 2-0 when he was played through on goal by a quickly-taken free-kick but failed to beat Alisson. Team news Chelsea named the same side as their last league match while Gomez and Milner replaced Matip and Shaqiri for Liverpool. Van Dijk was fit to start after suffering a rib injury last weekend. Shaqiri then skewed wide from the penalty spot and Roberto Firmino saw a header blocked on the line by David Luiz as Chelsea looked as though they would hold out. However, Sturridge snatched a draw in memorable style as he curled a left-footed shot over Kepa from 30 yards out. Opta stats Chelsea have won only two of their last nine home Premier League games against Liverpool (W2 D3 L4). Liverpool remain unbeaten in their opening seven matches of a Premier League season for the first time since 2008-09. Chelsea's Eden Hazard is the Premier League's top scorer this season with six goals - he has scored those six goals from just nine shots on target. Liverpool have only conceded two first half goals in their last 13 Premier League matches - both at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea (Oliver Giroud in May, Eden Hazard today). This was the 38th home Premier League game that Chelsea forward Eden Hazard has scored in - he has never ended on the losing side in any of those games (W34 D4 L0). Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has scored 17 Premier League goals as a sub - only Olivier Giroud (19) and Jermain Defoe (24) have scored more off the bench in the history of the competition. Daniel Sturridge is the seventh player to score 50 Premier League goals for Liverpool, after Robbie Fowler, Steven Gerrard, Michael Owen, Luis Suarez, Fernando Torres and Dirk Kuyt. Man of the match - David Luiz Hazard was bright throughout for Chelsea, but Luiz produced an assured display at the centre of defence. He played a couple of superb long-range passes, blocked a header from Firmino on the line and made two more interceptions than any other player on the pitch. He might still make fans nervous at times, but this was one of his better performances for Chelsea. The managers Maurizio Sarri: \"I think they are a step forward but I think also that we are closer than I thought one week ago. In the first two places, as you know, for me, is going to be very difficult because Manchester City and Liverpool are a step forward on us. So it is very difficult. But I think we can fight for the Champions League.\" Jurgen Klopp: \"Six, seven times we had big chances. We gave them one proper chance, they used it and we didn't use ours. That's how life is. As long as we play like we did tonight we will win football games.\" What's next?

Chelsea’s 100 per cent record in the Premier League was ended by West Ham United in a 0-0 draw on Super Sunday. After winning their first five games under Maurizio Sarri, Chelsea's quality in the final third was severely lacking as Eden Hazard was suffocated by the Hammers' midfield. West Ham created clear chances but missed the ruthlessness of Marko Arnautovic, who was absent with a knee injury. The standout opportunity fell to Andriy Yarmolenko late on but he headed wide from six yards out. Questions were being asked about West Ham under Manuel Pellegrini after four straight defeats, but four points in the last week and a first clean sheet has them moving in the right direction. Player Ratings West Ham: Fabianski (7), Balbuena (7), Zabaleta (7), Diop (6), Masuaku (7), Rice (7), Obiang (6), Noble (7), Yarmolenko (6), Anderson (7), Antonio (5). Subs: Snodgrass (7), Sanchez (6), Perez (6) Chelsea: Arrizabalaga (7), Rudiger (6), Alonso (6), Luiz (6), Azpilicueta (6), Jorginho (6), Kante (5), Kovacic (5), Willian (6), Hazard (5), Giroud (5). Subs: Morata (5), Barkley (6) Man of the match: Pablo Zabaleta Despite bossing the ball in the early stages, Chelsea - who had made a midweek trip to Greece in the Europa League - created little as West Ham carried the bigger threat on the counter attack. Arnautovic's replacement, Michail Antonio, squandered two chances in quick succession, blazing over from a tight angle on 31 minutes before firing straight at Kepa Arrizabalaga two minutes later. Team news Marko Arnautovic failed a fitness test for West Ham, therefore Michail Antonio started up front on his own. Meanwhile, Olivier Giroud was preferred to Alvaro Morata while Willian replaced the injured Pedro. David Luiz headed a great opportunity over the bar just after the break as Chelsea continued to look pretty with the ball but lacked ideas in the final third, with the axis of Hazard, Olivier Giroud and Willian struggling to find much rhythm. Alvaro Morata replaced Giroud on 64 minutes and should have scored within two minutes of coming on. Luiz took advantage of some sloppy defending from Yarmolenko at the back post but Morata's close range finish smacked Lukasz Fabianski's face and flew to safety. Hazard should have been greedier when bursting into the box with 15 minutes left, deciding to look for Morata rather than shoot before Yarmolenko wasted a glorious opening. Robert Snodgrass curled over a wonderful cross that put the chance on a plate for the Ukrainian, but he somehow headed wide from six yards out. Andriy Yarmolenko misses a gilt-edged chance Ross Barkley tested Fabianski from range in stoppage time and Willian fired wide from a tight angle but a Chelsea winner never really looked likely as they failed to score in the Premier League for the first time under Sarri. Opta stats West Ham have avoided defeat in three consecutive Premier League games against Chelsea (W1 D2) for the first time since a run of five between March 1998 and March 2000. Chelsea failed to score in the Premier League for the first time under Maurizio Sarri and for just the second time in their last 15 league games (also a 3-0 defeat at Newcastle in May). This was only Chelsea's second goalless draw in their last 48 away Premier League games (also 0-0 against Everton in December 2017). Chelsea midfielder Jorginho attempted 180 passes in this match - since 2003/04, this is the most by a player in a single Premier League match. Jorginho has completed 628 passes in total for Chelsea in the Premier League this season, more than any other player. This was Chelsea's 600th top-flight London derby, becoming the third London side to reach this number after Arsenal (674) and Spurs (609). Declan Rice challenges Eden Hazard Man of the match: Pablo Zabaleta Any one of the West Ham defensive unit would have been good value for the award but Zabaleta edges it courtesy of some important last-ditch tackles in the box. The former Manchester City man may be lacking pace but his positional play is still of high standard, with Hazard getting no joy from Zabaleta when moving out to the left flank. Manager reaction: Manuel Pellegrini \"We created two key chances with Michail Antonio and Andriy Yarmolenko. They had one clear chance that Alvaro Morata's missed after the rebound. I think we played a good tactical game as we allowed them to have the ball but near our box we defended well and we got our first clean sheet.\" 3:35 Manuel Pellegrini: Good tactical game Manuel Pellegrini: Good tactical game Manager reaction: Maurizio Sarri \"We could have done better, especially in the last 20 minutes of the first half. We played very well in the last 20 minutes. We knew West Ham are a good team and today would be very difficult. We are not happy with the result.\" 2:09 Maurizio Sarri ‘not happy with result’ Maurizio Sarri ‘not happy with result’ What's next?

Everton Alexandre Lacazette's fine second-half strike helped Arsenal to a 2-0 win over Everton in the Premier League at The Emirates on Super Sunday. The impressive Petr Cech kept Arsenal level in the first half with several fine stops, before a curling stunner from Lacazette (56) and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's close-range finish (59) gave the hosts a cushion, despite the latter looking offside. The result means Arsenal have won their last five on the bounce having lost their opening two, and sit in sixth place with Everton back in 12th. Sokratis and Theo Walcott battle for the ball Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (9), Bellerin (6), Mustafi (6), Sokratis (6), Monreal (6), Xhaka (6), Torreira (7), Ramsey (7), Aubameyang (7), Ozil (7), Lacazette (8) Subs: Holding (6), Iwobi (5), Welbeck (NA) Everton: Pickford (6), Kenny (6), Keane (6), Zouma (6), Digne (6), Gueye (6), Davies (6), Sigurdsson (6), Walcott (7), Calvert-Lewin (6), Richarlison (7) Subs: Bernard (5), Tosun (6) Man of the match: Petr Cech Though Arsenal had most of the ball, the majority of chances fell Everton's way in the first half; Richarlison was denied at his feet by Cech in the second minute, before he again forced the goalkeeper into a save with a 20-yard snap shot. Nacho Monreal saw his effort from close range superbly saved by Jordan Pickford after Aubameyang had unselfishly fed him, while Theo Walcott's pace caused problems for his old club, racing in-behind to see a shot blocked well by Cech again. Arsenal struggled to deal with Richarlison again before the break, Cech coming to the rescue once more to tip over his fierce shot from the left angle of the box, but the hosts struck twice in quick succession after half-time. Team news Torreira started his first Premier League game for Arsenal as Unai Emery made seven changes from the side that beat Vorskla 4-2 in the Europa League. Cech returned in goal, while Bellerin, Mustafi, Xhaka, Ramsey, Ozil and Lacazette all returned. Walcott started against his old side, while Richarlison came back from suspension and Keane partnered Zouma in defence. Richarlison reacts to a missed opportunity Everton started the second half well, but were flattened by two goals in four minutes. Out of nothing, Aaron Ramsey slid in Lacazette to curl home off the post from the edge of the box for his second goal of the season. Arsenal were then three-on-one in the final third, with Mesut Ozil's intended pass for Ramsey finding Aubameyang, who finished past a helpless Pickford despite being in an offside position. Everton hit the bar late on through Lucas Digne from a tight angle, but Cech was unbeatable in the Arsenal goal as Everton were beaten for a second straight Super Sunday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates his goal in the second half The managers Unai Emery: \"I'm very happy with the goalkeeper, and how they are all working for us, Emiliano [Martinez], [Bernd] Leno and Cech. I think Cech has a big experience, big quality, he started the pre-season very well, and we think he is in a performance we want. 3:17 Unai Emery was not 100 per cent happy with his side's performance Unai Emery was not 100 per cent happy with his side's performance \"Today he showed us he is very well and is continuing with this work and this spirit every day. The other goalkeepers are the same, very well, and need to continue working for when the team needs.\" Marco Silva: \"It was offside. At this level, with these mistakes from the referee, it put our team in that condition as well. The second goal is clearly offside. It is really frustrating, and I tell you why. In that moment we had just one player in our box, it is too clear for the assistants.\" 3:07 Marco Silva felt Everton should have got something from the game Marco Silva felt Everton should have got something from the game Opta stats Arsenal v Everton is the highest scoring fixture in Premier League history (153). Arsenal have won 97 top-flight games against Everton - at least 11 more than any side has managed against another in its history. Arsenal managed to keep their first clean sheet in their seventh game under new boss Unai Emery in all competitions. Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette have both scored in three of the last five Premier League games they've started together. What would VAR have changed? Arsenal's appeal for a penalty just after half-time fell on deaf ears as the ball hit Jonjoe Kenny on the arm, but VAR would have most likely played on, with the Everton man just a yard away from Aubameyang's initial header. However, Aubameyang's goal would have certainly been ruled out, with the Gabon striker clearly offside before netting. Man of the match - Petr Cech He's come in for criticism in recent months, but this was vintage Cech. None of Cech's six saves were run-of-the-mill, and if it weren't for his stops from Richarlison and Walcott in the first half, this would have been a different story. Aerially he was dominant, and even on the ball he showed composure, going long when necessary and getting a huge cheer for a delightful dink into Hector Bellerin under pressure. What's next? Arsenal now face Brentford in the Carabao Cup third round on Wednesday night, before welcoming Watford to The Emirates on Saturday at 3pm in the Premier League. Everton face Fulham on Saturday at Goodison Park."},{"date": "22/09/2019", "arena": "Craven Cottage", "attendance": 23418, "home_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Marcus Bettinelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timothy Fosu-Mensah", "yellows": ["32"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": ["30"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["45"]}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefan Johansen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["64"]}, {"name": "Kevin McDonald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["45"]}, {"name": "Jean Seri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Vietto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["45"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Floyd Ayité", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["45"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxime Le Marchand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Rico", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André-Frank Zambo Anguissa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["64"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aboubakar Kamara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Kabasele", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": ["58"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Abdoulaye Doucouré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Will Hughes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["70"]}, {"name": "Roberto Pereyra", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["90"]}, {"name": "Andre Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["80"]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Isaac Success", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["80"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Masina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ken Sema", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["90"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Chalobah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kiko Femenía", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["70"], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:59 Fulham 1-1 Watford Fulham 1-1 Watford Aleksandar Mitrovic’s late strike rescued a point for Fulham as they drew 1-1 with Watford at Craven Cottage. Andre Gray gave Watford the lead after just one minute and 27 seconds - the club's second-fastest goal in Premier League history - with his third league goal of the season. However, Mitrovic equalised for the home team with just 12 minutes to go, the forward's 17th goal since joining the club - initially on loan from Newcastle United - in January, more than any other player in England's top four leagues. Player ratings Fulham: Bettinelli (6), Sessegnon (6), Chambers (5), Fosu-Mensah (5), Mawson (4), McDonald (5), Johansen (5), Schurrle (7), Seri (6), Mitrovic (8), Vietto (6) Subs: Odoi (6), Anguissa (6), Ayite (6) Watford: Foster (7), Janmaat (6), Cathcart (6), Holebas (6), Kabasele (7), Doucoure (7), Capoue (7), Hughes (7), Pereyra (6), Deeney (7), Gray (7) Subs: Femenia (6), Sema (6), Success (6) Man of the match: Aleksandar Mitrovic As a result, Watford remain in the top four as their impressive start to the new campaign continues, while Fulham stay 15th in the table Fans were still streaming into a rain-soaked Craven Cottage when the Hornets opened the scoring with the first attack of the game, although it is a goal the Fulham defence will not want to see again. Firstly, captain Kevin McDonald failed to deal with a simple throw-in, before Gray bullied Jean Michael Seri out of the way, allowing Will Hughes to slip the striker through on goal. Andre Gray (left) celebrates his early goal with his team-mates And Gray made no mistake with a composed finish for his fourth goal in his last three matches against Fulham. The home side were lucky to go in at the break only one goal down after Christian Kabasele and Gray spurned presentable openings, while it could have been even worse had referee Martin Atkinson sent off Timothy Fosu-Mensah for a studs-up tackle on Troy Deeney just past the half-hour mark. So it was no real surprise when Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic replaced Alfie Mawson and McDonald with Denis Odoi and Floyd Ayite at half-time, especially given the former's shaky first-half display. The double change did manage to slow down Watford's attacking momentum after the interval, but the hosts initially still struggled to create many clear-cut chances. One of those fell to the man Fulham would have wanted, in-form forward Mitrovic, only for the Serb to head Andre Schurrle's inviting right-wing cross over the bar five minutes into the second period. Team news Fulham made two changes from their defeat at Man City, with Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Callum Chambers coming in for Denis Odoi and Cyrus Christie at the back, with that duo dropping to the bench. Watford, meanwhile, became the first Premier League team in a decade to name an unchanged side for the first six games of a season. But with the clock ticking away, Fulham did get back on level terms and it was that man Mitrovic who was on hand to instinctively flick home Luciano Vietto's ball in from the left edge of the area. And Mitrovic came within inches of winning the match in the last minute, only for Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster to tip his close-range header onto the bar as Jokanovic was denied a win against his former club. What would VAR have changed? The VAR would surely have increased Fosu-Mensah’s yellow to a red after his dangerous first-half tackle on Deeney, but it is debatable if Watford's appeals for a penalty would have been given after Hughes went over under Mawson's challenge just past the half-hour mark. Opta stats This was Fulham's 500th match in the Premier League; the 15th team to reach the milestone in the competition Fulham have lost just one of their last 19 home league games, including play-offs (W14 D4) Watford are without a win on their last nine Premier League visits to London, with their draw against Fulham coming after eight consecutive defeats Gray's strike for Watford, timed at one minute, 27 seconds was the quickest goal in the Premier League since March 10 2018 (Kenedy for Newcastle v Southampton, 1:03) Notes for Southgate Young full-back Ryan Sessegnon had a quiet game for the hosts, failing to provide an attacking outlet with few raids down the left. However, Will Hughes will have given the England boss another gentle reminder about his talents in the middle of the park with an assured and composed display, while Ben Foster would surely be part of the set-up had he not retired. Man of the Match - Aleksandar Mitrovic The powerful forward was the main reason why his side managed to rescue a point in this game after a buccaneering second-half display at the Cottage. The Serbia international had already proved to be a handful for the Watford back line before half-time, but they were unable to deal with him after the interval. The frontman almost headed the hosts level right at the start of the second period and having then equalised, he twice came close to winning the match, only to be denied by two fine Foster saves late on.

Aaron Lennon and a late double by substitute Ashley Barnes earned Burnley a comprehensive 4-0 win over Bournemouth at Turf Moor to seal their first Premier League victory of the season. Vydra, making his first start for the club, capped it with the opening goal of the game with a clinical finish after 39 minutes before Lennon doubled Burnley's advantage just 125 seconds later. Bournemouth dominated for large periods in the second half but they were impotent in attack and Burnley picked them off with two goals from Barnes on the counter-attack in the final 10 minutes. The result sees Sean Dyche's side move off the foot of the table while Bournemouth's good run of form has come to an emphatic end. Player ratings Burnley: Hart (7). Lowton (7), Tarkowski (7), Mee (7), Taylor (7), Lennon (9), Westwood (7), Cork (7), Gudmundsson (8), Vokes (6), Vydra (7) Subs: Barnes (8), Wood (6) Bournemouth: Begovic (4), Smith (4), S. Cook (4), Ake (5), Rico (4), Fraser (5), Lerma (4), Surman (4), Brooks (6), King (5), Wilson (4) Subs: Francis (4), Stanislas (4), Defoe (4) Man of the match: Aaron Lennon Bournemouth went closest to opening the scoring when Nathan Ake's shot deflected off Ben Mee and looped over Joe Hart onto the crossbar just past the quarter-hour mark. They had another golden chance to break the deadlock soon afterwards, when Callum Wilson was inches away from connecting to a Josh King cross with the goal gaping in front of him. After surviving a couple of hairy moments at the back, it was Burnley who took the lead late in the half. Vydra, handed a full debut after his summer move from Derby County, was on hand to finish clinically from close range after Ashley Westwood's half-volley had been diverted into his path by Ake's block. Moments later it was 2-0. Johann Gudmundsson latched onto a dinked ball down the line by Matthew Lowton, cut inside onto his favoured left foot and whipped a devilish cross to the far post, with Lennon sliding in to convert the chance into the corner. Team news Sean Dyche made three changes to the team beaten 1-0 by Wolves last weekend. Matthew Lowton, Ashley Westwood and Matej Vydra came in with Phil Bardsley, Jeff Hendrick and Ashley Barnes dropping down to the bench.In contrast, Eddie Howe made only one alteration from last Saturday's 4-2 win over Leicester as Andrew Surman replaced Dan Gosling in midfield. The visitors had a go in the second period and things might have been different for them had David Brooks scored his opportunity on the hour mark after being played through by Josh King, rather than seeing it brilliantly stopped by the onrushing Hart. Eddie Howe threw on Junior Stanislas and Jermain Defoe in search of a route back into the game but instead it was one of Dyche's substitutes who got the on the scoresheet next, as Barnes tapped in from close range after Gudmundsson's volley had clanged off the foot of the post and into his path. Notes for Southgate James Tarkowski will have done his chances of a call-up for next month's internationals no harm with a clean sheet and a solid display. Joe Hart strengthened his case for a recall with a couple of crucial stops following a strong performance against Wolves last weekend. Lewis Cook, capped by Southgate last season, failed to get on after being named as a substitute. With two minutes remaining, Burnley flooded forward on the counter-attack after clearing a Bournemouth corner, with Lennon scampering onto a loose ball before teeing up Barnes to score a first-time effort beyond Asmir Begovic for the fourth and final goal of the game. Opta stats Burnley scored four goals against Bournemouth, as many as in their previous eight Premier League games combined. Bournemouth have kept just one clean sheet in their last 15 Premier League away games, shipping 30 goals in total in those fixtures. Matej Vydra is the fifth player to score on his first Premier League start for Burnley, after Daniel Fox, Scott Arfield, Robbie Brady and Chris Wood. Aaron Lennon scored his first Premier League goal in 55 appearances, since netting for Everton against West Ham on March 5 2016. Johann Berg Gudmundsson has registered 12 Premier League assists for Burnley, seven more than any other player for the club. Ashley Barnes scored two goals in a Premier League game for the first time ever in his 105th appearance in the competition. 12 - Johann Berg Gudmundsson has registered 12 Premier League assists for Burnley, seven more than any other player for the club.

The 31-year-old grabbed the all-important second goal of the game when he slid in at the far post to convert Johann Gudmundsson's cross and he was a constant threat on the counter-attack in the second half. Aaron Lennon of Burnley celebrates after scoring his side's second goal Lennon played a huge role in Burnley's third when he skipped past a challenge on the left before clipping a cross to Gudmundsson, whose shot hit the post and rebounded to Barnes to score. He then got a well-deserved assist for the fourth, showing his desire to race onto a loose ball and tee up Barnes for his second to add some gloss to the scoreline. The managers Sean Dyche: You've got to earn the right to win a game and we did that today. It's cleared the air for us a bit, we've had a lot going on at the start of this season, you try and speak about it and people listen of sorts, but there have been big changes for our players. I said before maybe we were suffering from a success hangover which happens in life. We hit a pinnacle - finishing 7th in the league was a massive statement - and then the noise changes about what you're about. 2:13 Dyche: It's just the start Dyche: It's just the start We had a chat about that this week so I'm pleased with the players. I did remind them before the game, that I'm immensely proud of what this group have done over a number of years for the football club and I reminded them before the game that will never go. Now it's about moving forward and building on the progress we've made. Eddie Howe: It was a strange game, I don't think it was a 4-0 defeat in performance, but that's the reality of the result. We were well in the game early on, had chances to score and couldn't take them, we weren't effective in front of goal today and we've come away having conceded four goals. There are plenty of lessons for us to learn after today's game. What's next? Both sides are in Carabao Cup action next, with Burnley travelling to League One Burton on Tuesday and Bournemouth hosting Championship side Blackburn Rovers on the same night. In terms of the Premier League, Burnley face Cardiff City in Wales at 4pm on Super Sunday, while Bournemouth take on Crystal Palace on Monday Night Football.

Fresh from signing a one-year contract extension, Aguero tucked in City's opener (32) after he was picked out by Bernardo Silva, who scored with a looping header three minutes later. Ilkay Gundogan curled in an unstoppable effort (44) and was then lucky to escape injury before the break when Joe Ralls caught the German just below the knee with a challenge that saw the Cardiff midfielder receive a booking. In the second half, Riyad Mahrez tapped in his first City goal (67) before scoring his second late on (89) as Pep Guardiola's side responded to their midweek Champions League defeat to Lyon in perfect fashion. Sergio Aguero marked his 300th Manchester City appearance in style Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (6), Peltier (5), Manga (5), Morrison (5), Cunningham (5), Camarasa (6), Arter (5), Ralls (5), Hoilett (5), Ward (6), Reid (6) Subs: Richards (6), Zohore (6), Murphy (6) Man Cty: Ederson (6), Walker (6), Laporte (6), Otamendi (6), Delph (6), Fernandinho (7), Gundogan (9), Sterling (7), B.Silva (8), Sane (7), Aguero (8) Subs: Mahrez (8), Foden (6), Stones (6) Man of the match: Ilkay Gundogan Cardiff frustrated City in the opening half-hour, but the visitors broke the deadlock after 34 minutes with Aguero pouncing on Silva's cut across the box to celebrate his landmark appearance in style. Three minutes after the assist, Silva got his name on the scoresheet, with the Portuguese latching onto Leroy Sane's cross and looping his backwards header - perhaps fortuitously - into the far corner. Gundogan then made it three just before the break, playing a short one-two with Raheem Sterling on the edge of the area before curling an unstoppable effort into the postage stamp. Bernardo Silva doubled Man City's lead three minutes after assisting Sergio Aguero Team news Two Cardiff changes saw Lee Peltier and Greg Cunningham coming in for Sol Bamba and Joe Bennett. Man City made three changes, with Sergio Aguero, Leroy Sane and Nicolas Otamendi replacing Gabriel Jesus, David Silva and John Stones. A contentious moment followed before half-time, with Ralls late and catching Gundogan. Just a yellow card was shown, and it was an incident which harked back to the FA Cup meeting in January when Guardiola was left furious after Joe Bennett was cautioned for a high tackle on Sane. City remained on top in the second half despite applying the brakes, with Sane going close when his header hit the outside of the post. A fourth goal came midway through the half, with Mahrez scoring his first in a City shirt when tapping into the empty net from Gundogan's low ball across the box. Riyad Mahrez tapped in for his first Manchester City goal Mahrez then scored his second at the death, gratefully receiving Bruno Ecuele Manga's poor, misplaced pass before firing a low effort into the far corner. Notes for Southgate England duo Kyle Walker and Fabian Delph were rarely tested defensively, while John Stones was a second-half substitute on a quiet afternoon for City's back four. Raheem Sterling was lively and carved out a few opportunities for City, while Phil Foden came off the bench and came agonisingly close to his first Premier League goal - but Neil Etheridge got down to make the save. Opta stats Cardiff lost a home league game by a five-goal margin for the first time since April 1994 (2-7 v Cambridge in the third tier). Since Pep Guardiola took over ahead of the 2016/17 season, Manchester City have scored 5+ goals in 10 Premier League fixtures, four times more than any other side. Manchester City striker Aguero has now scored 13 and assisted two more in his last 13 Premier League games against newly-promoted sides. Bernardo Silva scored and assisted in the same game for the first time ever for Manchester City in his 61 appearances for the club in all competitions. Man of the match - Ilkay Gundogan The midfielder ran the show at the Cardiff City Stadium. He played a pivotal part in City's opener before curling in a beauty of his own for their third before the break. It was a relief to see the German come away from Ralls' tackle unscathed, and Gundogan then continued to punish the hosts in the second half, laying it on a plate for Mahrez before being replaced by Phil Foden with 20 minutes left. Ilkay Gundogan curled in a sensational effort just before half-time Pundit's view 4:06 Phil Thompson said this was Manchester City back to their very best Phil Thompson said this was Manchester City back to their very best The managers Cardiff boss Neil Warnock: \"It was always going to be tough. We started the game well but it just shows you when you make a mistake, it's our corner kick that they scored from. \"To go two down so early after that first goal, you could see one or two heads go down.

We cannot forget the Champions League, the opponents are good too, we knew that. It's part of the process. \"The season is long, there are a lot of games to play.

"report": "2:51 Crystal Palace 0-0 Newcastle Crystal Palace 0-0 Newcastle Crystal Palace could not find a way through an unambitious Newcastle side as the pair played out a drab 0-0 draw at Selhurst Park. Palace's Mamadou Sakho had the best chance of the game in the final 10 minutes when he headed wide of an unguarded goal from Andros Townsend's cross. The visitors played much of the game in their own half, but did have opportunities, notably when James Tomkins was caught in possession by Ayoze Perez early on but his weak shot was held by Wayne Hennessey. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (7), Wan-Bissaka (8), Tomkins (6), Sakho (7), van Aanholt (6), McArthur (6), Kouyate (6), Milivojevic (5), Townsend (7), Ayew (5), Zaha (6) Subs: Guaita, Kelly, Ward, Schlupp, Meyer (6), Puncheon, Sorloth (6) Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Yedlin (7), Lascelles (6), Fernandez (8), Dummett (6), Ritchie (5), Diame (6), Shelvey (6), Kenedy (6), Rondon (5), Perez (5) Subs: Clark, Manquillo, Atsu (6), Ki, Muto, Joselu (7) Man of the match: Aaron Wan-Bissaka Newcastle are still seeking their first win with six games gone, while Palace are yet to pick up their first home victory, having lost two and drawn one of their three games at Selhurst Park. Rafa Benitez had suggested this would be a game where his side would look to attack, but Palace's 10 shots to Newcastle's three before half-time told its own story, for once of the onlooking Mike Ashley, who was the subject of ridicule from the club's fans for much of the game. Mike Ashley was in the directors' box as Newcastle drew at Crystal Palace Wilfried Zaha shook off a pre-match scare when he disappeared from the warm-up clutching his back to take on an unusually deep role, but still orchestrated much of Palace's play as they pressed forward in numbers. Despite that, it was Newcastle who had the better of the early chances. Perez robbed Tomkins and strode through, only to fail to register enough power on his shot to test Hennessey, before Jamal Lascelles put a near-post header wide when unmarked at a corner. Team news Crystal Palace were unbeaten from the side that beat Huddersfield last week, even with Wilfried Zaha suffering an injury-scare in the warm-up. For Newcastle, Joselu was benched for Salomon Rondon, and Jacob Murphy replaced by Kenedy. Palace came closest when Luka Milivojevic's free-kick from the left beat everyone and rebounded off the post, and it was more a case of near-misses for the hosts before half-time. They were let off shortly after the break too, when Joselu's drive from Matt Ritchie's header was simple enough for Hennessey. But in the final 15 minutes, they really began to turn the screw in a half where they ended with 66 per cent of possession, and Sakho had the goal gaping when Andros Townsend crossed from the left, but he somehow headed wide of the near post from barely four yards. Mamadou Sakho heads wide to miss the game's best chance Late on, Townsend saw a shot smothered behind by Martin Dubravka, but Palace were left frustrated on an afternoon where the weather was just as poor as the quality on show from either side. Opta stats Crystal Palace have won just one of their last 11 Premier League games against Newcastle United (W1 D5 L5) - a 5-1 victory at Selhurst Park in November 2015. Newcastle have failed to win on 17 of their last 20 Premier League games in London (W3 D3 L14). Crystal Palace have failed to score in three consecutive Premier League home matches for the first time since September 2017. Newcastle have scored just four Premier League goals this season, one fewer than former striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has netted for Fulham (5). Following a run of four wins in a row, Newcastle have won just one of their last 11 Premier League matches, drawing two and losing eight. Crystal Palace goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey has kept a clean sheet in four of his last seven Premier League appearances, including in each of the last two. Notes for Southgate Jonjo Shelvey had a quiet game for Newcastle, although Jamal Lascelles was fairly strong defensively but missed two good chances from corners. Man of the match - Aaron Wan-Bissaka Wan-Bissaka gave Paul Dummett a tough afternoon down the Palace right, producing three crosses and making more passes in the opposition half than anyone else on the field. But in addition, he made three interceptions and five tackles, showing his importance at both ends of the field, and was a livewire around the pitch at Selhurst Park. What's next? Crystal Palace travel to West Brom, one of Roy Hodgson's former clubs, in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday at 8pm.

League defeats to record a 3-1 victory over struggling Huddersfield at the King Power Stadium. The visitors took an early lead through defender Mathias Jorgensen (5) but they could not hold onto that advantage, Kelechi Iheanacho finishing off a brilliant Leicester counter-attack (19) to level the scores. After the break the hosts took full control of proceedings, going ahead thanks to James Maddison's free-kick (66) before Jamie Vardy made sure of all three points (75). The victory moves Claude Puel's side up to eighth, while David Wagner's men drop to the foot of the table following their fourth defeat of the season.

Man of the match: James Maddison Huddersfield started the brighter of the two sides and they were rewarded with a fifth-minute lead, Jorgensen finishing from close range after latching onto Laurent Depoitre's flick-on from Philip Billing's long throw. Leicester were back on level terms 14 minutes later thanks to a brilliant counter-attacking goal. Erik Durm gifted possession to the hosts in midfield and, quick as a flash, Vardy was away. He laid the ball off to Iheanacho in the penalty area and the Nigeria international found the bottom corner with a first-time finish. The hosts were growing into the game with the impressive Maddison running the show and his clever free-kick created an opening for Vardy, but the striker scuffed his volley wide of the far post. Team news Puel made three changes to the Leicester side that lost 4-2 to Bournemouth last weekend. Evans returned in place of the suspended Morgan, while Amartey and Iheanacho came in for Pereira and Gray. Huddersfield made two changes from the side that lost 1-0 to Crystal Palace last weekend. Durm and Depoitre came into Wagner’s starting line-up in place of Hadergjonaj and Mounie. Puel changed things up at the break, bringing on Demarai Gray for Rachid Ghezzal, although it was Maddison who turned the match in Leicester's favour with a powerful free-kick from a central position 25 yards out. Jonas Lossl did manage to get his right hand to the ball but he could not keep it out as it curled into the net. Vardy made sure of his side's victory in the 75th minute with an excellent lofted finish after Iheanacho had slid a beautifully-weighted pass through for the former England striker. 3 - Jamie Vardy has found the net in his last three league appearances against Huddersfield. Habit. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) September 22, 2018 Opta stats Leicester have won nine of their last 10 league games against Huddersfield (D1), netting 28 goals in the process. They have also won each of their last eight home league meetings versus Huddersfield - the Foxes' longest current winning streak of that kind against any side in the league. Huddersfield have scored in five of their last six Premier League away games, finding the net in more away trips than in their first 16 in the competition (4 games scored in). Huddersfield defender Jorgensen scored his first goal for the club in all competitions in what was his 45th appearance for the club. Man of the Match - James Maddison James Maddison celebrates after scoring Leicester City 's second goal Maddison has taken to the Premier League like a duck to water following his £22m summer move from Norwich. He ran the show again for Leicester against Huddersfield, scoring his side's crucial second with a powerful free-kick to beat Lossl. Maddison, who has been tipped for an England call-up, has now either scored or assisted (three goals, one assist) in four of his last five Premier League starts for Leicester. Notes for Southgate England have been crying out for a technical midfielder in recent matches and Maddison could be the man to fit that bill. He did his chances of a call-up to Southgate’s next squad absolutely no harm with a man-of-the-match performance against Huddersfield. Ben Chilwell, who made his England debut earlier this month, also impressed on the left of Leicester’s defence, playing the full 90 minutes alongside Harry Maguire. Demarai Gray, who was also called up to the England squad for the friendly against Switzerland, made an impact after being brought on by Puel at half-time. What's next? Leicester are back in action on Tuesday when they travel to Wolves in the third round of the Carabao Cup (7.45pm). Puel's side's next Premier League encounter is on Saturday at 3pm against Newcastle at St James' Park. Huddersfield's next engagement is in the Premier League when they host Tottenham next Saturday at 3pm at the John Smith's Stadium."},{"date": "22/09/2019", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 50965,

Southampton Liverpool maintained their perfect start to the season as they returned to the top of the Premier League table with a comfortable 3-0 win over Southampton. An own goal from Wesley Hoedt (10) set them on their way before Joel Matip's header (21) and Mohamed Salah's close-range strike (45+3) had the game wrapped up by half-time. Xherdan Shaqiri was heavily involved on his full debut - it was his shot that led to Hoedt's own goal and he crashed the free-kick off the bar that allowed Salah to tap in the rebound - before he was replaced at half-time. There was a mild concern for Liverpool after the break as Virgil van Dijk went off with what appeared to be a rib injury but, despite that, they cruised through the remainder of Jurgen Klopp's 600th league game as a manager to continue their 100 per cent start to the season. Player ratings Home Team: Alisson (6), Alexander-Arnold (7), Matip (7), Van Dijk (7), Robertson (7), Henderson (7), Wijnaldum (7), Shaqiri (8), Salah (8), Mane (7), Firmino (7) Subs: Milner (7), Gomez (8), Keita (7) Away Team: McCarthy (5), Cedric (6), Vestergaard (4), Hoedt (5), Bertrand (6), Romeu (6), Lemina (6), Hojbjerg (5), Redmond (5), Targett (5), Long (5) Subs: Bednarek (5), Armstrong (5), Austin (5) Man of the match: Mohamed Salah The home side were on top from the first whistle and needed less than 10 minutes to take the lead. Sadio Mane found Shaqiri in the left-hand channel, the Swiss cut inside and his shot ricocheted off Shane Long into Hoedt and across the line as Alex McCarthy dived despairingly to try and claw the ball away. Southampton responded well and Long almost got in after a loose pass from Matip. Van Dijk was alert to it though and snuffed out the danger as quickly as it had arisen. Liverpool carried a threat throughout and it took a superb last-ditch tackle from Cedric Soares to deny Salah after the Egyptian had played a quick one-two with Roberto Firmino. Matip rose highest from the resulting corner though, outjumping Jannik Vestergaard at the far post to plant his header beyond McCarthy and into the corner of the net. Team news Jurgen Klopp makes three changes to the side that beat Paris Saint-Germain. Roberto Firmino returned, Joel Matip replaced Joe Gomez and Xherdan Shaqiri made his full debut. Southampton were without the ineligible Danny Ings and the injured Mohamed Elyounoussi, in came Oriol Romeu and Matt Targett. The hosts continued to push for a third, while Southampton pushed forward intermittently but lacked any sort of cutting edge. It spoke volumes that their best chance almost resulted in a Liverpool goal; Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg scuffed his shot from 12 yards after Ryan Bertrand's pull back, Liverpool broke with Salah and he was just off target with a back-heeled effort. The third came on the stroke of half-time as Shaqiri's 30-yard free-kick came back off the underside of the bar and Salah was quickest to react, prodding the ball home from mere centimetres out. The second half was a non-event, Van Dijk was substituted 10 minutes after the restart but emerged again at the final whistle, suggesting it may just have been a precaution, while Salah had another strike disallowed for offside but by 70 minutes both teams seemed happy to accept their fate. Liverpool reclaim top spot from Chelsea, who play West Ham on Super Sunday, while Southampton remain in the bottom half with just one win to their name this season. Notes for Southgate Trent Alexander-Arnold’s fine form continued on the Liverpool right and it was his corner that Matip headed in for the second. Jordan Henderson dictated things well in the middle of the park but it was the performance of Joe Gomez, only on as a sub for 35 minutes that really stood out. The youngster was imperious, showing pace and strength to deny Southampton any semblance of a chance. Ryan Bertrand was, as ever, among Southampton’s more threatening players, getting forward well down the left when the opportunity presented itself and he created the visitors best chance, spurned by Hojbjerg. Nathan Redmond started brightly but quickly became a peripheral figure. Man of the match - Mohamed Salah Mohamed Salah was back on form for Liverpool at Anfield Jurgen Klopp had praised Salah before the game after all the talk of a slow start to the season from last season's top scorer. Not only was he back on the scoresheet at Anfield, his goalscoring instincts clear for all to see as he reacted quickest as Shaqiri's free-kick came back off the bar, he was a constant menace. He tormented Vestergaard in the first half as he started in a central role and, having moved back to the right for the second, he was involved in everything as Liverpool pushed for more goals after the break. Opta stats Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has won all five of his Premier League meetings with Mark Hughes, more than he has against any other manager in the competition. Southampton manager Mark Hughes has lost each of his last six Premier League matches against Liverpool by an aggregate score of 17-3. Liverpool have won their first six games of a top-flight season for the third time in their history, after 1978-79 (finished 1st) and 1990-91 (finished 2nd). Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 24 Premier League games at Anfield (W16 D8), their best run in the competition since August 2009 (31 games). Mohamed Salah has been directly involved in 41 goals in 31 games in all competitions for Liverpool at Anfield (30 goals, 11 assists). The managers 2:52 Jurgen Klopp hailed the impact of Xherdan Shaqiri on his full Liverpool debut Jurgen Klopp hailed the impact of Xherdan Shaqiri on his full Liverpool debut Jurgen Klopp: \"The result is really cool, the performance could have been better, that was clear, and we made some changes that cost us because I changed the system as well! Without training that is always difficult, I don't like it too much but we tried something and the changes we made were obviously good because Shaq was quite influential and Joel Matip as well. But organisation-wise, we had a few problems.\" 2:16 Mark Hughes conceded Southampton gave themselves a mountain to climb at Anfield after conceding two 'easy' goals. Mark Hughes conceded Southampton gave themselves a mountain to climb at Anfield after conceding two 'easy' goals. Mark Hughes: \"In the key moments of the game, the opening periods, you want to be nice and solid. At either end of the half as well, you want to get into half-time without conceding and we conceded two easy goals really from opportunities that could have been avoided. We gave ourselves a mountain to climb and it is difficult on the best of days to come to Anfield and get yourself a foothold in the game.\" What's next? Liverpool are back in action at Anfield on Wednesday when they host Chelsea in the third round of the Carabao Cup, live on Sky Sports, before facing the Blues again next Saturday in the Premier League's tea-time game.

United a fourth successive win in all competitions as Wolves earned a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford. Sir Alex Ferguson was in attendance for the first time since undergoing brain surgery in May as Fred became the 500th different player to score a competitive goal for United when he drilled home the opener, wonderfully set up by Paul Pogba in the 18th minute. Wolves did not let United's opener unsettle them, though, as they remained a real threat and engineered a deserved equaliser for Moutinho in the 53rd minute. United pressed for the winner, but could not find a way past a stubborn Wolves side who were more than good value for the point that keeps them in the top half. United sit fifth, eight points behind leaders Liverpool, after a disappointing afternoon that means they've have dropped six points from seven Premier League games at Old Trafford against newly-promoted opposition under Jose Mourinho. Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (8), Lindelof (6), Smalling (7), Shaw (7), Valencia (6), Fred (8), Lingard (6), Fellaini (6), Pogba (7), Sanchez (3), Lukaku (4). Subs used: Mata (6), Martial (6), Pereira (6). Wolves: Patricio (8), Doherty (7), Bennett (6), Boly (8), Jonny (7), Coady (7), Neves (7), Jota (7), Moutinho (8), Costa (7), Jimenez (8). Subs used: Saiss (6) Gibbs-White (N/A), Traore (7) Man of the match: Joao Moutinho Wolves were much the better side in the opening stages, forcing David de Gea into two fine saves, one from a close-range Raul Jimenez effort, and the other, a more impressive one from a Ryan Bennett header. Wolves were made to pay for not taking their chances as Fred fired United into the lead. It was all about the Pogba pass, as the France international controlled the ball brilliantly into the path of Fred, who arrived just at the right moment to fire into the net from the edge of the box. The goal did not deter Wolves, though, as they continued to put United on the back foot, but for all their good possession and pressure, they could not find that killer pass. Team news Two changes for United from the side that beat Watford last weekend, with Fred and Luke Shaw coming in for the suspended Nemanja Matic and Ashley Young. Marouane Fellaini, who sat out of United’s Champions League win in midweek, started in midfield. Wolves, for the sixth game in a row, were unchanged. Cue Raul Jimenez to provide that telling assist eight minutes into the second half, as he held the ball up in the box and laid it off perfectly for Moutinho, who slammed the ball into the top corner from the 18 yards. United pressed for the winner, with Marouane Fellaini denied by a smart save from Rui Patricio, but Wolves had chances of their own to win it, with lively substitute Adama Traore forcing De Gea into another save with his feet in stoppage time. The result dents recent good work from United, who had overcome back-to-back defeats at the end of August by going on a three-match winning streak on the road. Wolves, though, will cause many a team problems this season. Notes for Southgate No United player put in more crosses into the middle in one play than Luke Shaw, but he was often off target. Chris Smalling had a solid game in the heart of the United defence, but Jesse Lingard was very ineffective before being substituted. Opta stats United have dropped six points from seven Premier League games at Old Trafford against newly-promoted opposition under Jose Mourinho; more than the Red Devils had dropped in 10 seasons in the top-flight between 2006-07 and 2015-16 (5). Wolves have avoided defeat at Old Trafford against Man Utd in all competitions for the first time since November 1980, stopping a run of eight successive losses. João Moutinho scored his first goal in 28 league games since netting against PSG in November 2017. Fred is the first Brazilian player to score a Premier League goal for Man Utd since Rafael vs QPR in February 2013. Paul Pogba has been directly involved in six goals in his seven starts in all competitions for Man Utd this season (4 goals, 2 assists). 2:41 Nuno Espirito Santo was full of praise for his Wolves side Nuno Espirito Santo was full of praise for his Wolves side Man of the match - Joao Moutinho Eyebrows were raised when Wolves managed to snare Moutinho in the summer for what appeared to be a nominal fee, and he proved why he has garnered such a prestigious reputation at Old Trafford, dictating the play for much of the contest, against impressive opposition. No team-mate created more chances, while he put in double the crosses of any Wolves player. It was the control with which he went about his business that was most impressive, though. 2:09 Jose Mourinho: We only deserved a draw Jose Mourinho: We only deserved a draw What's next?

Harry Kane ended his mini goal drought to help Tottenham earn a much-needed 2-1 win over Brighton at the Amex Stadium. After four games without scoring for club and country, Kane gave Spurs the lead from the penalty spot (42) after Glenn Murray had handled while blocking a free-kick. Despite Brighton finding their rhythm second half, substitute Erik Lamela made it 2-0 with a fine sweeping finish (76) after starting a move from deep, before Anthony Knockaert made for a nervy ending with a fine finish in stoppage time (90+3). Harry Kane makes it 1-0 from the penalty spot Player ratings Brighton: Gazzaniga (6), Trippier (7), Alderweireld (7), Vertonghen (7), Rose (7), Dembele (8), Dier (8), Eriksen (7), Moura (7), Son (6), Kane (7) Subs: Lamela (8), Alli (NA) Tottenham: Ryan (6), Montoya (5), Duffy (5), Dunk (5), Bong (5), Stephens (5), Bissouma (5), March (5), Propper (5), Knockaert (6), Murray (5) Subs: Kayal (5), Jahanbakhsh (5), Locadia (NA) Man of the match: Mousa Dembele After three straight defeats, the win leaves Spurs in fifth, while Brighton are seven points behind in 13th as they lost at home in the league for the first time since March. Mat Ryan was forced into a fine reflex save early on from point-blank range as Toby Alderweireld's header deflected off Gaetan Bong, and though Spurs had 79 per cent of the ball first half, they did not make it count until the closing stages. Kieran Trippier's free-kick was blocked by Murray's hand in the wall, a superb spot from referee Chris Kavanagh and his team, allowing Kane to step up and send Ryan the wrong way. Team news Vorm was out for Spurs, replaced by Gazzaniga in goal, with Whiteman on the bench. Trippier, Alderweireld and Rose returned for Aurier, Sanchez and Davies following the loss at Inter Milan, while Moura came in for Lamela. Brighton were unchanged following the 2-2 draw at Southampton on Monday Night Football. Solly March and and Toby Alderweireld in action at the Amex Stadium Christian Eriksen's long-range effort went just wide after the break, but Brighton eventually got going, and should have scored when Knockaert's weak shot from eight yards was collected by Paulo Gazzaniga after Beram Kayal had found him. But Spurs made it 2-0 with a superb move as Lamela broke free to feed Lucas Moura on the left, who in turn slipped in Danny Rose down the left flank. Lamela continued his run into the box, and latched onto Rose's centre to sweep home from 12 yards. Kane shrugged off talk of fatigue by playing all 90 minutes on the south coast, and nearly netted again late on as he piled into the box only for Ryan to save when one-on-one. Knockaert's fine finish cutting in from the right on his left foot created a nervous end, before Gazzaniga saved and held well from the same man's 20-yard effort a moment later. Kane scored having gone five without a goal for club and country Man of the match - Mousa Dembele So calm and collected on the ball, Dembele made Spurs tick on Saturday evening on a zippy surface. He made 70 passes at a staggering 97.1 per cent accuracy, while also winning 85 per cent of his duels. Alongside the equally-impressive Eric Dier, Dembele did his defensive work too, making three tackles, two clearances and winning the ball back four times. A superb performance from the Belgian. What would VAR have changed? The penalty decision was correct, as was Lewis Dunk's disallowed goal in the second half, but Dunk should have had a penalty after Eric Dier had a chunk of his shirt in the box. Going by grappling decisions at the World Cup, it would have been a spot kick with the score at 1-0 to Spurs, giving Brighton the chance to level. Opta stats Brighton have only won one of their last 10 games against Tottenham in all competitions (W1 D2 L7), a home victory in April 1983. Spurs have only failed to score in one of their last 17 Premier League away games (0-1 vs West Brom in May). Brighton suffered a home league defeat for the first time since March (0-2 v Leicester), winning two and drawing three before the loss to Tottenham. Paulo Gazzaniga became the third goalkeeper to appear in the Premier League this season for Tottenham, more than any other club has used. What's next? Tottenham now host Watford in the Carabao Cup third round in Milton Keynes on Wednesday night, before going to Huddersfield on Saturday in the Premier League.

Brighton against Southampton on Monday Night Football after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's stunning opener. The midfielder produced a moment of magic in the 35th minute of a lacklustre first half with a swerving effort from outside the box, before Danny Ings (64) converted from the spot after being fouled by Gaetan Bong in the area. But two minutes and nine seconds later, Shane Duffy (67) nodded home a Brighton reply and it was the defender who was fouled by James Ward-Prowse to win a late penalty, which Murray slotted home (90+1). It is the second 2-2 draw in a row for Chris Hughton's side, who are level on five points with Southampton, although are a place behind the Saints in 14th on goal difference. Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (7), Soares (6), Vestergaard (7), Hoedt (7), Bertrand (7), Lemina (7), Hojbjerg (8), Elyounoussi (7), Redmond (6), Long (6), Ings (7). Subs used: Ward-Prowse (4), Gabbiadini (4), Davis (n/a). Brighton: Ryan (7), Bong (5), Duffy (7), Dunk (6), Montoya (6), Stephens (7), Bissouma (6), March (6), Propper (7), Knockaert (7), Murray (7). Subs used: Jahanbakhsh (5), Locadia (5). Man of the match: Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. The first half was a cagey affair, and it took 22 minutes for a sight of goal. Hojbjerg headed a deep corner across the area and after some pinball, Ings saw his effort blocked. Mohamed Elyounoussi then attempted to sweep home the loose ball, but his effort went high over the crossbar. The Norwegian had another glorious chance not long after as he rose to meet a cross from Nathan Redmond, but could only direct the ball wide of the post. Southampton made the breakthrough with 10 minutes of the half to play thanks to a stunning strike from Hojbjerg. Eloynoussi's cross into the area was cleared by Lewis Dunk but it fell straight to the feet of the Dane, who hit a wonderful strike from 35 yards, leaving Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan furious. Team news Southampton named the same XI that won at Crystal Palace before the international break. Brighton made one change with the injured Pascal Gross replaced by Yves Bissouma. Chris Hughton clearly had strong words for Brighton at the break as they came racing out of the traps in the second half. After mostly being a spectator in the first period, Alex McCarthy was called upon after seven minutes as Anthony Knockaert tried his luck with a fierce drive but the goalkeeper pushed it away strongly before Solly March skewed the rebound. But the Saints doubled their lead in the 64th minute after Gaetan Bong caught Ings from behind in the box, with referee Anthony Taylor instantly pointing to the penalty spot. The striker stepped up to take it and, after a stuttering run-up, slotted home into the bottom-left corner. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg scored a stunning strike for Southampton However, Brighton rallied almost instantly as they pulled a goal back. Knockaert delivered an in-swinging free kick that was powered home by the head of Duffy from 10 yards out. The Seagulls kept pushing for their equaliser as McCarthy was forced to palm away a Jurgen Locadia header on the stroke of 90 minutes, but they got their reward not long after. Ward-Prowse was penalised for pushing Duffy over as Brighton had a corner, with referee Taylor again signalling to the spot. It was Murray - scoring in his third successive league game against Southampton - who stepped up, going down the middle to complete the Seagulls' comeback. Ryan Bertrand almost had the final say as he fired a curling free-kick towards goal but an impressive, leaping save from Ryan kept him at bay as the points were shared. Shane Duffy nodded home for Brighton against Southampton Opta stats Brighton have managed just two away wins in the Premier League since the start of last season, fewer than any other side to appear in both the 17/18 and 18/19 editions (W2 D5 L14). Southampton have dropped 26 points from leading positions in the Premier League since the start of last season, the most of any side to appear in both campaigns. Southampton striker Danny Ings has scored in consecutive Premier League appearances for the first time since February 2015. Glenn Murray has scored five goals in six league starts for Brighton against Southampton. Notes for Southgate Gareth Southgate was in the stands at St Mary's, with recent inclusion Alex McCarthy producing some good saves. Ryan Bertrand also almost scored late on. Nathan Redmond did not do too much, with James Ward-Prowse responsible for giving away Brighton's late penalty. The managers Mark Hughes: \"As always, I question the penalty decision because I thought it was a little bit soft. We are disappointed. We got ourselves into a winning position - a deserved one, I felt for the efforts up to the penalty we had - and we were quite comfortable. \"Credit to them. They had a real go in the second half and they had to. They had nothing to lose and were taking chances and they got their reward.\" 2:46 Hughes: Game management is poor Hughes: Game management is poor Chris Hughton: \"It's a second game on the spin where we have come back from 2-0 and you have to look at the character in the team but also some of the frailties that allowed us to get into that position in the first place \"From our second-half performance, we deserved to get something from the game. The level of performance was better, and we have had really good periods away from home, but it's about getting results.\" 4:26 Hughton: We deserved a point Hughton: We deserved a point Man of the match - Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg Southampton celebrate after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg's opening goal Hojbjerg is a man in form, now scoring in his last two games for Southampton after managing the same tally over 102 previous league games. His strike was a thing of beauty, too, and at 35 yards out, it is the longest-range strike in the Premier League so far this season. But it was not just his goal that he contributed. He dominated the midfield in the first half, running Brighton ragged before their second-half comeback, making interceptions and good passes for his other team-mates. 2:49 Hojbjerg: That's not good enough Hojbjerg: That's not good enough What's next? Southampton travel to Liverpool in the Premier League next weekend while Brighton welcome Tottenham to the Amex Stadium in the late Saturday kick off."},{"date": "16/09/2019", "arena": "Molineux",

Burnley are still without a Premier League win this season after Raul Jimenez's second-half goal earned Wolves a 1-0 victory at Molineux on Super Sunday. The Mexico forward struck the winner in the 61st minute to seal a second straight top-flight victory and one that boss Nuno Espirito Santo will feel his side deserved after Burnley goalkeeper Joe Hart made a string of fine saves to keep his side in the game. The result sees the home side climb into the top half of the table on eight points, while Burnley have made their worst top-flight start in 90 years and remain in the relegation zone after picking up just one point from their opening five matches. Hart spoke before the match of his desire to force his way back into England contention and excelled throughout the first half, bravely beating Willy Boly to a Helder Costa cross in the 10th minute before making a pair of vital stops on the half-hour. Joe Hart pulled off some great saves in the first half against Wolves An excellent reaction save kept out Jimenez's header with James Tarkowski heading the follow-up effort off the line and Hart then beat Matt Doherty to the ball moments later after his central defender had made another goal-line clearance. Player ratings Wolves: Patricio (6), Bennett (6), Coady (6), Boly (7), Doherty (9), Moutinho (6), Neves (7), Jonny (7), Costa (7), Jota (7), Jimenez (7). Subs: Traore (6), Bonatini (6), Gibbs-White (n/a) Burnley: Hart (8), Bardsley (7), Tarkowski (8), Mee (6), Taylor (6), Lennon (5), Cork (5), Gudmundsson (6), Hendrick (6), Barnes (5), Vokes (5). Subs: Vydra (6), Wood (6), Westwood (6) Man of the match: Matt Doherty Boly volleyed over the bar as Wolves failed to find the breakthrough their first-half dominance merited and they spurned a glorious chance within a minute of the restart when Jota pounced on Phil Bardsley's error, drew Hart and laid the ball to Jimenez, who blasted past two recovering defenders and over the bar. However, Hart was finally beaten on 61 minutes thanks to a stylish first-time finish from Jimenez. Costa slipped Doherty into the right channel and Jimenez met the wing-back's cross with a deft shot across the goalkeeper which went in off the post, giving the home side a deserved lead. Team news Wolves named the same side that claimed a dramatic late victory at West Ham before the international break. Sean Dyche freshened up Burnley's attack by handing Ashley Barnes and Sam Vokes their first starts of the season, while Johann Berg Gudmundsson returned from injury. Burnley might have snatched an unlikely equaliser minutes later when substitute Matej Vydra volleyed Johann Berg Gudmundsson's free-kick across goal and Jack Cork was unable to react to tap the ball into an empty yet from a yard. Sam Vokes (L) vies with Wolves defender Ryan Bennett That was their only real chance of the game and the impressive Doherty spurned another good Wolves opening when he shot wide from near the penalty spot after a one-two with Jimenez Substitute Leo Bonatini wasted two late chances and Nuno may have been frustrated by his side's inability to kill off a match they dominated, but they are now seven points ahead of a toothless Burnley side who have already played 11 games this campaign and look set for a season of struggle after their early European exit. Opta stats Wolves have won all three of their Premier League meetings with Burnley, against no other side have they recorded a 100 per cent win ratio. Burnley have never won a Premier League away game against newly promoted opposition (W0 D6 L5) This is Burnley's worst start to a season in the top flight (one point from five games) since 1927-28. Wolves recorded more shots than they have against any other side in a single match in Premier League history (30 shots). Since winning five successive Premier League games between March-April 2018, Burnley have picked up just three points from a possible 30 (D3 L7). Man of the Match - Matt Doherty Sky Sports commentator Andy Hinchcliffe: \"He has been absolutely outstanding. He was involved in the winning goal and is perfectly built to play the wing-back role. He is athletic and has real quality. He plays with his head up and plays passes at just the right time. He has been superb.\" Notes for Gareth Southgate If Joe Hart is hoping to force his way back into Southgate’s plans, his summer move to Burnley has certainly given him more chances to catch the eye. He has faced more shots and made more saves than any other goalkeeper in the Premier League this season including five this afternoon. His first-half performance was particularly impressive and he was helpless to keep out the only goal of the game. James Tarkowski made two important goal-line clearances in the first half and his recovery defending was impressive in an increasingly shaky Burnley backline. At the other end, Conor Coady has been talked about as an England contender but had little to do as Wolves restricted their opponents to just two shots on target. Managers Nuno Espirito Santo: \"We did a good game, we were organised, Burnley didn't have any chances, we had a lot. It was a lot, we should improve on that, but it's hard to build the way we build and stay organised in the shape. \"It could have been a different result but how we played is more important at this stage of the season. \"The scoreline could have been more. The way we create those chances requires the last touch, but things will come if we stay organise and are more clinical.\" 3:07 Un-named Video Un-named Video Sean Dyche: \"No complaints, Wolves played well. They are a good side and we knew we would have to defend resolutely, which to be fair I thought we did - our 'keeper played well. \"We were a bit more like ourselves defensively. It was a poor goal but other than that we got blocks in, were resolute and stayed in the game where we could have got something. \"But attacking wise it was nowhere near enough, not enough quality, guile and energy really. That's got to change.\" 2:50 Un-named Video Un-named Video What's next? Wolves travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United in the Premier League next Saturday afternoon, while Burnley host Bournemouth at Turf Moor at the same time."},{"date": "16/09/2019", "arena":

"2:53 Everton 1-3 West Ham Everton 1-3 West Ham West Ham finally won their first Premier League game of the season as Andriy Yarmolenko's first-half double saw them beat Everton 3-1 at Goodison Park on Sunday. Yarmolenko gave West Ham an 11th-minute lead with his first goal for the club, before doubling the visitors' advantage with a delightful curler just past the half-hour mark. However, Gylfi Sigurdsson's bullet header gave Everton a lifeline in first-half injury time - the attacker's first league strike since February - only for Marko Arnautovic's third goal of the season to restore his side's two-goal cushion after 61 minutes. Player ratings Everton: Everton: Pickford (5), Kenny (7), Holgate (5), Zouma (5), Digne (7), Gueye (6), Schneiderlin (5), Walcott (6), Sigurdsson (6), Calvert-Lewin (6), Tosun (5) Subs: Bernard (6), Niasse (6), Lookman (6) West Ham: Fabianski (7), Zabaleta (6), Balbuena (6), Diop (7), Masuaku (6), Noble (6), Rice (7), Obiang (7), Yarmolenko (8), Arnautovic (9), Felipe Anderson (7) Subs: Sanchez (6), Antonio (7), Snodgrass (6) Man of the match: Marko Arnautovic As a result, the Hammers jumped up from the bottom of the table to 16th, while Everton stay in 10th place having won only once so far this campaign. West Ham may have come into this match still looking for their first points of the season, but Manuel Pellegrini's side started on the front foot at a flat Goodison, their minds perhaps cleared after the recent international break. The visitors opened the scoring early on as Pedro Obiang and Arnautovic exchanged passes in midfield, before the Spaniard's ball over the top released the forward, who unselfishly squaring for Yarmolenko to sweep home his first goal since December 2017. Just like waiting for London buses, the Ukraine international - making his first Premier League start since his summer move from Borussia Dortmund - then added a second after 31 minutes. Marko Arnautovic celebrates scoring West Ham's third Jordan Pickford's poor clearance was intercepted by the alert Mark Noble, who found Yarmolenko on the right edge of the area. However, the winger still had a lot of work to do to score, only to cut inside Kurt Zouma and Lucas Digne, before curling an unstoppable effort into the far corner. With the home fans starting to fret, though, Everton got back into the contest just before the break as Sigurdsson met Jonjoe Kenny's inch-perfect cross from the right with an unstoppable header. But if the home faithful thought that goal would be a catalyst for a second-half revival, they were mistaken with West Ham the next scorers just past the hour-mark. Team news Everton made two changes from their draw at home to Huddersfield last time out, with Jonjoe Kenny and Idrissa Gueye replacing the injured Seamus Coleman and Tom Davies. The visitors made six changes from the side that lost 1-0 at home to Wolves before the international break. That meant starts for Pablo Zabaleta, Arthur Masuaku, Pedro Obiang, Mark Noble, Declan Rice and Andriy Yarmolenko. Again Obiang and Arnautovic linked up well with a neat one-two on the edge of the area, with the latter finishing confidently, the 12th goal the forward has been involved in for his team in their last 11 away encounters. Marco Silva, who suffered his first defeat as Everton manager, will no doubt point to a host of chances wasted by out-of-form striker Cenk Tosun, while his replacement in attack - Oumar Niasse - also hit the bar late on. But anything other than a first league win at the fifth time of asking would have been cruel on Pellegrini, who got the perfect 65th birthday present. Opta stats Pellegrini has won five of his seven Premier League clashes against Everton (D2); he has faced the Toffees more times in the competition without losing than any other side Everton have won just one of their last 13 Premier League games played on a Sunday, with this their tenth defeat in those matches (D2) West Ham have beaten Everton in consecutive league meetings for the first time since March 1973; both of their last two Premier League wins have now come against the Toffees (also in May 2018) Everton have now lost three of their last six meetings with West Ham (W2 D1), as many as their previous 31 combined in all competitions (W18 D10 L3) Yarmolenko is the fourth Ukrainian player to score in the Premier League (also Rebrov, Shevchenko and Voronin) and the first since Andriy Voronin for Liverpool against Spurs in May 2008 Yarmolenko is just the fourth West Ham player to score a brace on his first Premier League start for the club (also Trevor Sinclair, David Di Michele and Demba Ba) and the first since Demba Ba against West Brom in February 2011 Notes for Gareth Southgate Southgate will no doubt have noted Jordan Pickford’s mistake that led to West Ham’s second goal. However, the watching Steve Holland will surely have been impressed with Declan Rice’s composed display in front of the visitors’ back four as the midfielder waits to decide which country to represent. What would VAR have changed? It would have been interesting to see if the yellow dished out to Arthur Masuaku five minutes before half-time after the West Ham left back's boot caught Theo Walcott dangerously on the neck would have been upgraded by the VAR. Man of the match - Marko Arnautovic Arnautovic ran the show against Everton, scoring one goal and making another. Everton knew exactly what to expect, but being able to stop the big Austrian is another thing entirely. He offers a different challenge to most strikers as he's not fast ­or strong - he's both. Arnautovic won 75 per cent of his aerial duels, and was West Ham's fastest player at Goodison Park. He had only 23 touches before being taken off, but he made sure he made them count. 🥇Marko Arnautovic - Man of the Match🍾 Shots: 1 Goals: 1 Assists: 1 Touches: 23 (fewest of any West Ham starter)@WestHamUtd win successive League games against Everton for the first time since 1972-73 pic.twitter.com/mGqs16W7QM — Sky Sports Statto (@SkySportsStatto) September 16, 2018 Managers Marco Silva: \"We weren't good enough to win the match. Our first 10 minutes was good, but our first mistake we made - we prepared for, our opponent winning the ball and looking straight to Arnautovic, we prepared for it but we made too many mistakes. \"We reacted but there was a second mistake. We changed the formation and got back into the game, but even before we had two clear chances. In the second half we developed clear chances - they had three and scored three, we had four or five and scored one, even with not playing well. \"When you win, you win together and when you lose it's not just about our strikers. For the first goal we had to do something different. It's a big lesson for us to learn, as I've told our players, and we need to learn it quickly.\" 2:31 Everton boss Marco Silva said his side were not good enough to beat West Ham Everton boss Marco Silva said his side were not good enough to beat West Ham Manuel Pellegrini: \"I was worried about the game, because I was absolutely convinced we must win. We have been very unlucky to lose the three last games, as I said in the press conference maybe we didn't deserve to win but we didn't deserve to lose either. \"It's easy to change and say this isn't the right way, but i am completely convinced it is. We tried to score goals form the first minute and we did it. \"I didn't know how close a performance like that was, but I see the players working every day, and maybe in matches we haven't been able to perform like that but we must be able to repeat it during games, under pressure or with bad comments about our performances.\" 3:00 Manuel Pellegrini says he always knew West Ham were close to picking up a victory Manuel Pellegrini says he always knew West Ham were close to picking up a victory The Pundit - David Moyes \"Since he became a forward player, he saw it as part of his job (to score goals). You saw his goal, but the run in behind for their first goal, he is a threat. \"I think if he played for Everton today, Everton would have won the game because every time, especially in the first half, Everton looked to play into Cenk Tosun. And I thought they lost the ball and the first goal comes from it. \"Whereas anything that got played into Marko today, he set it, laid it, he spun in behind, he went again. He makes the first goal that way, he makes the second goal that way. \"So I think if he had been playing for the opposition today, he would have been a real handful for anybody.\" 2:01 Marko Arnautovic was West Ham's key player, according to David Moyes Marko Arnautovic was West Ham's key player, according to David Moyes What's next?

Tottenham 1-2 Liverpool Highlights: Tottenham 1-2 Liverpool Liverpool maintained their perfect start to the season with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham at Wembley. Georginio Wijnaldum's first Premier League away goal, awarded by goal-line technology, put Liverpool ahead on 36 minutes before Roberto Firmino sealed a fifth-consecutive victory with their second nine minutes after the interval. Eric Lamela grabbed a goal back in stoppage-time but it proved too little, too late for Mauricio Pochettino's men as Spurs slipped to a second successive defeat. Player ratings Tottenham: Vorm (5), Trippier (6), Alderweireld (5), Vertonghen (5), Rose (6), Dier (5), Dembele (6), Winks (6), Eriksen (5), Moura (6), Kane (5). Subs: Son (5), Lamela (6), Wanyama (n/a). Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Gomez (8), Van Dijk (8), Robertson (7), Wijnaldum (8), Milner (8), Keita (7), Mane (6), Salah (6), Firmino (8). Subs: Henderson (6), Sturridge (5), Matip (n/a). Man of the Match: James Milner There was so nearly a sensational start for Liverpool, who had the ball in the back of the net inside a minute when Sadio Mane diverted a cross from the right beyond Michel Vorm. However Spurs, who looked to be carrying a hangover from their defeat at Watford, were left off the hook when the effort was ruled out, with the offside Firmino adjudged to have interfered in play. Roberto Firmino appeals to the assistant referee after Mane's goal was ruled out for offside Spurs' lethargic start continued as a misplaced Eric Dier pass was pounced upon by Mohamed Salah on 22 minutes. He streaked clear but was prevented from breaking the deadlock by a fine save by Vorm. Christian Eriksen registered Tottenham's first attempt on target just before the half hour with a whipped 18-yard free-kick, but Alisson, a bystander until that point, was up to the task. Harry Winks made his first Premier League start since December 16 That kicked Spurs into gear as they finished the stronger of the two sides, but Liverpool continued to pose the greater threat in front of goal, Mane drawing Vorm into action at full stretch after bundling his way into the area. A minute later, though, Liverpool broke the deadlock through the most unlikely of sources as Wijnaldum's looping header crossed the line before Vorm hooked it away, handing the Dutchman his first goal away from home in the English top flight at the 112th attempt. Georginio Wijnaldum wheels away after heading Liverpool into the lead Liverpool maintained their momentum in a pulsating start to the second half. Andy Robertson struck the bar with a cross-come shot and a dipping Naby Keita volley drew another decent stop from Vorm, before a flowing counter ended with Mane swivelling and testing the Spurs stopper. Lucas Moura led the Spurs fightback but he could only strike the base of the post on 50 minutes - four minutes later, Liverpool had doubled their lead. Team news Harry Winks was the surprise Tottenham inclusion as he made his first Premier League start since December 16, replacing the injured Dele Alli. Michel Vorm started in goal in Hugo Lloris’ absence, while Eric Dier and Danny Rose were recalled to the starting line-up. For Liverpool there was just one change as Naby Keita replaced Jordan Henderson. Mane's low cross deflected onto the post off Toby Alderweireld, the ball rolled across the goal line and through the clutches of Vorm, presenting Firmino with the simplest of tap-ins. Liverpool should have finished the game off when Firmino released Mane through on goal on 63 minutes, but the Senegalese hesitated before playing Keita in on the overlap, allowing Vorm to save the midfielder's drive. But in the end the third was not necessary, despite Lamela becoming only the second player to score against Liverpool with his late consolation from a narrow angle. Opta stats Tottenham v Liverpool is now the highest scoring fixture in Premier League history (152 goals). Tottenham have lost consecutive Premier League games for the first time since the final two games of the 2015-16 season. Liverpool have won their opening five games of a top-flight season for only the third time, after 1978-79 and 1990-91. Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum's opener was the 19th Premier League goal of his career but the first to come in an away game. Georginio Wijnaldum's goal for Liverpool came via his 55th shot attempted in away Premier League games. Roberto Firmino has been directly involved in 61 Premier League goals for Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp (38 goals, 23 assists), 16 more than any other player. Tottenham faced 10 shots on target in a Premier League home game for the first time since January 2014 vs Manchester City. Christian Eriksen's assist for Erik Lamela's goal was his 50th in the Premier League, making him the second player to reach that milestone for Spurs (Darren Anderton, 67). The managers 3:48 Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino concedes his side lost to the better team Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino concedes his side lost to the better team Mauricio Pochettino: \"They were better, we competed, and we were close. Disappointed with the result but we need to keep working and improving. I am relaxed, I'm not worried. My confidence in these players is 200 per cent, not 100 per cent, 200 per cent.\" 5:05 Jurgen Klopp hailed Liverpool's victory at Tottenham as their best performance of the season Jurgen Klopp hailed Liverpool's victory at Tottenham as their best performance of the season Jurgen Klopp: \"It was very good. It was a very intense job and the boys did it. It was a deserved win. Over 85 minutes we were dominant. That was our best game of the season. Football as it should be. If we win at Tottenham it's a big result. I'm really proud of them.\" Man of the Match - James Milner It was another industrious performance from Liverpool's captain, who just edged out Joe Gomez, Virgil van Dijk and Firmino to the award. Milner is the wise head in this exhilarating Liverpool side and his game management and awareness throughout proved key, cutting the supply line to the Spurs attack by suffocating Eriksen, Winks and Dembele in midfield. What's next? Both sides kick off their Champions League campaigns before resuming in the Premier League. Tottenham travel to Inter Milan and Liverpool host PSG on Tuesday before Spurs make the trip to Brighton in Saturday's tea-time kick-off and Liverpool welcome Southampton to Anfield on Saturday at 3pm."},{"date": "15/09/2019", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10543, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

Leicester. Bournemouth scored three times in the opening 45 minutes with Fraser grabbing two (19 and 37) before King converted from the spot (41). Smith grabbed a fourth for Bournemouth (81) after Wes Morgan was shown a second yellow card of the afternoon and there were late goals from James Maddison (88) and Marc Albrighton (89) to give Leicester a brief glimmer of hope, but defeat for the visitors is likely to raise questions again over the long-term future of Claude Puel. The result means Bournemouth go up into fifth in the Premier League table. Leicester remain in ninth. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (8), S Cook (6), Ake (6), Smith (7), Lerma (6), Gosling (6), Rico (6), Brooks (6), Fraser (9), Wilson (7), King (7) Subs: L Cook (6), Francis (6), Mousset (6) Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Pereira (5), Morgan (4), Maguire (4), Chilwell (5), Mendy (6), Ndidi (6), Ghezzal (6), Maddison (7), Gray (5), Vardy (6) Subs: Albrighton (7), Evans (6), Iheanacho (6) Man of the match: Ryan Fraser After a bright start from Leicester with the visitors looking more likely to open the scoring, it was Bournemouth who took a surprising lead in the 19th minute. As Leicester piled numbers forward, Josh King kick-started a counter-attack before he played through Fraser for the Scotland international's first goal of the afternoon. Leicester missed two glorious chances to equalise shortly after the half-hour mark. Asmir Begovic first denied Jamie Vardy, who was clear on goal, before blocking Maddison's rebound onto the crossbar. Bournemouth made them pay moments later as Callum Wilson surged forward and played in the onrushing Fraser to calmly slot away his second. The afternoon turned from bad to worse for Puel's side when Ricardo Pereira clumsily handled in his own box to hand Bournemouth a penalty. King stepped up and drilled his effort into the bottom corner to give Howe's men a remarkable first-half lead. Team news Simon Francis dropped to the bench with David Brooks returning to the starting line-up. Jamie Vardy returned from suspension to lead the Leicester attack, replacing Marc Albrighton. Leicester started the second half in encouraging fashion with Harry Maguire forcing Begovic into a smart, reflex save in the 62nd minute, but Leicester were then reduced to 10 men. After already making two quick challenges, Morgan lunged into Smith when going for the final ball which resulted in referee Craig Pawson handing him his second yellow. Bournemouth capitalised on their man advantage to go four up with Fraser beating Pereira on the left flank before he squared for Smith to slot home. Even though Leicester were four down, they continued to fight and clawed back two late goals. First, Maddison converted from the spot after Pereira was tripped up by Sergio Rico. Then, just a single minute later, Albrighton reduced the deficit further as he latched onto Kelechi Iheanacho's pinpoint cross with a fine header. But that was as good as it got for Leicester as Bournemouth claimed an impressive three points. Notes for Southgate Harry Maguire ran the risk of getting sent off in the first half. After receiving an early yellow card, he was fortunate to not see another one after barging into King on the byline in the 28th minute. James Maddison is likely to have raised his chances of grabbing his first senior England cap. He was Leicester’s best performer and deserved to be on the scoresheet after a convincing display linking up with Jamie Vardy. Ben Chilwell had a quiet game at left-back as part of a backline that endured a difficult afternoon. Opta stats Bournemouth are unbeaten in their seven Premier League meetings with Leicester (W2 D5 L0). They've faced Leicester more often without losing in the Premier League than against any other side. Bournemouth have lost just two of their last 13 Premier League games at the Vitality Stadium, winning seven and drawing four. Leicester City have lost five of their last six Premier League away games, winning the other versus Southampton. Bournemouth striker Joshua King both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the first time in his career. Leicester defender Wes Morgan was shown his second ever red card in the Premier League and first since December 2014 vs Liverpool. Bournemouth have scored three first-half goals in a Premier League game for only the second time (also October 2016 v Hull). The managers 1:10 Howe says Bournemouth were clinical when the chances came Howe says Bournemouth were clinical when the chances came Eddie Howe: \"It was a tough game. Leicester are a very good team and you could see that in stages of the game but we were clinical when the chances came. We were very effective in front of goal and bar the last part of the game I'm very happy. It's a good day for us. We go away with a very good result but also knowing that we still have got work to do and things to do. That's a very healthy position to be in.\" 3:19 Puel says his side lacked concentration and focus against Bournemouth Puel says his side lacked concentration and focus against Bournemouth Claude Puel: \"It's a difficult feeling and I'm more than disappointed. It was strange the first half. It was not a fair reflection. We started this game with good intentions and it was a good balance between both. \"We had the first chances to score. But after the counter-attacks it was difficult to react. We had to prevent this situation. We lacked concentration and focus. \"After the second half it was difficult to come back. We tried but we conceded another goal with a man down but I praise the mentality of my team because we scored twice at the end. I think it was important. Now it's important to prepare for the next game and that I hope this was an accident and we react.\" Man of the Match - Ryan Fraser Fraser scored twice against Leicester Fraser put in a hugely impressive performance for Bournemouth and caused opposing right-back Pereira plenty of problems down the left flank. His pace and power was too much for Leicester and showed a clinical edge when he dispatched two of his chances as well as a grabbing an assist for Bournemouth's final goal. What's next?

The Blues fell behind for the first time this season when Sol Bamba turned in from close range following Sean Morrison's flick-on from a free-kick (17). But Chelsea began to turn on the style before half-time with a number of one-touch moves, and they levelled when Olivier Giroud flicked the ball into Hazard, who took a touch before firing beyond Neil Etheridge from the edge of the box (37). The Belgian had them in front before the break from another Giroud assist, this time from the edge of the six-yard box (44), and added a third from the spot late on when Bamba bundled into Willian (81). Player ratings Chelsea: Kepa (6), Azpilicueta (7), Rudiger (6), Luiz (6), Alonso (6), Jorginho (6), Kante (7), Kovacic (6), Pedro (5), Giroud (8), Hazard (9).

Subs: Richards (6), Paterson (7), Madine (6). Man of the match: Eden Hazard The Brazilian, a second-half substitute, got in on the act himself with a curling finish from outside the box (83), to give table-topping Chelsea their best start in eight years, and leave Cardiff still looking for their first win. Cardiff had begun with the same level of intent they had shown from the off against Arsenal before the international break, and Bamba gave them a warning of their potency from set-pieces when he headed a Joe Ralls corner wide of the far post. It wasn't heeded, and Morrison was given a simple task of providing an assist from a free-kick - as he had against Arsenal - and find a sliding Bamba to score the opener soon after. Chelsea then began to turn on the style at last, and Mateo Kovacic should have levelled when played through by a delightful backheel from Giroud, but Etheridge smothered his shot. Team news Chelsea dropped Alvaro Morata to the bench after a poor showing against Bournemouth, with Olivier Giroud replacing him. Cardiff were unchanged from their narrow 3-2 defeat to Arsenal a fortnight ago. More 'Sarri-ball' showed in flashes, and it was an excellent move which did eventually break Cardiff's resistance. Antonio Rudiger stepped out of defence, he looked into Giroud and his first-time ball found Hazard, who took a touch before drilling into the far corner from outside the box. And the game was turned on its head before the break, when Pedro's drilled cross from the left was kept alive by Giroud and turned into the path of Hazard, who slotted in from close range. After half-time Cardiff looked content to wait for their moment, while Chelsea's intensity dropped, without being caused too much trouble. But a moment of madness would cement their victory, when Bamba clattered into Willian with the Brazilian going away from goal, and Hazard fired in from the spot. Willian then got one of his own when he found a yard of space and left Etheridge helpless with a fine finish from 20 yards. Match facts Chelsea have won their opening five games to a Premier League season for the fourth time after 2005-06, 2009-10 and 2010-11 - more than any other team in the competition. This is the first time that Cardiff have opened an English top-flight campaign without winning any of their first five games since 1921-22. Cardiff boss Neil Warnock has gone 11 Premier League games without a win as manager for the first time (W0 D5 L6). Cardiff are winless in seven matches in all competitions (W0 D3 L4), their worst run under Neil Warnock; they last went on a longer run without victory between January and February 2015 (eight games). Since his Premier League debut in August 2012, Chelsea's Eden Hazard (115) has been directly involved in more goals than any other midfielder in the competition (74 goals, 41 assists). Eden Hazard is the fourth player to score more than one Premier League hat-trick for Chelsea (also Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink). Cardiff's Sol Bamba became the oldest player to score his first Premier League goal (33y 244d) since Zlatan Ibrahimovic in August 2016 (34y 316d). Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud provided two assists in a single Premier League game for the third time in his career and first since January 2017 vs Bournemouth. Man of the match - Eden Hazard Hazard was at his sublime best with his second Chelsea hat-trick, breaking down a tough Cardiff resistance to level with a lovely finish, before showing his predatory instincts to put the Blues ahead. It was not just his goalscoring which caught the eye, he won more than 60 per cent of his duels on the afternoon and put two good crosses in - as many as anyone else on the pitch. Eden Hazard moved top of the goalscoring charts with his hat-trick \"Hazard was unbelievable, unplayable,\" pundit Tony Cottee told Sky Sports News. \"It was one of those days. Every time he got the ball he made things happen. \"The equalising goal was fantastic, his second had a little bit of luck, and the penalty was undoubtedly a penalty.\" What's next? Chelsea travel to Greece to face PAOK in the Europa League on Thursday night at 7.45pm, while Cardiff are back in action next Saturday when they host Manchester City at 3pm."},{"date": "15/09/2019",

"report": "2:58 Huddersfield 0-1 Crystal Palace Huddersfield 0-1 Crystal Palace Wilfried Zaha handed Crystal Palace a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Huddersfield Town at the John Smith's Stadium. Zaha was a doubt for the game after missing Palace's 2-0 defeat against Southampton with a groin injury, but he was fit enough to start and ultimately proved the difference between the two sides. Huddersfield dominated for large periods but they lacked a killer edge in front of goal, with Steve Mounie missing a great chance with a header in the first half, and Aaron Mooy rattling the post with a volley in the second. Victory for Palace means they have ended their run of league defeats while Huddersfield still await their first victory of the season. Player ratings Huddersfield: Lossl (6), Hadergjonaj (6), Schindler (6), Zanka (6), Kongolo (7), Lowe (8), Billing (7), Mooy (9), Kachunga (6), Van La Parra (6), Mounie (4) Subs: Diakhaby (6), Depoitre (N/A), Mbenza (N/A) Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Wan-Bissaka (8), Tomkins (7), Sakho (7), Van Aanholt (6), Kouyate (6), Milivojevic (7), McArthur (6), Townsend (6), Ayew (6), Zaha (8) Subs: Jeffrey Schlupp (N/A) Man of the match: Aaron Mooy Huddersfield's gameplan throughout revolved around spraying the ball out wide to their wing-backs and whipping in crosses, and it almost worked perfectly after 17 minutes. The influential Mooy found Chris Lowe on the left wing and his inch-perfect cross was met by Mounie in the middle but he could only direct the ball over the bar with Wayne Hennessey completely stranded. Tempers started to flare midway through the first half with Lee Mason reaching for his pocket three times to caution James McArthur, Zanka Jorgensen and Zaha in quick succession. Zanka's yellow came for a cynical foul on Zaha and moments later the Palace talisman let his frustrations get the better of him by barging into Florent Hadergjonaj long after the ball had been played. That incident resulted in Zaha emerging as enemy No 1 in the eyes of the Huddersfield fans but he soon silenced their boos with a sensational solo strike. After playing a one-two with Jordan Ayew in Huddersfield's half, Zaha embarked on a slaloming run down the left before skipping inside Hadergjonaj and bending an unstoppable shot into the far corner from an acute angle. Team news David Wagner made one change to the team that drew 1-1 with Everton as Elias Kachunga came into the side in place of Adama Diakhaby.Roy Hodgson was handed a major boost as Wilfried Zaha was passed fit to start after missing the 2-0 defeat to Southampton with a groin injury. James Tomkins also returned with Christian Benteke and Martin Kelly making way. To their credit, Huddersfield responded well to going behind and continued to dominate proceedings after the interval. Right on the hour mark they went agonisingly close to equalising when Mooy re-adjusted his body before firing a technically perfect volley onto the foot of the post with Hennessey saving the subsequent rebound attempt from Hadergjonaj. Palace always looked a threat on the counter-attack and they could have settled it when Andros Townsend led a quick break, before teeing up Ayew who miscued his shot with Zaha blazing the loose ball well over the bar. Soon after, McArthur missed another good opportunity on the counter after being teed up by Zaha while Cheikhou Kouyate had a goal ruled out for a foul on Lossl. With virtually the last kick of the game, Phillip Billing volleyed towards goal but McArthur toe-poked it just wide to ensure that Palace came away with a vital three points. Opta stats The away team has won all three of the Premier League meetings between Huddersfield and Crystal Palace, making it the fixture with the best 100% record for away team victories in the competition's history. Crystal Palace have won all four of their top-flight away matches against Huddersfield, keeping a clean sheet on each trip, their best such 100% away record against a single team in the top tier of English football. Huddersfield are without a win in nine Premier League games (D4 L5), their longest run without a victory in league football since September 2015 (10). Huddersfield have lost their last three games against Crystal Palace in all competitions for the first time ever. Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha has netted eight goals in his last 10 Premier League games, as many as in his previous 44. Since the start of last season, Crystal Palace have averaged 1.5 points per game when Zaha has played (33 games), compared to no points when he has been involved (10 games). Man of the match - Aaron Mooy Wilfried Zaha's goal was the only moment of attacking quality in the game and he, along with fellow Crystal Palace academy graduate Aaron Wan-Bissaka, was the pick of the players for the visitors. However, while Palace won the game, they didn't actually play that well. Huddersfield performed well without managing to score and at the heart of everything positive that they did was Aaron Mooy in midfield. Wilfried Zaha battles for the ball with Aaron Mooy The Australian ran the game for the hosts, pinging diagonal passes out to both flanks to initiate attacks and linking the play from back to front. He went closest to scoring for his side too with a textbook volley that hit the post and he didn't deserve to be on the losing side. The managers David Wagner The performance was good but sometimes you don't get what you deserve. I think for sure this was our best performance of the season. The players created so many good opportunities, more than we've done in the first five games combined. Apart from the last minutes when we gave some counter-attacks away, I think we controlled it defensively as well and limited them. They had one magical moment from Wilf Zaha but we should've defended better, we've seen goals like this from him before so I'm very disappointed with that situation, it was easy to avoid. Roy Hodgson He [Wilfried Zaha] was a constant threat, wasn't he? He was very close to scoring more than one goal especially early in the second half when we broke behind them on a few occasions but it's nice that he's the match-winner and it's nice that the match-winner was such a good one. 2:51 Hodgson: Zaha is vitally important Hodgson: Zaha is vitally important He's vitally important to us, there's no doubt about that. He worries the opposition, his pace and his ability on the ball gives us that constant threat on the counter-attack if we are leading and the other team are trying to throw bodies at us. This year what he's done apart from his excellent dribbling skills and ability to go past people, he's adding goals to his game. That's yet another goal for him this season and we need people to start chipping in otherwise we'll be relying on him a little too much. The pundit - Matt Le Tissier \"Huddersfield were so dominant in that first half, and that Palace goal was so far against the run of play, but it was just a moment of magic from Zaha. You could say Huddersfield were unfortunate, but they did have the opportunities. Putting the ball in the back of the net seems so difficult at the minute. \"When you've got someone who can do something a little different, you've always got a chance when you keep a clean sheet. Zaha was the standout footballer on that pitch today.\" What's next? Huddersfield are in action again next Saturday when they travel to the King Power to take on Leicester City. Crystal Palace are also playing that day as they entertain Newcastle United at Selhurst Park."},{"date": "15/09/2019", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53307, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Ederson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aymeric Laporte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["67"]}, {"name": "Bernardo Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["74"]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["54"]}, {"name": "Leroy Sané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "IIkay Gündogan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["67"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["74"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Fernando de Jesus", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["54"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oleksandr Zinchenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Foden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arijanet Muric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Fulham", "lineup": [{"name": "Marcus Bettinelli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cyrus Christie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Denis Odoi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alfie Mawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jean Seri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["56"]}, {"name": "Kevin McDonald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stefan Johansen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luciano Vietto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["69"]}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Schürrle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Floyd Ayité", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["69"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maxime Le Marchand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timothy Fosu-Mensah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André-Frank Zambo Anguissa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["56"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:58 Man City 3-0 Fulham Man City 3-0 Fulham Leroy Sane scored on his return as Manchester City maintained their imperious Premier League home record in a 3-0 victory over Fulham. Sane (2) took just 90 seconds to bag on his first start of the season as City were in a slick mood and had too much for the naive Londoners, who tried to go toe to toe with the champions in the early stages. David Silva (21) scored on his 350th appearance for the club and Raheem Sterling (47) completed the scoring in a game where City were scintillating to watch but wasteful in front of goal. City have now won 18 of their last 20 Premier League home games and move to within two points of Liverpool and Chelsea at the top of the table. Player Ratings Man City: Ederson (7), Walker (6), Otamendi (7), Laporte (7), Delph (8), Fernandinho (8), D.

Fernandinho robbed Jean Michael Seri in midfield with just two minutes gone and surged down the left before crossing for Sane, who tapped home from two yards. Sterling, who gave Fulham youngster Ryan Sessegnon a torrid time at left-back, had an effort pushed onto the crossbar on 15 minutes but Silva doubled the lead shortly after. Team news Leroy Sane was handed his first start of the season as Pep Guardiola made four changes with Fabian Delph, Bernando Silva and Nicholas Otamendi coming in. Benjamin Mendy was left out the squad. Meanwhile, Fulham made three changes from the 2-2 with Brighton. Cyrus Christie, Stefan Johansen and Ryan Sessegnon returned to the side. He was on hand to thump home from close range for his 50th Premier League goal after Sergio Aguero's shot was blocked into Silva's path. A couple of long-range efforts from Andre Schurrle were all Fulham could muster in response as City continued to break forward down the wings at will. The third goal came via that route as Aguero stole a march down the right and flashed in a low cross which Sterling prodded home for his third of season. Raheem Sterling celebrates scoring against Fulham for Manchester City Aguero limped off with what seemed a knee injury midway through the half and his replacement Gabriel Jesus wasted multiple chances in the final quarter. Bernardo Silva also somehow fired over from 10 yards - it mattered little for this game but City will need to sharpen up their finishing as the season progresses. England watch Raheem Sterling was straight back into first-team action after pulling out of the England squad with a back injury. He looked full of energy as he gave the Fulham back four a torrid time but will have been disappointed only to have scored one having had five presentable chances in front of goal. Fabian Delph was impressive at left-back but Kyle Walker was subdued, maybe affected by sustaining an early eye injury. For Fulham, Ryan Sessegnon was given the run-around by Sterling at full-back and looked out of his depth in that position against high-class opposition. Opta stats Courtesy of their victory over Fulham, Manchester City have won six consecutive Premier League matches against a single London team for the first time ever. Fulham have registered their second worst-ever start to a Premier League campaign after five games (4pts, -5 goal difference); only bettering 2011/12 (3 pts, -3 goal difference). City are unbeaten in the Premier League against newly promoted sides in their last 34 home meetings (W30 D4), since losing to Reading 0-2 in 2007. Sane has had a hand in 18 goals in his last 16 Premier League games at the Etihad Stadium (6 goals, 12 assists). Aguero (68) has scored more goals in all competitions for Manchester City under Pep Guardiola than Sterling (36). Man of the match: David Silva The 32-year-old is showing no signs of slowing down as once again he turned in a mesmerising performance of passing and moving. Everything City conjured up down the left flank was through Silva, who linked with Fabian Delph and Sane impeccably. Nobody made more passes (62) in the opposition half than the Spaniard and he showed his ruthlessness in front of goal by firing home his only shot of the game. Man-of-the-match David Silva showed his ruthlessness in front of goal Pundit reaction - Paul Merson \"Sane gives City real width. That's what they want as he opens the game up for them. When he stays out wide, the two Silvas can get on the ball and do their stuff. \"Sane's attitude was good, he scored a goal. He must have been devastated by not going to the World Cup, he looked a shoo-in and was on all the billboards in Germany. That would have affected him, but fair play to him. \"City played the whole of the second half in third gear. That's why I think they have the edge over Liverpool, who were taken to the wire against Brighton. I think that takes its toll later in the season.\" What's next? City open their quest for Champions League glory on Wednesday against Lyon before travelling to Cardiff next weekend. Meanwhile, Fulham host Watford in the Saturday lunchtime game next weekend, which is live on Sky Sports."},{"date": "15/09/2019", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52165,

Newcastle 1-2 Arsenal Arsenal secured a third successive Premier League win under Unai Emery with a 2-1 victory over Newcastle on Saturday. After a lacklustre first-half at St James' Park, Granit Xhaka's stunning free-kick (49) broke the deadlock before Mesut Ozil (58) doubled his side's advantage on his 200th appearance for the club. Substitute Ciaran Clark pulled one back in stoppage time (90+1) but it proved to be too little too late for the hosts as Emery's side held on for all three points. Victory sees the Gunners move up to seventh in the table, while Newcastle, who have just one point from their opening five games, stay 18th. Plater ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Yedlin (6), Fernandez (7), Lascelles (6), Dummett (6), Murphy (6), Diame (6), Hayden (6), Ritchie (7), Perez (7), Joselu (6).

Subs: Torreira (7), Mkhitaryan (6), Welbeck (6). Man of the match: Sokratis Papastathopoulos Rafael Benitez's approach had been questioned earlier in the season but against Arsenal, Newcastle started on the front foot. In the ninth minute, Ayoze Perez's pass released Jacob Murphy in behind Hector Bellerin but the winger's cut back could not pick out a team-mate as Xhaka cleared. Murphy had the chance to redeem himself in the 20th minute as Shkodran Mustafi's slip let him in, but Sokratis got his central defensive partner out of trouble with an excellent covering tackle. The visitors slowly grew into the game and the pace of Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was causing the home side problems. Arsenal's best chance though fell to Aaron Ramsey, who, with support waiting, sliced a cross high over the crossbar after being played in by Lacazette. Mesut Ozil celebrates scoring for Arsenal against Newcastle Emery reacted to the Gunners' poor first-half display by sending on Lucas Torreira for Matteo Guendouzi, and it was a move that paid off as his side took the lead four minutes after the restart. Referee Lee Probert handed the Gunners a free-kick 25 yards from goal after Aubameyang was adjudged to have been clipped by Federico Fernandez and Xhaka curled a left-foot free-kick past Martin Dubravka and into the top corner. The visitors extended their advantage nine minutes later after Lacazette's shot had been blocked, Ozil steered the rebound past Dubravka. Team news Rafael Benitez made three changes from the side that lost 2-1 at Manchester City. Izaac Hayden, Matt Ritchie and Joselu replaced Ciaran Clark, Ki Sung-Yeung and Salomon Rondon, while Jonjo Shelvey was named on the bench after returning from injury. Arsenal were unchanged from their 3-2 win at Cardiff before the international break. Petr Cech kept his place in goal with Bernd Leno remaining on the bench, while Mesut Ozil also remained in the starting line-up. Benitez sent on Kenedy and Yoshi Muto as he looked to rescue something from the game, but it was Clark who pulled what proved to be a consolation goal back with a stoppage-time header from Fernandez's cross. Opta stats Arsenal have won consecutive Premier League away games for the first time since May 2017. The Gunners have opened the scoring in each of their last 11 Premier League games against Newcastle - only against Southampton have they had a longer run of scoring the first goal in the competition (13 between 1999 and 2012). One point from five games represents Newcastle's joint-worst start to a Premier League campaign (also 1999-00). Arsenal have failed to keep a clean sheet in any of their first five games to a top-flight season since the 1988-89 campaign. All 10 of Arsenal's Premier League goals this season (including own-goals) have been scored by different players. All four of Granit Xhaka's Premier League goals for Arsenal have been from outside the box. Xhaka's opener was Arsenal's first goal from a direct free-kick in any competition since Alexis Sanchez's strike against Middlesbrough in April 2017. Notes for Southgate Gareth Southgate was in attendance at St James’ Park but it was a frustrating afternoon for the England manager. Jamaal Lascelles picked up an injury in the warm up and was replaced at half-time, while Jonjo Shelvey was an unused substitute on his return from injury. The Pundit - Phil Thompson \"In the first half Newcastle dominated, but you worried for them because they didn't get a goal. Arsenal got their passing movement going and the game changed with Xhaka's goal. 4:39 Thommo surprised by Benitez' subs Thommo surprised by Benitez' subs \"It was like switching the light off for Newcastle - a procession. Arsenal players started to want the ball, and it was shocking because Newcastle just gave the ball away. That must have infuriated Benitez.\" Man of the Match - Sokratis Papastathopoulos Sokratis Papastathopoulos in action during the match Arsenal have been crying out for a no-nonsense defender and Sokratis looks fitting that bill for Emery's side. At St James' Park, he made a couple of key interventions. The first was a crucial last-ditch tackle which got Mustafi out of trouble when his slip had let Jacob Murphy in. The second was another brilliantly timed tackle in the centre of the field which stopped an extremely promising Newcastle counter-attack completely in its tracks. He also won countless headers as Arsenal weathered an early storm to secure all three points. What's next? Newcastle are next in action against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in the Premier League next Saturday (3pm). For Arsenal, they have Europa League commitments on Thursday (8pm) against Vorskla at the Emirates Stadium before hosting Everton, live on Sky Sports, next weekend on Renault Super Sunday."},{"date":

Manchester United inflicted a first defeat of the Premier League season on Watford as they won 2-1 at Vicarage Road. The Hornets had won all four of their league games before the international break, but two goals in three first-half minutes from Romelu Lukaku (35) and Chris Smalling (38) ultimately sealed the win for United, who had Nemanja Matic sent off in injury time. Andre Gray pulled a goal back for Watford in the 65th minute, but they could not find another as their winning run was brought to a halt. United ended the game with 10 men as Matic was shown a second yellow card after a foul on Will Hughes in the third minute of injury time, but held on for their second win in a row after two league defeats, and move up to eighth. Player ratings Watford: Foster (7), Janmaat (6), Cathcart (7), Kabasele (7), Holebas (7), Doucoure (7), Capoue (6), Hughes (6), Pereyra (6), Gray (7), Deeney (7). Subs: Femenia (5), Masina (n/a), Success (n/a). Man Utd: De Gea (7), Valencia (7), Smalling (7), Lindelof (7), Young (7), Pogba (8), Fellaini (8), Matic (5), Sanchez (5), Lukaku (7), Lingard (6). Subs: Martial (6), McTominay (n/a), Bailly (n/a). Man of the match: Marouane Fellaini. Watford began well and tested David de Gea in the 16th minute after a poor attempted clearance from Marouane Fellaini saw Troy Deeney take aim with a fierce drive, but the United goalkeeper made a superb, leaping save to keep him out. Ben Foster was excellent in the first half despite the scoreline, and made a wonderful save from Alexis Sanchez in the 32nd minute as a long ball from De Gea was put into the Chile forward's path by Lukaku. He then dribbled down to the right of the area before taking aim, but Foster was equal to it with a fingertip stop at the near post. Team news Watford named the same matchday 18 from their win against Tottenham two weeks ago. Manchester United made one change with the injured Luke Shaw replaced by Ashley Young. But he was not able to keep United out three minutes later. Young whipped a cross into the area after his initial free-kick was played back into his path, with Lukaku waiting at the goal mouth to bundle the ball home with his stomach. The Watford players were calling for handball but there was no case to answer for referee Mike Dean. The goal spurred United into action as Paul Pogba twice tested Foster before Smalling scored their second in the 38th minute. Young's corner was headed toward the six-yard box by Fellaini before Smalling controlled with his chest and hit a volley on the turn to send the ball past the goalkeeper at point blank range. The second half saw few chances but did have a goal as Gray pulled one back for Watford in the 65th minute. Abdoulaye Doucoure cut the ball back for the striker at the top of the area, who had plenty of space and time to sweep a fine strike into the back of the net and give the hosts hope of a result. Romelu Lukaku celebrates scoring for Manchester United with Jesse Lingard It was a frantic finish at Vicarage Road too, with a thunderous Doucoure volley forcing a good save from De Gea on the stroke of 90 minutes, before United went down to 10 men. Matic tackled Hughes on the right flank, and received a second yellow card after an earlier challenge on Doucoure also saw him booked, seeing him sent off. De Gea kept United ahead in the closing stages, pushing away Christian Kabasele's header from a free-kick before also seeing away a corner as the visitors held on for all three points. Opta stats Watford have lost 13 of their last 14 matches against Manchester United in league competition, with their solitary win coming at Vicarage Road in September 2016 (3-1). Jose Mourinho has won six of his seven Premier League encounters with Watford (L1), including each of the last four. Manchester United's Chris Smalling has ended up on the winning side in all 11 Premier League games in which he has scored, the joint-best such record in the competition (also 11 games for Ryan Babel). Manchester United have picked up a red card in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since September 2014. Notes for Southgate Will Hughes had a quiet game, and would not have done too much to put himself into Gareth Southgate's thinking. Chris Smalling did well and scored a brilliant goal, while Ashley Young had a good game in place of Luke Shaw. Jesse Lingard was not at his flowing best, and will feel that he could have done better. The managers Javi Gracia: \"I think the first half, they played much better than us. They had more possession, more chances and they played better. \"The most important thing for me is that we made a very big effort again. We tried to win, but if we have to lose, we have to lose like today in this way, fighting until the end, showing all the time our spirit and character. Our fans, they have to be proud of us and we have to make an effort and I think the players have done it.\" Jose Mourinho believes his side could have added to their tally in the first half Jose Mourinho: \"I am very happy with the points. I am very happy with something that represents for me the spirit of the team, but I feel a bit frustrated because we had everything in the first half to kill the game,. \"I think if we play the second half the way we did in the last part of the first half, we would be in this moment with a completely different result and without the last 10 minutes.\" Man of the match - Marouane Fellaini He may not be the most popular figure, but Fellaini played an important part in United's win. He put in a shift at both ends, and had a hand in both goals. Indeed, he picked up the assist for the second after his knockdown was scored by Smalling. Troy Deeney and Chris Smalling battle for the ball at Vicarage Road He also helped out defensively, which was much needed at times, and looked solid when called upon to help out at the back. What's next? Watford will be live on Sky Sports next weekend when they take on Fulham in the Premier League at Craven Cottage. Man Utd get their Champions League campaign underway on Wednesday when they travel to Young Boys in Switzerland (8pm) before hosting Wolves in the Premier League on Saturday."},{"date": "02/09/2019",

"2:58 Cardiff 2-3 Arsenal Cardiff 2-3 Arsenal Alexandre Lacazette's 81st-minute winner saw Arsenal edge out a spirited Cardiff side 3-2 for Unai Emery's first away victory as head coach. Shkodran Mustafi headed the Gunners in front after 12 minutes from an Aaron Ramsey corner, but Cardiff had several chances to level before Víctor Camarasa turned Joe Bennett's cross home at the second attempt in first-half injury-time to finally net their first goal of the season. The goals kept flowing after half-time with a brilliant curled Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang finish from outside the box (62) putting Arsenal back ahead, before Danny Ward levelled from a Sean Morrison flick at a free-kick (70). But Emery's first away success was secured nine minutes from time when Lacazette swivelled and fired a rocket of a shot inside Neil Etheridge's near post. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (6), Manga (6), Morrison (7), Bamba (5), Bennett (7), Ralls (6), Hoilett (6), Arter (6), Camarasa (7), Reid (7), Ward (7). Subs: Zahore (n/a), Madine (n/a). Arsenal: Cech (5), Bellerin (6), Sokratis (6), Mustafi (7), Monreal (7), Xhaka (6), Guendouzi (6), Ramsey (6), Aubameyang (8), Lacazette (8), Ozil (5). Subs: Torreira (6), Welbeck (n/a), Mkhitaryan (n/a). Man of the match: Alexandre Lacazette Alexandre Lacazette picked a good time to score his first goal of the season Harry Arter should have put Cardiff ahead inside seven minutes as the hosts stifled the space Arsenal wanted to play out from the back, but, after intercepting a wayward Petr Cech pass to Matteo Guendouzi, he blazed over when unmarked on the edge of the area. Arsenal showed more clinical finishing when they took the lead soon after, as Ramsey's corner was met with a bullet header from Mustafi to leave Etheridge helpless in the Cardiff goal. Danny Ward celebrates after netting Cardiff's second equaliser Arter had another good chance from Morrison's knock-down but could not keep his shot down again, but on the stroke of half-time Cardiff finally broke their goalscoring duck. Granit Xhaka's lazy cross-field ball was picked off by Junior Hoilett and Bennett's cross took a nick but fell kindly for Camarasa, who fired high into the net as Cardiff became the last of the 92 teams in the domestic football pyramid to register their first goal. After half-time Arsenal began to win the midfield battle, but for all their possession they struggled to test Cardiff until Lacazette's deft back-flick found Aubameyang's run and he curled a beautiful strike into the far corner. Sean Morrison battles for possession with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Team news Cardiff made two changes from their draw at Huddersfield, recalling Bobby Reid for Kenneth Zahore and giving Danny Ward a first Premier League start ahead with Nathaniel Mendez-Laing injured. Arsenal started Alexandre Lacazette for the first time this season, while Mesut Ozil also returned from illness. Cardiff instantly responded, having found their shooting boots, and Morrison was again used from a free-kick, this time to nod back across goal where Ward was waiting to head in off the far post. Just as Cardiff looked like they might earn an impressive point, Lucas Torreira's pass into the box found Lacazette on the turn and he struck a shot so powerful Etheridge barely moved as it whistled inside his near post. Cardiff had a glorious chance to level in the final minute of stoppage time but Morrison, at it again, headed over from a free-kick with Cech off his line. Aubameyang celebrates after scoring Arsenal's second goal Opta stats Arsenal have collected six points in their last three away Premier League games (W2 D0 L1), as many as in their previous 11 away games combined (W1 D3 L7). Cardiff are winless in six matches in all competitions (D3 L3), their worst run under Neil Warnock and worst since a run of eight in January and February 2015. Since his Premier League debut in February, only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (15) has scored more Premier League goals than Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (11). Victor Camarasa's goal for Cardiff ended a run of 415 minutes without scoring for the Bluebirds in league competition. All six of Shkodran Mustafi's Premier League goals have been scored via set-pieces (three from corners, three from free-kicks), with five of them headed goals. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's strike from outside the box ended his personal run of 76 consecutive goals from inside the box in club football - his last from outside the box before today was against Spurs for Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League in March 2016. Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette has been directly involved in seven goals in his last five Premier League starts (5 goals, 2 assists). Cardiff striker Danny Ward made his first Premier League start - 3,305 days after his first appearance in the competition for Bolton Wanderers in August 2009. Man of the match - Alexandre Lacazette He scored the winner, but Lacazette showed his other qualities in making Aubameyang's goal and creating three chances through the game, the second-highest figure of anyone on the pitch. He rewarded Emery for having the faith to give him a first start of the season in fine style, and led the line brilliantly throughout."},{"date": "02/09/2019", "arena": "Turf Moor", "attendance":

10-man Manchester United returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor. United looked on course for a routine victory when Lukaku headed them ahead on 27 minutes and doubled their tally with a close-range second a minute before half-time. But after Paul Pogba had a second-half penalty saved by Joe Hart, United had to play the final 19 minutes a man down when Marcus Rashford was shown a straight red card for head-butting Phil Bardsley. However, three days on from their agonising Europa League exit against Olympiakos, Burnley showed little sign of mounting a late comeback, Sam Vokes' header stoppage-time header all the Clarets could muster by way of a response. Instead, United ground out the win - which lifts them to 10th in the table - to ease the pressure on beleaguered manager Jose Mourinho. Burnley remain second from bottom after their third successive defeat. Player ratings Burnley: Hart (7), Taylor (5), Tarkowski (5), Mee (5), Bardsley (5), Lennon (5), Cork (5), McNeil (6), Westwood (5), Wood (6), Hendrick (5). Subs: Vokes (6), Barnes (5), Vydra (5). Man Utd: De Gea (7), Valencia (7), Lindelof (7), Smalling (7), Shaw (7), Matic (7), Fellaini (7), Sanchez (7), Pogba (7), Lingard (8), Lukaku (8). Subs: Bailly (n/a), Herrera (6), Rashford (3). Man of the Match: Romelu Lukaku. United's fluid front three of Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez and Jesse Lingard tormented Burnley in the opening exchanges, with the fleet-footed England international creating two clear opening inside 10 minutes. With barely two minutes on the clock, Lingard wriggled clear of the Clarets centre-backs but flashed a shot wide of the post - eight minutes later he curled an effort from the edge of the box over. Romelu Lukaku celebrates scoring against Burnley Lingard remained a threat but it was his strike partners that combined for United's opener as Sanchez was allowed to pick out Lukaku with a cross from the left, and the Belgium international headed his second goal of the season beyond Hart from six yards. It was no more than United deserved and they could have had a second had it not been for Hart, who raced off his line to smother Lukaku on 36 minutes - but it was not long until the Burnley goalkeeper's defences were breached again. Team news Both managers made three changes on the back of Premier League defeats against Fulham and Tottenham respectively. Charlie Taylor, Dwight McNeil and Phil Bardsley came in for Burnley while Victor Lindelof, Alexis Sanchez and Marouane Fellaini – making his 250th Premier League appearance – were recalled into the United line-up. Lingard was involved again as his shot ricocheted around the Burnley area, striking Ben Mee and the head of Ashley Westwood before falling perfectly for the lurking Lukaku, who slotted home to double United's lead on 44 minutes. With United meandering to victory, the game burst into life on 68 minutes as substitute Rashford drew a foul from Aaron Lennon in the area, but Pogba's penalty after his now-trademark run-up was parried away by Hart. Things took a turn for the worse for United three minutes later when Rashford was given his marching orders by referee Jon Moss for reacting angrily to a Bardsley tackle and throwing his head into the face of the Burnley defender. Marcus Rashford saw red for head-butting Phil Bardsley But despite Burnley's best effort, United had a measure of control despite falling down to 10 men and saw out the victory with relative ease, Vokes' glancing header the closest the Clarets came to reducing the arrears. Opta stats Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has won each of his four Premier League away games at Turf Moor (P4 W4), including all three in charge of the Red Devils. Burnley have won just one of their last 18 top-flight meetings with Manchester United (D8 L9), with that victory coming in their first ever Premier League meeting back in August 2009 (1-0). Among each of the current Premier League teams, Burnley are on the longest winless run of any side in the competition (nine games - D3 L6). Manchester United have won each of their last 24 Premier League matches in which they've scored the opening goal. Marcus Rashford was shown his first red card for Manchester United, while also being the first substitute to be sent off for the Red Devils in the Premier League since Marouane Fellaini against Hull City in May 2015. The managers 1:46 Dyche credits United’s performance Dyche credits United’s performance Sean Dyche: \"Well, I think we're finding our feet a bit. They've had a lot of challenges these players. Its game 10 for us of a squad of roughly 17 at any given time. We were down to 16 on Thursday and that's a lot of football for anyone in this early part of the season. It's still physically a task. This two-week period now gives us a chance to rest and work, but certainly refresh ourselves for the challenge which is the Premier League.\" 3:39 Mourinho: We should score 6, 7 or 8! Mourinho: We should score 6, 7 or 8! Jose Mourinho: \"The three points were an important thing, the quality of the performance and happiness of the team is an Old Trafford response - the way Old Trafford reacted to the boys in the Spurs defeat was important. Today the fans were fantastic from the first minute, but Old Trafford is a moment to remember.\" Man of the Match - Romelu Lukaku Mourinho has really been up against after United's worst start to a Premier League season since 1992. But just when his manager needed it most, Lukaku rekindled his touch in front of goal. The Belgian's first league brace since his United debut in the competition back in August 2017 put the visitors in control, and gave Mourinho something to cheer about after a fortnight of angst at Old Trafford. What's next? Both sides resume their Premier League campaign after the international break. On September 15, United travel to Watford (5.30pm), while Burnley make the trip to newly-promoted Wolves the following day (1.30pm), live on Sky Sports Premier League."},{"date": "02/09/2019",

Watford 2-1 Tottenham Watford came from behind to maintain their 100 per cent start to the season as two quickfire headers gave them a 2-1 win over Tottenham at Vicarage Road on Super Sunday. The first half was not one of the purists, but Spurs took the lead in the second through Abdoulaye Doucoure's own goal (54), and it would have been 1-1 in own goals had Toby Alderweireld's header not come off the bar at the other end shortly after. But Watford did equalise through Troy Deeney's cute header from Jose Holebas' superb free-kick (69), and shocked Spurs with another header as Craig Cathcart converted Holebas' corner from the left (76). Deeney celebrates scoring for Watford against Spurs Player ratings Watford: Foster (5), Janmaat (6), Cathcart (7), Kabasele (6), Holebas (7), Hughes (7), Capoue (6), Doucoure (5), Pereyra (6), Deeney (8), Gray (6) Subs: Success (6), Chalobah (NA), Mariappa (NA) Tottenham: Vorm (5), Trippier (6), Alderweireld (5), Vertonghen (6), Sanchez (5), Davies (5), Dembele (6), Moura (6), Alli (5), Eriksen (5), Kane (5) Subs: Llorente (NA), Winks (NA), Rose (NA) Man of the match: Troy Deeney The result ends Tottenham's own perfect start to the campaign, while Watford have won all four opening league games for only the second time in their history, and the first in the top flight. Watford worked the first chance of the game early on, spreading the ball out wide right to Daryl Janmaat, whose cross was headed over by Deeney piling in. But both sides were sloppy for the remainder of the half, getting into good positions and miscuing the final pass. Although a goal did come nine minutes after the restart, it summed the game up to that point. After a mix-up between Watford goalkeeper Ben Foster and defender Christian Kabasele, Lucas Moura's cut-back was bizarrely diverted into the bottom corner by Doucoure's midriff. Team news Watford stuck with the same side that won against Crystal Palace last weekend, while there were three changes for Tottenham from their win at Old Trafford. Lloris was out with a thigh injury so Vorm started in goal, while Sanchez and Davies started in place of Rose and Dier. Deeney (left) and Jan Vertonghen battle for the ball There was almost an own goal at the other end after Deeney got the better of Davinson Sanchez at the right byline, but his cross was headed onto the crossbar by Alderweireld. Watford had woken up, and got their leveller moments later through Deeney, who got up well before glancing a header into the bottom left corner from Holebas' dangerous right-wing set-piece. The equaliser gave the hosts energy, and they duly took the lead seven minutes later through defender Cathcart, rising highest among a swamp of players to turn a header past Michel Vorm. Sub Fernando Llorente should have done better as the ball dropped to his feet at close range late on, before Harry Kane nodded inches over from Kieran Trippier's ball having climbed well as Spurs failed to grab a point. Opta stats Deeney became the fourth player to score in 100 matches for Watford in all competitions, after Tommy Barnett, Ross Jenkins and Luther Blissett. This was the first time that Tottenham lost a game in which they had been leading in the Premier League since November 2016 against eventual champions Chelsea, ending a run of 48 league matches without defeat when taking the lead at any stage. This was Watford's first league win over Tottenham since May 1987, ending a run of 12 league games without a victory (D4 L8). Since Javier Gracia took over as Watford manager in January, no side has won more home Premier League games than the Hornets (seven, level with Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd and Spurs). The managers Javi Gracia: \"I am, very happy, like all of the Watford fans. We are enjoying the moment, to win four games in a row is not easy, and we try to keep our level in the next games. 2:38 Javi Gracia is enjoying the vibe at Watford at present Javi Gracia is enjoying the vibe at Watford at present \"For me the atmosphere we have in this moment, in the team, the players playing and not playing, they are enjoying a lot, feeling the supporters enjoying the games. For me that's the most important.\" Mauricio Pochettino: \"I think if you want to win, show you are contenders, you cannot say we are going to play for 45 minutes and 0-0 and just win it in the second half. 3:45 An unhappy Mauricio Pochettino has demanded more from his side An unhappy Mauricio Pochettino has demanded more from his side \"We need to do more, show more aggressiveness, because we have the quality. We score and go in front, and then in two set-pieces we concede two goals. If you want to be a contender, to be at the top, you cannot concede this type of action.\" The pundit Tottenham have a huge game after the international break as they host Liverpool, live on Sky Sports, and Graeme Souness thinks the response will be key. Deeney equalises in the second half for Watford \"Everyone can be a big personality in the dressing room when you are winning, but a punch on the nose like this will find out if you are a proper team. Can you brush the criticism away and deal with the disappointment? Whether it's the biggest game of the season or one of the less-fancied teams you do what you have to do to get back on track.\" Notes for Southgate Spurs' England contingent won't be flying as they head into the Nations League fixtures. Kane was starved up front, Alli showed some signs in the first half but ultimately struggled to make an impact, and Trippier played extremely high up the right flank but his delivery was missing. After a promising start to all three's seasons, this will be painful. Man of the match - Troy Deeney Even during a dull first half, Deeney threw himself about in both boxes, and led like a skipper in the second half. He got himself involved in a whopping 23 duels - 10 more than any other Watford player - winning most of them, and got the goal his performance deserved. \"A proper captain's performance from Deeney,\" said Alan Smith on the gantry. \"He led and controlled his players for 90 minutes.\" What's next? Watford now host Man Utd on Saturday, September 15 at 5.30pm, while Spurs host Liverpool on the same day, live on Sky Sports Premier League at 12.30pm at Wembley."},{"date": "01/09/2019", "arena":

Saturday and maintain their perfect start to the Premier League season. The visitors led thanks to Sadio Mane's well-taken 10th-minute strike - the Senegalese's fourth league goal of the season - before Roberto Firmino's downward header doubled their advantage on the stroke of half-time. However, Rachid Ghezzal - on his first start for the Foxes - took advantage of an awful error by Alisson, who got caught in possession, to give the hosts hope just past the hour-mark. Klopp: I knew a mistake was coming Puel: Second half merited more Liverpool stay top of the table having won their first four league matches for the first time since 1990, while Claude Puel's men remain on six points after a second defeat of the campaign. Player ratings Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Ricardo Pereira (5), Morgan (5), Maguire (5), Chilwell (8), Mendy (6), Ndidi (8), Albrighton (6), Maddison (8), Gray (6), Ghezzal (7) Subs: Amartey (6), Iheanacho (7), Okazaki (6) Liverpool: Alisson (6), Alexander-Arnold (6), Gomez (9), van Dijk (7), Robertson (7), Wijnaldum (6), Henderson (6), Milner (6), Salah (6), Firmino (7), Mane (7) Subs: Matip (6), Keita (6), Shaqiri (6) Man of the match: Joe Gomez Jurgen Klopp's side arrived at a sun-drenched King Power in buoyant mood having won their opening three top-flight games without conceding, and it showed in the early exchanges. The visitors spurned two gilt-edged chances after just five minutes when first Firmino, who had breezed behind a static Harry Maguire, failed to beat Kasper Schmeichel from close range before Mo Salah inexplicably side-footed the rebound wide of the gaping goal. Sadio Mane (right) opened the scoring at the King Power Stadium However, those misses were soon forgotten as Liverpool made the breakthrough after a storming run down the left by Andy Robertson, who bulldozed his way through Ricardo's flimsy challenge. The Scotland international then found Mane on the edge of the area and after the forward evaded Maguire's tackle, he beat Schmeichel with a toe-poked effort into the bottom corner of the net. Leicester could have drawn level midway through the first half, only for Alisson to palm away Demarai Gray's shot when one on one with the goalkeeper and just as the hosts started to build up a head of steam, Liverpool struck again. Rachid Ghezzal (right) pulled a goal back for Leicester after a mistake by Alisson James Milner swung in a corner from the right and Firmino escaped the attentions of James Maddison to plant a header just out of Schmeichel's grasp as the forward got off the mark for the season. The home side came out all guns blazing after the break in search of the goal to get them back in the contest, and they got it thanks to a horrible gaffe from Liverpool's new £67m 'keeper. Team news Jamie Vardy served the last of a three-match ban, with Rachid Ghezzal replacing Kelechi Iheanacho and Mark Albrighton coming in for Daniel Amartey. Meanwhile, Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson made his first start of the season replacing Naby Keita in midfield. Van Dijk was pressurised into playing the ball back to the Brazilian, who got dispossessed by Kelechi Iheanacho as he tried to dribble his way past the substitute in the area. That mistake allowed the striker to tee up Ghezzal for a simple finish into the unguarded net. Luckily for Alisson and Liverpool, it did not cost them.

Only six players have more in the competition James Milner made his 100th Premier League appearance for Liverpool today (also 100+ games for Aston Villa and Man City). He is the fourth player to reach 100+ apps for three different Premier League teams alongside Gareth Barry, Rory Delap and Gary Speed Liverpool forward Sadio Mane has had a hand in four goals in his last four Premier League games against Leicester (two goals, two assists) Since the start of last season, no player has more league assists in the top four tiers than Leicester's James Maddison (16), level with Kevin De Bruyne and Barry Douglas Leicester are the first Premier League team to have three Algerian players score for them in the competition following Rachid Ghezzal's strike (also Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani) Notes for Southgate Left-back Ben Chilwell and midfielder James Maddison got England U21 call-ups in midweek, but on the basis of their energetic displays against Liverpool, Gareth Southgate may have missed a trick not promoting the duo to the seniors. However, the England boss will have been heartened by both Joe Gomez’s man-of-the-match performance and the return to action of Jordan Henderson. Man of the Match - Joe Gomez Gomez was once again a rock at the back for Liverpool at the King Power - highlighted by a magnificent goal-saving block to prevent James Maddison from scoring in the second half - with the silky-smooth central defender starting to form a formidable relationship with Virgil van Dijk for the club. The 21-year-old was recalled to the England squad in midweek after his injury-enforced absence from last summer's World Cup. On the basis of this near-faultless showing against Leicester, though, you can see just why Gareth Southgate was so desperate to bring the player back into the national fold. Demarai Gray shoots under pressure from Joe Gomez (right) Pundit - Jamie redknapp \"He [James Maddison] ran the game in a midfield full of international players and I was surprised he [Claude Puel] took him off with 10 minutes to go as I would have kept him on \"I thought he was fantastic, 21 years old, third or fourth game in the Premier League and he looks like he has been here for years. \"I was so impressed and was looking forward to watching him today. He is so comfortable on the ball, plays little one-twos, always looking to pass forward. \"And also the first to press, wins a lot of balls back high up the pitch and I just thought his imagination and passing in the midfield area, which was so congested, was just brilliant, it really was. \"He was so clever and unlucky not to get his goal, but it was a fantastic tackle by Joe Gomez, the little reverse ball.\" 0:19 Jamie Redknapp says James Maddison ran the game Jamie Redknapp says James Maddison ran the game Mangers Claude Puel: \"I am disappointed for my players because they gave their best. Our second half was fantastic with good quality, good pressing and a lot of chances. \"We have had a lot of opportunities to come back into this game. We came back with the first goal and we continued to attack. \"It was a shame in the first half to concede the second goal just before half-time, and it was difficult, of course, after to come back.\" 3:36 Puel: We deserved more Puel: We deserved more Jurgen Klopp: \"We all have to learn from that, not only himself. It was clear last week that it would happen one day - I didn't think it would happen the next week immediately. \"But we could have cleared the situation twice before, then they gave the ball back to him and yes, he could have shot it away as well. \"It was a bit that mood in the whole team, play it back, play it back, play it back and in the end, it's the goalie. He knows it was his mistake, of course, he's man enough to get that. \"I told him that the best game to do it was this one because we won it, so it's all fine now. We know that now we have ticked that box as well.\" 5:41 Klopp: No problem with Alisson Klopp: No problem with Alisson What's next? After the upcoming international break, Leicester take on Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday September 15, with the game getting underway at 3pm.

2-2 Fulham Brighton came from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Fulham thanks to Glenn Murray's double in an entertaining encounter at the Amex Stadium. Pascal Gross saw a penalty brilliantly saved by Marcus Bettinelli in the first half (25), and Fulham compounded the hosts' misery as Andre Schurrle scored his second in two games from a superb Jean Michael Seri assist (43). Fulham got a second as Aleksandar Mitrovic tucked away a rebound (62) for his fourth of the season, but Brighton halved the deficit through Murray just five minutes later as the hosts broke (67). Andre Schurrle gave Fulham a 1-0 lead Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (6), Montoya (6), Duffy (6), Dunk (7), Bong (6), Knockaert (7), Propper (8), Stephens (6), Gross (6), March (6), Murray (7) Subs: Bissouma (5), Locadia (5), Jahanbakhsh (5) Fulham: Bettinelli (8), Fosu-Mensah (6), Odoi (8), Mawson (6), Le Marchand (7), Seri (7), McDonald (6), Anguissa (6), Schurrle (7), Mitrovic (6), Vietto (6) Subs: Sessegnon (6), Johansen (5), Chambers (NA) Man of the match: Denis Odoi Mitrovic went from hero to zero in the other box, handling to give Brighton a penalty, which Murray buried to level things up (84). The result means Fulham and Brighton stay level on four points in 11th and 12th respectively, with one win in four games each. Brighton pressed early on, and won a penalty midway through the first half after Murray was clipped by Luciano Vietto. Gross struck it well, but Bettinelli tipped the ball away low to his right. Team news Two changes for Brighton after the defeat at Liverpool; Bissouma came out, replaced by Gross, and captain Dunk was back in for Balogun. For Fulham, Alfie Mawson made his first Premier League appearance for Fulham, with Joe Bryan dropping to the bench. Cairney was out with injury, so Anguissa came in for his debut. Jean Michael Seri and Anthony Knockaert battle for the ball Murray glanced a header inches wide from the resulting corner before Fulham took the lead through summer signing Schurrle, getting on the end of Seri's lifted through ball to swivel and hook past Mat Ryan from six yards. Solly March missed a golden chance to level after the break, slamming over the bar when one-on-one and Mitrovic made him pay at the other end. Wrestling to win the ball out wide, the Serb saw his low shot saved well by Ryan, but he duly tucked away the rebound, meaning he has scored more goals in English league football than any other player since his Fulham debut in February (16). Aleksandar Mitrovic (right) scored Fulham's second Brighton were soon back in it as Murray tucked under Bettinelli from Anthony Knockaert's unselfish pass after Fulham left too many players up the pitch, changing the mood inside the Amex. They sensed an equaliser and got it with six minutes remaining when Mitrovic controlled a dropping ball with his arm and Murray stepped up to slam into the top right corner from the spot. Sub Ryan Sessegnon nearly poked home a winner for the visitors, but Ryan got down well to thwart him as the points were shared. The managers Chris Hughton: \"[I'm] delighted, I think it's nothing less than we deserve. When you go 2-0 down at home against a good side at keeping possession, you've got to be grateful for what we've got. 2:31 Chris Hughton was delighted with the point, and had no qualms with Anthony Knockaert's reaction to being substituted Chris Hughton was delighted with the point, and had no qualms with Anthony Knockaert's reaction to being substituted \"I've got to give credit to our lads, we dropped our levels after we missed the penalty and that was the change in the momentum. But I thought after they scored their second the reaction was excellent, and we could have even won it at the end.\" Slavisa Jokanovic: \"We have mixed opinions about the game. We must be disappointed after playing professionally for one hour, offering a really solid performance at 2-0 up. \"This is our first point away from home, and this point probably shows our ambition, our way to be competitive, to be in all of the games. This isn't an easy place to come, it's the Premier League, and it can be hard for us if we make some kind of sloppy mistakes.\" 2:56 Slavisa Jokanovic could not hide his mixed feelings having been 2-0 up in the second half Slavisa Jokanovic could not hide his mixed feelings having been 2-0 up in the second half Opta stats Brighton have won points after going two goals down for the first time ever in the Premier League. Fulham are without a win in their last six league clashes with Brighton, drawing one and losing five. Brighton have been awarded 10 penalties in the Premier League since the start of last season (scoring seven), a joint-high along with Crystal Palace. Fulham goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli made his first penalty save in league competition since March 2015 vs Huddersfield. What would VAR have changed? What would VAR have changed?In the lead-up to Brighton's first penalty, Murray was in an offside position initially, but did not touch the ball as Knockaert then passed the ball back to him in a new phase of play. With the help of VAR, Murray may have been adjudged to have been involved in the play, with Fulham's defenders marking him, but it would have been close. It is likely VAR would not have reversed the decision to give Brighton a second penalty for Mitrovic's handball. Man of the match - Denis Odoi Particularly in the opening period as Brighton pressed hard, Fulham's defence were watertight, and much of it came down to Odoi. He made a team-high five clearances, and his passing accuracy was 89 per cent, with more passes than any other player (65). He showed attacking intent, too, bursting through the Brighton midfield on a couple of occasions and causing the back line unexpected issues. It was Alfie Mawson's Premier League debut for Fulham, but Odoi starred. What's next? Brighton go to Southampton on Monday Night Football on September 17, live on Sky Sports Premier League, while Fulham go to champions Manchester City on Saturday September 15, after the international

Substitute Pedro broke Bournemouth's resistance with a deflected effort in the 72nd minute before Eden Hazard fired in the second with five minutes remaining. Bournemouth had chances with the game at 0-0 but Callum Wilson and Nathan Ake both shot over the bar from excellent positions.

Bournemouth suffer their first defeat, and will be left to regret their two big missed chances by Wilson and Ake, having frustrated Chelsea for much of the game with their compact and well-organised defence. Chelsea had 81 per cent possession in their previous game against Newcastle, and it was a similar story in the first half against Bournemouth, who played with a back three and defended deep. Eden Hazard celebrates his second-half goal Chelsea struggled to create clear chances as Antonio Rudiger headed over from a corner and Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic shot wide. Wilson spurned a fantastic chance to score in the 30th minute when he turned a shot over the bar from 10 yards out from Sergio Rico's left-wing cross. Callum Wilson competes for a header with David Luiz Alonso almost broke the deadlock late in the half as he hit a scuffed effort against the post from the edge of the box. Alonso went close again after the break as his swept shot from inside the area was pushed away by Begovic. Former Chelsea defender Ake then missed from almost under the bar after a corner landed at his feet. Team news Chelsea made one change as Willian replaced Pedro. Summer signings Lerma and Rico made their first Premier League starts for Bournemouth in place of Brooks and Surman, while Francis replaced Daniels. Bournemouth's compact defence continued to frustrate Chelsea, but a fortunate deflection helped the hosts break the deadlock as Pedro's shot hit Steve Cook and spun past Begovic. Hazard then made sure of victory as he collected Alonso's lay-off and drilled a low shot past the goalkeeper. Opta stats Chelsea have won their first four games to a Premier League season for the sixth time, and first since 2014-15 under Jose Mourinho. Chelsea have had exactly 24 shots in both of their Premier League home games this season. Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri has become the sixth manager to win his first four Premier League games in charge, after Jose Mourinho, Guus Hiddink, Carlo Ancelotti, Pep Guardiola and Craig Shakespeare. Chelsea's Pedro has scored three goals in four Premier League games this season, more than he'd managed in his previous 23 in the competition (2). No player has been involved in more Premier League goals this season than Chelsea's Eden Hazard (4 - 2 goals, 2 assists). Eden Hazard has scored in all five of Chelsea's Premier League victories against Bournemouth. Man of the match - Eden Hazard It was hard going for Chelsea, but Hazard was their driving force. The Belgium international was typically threatening whenever he got on the ball, driving past challenges and creating spaces for team-mates. He made five key passes (more than any other player) and sealed the win with a clinical finish. The managers Maurizio Sarri: \"This kind of match usually you can win in the last 20-25 minutes. The match was very difficult against a very organised team. They defended very aggressively and the situation was not so easy.\" 2:11 Maurizio Sarri reflects on Chelsea's performance Maurizio Sarri reflects on Chelsea's performance Eddie Howe: \"We had good opportunities. We knew today was probably going to be a counter-attack day and set plays, and it turned out that way. It was a good chance for Callum and Nathan's one is a big moment in the game because you are trying to take the lead and make it difficult for Chelsea. We did that without taking the lead...Although we are disappointed I think it was a decent performance.\" 1:41 Eddie Howe was left to rue missed opportunities Eddie Howe was left to rue missed opportunities What's next?

and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg gave Southampton their first win of the Premier League season after they beat Crystal Palace 2-0 at Selhurst Park. Ings slotted in his second Premier League goal of the season (47') before Hojbjerg's injury-time finish (90+2') gave manager Mark Hughes a long-awaited victory in south London. Substitute Charlie Austin missed from the penalty spot following a handball by Aaron Wan-Bissaka midway through the second half, but the visitors doubled their lead in injury-time to condemn Palace to their third consecutive loss. Victory for Southampton means they move up into 10th. Crystal Palace, meanwhile, drop down to 15th.

Mohamed Elyounoussi's dinked cross fell to the feet of the Republic of Ireland international, but Wan-Bissaka combined with Mamadou Sakho to block what looked destined to be a certain goal. Benteke squandered a great opportunity to score his first Premier League goal of the season six minutes later to mark a disappointing first half for the former Liverpool striker. Wan-Bissaka's dangerous cross into the box was missed by Alex McCarthy to present Benteke with a free header, but he nodded wide of the post. With Southampton dominating the possession battle, they almost took the lead through an own goal as Luka Milivojevic's diving header towards his own net had to be brilliantly parried away by Wayne Hennessey. Team news Zaha was out with a hip problem. Wan-Bissaka returned to the starting XI following his suspension Southampton were unchanged to the side that lost 2-1 to Leicester in the Premier League Just two minutes into the second half, Ings gave Southampton the lead. A lapse of concentration from Sakho and Martin Kelly allowed Cedric's simple ball over the top to reach Ings, who scored his second goal in a Southampton shirt. Southampton had the ideal opportunity to go two up when Wan-Bissaka's handball gifted Mark Hughes' side a spot-kick in the 64th minute, but Austin's penalty was saved by Hennessey's boot. Moments later, the Wales goalkeeper produced a fantastic save as he denied Nathan Redmond's close-range effort before Elyounoussi smashed his close-range rebound onto the bar. Benteke could have levelled the game in the final minute, but his point-blank header was superbly denied by McCarthy's feet. With Palace leaving themselves exposed at the back as they pushed for an equaliser in injury time, Hojbjerg capped off a fast Southampton counter-attack to double their lead - and his first Premier League goal - to secure the visitors a valuable three points. Notes for Southgate Alex McCarthy put in a solid display between the sticks for Southampton. He pulled off a particularly crucial save in the final minute to deny Christian Benteke. Aaron Wan-Bissaka was called into the England U21 squad and he looked threatening going forward for Palace despite handballing for a Southampton penalty. Opta stats Crystal Palace have failed to score in consecutive home league games for the first time ever under Roy Hodgson. Southampton have won five of their last seven away league games against Crystal Palace, losing the other two. Crystal Palace have lost all 10 Premier League games since the start of last season when Wilfried Zaha hasn't appeared. Southampton striker Danny Ings has scored in three consecutive away league appearances for the first time ever. Christian Benteke has scored just three goals in his last 36 Premier League appearances for Crystal Palace, after netting 15 in his 35 before that with the Eagles. Man of the Match - Danny Ings Ings was a constant thorn in the Crystal Palace defence and gave Southampton a much-needed confidence boost when he calmly put Hughes' side in front shortly after the break. Danny Ings celebrates his goal at Selhurst Park His link-up play with Long and substitute Charlie Austin caused the Palace centre-back pairing of Sakho and Kelly plenty of problems and he could be set for a prolific season should he remain injury-free. The Managers 3:01 Following their defeat to Southampton, Crystal Palace's Roy Hodgson says he wants to see Christian Benteke scoring goals and improving his confidence Following their defeat to Southampton, Crystal Palace's Roy Hodgson says he wants to see Christian Benteke scoring goals and improving his confidence Roy Hodgson: \"There's nothing that has been happening in our training or the way we've been approaching games which would suggest that we wouldn't be as good as we'd be in the first three games but we certainly weren't. \"It might just be that football does things to you sometimes and we came across a very determined, aggressive and athletic Southampton team who ask questions of us and unfortunately for us, we weren't able to supply the answers.\" 2:54 Mark Hughes says his Southampton side played exceptionally well and controlled the game in the first half during their win at Crystal Palace Mark Hughes says his Southampton side played exceptionally well and controlled the game in the first half during their win at Crystal Palace Mark Hughes: \"Palace have got a lot of good players they can call upon but it was more about us being able to control the game for long periods. \"Everybody is in a better frame of mind when you can win before an international break and we've been able to do it.

Everton 1-1 Huddersfield Huddersfield showed their fighting spirit as they earned a deserved point in a 1-1 draw against substandard Everton at Goodison Park. Philip Billing gave the Yorkshire side the lead after 34 minutes when he headed in his first Premier League goal from Chris Lowe's corner. But Marco Silva's side equalised within 87 seconds as Dominic Calvert-Lewin rose to head in Lucas Digne's cross from the left. Philip Billing wheels away in delight after giving Huddersfield the lead on Saturday Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Digne (7), Coleman (6), Zouma (7), Holgate (7), Davies (5), Schneiderlin (6), Sigurdsson (5), Walcott (6), Calvert-Lewin (7), Tosun (6).

Subs: Kachunga (6), Durm (6), Depoitre (n/a) Man of the match: Philip Billing (Huddersfield) Huddersfield, who have moved out of the relegation zone and up to 17th position, shaded the second period with neither side coming close to finding a winner, meaning both have now recorded two draws on the bounce. Everton move up to seventh place but it is a point that will suit Terriers boss David Wagner a lot more, although his side's six shots on target compared to the hosts' one suggests it was they who might count themselves unlucky not to win this encounter. Everton were without the suspended Richarlison and they missed the Brazilian's trickery even before Theo Walcott was forced off the field through injury early in the second half. By then, both sides had found the net in a frantic three-minute spell that sparked this niggly contest into life. Everton have struggled to defend set pieces so far this season, with Wolves, Southampton and Bournemouth all scoring in their three previous matches from such deliveries - and Billing benefited from their latest display of weakness. Calvert-Lewin is congratulated on his first Premier League goal this season Team news Everton made four changes from the side that drew 2-2 at Bournemouth in their last Premier League outing. Lucas Digne was picked over Leighton Baines at left-back. Kurt Zouma replaced the injured Michael Keane, Morgan Schneiderlin returned from injury in place of Idrissa Gueye, while Dominic Calvert-Lewin covered for the suspended Richarlison. Huddersfield made two changes to the side that drew 0-0 against Cardiff last time out in the Premier League. Jonas Lossl replaced the injured Ben Hamer while Chris Lowe came in for the suspended Jonathan Hogg. Chris Lowe's corner was inadvertently flicked on by Calvert-Lewin at the front post, with the Denmark Under-21 international heading in unmarked from close range. But Everton's response was immediate. Kurt Zouma fed Digne down the left, and the former Barcelona full-back - on his first Premier Leagure start- cut inside Adama Diakhaby before his cross was headed in by Calvert-Lewin for his third goal of the week. The 21-year-old scored twice in the 3-1 victory over Rotherham in the Carabao Cup second-round win on Wednesday, and he very nearly completed the turnaround before the interval as he headed over from Walcott's cross when well-placed. Theo Walcott was forced off through injury on a frustrating day for the hosts Cenk Tosun, Seamus Coleman and Zouma had all flashed speculative efforts wide of Lossl's goal in a frustrating first half for the hosts, and the closest they came to scoring in the second period fell to Tosun but he headed over from Zouma's hooked cross. Huddersfield were always dangerous on the counter-attack with Rajiv van La Parra firing over - but neither side had the cutting edge to turn one point into three. Opta stats Huddersfield haven't won any of their last 15 away games against Everton in all competitions (D3 L12), last winning there 2-1 in the top-flight in September 1937. Everton recorded their 200th score draw in the Premier League, more than any other team in the competition. There were just 87 seconds between Philip Billing giving Huddersfield the lead and Dominic Calvert-Lewin's equaliser for Everton. Yorkshire teams have won none of their last 16 Premier League visits to Goodison Park (W0 D6 L10) since Sheffield Wednesday won 2-1 there in April 1999. Since the start of last season, Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been directly involved in more goals for Everton in all competitions than any other player (11 goals, 6 assists). Huddersfield's Philip Billing scored his first league goal since February 2017 vs Reading, ending a run of 31 appearances without a goal (inc. play-offs). Man of the match - Philip Billing Billing saw his midfield partner Jonathan Hogg receive his marching orders in last weekend's stalemate with Cardiff and the 22-year-old must have thought he was in for a long afternoon when referee Stuart Attwell brandished a yellow card in his direction after just four minutes at Goodison Park. Billing stood out in a dogged display from the Terriers on Merseyside The young Dane grew into this game, and didn't let the early caution affect his energy levels and determination to earn his side a positive result on Merseyside. Billing was among many Huddersfield players who worked tirelessly to preserve a point for the relegation candidates, and he capped his display with a well-placed header from close range in front of the Gwlays Street to give his side the lead.

In what was a tight affair, the hosts were heading for their first point of the season but Traore capitalised on Carlos Sanchez's error in the third minute of injury time to hand Nuno Espirito Santo's side their first top-flight win since beating QPR in February 2012. A first league win of the campaign sees Wolves move up to ninth in the table, while West Ham, who have only once before lost their opening four league matches of a season, stay rooted at the foot of the league and without a point heading into the international break. Nuno Espirito Santo celebrates the 1-0 away win at West Ham Both goalkeepers were called into action early as Rui Patricio got down low to his right to keep out Felipe Anderson's effort, while Lukasz Fabianski had to be alert to tip Matt Doherty's powerful strike over the bar. Despite the early saves, chances proved hard to come by at the London Stadium.

Pellegrini changed things around at the break, replacing Snodgrass with summer signing Andriy Yarmolenko and West Ham almost found a way through. A clever flick from Jack Wilshere found Marko Arnautovic but the Austria international could only prod the ball wide. Robert Snodgrass and Helder Costa battle for the ball Moments later, Patricio was at full stretch, diving away to his right to claw Michail Antonio's looping header off the line. Wolves then went close to taking the lead in the 74th minute but this time it was Fabianski who kept the scores level, racing off his line to block substitute Leo Bonatini's shot. They went even closer five minutes later. Ruben Neves' cross-field pass picked out Doherty, who picked out Jimenez in acres of space in the West Ham penalty area. However, the striker, under no pressure whatsoever, missed his kick in front of goal. Team news Manuel Pellegrini made eight changes from the side that beat AFC Wimbledon in the Carabao Cup last Tuesday. Diop, Cresswell and Snodgrass retained their places as the likes of Fabianski, Wilshere, Anderson and the fit-again Arnautovic returned to the starting line-up. Wolves made nine changes from the side that won 2-0 at Sheffield Wednesday in the Carabao Cup. Doherty and Coady kept their places as Nuno reverted to the starting line-up that drew 1-1 with Man City last weekend. Arnautovic almost snatched all three points at the death as he turned inside Conor Coady but luckily for Wolves, the Austrian's shot was kept out by the face of Patricio. There was still time for one final chance and it fell to Wolves. Sanchez lost the ball deep in his own half before Bonatini teed up Traore, who secured all three points for his side. Traore scores an injury-time winner for Wolves Opta stats West Ham have lost their first four league games in a season for only the second time in their history and first since 2010-11 when they were relegated. Manuel Pellegrini is the first West Ham manager to lose his first four Premier League games in charge since Avram Grant.

Slump. pic.twitter.com/WROuWYKZpZ — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) September 1, 2018 Man of the Match - Rui Patricio Rui Patricio made two crucial saves for Wolves It was a tough call between the two goalkeepers, Patricio and Fabianski. Both made crucial saves to keep their sides in the game but Traore's winner just swings the award in the Wolves goalkeeper's direction. The Portugal international's two big saves came in the second half. Firstly, he dived away to his right to claw Antonio's header away from goal before keeping Arnautovic's goal-bound effort out with his face. In the end, they proved to be crucial interventions from the 30-year-old, who has been a pivotal part in Wolves' solid start to the season. The managers Manuel Pellegrini: \"We knew before we started that we had a tough start, seven difficult games. I don't think it is a bad start, it is a very bad start. We didn't think we'd lose six points here at home. Here at home to lose we must be very worried. But I think everyone inside the club is calm. We need to be calm. I think we have a strong squad and we are going to have better performances in the future. But of course, when you start with no points in four games it is difficult.\" 2:14 Pellegrini: We need to be calm Pellegrini: We need to be calm Nuno Espirito Santo: \"It feels good. Even if we didn't win I would be happy because we worked hard. We are happy and for our fans, it's massive, to come here and get three points. It means more for our fans.

Newcastle Highlights: Man City 2-1 Newcastle Kyle Walker's stunning maiden goal for Manchester City helped the champions overcome an improved Newcastle United 2-1 on Saturday. The England international's sumptuous long-range drive seven minutes into the second half proved decisive as City moved to within two points of leaders Liverpool and Chelsea with their third win of the season. Raheem Sterling fired City ahead inside eight minutes with a fine strike of his own before the Etihad Stadium was stunned on the half-hour mark by DeAndre Yedlin's equaliser - Newcastle's first league goal away from home this season. However, despite the visible improvement, Rafa Benitez's men were left to reflect on a third defeat of the season which leaves them in the relegation zone with one point ahead of the international break. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (8), Stones (6), Laporte (6), Mendy (5), Fernandinho (6), D. Silva (6), Mahrez (5), Sterling (7), Jesus (5), Aguero (6).

Subs: Atsu (5), Murphy (5), Joselu (5). Man of the Match: Kyle Walker Another arduous league outing looked on the cards for Newcastle when City started brightly. Riyad Mahrez dragged a shot wide with just four minutes on the clock and, four minutes later, the champions were ahead. Newcastle were the architects of their own downfall as returning skipper Jamaal Lascelles surrendered possession on the edge of his area, handing Benjamin Mendy the chance to release Sterling, who marked his 100th Premier League appearance for City with a sumptuous strike into the far corner. Raheem Sterling celebrates his opener alongside teammates John Stones and Kyle Walker Sterling's second goal of the season ushered in a period of City dominance but they failed to double their lead, Gabriel Jesus firing a free header straight at Martin Dubravka on 27 minutes. City were made to pay for their wastefulness as Yedlin embarked on a lung-busting 70-yard run, got on the end of Salomon's Rondon's cross and rifled Newcastle's equaliser beyond Ederson. DeAndre Yedlin scores equalises for Newcastle United Buoyed by Yedlin's first Premier League goal, Newcastle made it to the break level, but they were undone within seven minutes of the restart thanks to a moment of magic from Walker. Team news John Stones, Riyad Mahrez and Gabriel Jesus, and Jamaal Lascelles, Kenedy and Ayoze Perez, returned as both managers made three changes from their last Premier League outing. Leroy Sane was left out of the Man City squad amid reports of concerns over his focus. Sergio Aguero laid the ball into the path of the England international, who took a touch before flashing an unstoppable effort past Dubravka in the blink of an eye. Kyle Walker scores from distance to give Manchester City a 2-1 lead City were on course to return to winning ways but their hopes of adding gloss to the victory were hampered by the inspired Dubravka, who denied Fernandinho and David Silva on 67 minutes with a sublime triple save before thwarting Aguero in a one-on-one in stoppage time. Opta stats Manchester City have won each of their last 10 Premier League home games against Newcastle, their joint-longest run of home wins against a single opponent in the top-flight (also 10 v Wolves between 1900 and 1937). Newcastle have registered just one win in their last 10 away Premier League games (D3 L6). Manchester City hit the 750 mark for home Premier League goals in this game (160 at Maine Road and 590 at the Etihad). Since the start of last season, only Mohamed Salah (45) and Harry Kane (35) have had a hand in more Premier League goals than Manchester City winger Raheem Sterling (31 - 20 goals, 11 assists) Benjamin Mendy is the third Man City player to assist as many as four goals in their first four games to a Premier League season, after Samir Nasri in 2011-12 and David Silva in 2015-16. Excluding own goals, Newcastle full-back DeAndre Yedlin is the first American player to score in the Premier League since Geoff Cameron for Stoke vs Aston Villa in March 2014. Kyle Walker scored his first goal for Man City in all competitions in his 52nd appearance for the club. The managers 0:56 Pep Guardiola sheds light on Leroy Sane omission from City's squad Pep Guardiola sheds light on Leroy Sane omission from City's squad Pep Guardiola: \"Our performance was quite good, especially in the second half where we didn't let them run and we created enough chances. The game was quite good. We have one title before the international break and 10 points from 12 so it's a good result, I'm so delighted and satisfied for the guys.\" 0:43 Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez was disappointed not to get a result at the home of the champions Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez was disappointed not to get a result at the home of the champions Rafa Benitez: \"I'm disappointed because in the end you want to get that result. The team effort was there, the mentality was there - you could see the players fighting for each other. I'm really pleased with that but really disappointed because we have to manage better to get results here.\" Man of the Match - Kyle Walker Kyle Walker has got a Premier League and League Cup winners' medal to show from his first 52 games for City - now he has a first goal to go with them. The England international has taken his time to settle into the new season, with Benjamin Mendy catching the eye on the opposing flank. But any suggestion Walker would be overshadowed by his defensive partner was emphatically dismissed with a goal fit to win any game. What's next? After the first international break of the season, City host Fulham and Newcastle welcome Arsenal to St. James' Park on September 15."},{"date": "27/08/2019", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance":

Moura scored twice as Tottenham stunned Manchester United with a 3-0 win at Old Trafford on Monday Night Football. Harry Kane's superb header from a corner (50) and Lucas' tidy finish (52) gave Spurs daylight against a shell-shocked United, after Jose Mourinho made six changes from the side that lost 3-2 at Brighton last week. Spurs then caught United on the break to add a third through man-of-the-match Lucas' fine finish (85), meaning United have suffered their worst start to a Premier League season since 2014.

Subs: Aurier (NA), Davies (NA), Winks (NA) Man of the match: Lucas Moura United have also lost two of their opening three Premier League games for the first time since 1992, while Spurs register their best start since 2009/10. Most of the early talk surrounded Mourinho's tactics, with Ander Herrera starting on the right side of a central-defensive three and Paul Pogba further up the pitch than in previous weeks. Paul Pogba looks on at Old Trafford on Monday night Danny Rose so nearly handed United an early lead with a loose back-pass, but Romelu Lukaku will feel he should have scored having rolled the ball just wide of the open goal after rounding Hugo Lloris. Spurs had a strong call for a penalty turned down by Craig Pawson after Jones' clumsy challenge on Moura from behind, with Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville agreeing in the MNF studio that Jones should have been penalised. Team news Jose Mourinho made six changes from the side that lost 3-2 at Brighton. Lindelof and Bailly were replaced by Jones and Smalling; Mata, Pereira and Martial were left out of the squad completely, while Valencia, Matic and Herrera came in. Young was also replaced by Lingard. For Spurs, Lloris started despite his off-field controversy, while Sanchez and Davies dropped out for Rose and Dembele. Lamela was injured in the warm-up, replaced by Amos. Kane scored a superb header to put Tottenham ahead on 50 minutes But Spurs went ahead in fine fashion five minutes after the break through Kane's brilliant header into the far corner from Kieran Trippier's corner, Tottenham's first goal at Old Trafford in 433 Premier League minutes. Lloris turned away a Lukaku effort moments later, but it was 2-0 on 52 minutes through Lucas, turning home from 10 yards into the bottom left corner after Christian Eriksen picked him out. Distance tracking Man Utd Tottenham Sprints (player) Lingard - 18 Lucas - 26 Distance (player) Fred - 11.99km Eriksen - 13.25km Sprints (team) 104 111 Distance (team) 109.21km 119.43km Time standing 7.65% 4.45% Spurs had two golden opportunities to make it 3-0 after Mourinho made three quick-fire changes; first, substitute Victor Lindelof's poor back-pass was picked up by Dele Alli, but he could only fire at David de Gea, before Kane headed wide unmarked from six yards after losing Lindelof at a corner. Mousa Dembele and Jesse Lingard battle for the ball in midfield United piled on the pressure in hope of halving the deficit, but Lucas broke away to get his second and Spurs' third, slipping past Chris Smalling and finishing neatly into the left corner past De Gea. Mourinho showed respect to the United fans after the game, standing in front of the Stretford End and clapping the home support for over a minute. 2:57 Mourinho was applauded off at the end of the game Mourinho was applauded off at the end of the game The managers Jose Mourinho: \"We work all week, and by the strategic point of view we didn't lose, by the tactical point of view we didn't lose, but we lost the game. We work very, very well during the week, we prepared the game very well, we played very well, the players had a fantastic attitude.\" 5:49 Mourinho insists his tactics did not cause the defeat Mourinho insists his tactics did not cause the defeat Mauricio Pochettino: \"After four years of playing here, when you don't score one goal, to win away from home at Old Trafford it is a massive, massive victory.\" 3:56 Mauricio Pochettino hails a 'massive victory’ Mauricio Pochettino hails a 'massive victory’ The pundit Jamie Carragher: \"There's a serious lack of quality, if you've spent £400m on a squad. How do you lose 3-0?That's a team that looks like it still needs £200m spent on it. Some of the defenders there. What's happened at United in terms of buying two £30m centre-backs? I can't really criticise Lindelof because it gets to the stage that he's so far out of his depth that you start to feel sorry for him. In Jones and Smalling, have they improved since Mourinho came in? They've been playing for a long time, and it shouldn't really be happening at this level.\" 1:02 Jose walks out of press conference Jose walks out of press conference Opta stats This was Man Utd boss Mourinho's biggest home defeat in all competitions as a manager. This was Manchester United's 50th home defeat in the Premier League. Mourinho has lost two of his opening three games in a league season for the first time in his career. Notes for Southgate Luke Shaw was praised after the game by Mourinho for his battling performance, but Chris Smalling and Phil Jones looked nervous in a higher defensive line as Spurs eventually got the better of them. Meanwhile, Jesse Lingard failed to make an impact on his first start since the World Cup. Danny Rose almost handed Romelu Lukaku a goal on a plate early on, Kieran Trippier played extremely high and made an impact on the right flank, and Harry Kane showed his world-class goalscoring ability with a superb header to break the deadlock. Dele Alli was involved, but not outstanding. Man of the match - Lucas Moura Lucas became the first player to score a double at Old Trafford in the Premier League since Sergio Aguero in April 2015, and his fine start to the season continued with a vibrant display. Lucas put in a fine display at Old Trafford \"He has terrorised the defenders at times with his pace,\" said Alan Smith on MNF. \"He is clearly really desperate to do well at his new club and he has certainly done brilliantly tonight.\" Will Son have a battle on his hands to get back into the starting XI? What would VAR have changed? Almost definitely, VAR would have handed Spurs a first-half penalty. Defender Jones looked directly at referee Pawson after colliding with Lucas in the box, and having looked at the replays, there could have been little complaints. What's next? Manchester United go to Burnley on Sunday at 4pm in the Premier League, while Tottenham go to Watford at the same time on Super Sunday, live on Sky Sports Premier League."},{"date": "26/08/2019",

Crystal Palace Watford 2-1 Crystal Palace Watford survived a late scare to seal a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace and win three games at the start of a top-flight season for the first time. Wilfried Zaha struck 12 minutes from time at Vicarage Road to raise hopes of a visiting fightback but the hosts held on as Roberto Pereyra's 53rd-minute strike and Jose Holebas's freak second (71) proved enough. Palace had been denied by several fine Ben Foster saves in the first half and saw Joel Ward head agonisingly wide deep into stoppage-time on a frustrating afternoon where Roy Hodgson may again curse the officials. Wilfried Zaha is shown a yellow card at Watford Player ratings Watford: Foster (8), Janmaat (7), Cathcart (6), Kabasele (7), Holebas (7), Capoue (7), Doucoure (6), Hughes (6), Pereyra (8), Deeney (7), Gray (6). Subs used: Sema (6), Success (n/a). Crystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Ward (7), Kelly (6), Sakho (6), Van Aanholt (6), Townsend (7), Milivojevic (6), McArthur (6), Schlupp (6), Benteke (6), Zaha (7). Subs used: Meyer (6), Sorloth (n/a). Man of the match: Roberto Pereyra Watford - third in the fledgling table - had started brightly on the slick surface, Pereyra whipping in a ball that just evaded Andre Gray at the far post, but the game quickly became fractious as the rain fell. Zaha, memorably mocked by Watford's mascot back in December 2016, drew the ire of the home crowd for a tackle on Holebas but had been dangerously halted himself minutes earlier by Etienne Capoue's studs, the card dubiously yellow rather than red. Team news Watford were unchanged from their 3-1 win at Burnley last weekend. Joel Ward replaced the suspended Aaron-Wan Bissaka in Crystal Palace's starting XI but there was a further late change when James Tomkins suffered a calf injury in the warm-up, Martin Kelly stepping in. With the game's tempo brisk, Andros Townsend set up Christian Benteke for a header superbly clawed away by Foster and the Watford goalkeeper made another close-range stop to thwart James McArthur with only 16 minutes gone. Palace had crafted the best chances but Watford slowly found a foothold, the impressive Pereyra twice going close and Daryl Janmaat, a consistent attacking threat, striking a Gray lay-off on the run just wide as the interval approached. Jose Holebas is mobbed by team-mates after putting Watford 2-0 ahead The hosts' momentum stretched into the second half and Pereyra finally made it count, cutting inside Townsend and finding the far corner after Capoue had found him following a muscular dart downfield. Benteke had wasted one headed chance before Foster pushed the other clear but the Belgian went close with a far more ambitious effort, cushioning a ball with back to goal before curling just high and wide. Palace's hopes instead seemed extinguished when Holebas tricked inside and delivered a deep cross that caught out Wayne Hennessey and dropped into the far corner. Roberto Pereyra celebrates putting Watford ahead against Crystal Palace Hodgson, who had been angered by decisions against Liverpool, threw on Max Meyer and it was his give-and-go that paid dividends, Zaha collecting the return ball before jinking at the byline and drilling low from an angle. Substitute Alexander Sorloth failed to connect with a late Palace corner, before Ward fluffed his lines from another as Javi Gracia's side held on for victory and 'Harry the Hornet' thumped his drum in celebration. Man of the match - Roberto Pereyra Roberto Pereyra had seen one half-volley deflected behind and fired another good chance straight at Wayne Hennessey before finally making the breakthrough with a superbly taken goal. Especially influential in the first half, he had four shots on target overall - the most of any Hornets player - as well as delivering three crosses and a key pass.

Watford's current run of three consecutive wins in the Premier League is their second-longest winning streak in competition history, and just one short of their record of four games (in December 2015 under Quique Sanchez Flores). Watford have lost only one of their nine home games in the Premier League under Javi Gracia (W6 D2), including wins in each of their most recent three. Wilfried Zaha is now Crystal Palace's top scorer in Premier League history (24), overtaking Chris Armstrong who netted 23 goals in the competition for the Eagles. Roberto Pereyra has been directly involved in seven of Watford's last 11 goals in the Premier League, scoring six and assisting another. Jose Holebas has been directly involved in three of Watford's four Premier League goals at Vicarage Road this season (one goal and two assists). Notes for Southgate Andros Townsend has not given up of hope of playing for England again but though he delivered several dangerous early balls, he was turned for both Watford's goals.

quick first-half double as Fulham beat Burnley 4-2 to seal their first win of the Premier League season. The Whites looked the better side from the outset after a thunderous strike from Jean Michael Seri inside three minutes, although Jeff Hendrick (10) got Burnley level not long after. Two quickfire strikes from Mitrovic (36, 38) ultimately decided the game, but Burnley put the pressure on again when James Tarkowski tapped home in the 40th minute. The second half saw just the one goal - a strike from Andre Schurrle (83) - as Fulham won their first league game of the season, while Burnley have now gone eight top-flight games without a win. Player ratings Fulham: Bettinelli (6), Fosu-Mensah (7), Odoi (6), Le Marchand (6), Bryan (7), Seri (7), McDonald (6), Cairney (7), Schurrle (8), Mitrovic (7), Vietto (7). Subs used: Chambers (4), Anguissa (5), Sessegnon (n/a). Burnley: Hart (6), Lowton (6), Tarkowski (7), Mee (7), Ward (6), Lennon (6), Cork (6), Gudmundsson (n/a), Westwood (6), Wood (4), Hendrick (6). Subs used: Taylor (7), Vokes (4), Barnes (4). Man of the match: Andre Schurrle. In a goal-laden first half, it was Seri's opening strike in the third minute that was the pick of the strikes. Luciano Vietto laid the ball off to the midfielder and he hit his effort towards goal, which rifled into the top corner, scoring with his first-ever Premier League shot. Seven minutes later and Hendrick got Burnley level. It was a great run down the field from Aaron Lennon, who picked out Hendrick on the left of the area. His initial effort was blocked by the knees of Denis Odoi before he scored the rebound on the angle. The game looked to be meandering towards half-time when there was a flurry of goals. Mitrovic kicked things off in the 36th minute as Seri played a short corner to Tom Cairney at the top of the box. His curled cross towards the back post was then glanced home by Mitrovic. Team news Fulham made five changes, with Marcus Bettinelli, Kevin McDonald, Andre Schurrle, Luciano Vietto and Denis Odoi coming into the XI. Burnley made no changes to their Premier League XI, with five players retaining their places from midweek. He added the second two minutes later as Fulham went on the break with Vietto again involved, whipping a superb ball into the area which Mitrovic again nodded home, this time more emphatically. There was more to come, though, as Tarkowski pulled one back for Burnley with five minutes of the half to play. Charlie Taylor's corner was nodded back across the area by Ben Mee, allowing his fellow defender to tap home from point-blank range. There were fewer goals in the second half, but Andre Schurrle rattled the crossbar in the 55th minute, rounding Tarkowski before taking aim. Mitrovic could have completed his hat-trick in the 74th minute, but could not convert Timothy Fosu-Mensah's fizzing cross, ending up in the back of the net himself. Aleksandar Mitrovic wheels away after restoring Fulham's advantage After plenty of shots, Schurrle finally made the breakthrough in the 83th minute to round off the win. Mitrovic did well in the build-up, seeing his strike ping off the crossbar, but the rebound landed at the feet of the German who fired home. Opta stats Since a run of five consecutive Premier League wins between March and April, Burnley have collected just three points in eight league games (P8 W0 D3 L5). Fulham striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored 15 league goals since his debut for the Whites in February - no player has more in the top four tiers of English football in that time (Mohamed Salah has also scored 15). Andre Schurrle scored his first Premier League goal for Fulham - his goal was the 11th shot he'd had in the match. Four of Aleksandar Mitrovic's 13 Premier League goals have been scored against Joe Hart (also with Newcastle in October 2015 against Manchester City and in August 2017 against West Ham). Jeff Hendrick celebrates after scoring Burnley's equaliser Man of the match - Andre Schurrle It was a superb performance from Schurrle, who is starting to find his feet again after some disappointing seasons back in Germany. He was pulling the strings in the middle of the park for the first half and got into the right-back position on a number of occasions to cover his team-mates. His focus shifted in the second period and he was purely attack-minded, having a huge number of efforts, including one which pinged against the crossbar. He finally got his goal late on and it was much deserved. He will be a star for Fulham if he keeps the same level for much of the season. Notes for Southgate England manager Gareth Southgate was in attendance at Craven Cottage, with Joe Hart playing another 90 minutes although did not make many big saves. James Tarkowski scored for a second Premier League game in a row. For Fulham, Calum Chambers and Ryan Sessegnon made substitute appearances but did not do too much. What's next? Fulham take on Exeter in their midweek Carabao Cup fixture before facing Brighton on Saturday in the Premier League.

Newcastle 1-2 Chelsea Highlights: Newcastle 1-2 Chelsea Chelsea made it three wins from three with a dramatic 2-1 victory at Newcastle on Renault Super Sunday. DeAndre Yedlin's unfortunate own goal on 87 minutes sealed the win for Maurizio Sarri's dominant side - who had 81 per cent possession - after a controversial finale at St. James' Park. Eden Hazard fired Chelsea in front from the penalty spot on 76 minutes after Fabian Schar was harshly penalised for a foul on Marcos Alonso, but Newcastle were level six minutes later as Joselu's near-post header was allowed to stand, despite Yedlin catching Olivier Giroud in the face with an elbow in the build-up. Chelsea had the final word, though, as Yedlin turned Alonso's cross into his own net to maintain the Blues' flawless start to the season, and leave Rafa Benitez's men waiting for their first win.

Man of the Match: Eden Hazard. Newcastle, bolstered by four new signings making their full debuts, set their stall out from the start and registered the game's first effort on target, Jacob Murphy's low drive drawing Kepa Arrizabalaga into a save on six minutes. Chelsea thought they had lost Eden Hazard to injury on 20 minutes but the Belgian shook off a knock, tormented the Newcastle defence and brought the game to life as a contest. DeAndre Yedlin turns the ball into his own net for Chelsea's second Hazard nearly broke the deadlock on 24 minutes but his effort with the outside of his boot curled away from goal. Six minutes later he embarked on a trademark run, beating three defenders, but he dragged a shot wide. The subdued encounter was now frantic as two new Newcastle signings nearly provided the opener on 34 minutes, but Salomon Rondon headed wide from Federico Fernandez's cross from the left. Team news Rafa Benitez made six changes from the goalless draw at Cardiff. Four signings made their full Newcastle debuts, as Federico Fernandez, Fabian Schar, Ki Sung-yeung and Salomon Rondon started. Eden Hazard started for Chelsea as they made two changes from the victory over Arsenal. Hazard replaced Willian, while loanee Mateo Kovacic got the nod ahead of Ross Barkley. Pedro pounced on a poor clearance from Ki Sung-yeung and whistled a shot wide of the top corner on 36 minutes, before Martin Dubravka produced a fine save to keep the Spaniard's low effort out. Chelsea picked up from where they left off after the interval. An intricate move released Cesar Azpilicueta in down the right but he fired straight at Dubravka, before Alvaro Morata's touch let him down after the Chelsea captain found his compatriot in space in the area. Joselu celebrates after his header made it 1-1 Antonio Rudiger rattled the crossbar with a thunderous 30-yard drive on 73 minutes before Chelsea were handed the chance to take the lead when referee Paul Tierney penalised Schar for a trip on Alonso, despite the Newcastle debutant appearing to get a touch on the ball. Up stepped Hazard who made no mistake from 12 yards, rifling the ball to Dubravka's right, but out of the blue Newcastle were level. With Giroud on the floor clutching his face after a clash with Yedlin, the Newcastle full-back whipped a wicked ball in for substitute Joselu to power a header past Arrizabalaga. Newcastle players are distraught after conceding Chelsea's late winner But an unlikely point was snatched out of Newcastle's clutches as Giroud cushioned Willian's free-kick into the path of Alonso, and his effort cannoned off Yedlin to break hearts on Tyneside. Opta stats Chelsea have registered their first Premier League victory at St James' Park since December 2011 - drawing one and losing four of their previous five visits. Chelsea haven't kept a clean sheet at St James' Park since a 3-0 victory in December 2011 - failing to keep a shutout in their last six visits. Joselu's goal in the 83rd minute was Newcastle's first shot on target since the sixth minute and their only shot on target in the second half. Maurizio Sarri is the fifth Chelsea manager to win his opening three Premier League games in charge of the club after Antonio Conte, Carlo Ancelotti, Guus Hiddink and Jose Mourinho. Jorginho completed 158 passes out of a possible 173 (91.3%), 27 more than the whole Newcastle side combined (131). Eden Hazard's goal was his 70th for Chelsea in the Premier League - overtaking Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in third (69); only Frank Lampard (147) and Didier Drogba (104) have scored more for the Blues.

Rafa Benitez claims that his Newcastle side were close to taking points off Chelsea but a \"soft penalty\" and an own goal proved to be the difference at St James' Park. Rafa Benitez: \"The penalty was soft. The foul was soft [for the free-kick for the winner]. It's a pity because we were very close. We knew playing open against them, with their ability, they can beat players. I think we did a good job, and it's a pity to lose this way.\" 2:00 Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri claims the 2-1 win over Newcastle at St James' Park was 'very difficult' due to how compact Rafa Benitez's side were. Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri claims the 2-1 win over Newcastle at St James' Park was 'very difficult' due to how compact Rafa Benitez's side were. Maurizio Sarri: \"I was surprised, I have never seen a Rafa Benitez side play with five defenders. I think it is very difficult to play here for every team - not only us. We were a bit unlucky when they scored to make it 1-1.\" Man of the Match - Eden Hazard On his first start of the season, there was no rustiness from Hazard who was exemplary throughout. He registered three more attempts than any other player on the pitch with five efforts on goal, produced a game-high nine touches in the opposition box, completed 91 of his 101 passes and capped it all with Chelsea's opener from the spot. What would VAR have changed? Quite a lot, to be honest, although had Video Assistant Referee been in use, Chelsea still would have won, albeit in less dramatic circumstances. Schar's challenge on Alonso that handed Chelsea their penalty could have been overturned, and Joselu's equaliser could have been chalked off for a foul on Giroud, but Hazard's spot kick would have been the difference.

After City hit the woodwork twice in the first half, Wolves took the lead in the most controversial fashion as Willy Boly handled Joao Moutinho's fine cross into the far corner (57), the touch not spotted by referee Martin Atkinson or his assistants. City equalised through Aymeric Laporte's strong header from Ilkay Gundogan's set piece (69), before Sergio Aguero hit the crossbar with a free-kick in the last minute of stoppage time. Aymeric Laporte celebrates his equaliser at Molineux Player ratings Wolves: Patricio (8), Coady (6), Bennett (7), Boly (8), Doherty (6), Neves (6), Moutinho (7), Jonny (7), Jota (7), Jimenez (7), Costa (7).

Subs: Jesus (6), Sane (5), Mahrez (NA) Man of the match: Willy Boly The result means City drop points for the first time this season, while Wolves are on two points from their opening three games. Wolves caused City some problems early on, seeing Raul Jimenez's early close-range strike chalked off correctly for offside, but City eventually got going. They rattled the woodwork twice in two minutes; Aguero slid a first-time effort against the foot of the post from 12 yards, before Raheem Sterling's fine half-volley from 25 yards was superbly tipped onto the bar by Rui Patricio, an early contender for save of the season. Team news Wolves were unchanged following the 2-0 defeat by Leicester, while Man City made two changes after the 6-1 win over Huddersfield. Gabriel Jesus was replaced by Raheem Sterling, and Kyle Walker came in for John Stones. Boly gave Wolves the lead in controversial fashion, handling in from close range Aguero then fired straight at Patricio in a good position after Benjamin Mendy's wicked cross was palmed into his path, before a frantic two-minute period in the second half saw Wolves take the lead and leave City feeling hard-done-by. Ederson brilliantly tipped wide after Douglas Costa had raced through one-on-one on the City goal, but from the resulting short corner, Moutinho's wicked cross was turned home by the hand of Boly. Seconds later, Boly superbly blocked from David Silva's drive as City looked for an instant reply, and City then saw strong appeals for a penalty turned down by Atkinson as Ruben Neves tripped Silva. City did eventually respond through Laporte's first goal for the club, a thumping header from six-yards from Gundogan's pinpoint free-kick, and it was nearly 2-1 as Patricio saved brilliantly with his legs from Gabriel Jesus' strong header. Sterling reacts after coming close at Molineux Aguero hit the woodwork for the second time with a 95th-minute free-kick coming off the crossbar, and it stayed one apiece after a frantic and entertaining contest. Opta stats Wolves have lost just two of their 28 home games in all competitions under Nuno Espirito Santo (W18 D8 L2). City have lost just one of their last 30 Premier League games against newly-promoted teams (W22 D7 L1). City conceded the first goal of a Premier League game for the first time in their last 18 fixtures in the competition, since losing 3-4 to Liverpool on January 14th. Since the start of last season, City have lost just one of the six Premier League games in which they conceded the first goal (W3 D2 L1). The managers Nuno: \"The players deserve credit. the way they worked and prepared themselves, we knew it would be tough but we worked for it, played the way and style and shape we believe, and individually we were fantastic.\" 2:51 Nuno Espirito Santo hailed a fantastic Wolves performance Nuno Espirito Santo hailed a fantastic Wolves performance Guardiola: \"It was a good game. Too many counter-attacks, but we missed simple passes, and when that happens it is impossible to avoid it. We had chances with the players we had, and it was a good point. \"Of course, Wolves deserve compliments. It's none of my business [whether Boly's goal should bring in VAR]. The Premier League will decide, and when they decide VAR will be here. When I spoke to the referee, I was just making a compliment about their job.\" 2:04 Pep Guardiola was tight-lipped on the decisions Pep Guardiola was tight-lipped on the decisions The pundit Jamie Carragher: \"I thought Wolves were brilliant. What I feared at half-time was that position Sterling and David Silva were taking up, and naturally you drop deeper but they kept trying to push up. \"I think for a lot of teams going forward against Man City, I'm not saying that's the exact blueprint but you don't want to be in your own box for 90 minutes and you had Conor Coady marshalling that back three and moving them forward.\" Raul Jimenez reacts after his goal is ruled out for offside Man of the match - Willy Boly Forget the goal; it came off his arm and he may have been offside. Boly's passed his main objective - to keep City out at the other end - with flying colours. He made two world-class last-ditch tackles in the first half, and another block from Silva immediately after his opener in the second half. Boly also lost the ball only four times, less than any other Wolves player. Notes for Southgate By his standards, this was a below-par performance from Kyle Walker, and though Raheem Sterling looked impressive in the first half, he tailed off in the second. Sterling could have scored from 25 yards with an early effort superbly saved by Rui Patricio, but he was snuffed out by Wolves as the game wore on. What would VAR have changed? To be frank, quite a lot. Boly's goal was a clear handball, and could have even gone down as an offside if the ball had in fact flicked off Ryan Bennett's head. Just seconds later, City felt they should have had a penalty from Neves' clumsy foul on Silva; if the World Cup was anything to go by, it would have been given. Pep Guardiola had a few words in the officials' ears at full-time, and on balance, he was right to feel aggrieved. What's next? Wolves now go to Sheffield Wednesday on Tuesday night in the Carabao Cup second round before a trip to West Ham on Saturday in the Premier League. City, meanwhile, host Newcastle at 5.30pm on Saturday."},{"date": "25/08/2019", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59830, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shkodran Mustafi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sokratis Papastathopoulos", "yellows": ["90"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Guendouzi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["56"]}, {"name": "Granit Xhaka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henrikh Mkhitaryan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["45"]}, {"name": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["75"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Lacazette", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["45"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Torreira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["56"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephan Lichtsteiner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rob Holding", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bernd Leno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["75"], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fredericks", "yellows": ["80"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabián Balbuena", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Issa Diop", "yellows": ["41"], "reds": [], "own_goals": ["70"], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arthur Masuaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Snodgrass", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["75"]}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": ["88"], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["63"]}, {"name": "Felipe Anderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": ["59"]}], "subs": [{"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Javier Hernández", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["59"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andriy Yarmolenko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["75"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": ["63"], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rice", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "2:47 Arsenal 3-1 West Ham Arsenal 3-1 West Ham Unai Emery got his first win as Arsenal manager as the Gunners beat West Ham 3-1 in the Premier League on Saturday. West Ham may feel their performance deserved a point as they went ahead in the 25th minute with Marko Arnautovic firing home from the edge of the area. Arsenal were level five minutes later as Nacho Monreal slotted home before West Ham defender Issa Diop (70) saw the ball strike his midriff from an Alexandre Lacazette cross and go in. Danny Welbeck then sealed the result the second minute of added time, given plenty of space to slot home from a Hector Bellerin delivery as West Ham suffered three opening Premier League defeats for the second season in a row. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (7), Bellerin (6), Mustafi (6), Sokratis (6), Monreal (7), Guendouzi (7), Xhaka (6), Mkhitaryan (6), Ramsey (8), Aubameyang (7), Iwobi (6). Subs used: Lacazette (7), Torreira (5), Welbeck (6). West Ham: Fabianski (7), Fredericks (7), Balbuena (6), Diop (5), Masuaku (6), Sanchez (5), Wilshere (6), Anderson (7), Snodgrass (7), Antonio (7), Arnautovic (7). Subs used: Hernandez (6), Perez (5), Yarmolenko (4). Man of the match: Aaron Ramsey. Arsenal thought they had taken an early lead in the 12th minute, but Aaron Ramsey's header was ruled out for offside. The Welshman picked out Bellerin on the right flank, before the defender cut back for Henrikh Mkhitaryan. His effort was saved but Ramsey was there to head in the rebound, but the offside flag was raised. It was West Ham who made the breakthrough in the 25th minute. Felipe Anderson strode down the field before playing a neat give-and-go with Arnautovic at the top of the box. The striker then took a touch to get the ball past Sokratis and fire home into the bottom corner. Team news Mesut Ozil was left out of the Arsenal matchday 18 after suffering an illness with Aaron Ramsey replacing him. West Ham made four changes with Ryan Fredericks, Carlos Sanchez, Issa Diop and Michail Antonio coming into the XI. Jack Wilshere and Lukasz Fabianski also lined up against their former side. But the lead did not last for long as Arsenal equalised five minutes later. Mkhitaryan picked out a superb run from Bellerin down the right of the area and found Monreal, who had time to take a touch before sweeping past goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski. The second half began at a pace, with Fabianksi called into action inside three minutes to keep out a Shkodran Mustafi header before Arnautovic's half-volley from an Anderson cross was saved well by Petr Cech. It was some bad West Ham luck that saw Arsenal take the lead in the 70th minute. The Hammers failed to clear an Arsenal attack, allowing Ramsey to head the ball back into the area. Lacazette held off Carlos Sanchez before slotting the ball across - intended for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang - but Diop was ahead of the striker to see the ball unwittingly turned home off his midriff. Issa Diop challenges Alexandre Lacazette Substitute Welbeck sealed the victory for Emery in the second minute of added time after Bellerin put the ball into the area through the legs of Arthur Masuaku, allowing the striker - in plenty of space - to slot home and give Arsenal their first three points of the season. Opta stats Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 10 Premier League London derbies at the Emirates in, winning seven and drawing three. West Ham United have lost their first three games of the Premier League season for the third time this decade (also 2010-11 & 2017-18) after doing this just five times between 1920 and 2010. Nacho Monreal celebrates his equaliser West Ham attacker Marko Arnautovic has had a hand in 14 Premier League goals in 2018 (eight goals, 6 assists), second only to Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (22). Issa Diop is only the eighth player to score an own-goal on his Premier League debut and the first to do so for West Ham United in the competition. Man of the match - Aaron Ramsey Ramsey was back in the starting XI after being dropped against Chelsea, replacing Mesut Ozil, and it was a solid performance from the Welshman in midfield. He was involved in plenty of the good, passing moves from Arsenal and could even have nabbed a goal if he had not have been offside. Should Ozil return for next weekend's game against Cardiff, Emery will have some tough decisions to make. Notes for Southgate Jack Wilshere played the full 90 minutes but was rather ineffective against his former side and picked up a booking. Michail Antonio did well on the wing, constantly getting the better of Hector Bellerin, and could be on the periphery of Gareth Southgate's thinking. Would VAR have made a difference? Perhaps for a few minor incidents. Mkhitaryan's free-kick in the 43rd minute hammered into the West Ham wall and there were some calls for a handball, but nothing was given by referee Graham Scott. There was another half penalty appeal in the 79th minute as Fabian Balbuena appeared to be holding back Danny Welbeck in the box, sending him to ground, but again, the appeals went unanswered. Alexandre Lacazette celebrates after his cross was turned in for an own goal by Issa Diop What's next? Arsenal will be live on Sky Sports next weekend when they travel to Cardiff in the Premier League on Renault Super Sunday. West Ham will be in action in midweek when they face AFC Wimbledon in the Carabao Cup live on Sky Sports Football before welcoming Wolves to the London Stadium in the Premier League on

However, that did not affect the visitors, who went ahead through Theo Walcott's breakaway strike (56), before Adam Smith also saw red for hauling back the Everton goalscorer. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Daniels (6), Steve Cook (6), Ake (7), Smith (6), Fraser (8), Gosling (6), Surman (6), Brooks (6), Wilson (7), King (6) Subs: Ibe (6), Lewis Cook (6), Mousset (6) Everton: Pickford (8), Holgate (6), Keane (6), Baines (6), Coleman (7), Walcott (9), Gueye (8), Davies (6), Sigurdsson (7), Richarlison (6), Tosun (6) Subs: Zouma (6), Bernard (6), Calvert-Lewin (6) Man of the match: Theo Walcott Marco Silva's team soon doubled their lead thanks to Michael Keane's header (66), only for the hosts to take a share of the spoils after goals in the final 15 minutes from Josh King - via the spot - and Nathan Ake. The two sides started in confident fashion having both begun the season unbeaten, although it was Bournemouth who created the better openings. Richarlison (centre) protests his innocence after being shown a red card by referee Lee Probert Callum Wilson spurned the first after 16 minutes when stroking the ball over the bar with just Jordan Pickford to beat, before Ake mistimed a header with the goal gaping six minutes before the break. Two minutes later, though, the visitors' task got a lot harder after a moment of recklessness from their £40m summer signing from Watford. Nathan Ake celebrates his 79th-minute equaliser Adam Smith and Richarlison squared up to each other in the area, with both placing their foreheads against each other, before the Brazilian forward appeared to lean his into his opponents. Referee Lee Probert immediately brandished the red card, with no action taken against Adam Smith, although it was Everton who actually opened the scoring with the first shot on target in the match. Cenk Tosun released Walcott down the right and the forward's pace sent him clear of the Bournemouth back line, before drilling the ball past Asmir Begovic at his near post. Team news Bournemouth were unchanged from last weekend's 2-1 win at West Ham, meaning record signing Jefferson Lerma had to settle for a place on the bench. Everton were without midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin due to a muscle injury, with Tom Davies coming in to replace the Frenchman in the visitors only change from last weekend's win over Southampton. The contest really appeared to swing Everton's way just past the hour-mark after Adam Smith was dismissed for pulling Walcott back as the winger latched on to Pickford's brilliant long through ball. Even more so when Keane - who later went to hospital with a head injury - headed in Sigurdsson's cross at the far post after Bournemouth were caught out as Everton took a quick free kick, only for the home team to score twice in the final quarter of an hour. Bournemouth were given hope when Leighton Baines gave Wilson a nudge in the back, with King converting the penalty 15 minutes from time. And just four minutes later Ake was on hand to stab home a rebound after Wilson's brilliant curling header from Jordon Ibe's right-wing corner had beaten Pickford, only to strike the post. Opta stats Premier League matches between Everton and Bournemouth have seen 4.14 goals on average (29 goals in seven games); the highest average for a Premier League fixture to have been played on more than six occasions Since the start of 2017-18 season, Bournemouth have won a league-high 25 points from losing positions in the Premier League Michael Keane scored his first Premier League goal for Everton, in what was his 33rd appearance in the competition for the Toffees Joshua King has been directly involved 38 Premier League goals for Bournemouth (31 goals, seven assists); 14 more than any other player Richarlison's red card was the 91st that Everton have been given in Premier League history; more than any other team in the competition Bournemouth defender Adam Smith's red card was his first in the Premier League, in what was his 98th appearance in the competition Notes for Southgate Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson gave Gareth Southgate another reminder of his predatory instincts on Saturday after helping set up both of his side’s goals. Meanwhile, Theo Walcott’s energetic display will surely not have gone unnoticed either by the England boss, with the speedy forward the best player on the pitch at the Vitality. Managers Eddie Howe: \"Another comeback and we're delighted to achieve it because - certainly at 2-0 down and 10 v 10 - it looked very difficult just from the mental perspective of how the game had gone for us to that point. \"The players went again and once we got the goal to go 2-1, the whole game changed, the momentum of the game changed and we were the stronger team at the end.\" 1:47 Howe hails team attitude Howe hails team attitude Marco Silva: \"It is naïve, it is something Richarlison can't do. It is something for the boy to learn fast, but it is something we can see many, many times in a football match. \"Both players to put their heads against one another and with minimum contact or movement as well. But it is smoothing he cannot do.\" 3:12 Silva: Richarlison was naive Silva: Richarlison was naive Man of the Match - Theo Walcott The forward - who scored in consecutive top-flight appearances for the first time as an Everton player and the first time since April 2017 - was a constant threat to Bournemouth with his pace and trickery, as shown with the visitors' opening goal on the south coast. And you can see the 29-year-old being a vital component in Marco Silva's forward line as the season progresses as he looks to stretch opposition defences on the counter. Theo Walcott celebrates after scoring the opening goal of the game What would VAR have changed? The red cards shown to Richarlison and Adam Smith would both have remained even if VAR had been in operation, while Bournemouth's second-half penalty would also have stood. 25 - Since the start of 2017-18 season, Bournemouth have won a league-high 25 points from losing positions in the Premier League.

Cardiff Jonathan Hogg was sent off after an off-the-ball tussle with Harry Arter as Huddersfield and Cardiff played out a 0-0 draw at the John Smith's Stadium. Huddersfield, without a Premier League point before the game and Cardiff without a goal, largely cancelled each other out in a game that was low in quality and lacking in chances. Hogg's sending off after 63 minutes resulted in Cardiff taking a grip of the game and they should have won it as Sean Morrison missed a gilt-edged chance with a header late on. Ultimately, it was a result that will suit neither side as Huddersfield remain in the relegation zone, while Cardiff's search for a Premier League goal continues. Player ratings Huddersfield: Hamer (6), Hadergjonaj (6), Jorgensen (6), Schindler (7), Kongolo (8), Hogg (4), Billing (6), Mooy (6), Van La Parra (5), Diahkaby (5), Mounie (6) Subs: Lossl (7), Mbenza (6), Depoitre (N/A) Cardiff: Etheridge (7), Manga (6), Bamba (7), Morrison (7), Bennett 7(), Murphy (6), Ralls (7), Arter (6), Camarasa (6), Mendez-Laing (6), Zohore (6) Subs: Paterson (6), Ward (6), Reid (6) Man of the match: Terence Kongolo With just five minutes played, both teams were forced into an early substitution. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing had done brilliantly to flick the ball over Christopher Schindler and then around Mathias Jorgensen but with the ball racing away from him, he slid in to shoot with the onrushing Ben Hamer blocking the effort before colliding into him. Both received treatment for their injuries with Mendez-Laing being stretchered off and Hamer following him a couple of minutes later after failing to shake off his knock. Callum Paterson replaced Mendez-Laing and Jonas Lossl came on for Hamer. The half-time whistle was a welcome interruption to a game that produced no shots on target in the opening 45 minutes. Harry Arter ended that particular drought after 51 minutes, drawing a comfortable save from substitute goalkeeper Lossl, before Steve Mounie forced a good stop from Neil Etheridge with a thumping header at the other end moments later. Team news David Wagner made five changes from the side beaten 6-1 by Manchester City last weekend. Aaron Mooy, Jonathan Hogg, Mathias Jorgensen, Rajiv Van La Parra and Adama Diakhaby were all brought in. Neil Warnock made just one change as Nathaniel Mendez-Laing came in for Junior Hoilett, who suffered a groin injury against Newcastle. With 63 minutes played, Huddersfield were reduced to 10 men. Arter and Hogg tussled inside the area from a Cardiff corner and the former's pleas for a penalty irked the Huddersfield captain who forcefully pulled him back up from the turf. The pair then squared up to each other before Hogg appeared to aim a headbutt in Arter's direction. Following a lengthy discussion with his assistant referee, Michael Oliver sent Hogg off and produced a yellow for Arter. With an extra man advantage, Cardiff began to dictate the game and Neil Warnock threw on two strikers - Danny Ward and Bobby Reid - in search of a winner. It was almost a centre-back who provided it, though, as Morrison rose above Lossl to meet a Joe Ralls corner inside the six-yard-box but he somehow nodded it just wide with the goal gaping. In the final minutes, all three of Cardiff's substitutes combined for a chance as Ward teed up Paterson whose cross was diverted agonisingly wide of the far post from Reid's deflected effort. After soaking up sustained Cardiff pressure for the final 20 minutes, Huddersfield nearly nicked it themselves, as Terence Kongolo burst forward before whipping a dangerous cross into the box and Sol Bamba just about managed to avoid scoring an own goal as he bundled the ball out for a corner and away from Laurent Depoitre. Man of the match - Terence Kongolo This was the kind of game where defenders, rather than attackers, thrived and Huddersfield's Terence Kongolo just about edged Cardiff's captain Sean Morrison as the best player on the pitch. Terence Kongolo and Danny Ward battle for possession The Dutchman has tended to play as a centre-back for Huddersfield but he showed invention in the final third at left-back, plundering a well-struck shot into the side netting in the first half before jinking past Calum Paterson with an excellent run in the second. He almost capped a promising performance with an assist late on as he galloped the length of the pitch before sending in a peach of a cross that was almost turned into his own net by Sol Bamba. Opta stats Huddersfield Town have scored just one goal in their last eight matches at the John Smith's Stadium in all competitions (W1 D2 L5), despite attempting 103 shots in those matches. Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock has won just one of his last 15 Premier League games as a manager (W1 D6 L8) and none of the last nine (W0 D5 L4). Cardiff's Neil Warnock has never lost in this fixture as a manager, winning four and drawing three of his seven games. Since the start of last season, Huddersfield Town have failed to score in 23 of their 41 Premier League games; more than any other team in this period. Cardiff City have won just one of their last 18 away games in the Premier League (W1 D4 L13). Huddersfield Town have failed to win their opening three league games of the season for the first time since 2015-16. At this stage last season, the Terriers had won two and drawn one of their three games in the Premier League. Two of Huddersfield Town's four red cards in the Premier League have been shown to Jonathan Hogg. The managers David Wagner: \"First of all, I think it was soft but Hoggy has to solve this problem much more cleverly, he has to go away. Both players were aggressive but one player was more clever than the other one and the clever one was not my player. \"In this situation, you have to step away and not invite your opponent to have the opportunity to react how he reacted. Hoggy can solve this problem if he steps away from it, this is how I see it. \"It was unfortunate because he's an experienced pro and he played a very good game for 60 minutes but in this situation he has shown what he usually wouldn't.\" Neil Warnock: \"At half-time, we changed a couple of things and I thought against 11 men we were a lot better, against ten we handled it quite well and should've scored a couple of goals really but that's been our season so far. \"We had good chances and we also had a load of opportunities to make a better pass in the box which we've been working on but it's difficult at this level, the top players create stuff out of nothing.\" What's next? Both teams are in Carabao Cup action next with Huddersfield facing Stoke City away and Cardiff entertaining Norwich City. Next up in the Premier League for Huddersfield is Everton away on Saturday while Cardiff are in Super Sunday action as they host Arsenal, live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event."},{"date":

"report": "2:59 Southampton 1-2 Leicester highlights Southampton 1-2 Leicester highlights Harry Maguire was the hero as his stoppage-time strike earned Leicester a 2-1 victory over 10-man Southampton at St Mary's. After a tepid first period, Ryan Bertrand opened the scoring seven minutes into a thrilling second half, but that lead lasted just four minutes as Demarai Gray capitalised on some poor Southampton defending to equalise. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg then took centre stage as he went down in the box 13 minutes from time, but instead of earning his side a penalty, referee Jonathan Moss brandished a second yellow for simulation, with a red to follow. Saints looked like they had done enough to hold on for a point, but Maguire had other ideas, as he drilled into the net through a sea of defenders (90+2) to snatch all three points for a Leicester side without the suspended Jamie Vardy. Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (6), Soares (5), Vestergaard (6), Hoedt (6), Bertrand (7), Hojbjerg (4), Lemina (7), Long (6), Ings (6), Elyounoussi (5), Redmond (6). Subs: Austin (6), Romeu (n/a), Armstrong (n/a) Leicester: Schmeichel (7), Chilwell 7), Morgan (6), Maguire (8), Mendy (7), Ndidi (7), Pereira (7), Amartey (6), Gray (7), Maddison (7), Iheanacho (5). Subs: , Albrighton (6), Okazaki (n/a), Ghezzal (n/a) Man of the match: Harry Maguire Mark Hughes named an attack-minded side as he went in search of a solution to Saints' woes in front of goal, especially on their own patch, but even such a multitude of options could not inspire the hosts in the first half. Nathan Redmond tested Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel low down to his right, before Danny Ings swivelled and fired for goal right on the stroke of half-time but the Denmark international was again equal to it. The second half was the antithesis of the first, with the action flowing from end to end. Ings almost broke the deadlock four minutes after the break but was denied by Schmeichel. Teams news Kelechi Iheanacho was the man to get the nod up front in place of the suspended Jamie Vardy for Leicester, with the former Manchester City striker leading the line on his own. Mohamed Elyounoussi was handed his full debut for Saints after recovering from injury, Charlie Austin was the man to miss out. Four changes in all for the hosts from their defeat at Everton, with Jannik Vestergaard also starting. Schmeichel, however, was powerless soon after as Bertrand struck. Hojbjerg's low cross rolled into the path of the Saints skipper on the edge of the box, but he timed his strike to perfection, powering the ball into the roof of the net. The game opened up as a result, with both sides creating chances, but Hojbjerg's senseless dismissal, as he tried to win a penalty despite no contact being made by Leicester's Daniel Amartey, ensured Saints tightened things up, content with a point. And they almost held out, until Maguire stepped up. Fed by Chilwell on the left, the England international strode forward, fired for goal, the ball came through plentiful Saints defenders, leaving McCarthy wrong-footed, as he could only look on as the ball rolled into the net for the winner. Demarai Gray celebrates his equaliser at St Mary's Stadium Man of the match - Harry Maguire Another performance to show why Leicester were demanding such an exorbitant fee for the England defender. His strike late in the day proved decisive, but some of his last-ditch defending was just as important at St Mary's. One moment, in particular, exemplified everything Maguire is about, as he nicked the ball off the toe of Ings in the first half, just as the former Liverpool striker looked sure to score. Maguire (10) made two more clearances than anyone else on the pitch. Notes for Southgate Maguire again showed why he is so integral to England with an assured display for Leicester. Bertrand's superb goal will certainly have attracted Gareth Southgate's attention, but no player gave the ball away more often than Bertrand at St Mary's. The other player to lose possession 21 times in the match? England hopeful Nathan Redmond. Opta stats Southampton have lost 24 points from leading positions in the Premier League since the start of 2017-18, the most of any team currently in the top-flight. Leicester finally won back-to-back away league matches at Southampton for the first time ever, on their 40th visit there (W5 D14 L21). Southampton have won just one of their last 13 Premier League matches at St Mary's (W1 D6 L6). Leicester City had lost six successive Premier League games that they'd fallen behind in, before today - previously winning from behind in March versus West Bromwich Albion (4-1). Since the start of last season, Leicester's Premier League games have seen eight red cards given, with only Everton's fixtures producing more in that period (11). Southampton's Ryan Bertrand celebrates his goal with team-mate Cedric Soares What's next?

Liverpool moved to the top of the Premier League with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Brighton at Anfield. Salah scored the only goal of the game - his 29th in 29 appearances for Liverpool at Anfield in all competitions - side-footing a first-time effort past Mat Ryan in the first half. Jurgen Klopp's side were far from their best and they had Alisson to thank late on when he pushed Pascal Gross' header past the post, but they held to maintain a 16-month undefeated league run at home and secure their best start to a Premier League season in five years. Liverpool, who were unbeaten in each of their last 22 Premier League games before the game, started in confident fashion. Salah combined with Sadio Mane, who failed to hit the target with an effort from the edge of the penalty area. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Gomez (6), Van Dijk (7), Robertson (7), Milner (7), Wijnaldum (8), Keita (6), Salah (7), Mane (7), Firmino (6). Subs: Henderson (6), Sturridge (6), Matip (n/a). Brighton: Ryan (7), Montoya (7), Duffy (7), Balogun (6), Bong (7), Knockaert (6), Stephens (6), Propper (6), March (6), Bissouma (5), Murray (7). Subs: Locadia (6), Jahanbakhsh (6), Gross (6). Man of the match: Georginio Wijnaldum Brighton were trying to stay compact but they were struggling to keep the hosts at bay. Roberto Firmino made an excellent run to the near post to meet Andrew Robertson's cross. The Brazil international made good contact with his header but he could not beat Ryan, who clawed the ball away from goal. The hosts continued to pile the pressure on and Trent Alexander-Arnold was the next to go close, clipping the crossbar with a free-kick and they finally made the breakthrough in the 23rd minute through Salah after Yves Bissouma lost possession 15 yards outside his own area. The hosts quickly sprang into action as James Milner picked out Firmino and the Brazilian laid the ball off for Salah, who produced a clinical finish to pick out the bottom corner via the inside of the post. Brighton almost snatched an equaliser early in the second half. Glenn Murray bundled his way into the penalty area and his cross was cleared only as far as Anthony Knockaert, who sliced his shot wide of the far post. Team news Liverpool named the same starting XI in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time since May 2017. There were two changes for Brighton from their win over Manchester United as Leon Balogun and Yves Bissouma came into the side to make their first Premier League starts in place of Lewis Dunk and Pascal Gross. Liverpool were struggling for rhythm but they nearly grabbed a second when Shane Duffy almost turned Robertson's cross past his own goalkeeper, while Alexander-Arnold had an opportunity to wrap up victory five minutes from time but his left-footed shot was deflected wide. Alisson was then called into action, producing a vital save as he parried wide Gross' header to ensure he became only the third Liverpool goalkeeper in the last 51 seasons alongside Bruce Grobbelaar, Pepe Reina and Simon Mignolet (twice) to keep a clean sheet in the first three league matches of a campaign. Davy Propper in action with Virgil van Dijk and Georginio Wijnaldum at Anfield Opta stats Liverpool have won their last six matches against Brighton in all competitions, scoring 21 goals and conceding just five. Of the 17 teams to play in the Premier League both last season and this season, Brighton have won the fewest points in their away games (11). Liverpool have kept 11 clean sheets in the Premier League in their 18 games since Virgil van Dijk's debut in January 2018, more than any other side in that period. Since the start of last season, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has been directly involved in 45 Premier League goals, (34 goals, 11 assists), 12 more than any other player in this period. Under Jurgen Klopp, Roberto Firmino has had a hand in 59 Premier League goals (36 goals, 23 assists), 14 more than any other Liverpool player. Man of the Match - Georginio Wijnaldum Georginio Wijnaldum (C) played a key role for Liverpool It was not the easiest of games for Liverpool but Wijnaldum produced a solid performance in the middle of the park. He kept things neat and tidy, completing 75 of his 76 passes in the game with a 98.7 per cent accuracy - his one misplaced pass came in the 80th minute. With Henderson getting closer and closer to full match fitness, Klopp will have some difficult decisions to make in the coming weeks with Wijnaldum in this kind of form. Notes for Southgate Notes for SouthgateTrent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez both started in Liverpool’s defence, helping Klopp’s side to a third straight clean sheet in the Premier League. Alexander-Arnold, who picked up a booking for a cynical foul on Jurgen Locadia, was also a threat at the other end of the pitch, clipping the crossbar with a free-kick. Jordan Henderson got another 23 minutes from the bench as he continued his comeback after his exploits at the World Cup, while Daniel Sturridge also got 10 minutes from the bench. Would VAR have made a difference? There were calls for a Liverpool penalty as Brighton goalkeeper Ryan clattered into Firmino as he came for Bissouma's wild, high clearance but referee Chris Kavanagh ruled it was the Liverpool player who had fouled the goalkeeper. What's next? Liverpool will be live on Sky Sports next weekend when they travel to Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday. Brighton will be in action in midweek when they face Southampton in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday before hosting Fulham at the Amex Stadium in the Premier League on Saturday."},{"date": "20/08/2019",

Crystal Palace 0-2 Liverpool Crystal Palace 0-2 Liverpool James Milner's penalty and Sadio Mane's late strike sealed a 2-0 win for Liverpool against Crystal Palace, who had Aaron Wan-Bissaka sent off on Monday Night Football. It had been an even opening period when Mamadou Sakho caught the ankles of Mohamed Salah in the area on the cusp of half-time - sending him down - and Milner put the resulting spot-kick past Wayne Hennessey. Salah was involved again as Palace ended the game with ten men when Wan-Bissakka brought down the Egypt international just outside the box in the 75th minute. It was a straight red card for the youngster, meaning he will miss the next three fixtures. Mane rounded off the victory in the third minute of added time as Liverpool hit their hosts on the break, with the Senegal forward slotting home to give Liverpool a second win of the season. Player ratings Crystal Palace: Hennessey (7), Wan-Bissaka (6), Van Aanholt (7), Tomkins (6), Sakho (6), Schlupp (5), McArthur (6), Milivojevic (6), Townsend (6), Zaha (6), Benteke (6). Subs used: Sorloth (5), Ward (4), Meyer (n/a). Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (7), Van Dijk (8), Gomez (7), Robertson (7), Wijnaldum (6), Milner (7), Keita (7), Salah (7), Mane (7), Firmino (6). Subs used: Henderson (6), Lallana (n/a), Sturridge (n/a). Man of the match: Virgil van Dijk. It was a fairly quiet first half until the 23rd minute when Naby Keita nicked the ball around Andros Townsend before taking a few strides and releasing a superb long pass for Salah. The forward tried to chip over Hennessey but under pressure, he sent the ball flying high into the crowd. Palace went close 90 seconds later when Townsend fired a curling effort towards goal but it smashed off the top corner of the crossbar. Wilfried Zaha attempted to net the rebound but it hammered off the back of Joe Gomez before going behind for a corner. Team news Both sides named an unchanged XI from their opening weekend fixtures. Max Meyer was named on the bench for Crystal Palace while Fabinho and Loris Karius missed out on the matchday 18 for Liverpool. Liverpool opened the scoring just before half-time through Salah, who was tripped in the area by Sakho, with referee Michael Oliver instantly pointing to the spot despite protests from the defender. Milner dispatched coolly past Hennessey. The second half began at a pace, with Salah rounding the oncoming Hennessey in the box early on but failing to chip home before Keita fired the cut-back from his team-mate just wide. At the other end, Alisson was called into action eight minutes after the restart as Luka Milivojevic curled a free-kick his way, but the Brazilian made a leaping save. With 15 minutes to play, Crystal Palace went down to ten men as Wan-Bissaka was given his marching orders. As Salah raced towards goal, the 20-year-old caught him around the ankles just outside the area and was shown a straight red card. Wilfried Zaha tries to get away from defenders at Selhurst Park Liverpool pushed for another as the game drew to a close and made the breakthrough in the 93rd minute. After clearing a Palace corner, Salah burst down the field before laying the ball off to Mane. He continued the run, shrugging off a challenge from Patrick van Aanholt and rounding the oncoming Hennessey before slotting home. Opta stats Liverpool won their 34th Premier League game played on a Monday - only Man Utd (43) and Arsenal (36) have more victories. Roy Hodgson suffered his 100th defeat in the Premier League as a manager (W87 D65 L100). Aaron Wan-Bissaka is the youngest Crystal Palace player to be shown a red card in the Premier League (20 years, 267 days). James Milner extended his current record for the most Premier League games scored in without losing any of them (48 Games: W38 D10 L0). Notes for Southgate The England manager and his assistant, Steve Holland, were in attendance and Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez put in a good shift in defence. Jordan Henderson also made a solid 23 minute cameo with Daniel Sturridge getting a few minutes - if that - towards the end. For Crystal Palace, Andros Townsend did well although Aaron Wan-Bissaka was sent off, and could have scuppered a chance to be named in Southgate's next England side. The managers Roy Hodgson: \"I considered us unlucky to have been on the wrong end of refereeing decisions, but that's my opinion. Other people can have theirs. \"Really and truly, I don't like talking about refereeing decisions. I can't change them, they obviously irritate me, they obviously anger me when it costs the team points but then I'm just like every other manager in football from Sunday league up to the Premier League.\" 3:40 Roy Hodgson was angry at the penalty decision Roy Hodgson was angry at the penalty decision Jurgen Klopp: \"They caused us as many problems as possible with these long balls and then if you win the second one, they try to get in behind really quickly in one-on-one situations with Zaha. \"We were there and helped each other to avoid big problems but it was not a brilliant performance from us tonight. A lot of players can play 70 per cent or 80 per cent better; it would have helped but we worked really hard and that's absolutely OK. I'm happy with the performance and very happy with the result.\" 5:10 Jurgen Klopp says the clean sheet was very pleasing Jurgen Klopp says the clean sheet was very pleasing Could VAR have made a difference? VAR would probably have been used a few times. Of course, there is the first-half penalty that was awarded and referee Oliver may have wanted to consult a replay before giving - or not giving - the spot-kick. There was also Wan-Bissaka's red card. Salah appeared to kick the ball away before the tackle, meaning there could have been a case for it not to have been a straight red card. Again, Oliver could have consulted a replay and his colleagues to make a decision. Naby Keita in action for Liverpool against Crystal Palace Man of the match - Virgil van Dijk It was another Premier League clean sheet for Liverpool, and Van Dijk was a big part of that. Crystal Palace had their fair share of chances - particularly in the first half - and he was key in making headers, tackles and blocks to keep Liverpool's 100 per cent record intact. What's next? Crystal Palace are live on Sky Sports again next weekend as they travel to Watford on Renault Super Sunday.

Subs used: Barnes (5), Vokes (5), Taylor (5). Watford: Foster (7), Janmaat (6), Cathcart (7), Kabasele (6), Holebas (7), Doucoure (8), Capoue (7), Hughes (7), Pereyra (7), Deeney (7), Gray (7). Subs used: Sema (6), Femenia (n/a), Success (n/a). Man of the match: Abdoulaye Doucoure. It was a fast start at Turf Moor, and Gray netted against his former side in the third minute after setting off the move. He picked out Deeney on the right before making a lung-busting run into the box, received the ball back from his captain, with his first touch sending the ball fizzing past Joe Hart. Three minutes later and Burnley were level. Johann Berg Gudmundsson delivered a corner for Tarkowski to head the ball into the back of the net, scoring his first goal for the Clarets in the process. Team news Burnley made no changes from their draw with Southampton last weekend, and five players kept their places from the midweek win against Istanbul Basaksehir. Watford named an unchanged XI and bench. There were few other chances for the remainder of the half, with Gundmundsson testing Ben Foster with a superb free kick in the 17th minute, but the Watford goalkeeper was equal to it. Hart also denied Deeney with six minutes of the half to play as the striker tried his luck from distance. Three was the magic number for Watford as, three minutes into the second half, Deeney doubled the Hornets' lead. After Ben Mee blocked his initial effort, the rebound landed to Doucoure who took out most of the Burnley defence with a superb slotted pass to Deeney on the right and he poked home around Hart. Troy Deeney was on target for Watford in their 3-1 win at Burnley Two minutes later, and Hughes added the third with a wonderful strike. He latched onto a wayward pass from Matt Lowton before striding towards the top of the area before hammering the ball past a leaping Hart, who could have done little to keep it out. Although Burnley saw the better of the ball for the remainder of the half, they rarely looked like troubling the Watford defence. The closest they came to a goal was in the 70th minute as Gudmundsson delivered a free kick into the area which was nearly headed home by substitute Sam Vokes, but it whistled past the post. Notes for Southgate Joe Hart conceded his first league goals in Burnley colours - although there was little he could do about the third - and did have a couple of nervy moments. James Tarkowski was generally solid at the back, and capped things off with a goal while Jack Cork had a fairly quiet afternoon in midfield. For Watford, Hughes scored a wonderful solo goal and put in a good performance, particularly in the second half. Opta stats Watford have won their opening two matches in a top-flight league season for only the second time. On the previous occasion (1982-83), they ended 2nd in the league behind Liverpool. Burnley are now winless in seven successive Premier League matches (W0 D3 L4) and have an aggregate score of 4-13 in these games. 3 - Three different English players have scored in a league match for Watford for the first time since December 31st 2011 (vs Doncaster Rovers). Trio. pic.twitter.com/1dlhv4HQcF — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) August 19, 2018 Since their first season back in the Premier League after re-promotion in 2016-17, this is only the second time that Burnley have conceded 3+ goals in a home match (alongside 0-3 v Tottenham Hotspur in December 2017). Andre Gray's opening goal ended a run of 730 minutes without a Premier League away goal for Watford. Indeed, Gray was the last Hornets' player to score on the road in the competition before today; at Manchester City on January 2nd 2018. The managers Sean Dyche: \"We gave them two out of the three, for sure. Will Hughes scored a great goal but he shouldn't have been on the pitch. I saw the tackle, I'm right on top of it and I don't think he's even on the pitch when he makes the tackle, it's that far off the pitch on Stephen Ward, but the referee made a decision and decided not to send him off. \"We were certainly part of our own downfall today. We didn't start the first three or four minutes of the game right. The rest of the first half, I thought we were very good and the first five or six minutes of the second half, we started a bit soft.\" 3:14 Dyche: We gave it away Dyche: We gave it away Javi Gracia: \"It was a challenge for us to improve on previous away games. We got a good result today, we played well and we continued with the same play as we have before. \"I'm happy with the first half too but the second half, we were given a step forward and controlled the game until the last moments. We created many chances, had many shots on target - more than Burnley - and I'm happy for that.\" 2:19 Gracia delighted with perfect start Gracia delighted with perfect start Would VAR have made a difference? There were a couple of instances where VAR could have been called upon. In the 29th minute, there was a scramble in the area as Jeff Hendrick appeared to go down under pressure from Craig Cathcart but no penalty was given. There was also a crunching tackle from Hughes on Stephen Ward in front of the dugouts and although he was given a yellow card, replays may have put it as a red card offence. Also in the 90th minute, there was a confrontation between Matt Lowton and Isaac Success with the Burnley man appearing to stand on Success' hand as he walked past. There could yet be retrospective action from the FA with referee Paul Tierney not showing any cards. James Tarkowski celebrates his equaliser against Watford Man of the match - Abdoulaye Doucoure The midfielder had a wonderful game at Turf Moor and was the heart of Watford's engine room. He martialled things well as Burnley scrapped to find a goal in the second half and his pass for Deeney's goal was nothing short of world class. If he can maintain that level of performance for the entire season, things are looking bright for Watford. What's next? It's another Europa League game for Burnley on Thursday as they travel to Olympiakos in the first leg of their play-off tie to qualify for the group stages. They then face Fulham next Sunday in the Premier League. For Watford, they also play on Sunday 26 August - live on Sky Sports - as they welcome Crystal Palace to Vicarage Road."},{"date": "19/08/2019", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54021,

6-1 Huddersfield Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick as Manchester City swept Huddersfield aside with an emphatic 6-1 victory on Super Sunday. City's all-time leading goalscorer was on target twice in the first half (25, 35), either side of a low finish from Gabriel Jesus, as the champions took total control of their first home game of the new Premier League season. Jon Stankovic tapped in a lifeline for Huddersfield two minutes before half-time, but David Silva's sublime free-kick re-established City's three-goal cushion on 47 minutes. Aguero sealed the 13th hat-trick of his Manchester City career 14 minutes from the end, before Terence Kongolo's own goal six minutes from time completed the rout as Pep Guardiola's side laid down an early marker in the title race. Player ratings Man City: Ederson (8), Laporte (7), Stones (7), Kompany (7), Mendy (8), D Silva (9), Fernandinho (7), Gundogan (7), B Silva (7), Aguero (9), Jesus (8). Subs: Mahrez (6), Sane (7), Foden (n/a) Huddersfield: Hamer (3), Smith (5), Stankovic (6), Kongolo (4), Schindler (6), Lowe (6), Hadergjonaj (6), Billing (6), Pritchard (5), Sabiri (6), Mounie (6). Subs: Depoitre (6), Diakhaby (6), Sobhi (n/a) Man of the match: Sergio Aguero Goalkeeper Ederson was the architect of the opening goal in the 25th minute, hitting a goal-kick long into the path of Aguero who evaded the attention of Christopher Schindler and chipped the onrushing Ben Hamer from the edge of the penalty area. Aguero celebrates with David Silva in the first half The second came six minutes later when Mendy cut in from the left and exchanged passes with Jesus before the ball ricocheted back into the path of the striker and he shot low with his left foot past Hamer's near post. The Huddersfield goalkeeper was slow getting down, but Aguero's second four minutes later was even more embarrassing. Hamer palmed Mendy's left-wing cross back out into play and the Argentine was alert to tap into an empty net. Team news Pep Guardiola raised eyebrows with his team selection, leaving out Kyle Walker, Raheem Sterling and Riyad Mahrez. They were replaced by Gabriel Jesus, Vincent Kompany and David Silva with Kevin De Bruyne injured and Leroy Sane on the bench. Jon Stankovic made his first Huddersfield appearance since March 2017. Huddersfield somehow found a way into the game on 43 minutes when Philip Billing's throw-in was flicked on by Steve Mounie for Stankovic to prod in from close range, but the respite was only temporary as David Silva stepped up to curl a brilliant free-kick past Hamer two minutes after half-time. Silva scored with a wonderful free-kick With the result beyond doubt, Aguero chased his hat-trick and went close when his left-footed long-ranger fizzed back off the post in the 57th minute and he lashed over two minutes later after a one-two with Jesus. But his third goal arrived with his last touch of the game in the 76th minute as he expertly back-heeled Mendy's cross across Hamer before his replacement Leroy Sane engineered a sixth goal when his close-range effort was blocked by Hamer and bounced in off the unfortunate Kongolo. The result puts City top of the fledgling Premier League table and will leave many wondering if they can possibly be stopped in their pursuit of back-to-back titles. Match stats City are the first reigning Premier League champions to win their first two games of the season since they themselves managed to do so at the beginning of 2014/15 . Huddersfield have conceded nine goals in their first two matches this season; only one side in Premier League history has conceded more - Wigan Athletic in 2010/11 (10). City have now scored 104 goals in 39 games at home under Pep Guardiola in the Premier League. David Silva's strike was his first ever direct free-kick goal in a league match in the top five European Leagues, in what was also his 250th Premier League appearance. With his assist to Aguero for the opening goal, Ederson became the first goalkeeper to assist a Premier League goal for Manchester City. Aguero has now scored nine hat-tricks in the Premier League (level with Robbie Fowler), only Alan Shearer (11) has managed more. Man of the Match - Sergio Aguero Jermain Defoe on Sky Sports: \"He is a special player. The finish for the third goal was unbelievable. I said before the game he looked sharp and he could have scored five today. The movement for the hat-trick goal is what we need to be teaching kids. He got across the near post and the finish was great. He is a genius.\" Notes for Gareth Southgate John Stones was the only member of Gareth Southgate’s World Cup squad to feature and while he looked impressive bringing the ball out of defence, he was at fault for Huddersfield’s goal as he lost concentration at the set-piece and allowed Stankovic to get a yard on him and score. The England boss will have noted that both Kyle Walker and Raheem Sterling were benched after starting at Arsenal last weekend, though time will tell if that if they have slipped down the pecking order or if it is simply part of Pep Guardiola’s post-World Cup recovery strategy. What's next? Manchester City are live on Sky Sports Premier League again next Saturday lunchtime when they face newly-promoted Wolves at Molineux, while Huddersfield also play a promoted side as they welcome Cardiff on Saturday afternoon."},{"date": "19/08/2019", "arena": "Amex Stadium", "attendance": 30592, "home_team": {"name": "Brighton and Hove Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Mathew Ryan", "yellows":

Manchester United on Renault Super Sunday. There was sheer jubilation inside the Amex Stadium as two goals in two minutes from Glenn Murray and Shane Duffy put Brighton two up inside 27 minutes. Romelu Lukaku halved the deficit on 34 minutes with a close-range header but there was no respite for the beleaguered United defence as Pascal Gross won and converted a penalty on the stroke of half-time to put Brighton in control. Paul Pogba scored a penalty in stoppage-time but it came too late to inspire a comeback as Jose Mourinho, in the week in which he accused Manchester City of lacking class, was left to reflect on a gulf in class on the field. Player ratings Brighton: Ryan (7), Montoya (7), Dunk (5), Duffy (8), Bong (7), Propper (7), Stephens (7), Gross (8), March (8), Knockaert (7), Murray (8).

Subs: Rashford (5), Lingard (5), Fellaini (5). Man of the Match: Shane Duffy. Brighton lost captain Lewis Dunk to injury after an even opening 21 minutes, but rather than handing United the opportunity to expose any defensive weaknesses, the Seagulls went on the attack to devastating effect. After Anthony Knockaert dragged a shot wide, Solly March drilled a cross into the United area where Murray nipped ahead of his marker to deftly chip his first goal of the season beyond David de Gea. Goalscorer Glenn Murray tormented the United defence throughout Brighton celebrations turned to pandemonium two minutes later as United failed to clear their lines from a corner on no more than three occasions, allowing Duffy time to rifle a quick-fire second. United were shell-shocked and bereft of ideas until a cross under pressure from Luke Shaw found Lukaku in space in between the advancing Brighton centre-backs, and the Belgium international nodded home from close range. Team news Brighton made two changes from their opening-day defeat at Watford. Both came at full-back as Bruno and Bernardo come out made way for Martin Montoya and Gaetan Bong. After a summer of speculation, Anthony Martial started for Manchester United, with Alexis Sanchez not in the squad. Ashley Young replaced Matteo Darmian at right-back while Romelu Lukaku got the nod ahead of Marcus Rashford in attack. But the momentum was soon back in Brighton's possession as a needless Eric Bailly lunge on Gross, who was going away from goal, handed Brighton a penalty, which the German dispatched through the legs of De Gea. Mourinho brought Jesse Lingard and Marcus Rashford on at the break, and Marouane Fellaini on the hour, in a bid to inject some life into his struggling side. Pascal Gross celebrates after restoring Brighton's two-goal lead United improved slightly but took an age to test Maty Ryan, Pogba's curling shot from the edge of the area drawing the Brighton goalkeeper into action 16 minutes from time. And by the time Pogba had converted a penalty deep into stoppage-time, after Duffy had brought Fellaini down, it was too little too late as Brighton basked in another memorable victory. Opta stats Since taking charge of Manchester United at the start of the 2016/17 season, the only opponent Jose Mourinho has lost against more often than Brighton (2) is his former club Chelsea (4). Brighton have lost just one of their last eight home games in the Premier League (W5 D2 L1), with the two most recent both being wins against Manchester United (1-0 in 2017/18 and 3-1 in 2018/19). This was only the tenth time in Premier League history that Manchester United conceded three first half goals in a game, and the first time since October 2015 v Arsenal. Manchester United lost their first away game of a Premier League campaign for the first time since 2012/13, when they lost 0-1 against Everton at Goodison Park. 23 of Glenn Murray's 24 goals in the Premier League have been scored from inside the box, including 100% of those scored for Brighton in the competition (13/13). Pascal Gross has scored eight goals in the Premier League, with all eight coming at home. Only Georginio Wijnaldum (18) and Clive Wilson (9) have netted more goals exclusively at home. Paul Pogba ended on the losing side in a Premier League game he scored in for the very first time - prior to today, Manchester United had won each of the previous 11 games he had netted in, which was a joint-record in the competition (with Ryan Babel for Liverpool - 11 games). The managers 3:29 Chris Hughton insisted beating Manchester United \"doesn't change anything\" and Brighton should still be prepared for a tough season Chris Hughton insisted beating Manchester United \"doesn't change anything\" and Brighton should still be prepared for a tough season Chris Hughton: \"The tempo right from the start, we always had an outlet. If you score three goals against any of the top six, it's always a good feat. We forced things our way today with a very good performance. On the whole the team were excellent.\" 3:56 Jose Mourinho does not want to be critical of his players as people \"do not accept it\" and says he will only speak of them positively Jose Mourinho does not want to be critical of his players as people \"do not accept it\" and says he will only speak of them positively Jose Mourinho: \"I was not expecting big mistakes. We are not speaking about small mistakes, we made big mistakes, and we were punished by them. Of course when you lose your confidence, you lose a bit of the game plan.\" Man of the Match - Shane Duffy The Irishman was a force at the back throughout and took the loss of defensive partner Dunk in his stride. He proved his worth in both boxes with a finish befitting of a striker for Brighton's second goal. Conceded a late penalty but not even that could take away from Duffy's immense display. What's next?

Newcastle Highlights: Cardiff 0-0 Newcastle Kenedy saw a last-gasp penalty saved - having earlier escaped a red card - as 10-man Newcastle missed the chance to snatch victory at Cardiff on Saturday. Cardiff had the better of the game and should have broken the deadlock when Kenneth Zohore headed wide early in the second half. Newcastle looked laboured and, after Kenedy avoided a red card for kicking out at Victor Camarasa, substitute Isaac Hayden was sent off in the 66th minute for sliding in from behind on Josh Murphy. Player ratings Cardiff: Etheridge (8), Morrison (5), Manga (6), Bennett (6), Bamba (6), Camarasa (6), Arter (6), Ralls (6), Murphy (8), Hoilett (5), Zohore (5) Subs: Reid (5), Mendez-Laing (5), Paterson (5) Newcastle: Dubravka (6), Dummett (6), Clark (6), Lascelles (6), Manquillo (5), Ritchie (5), Diame (5), Shelvey (5), Kenedy (3), Perez (5), Joselu (5) Subs: Hayden (4), Murphy (5), Muto (5) Man of the match: Josh Murphy But Cardiff could not capitalise and were fortunate in the end to leave with a point from a goalless draw after Neil Etheridge saved Kenedy's penalty with almost the final kick of the match. The miss capped a dismal display from Kenedy, while Etheridge has now saved a spot-kick in both of Cardiff's opening two matches of the season. Last weekend it was in a 2-0 defeat to Bournemouth but on this occasion Etheridge's save earned Cardiff a point they will likely feel they deserved on the balance of play. Javier Manquillo battles for possession with Josh Murphy Etheridge was called into action to keep out early efforts from Kenedy and Ayoze Perez, but, at the other end, Sol Bamba saw a header from a corner blocked on the line. The visitors appeared fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men in the 34th minute when Kenedy kicked out at Camarasa and escaped punishment. Zohore then went close with a header before Etheridge saved again from Perez. 0 - Kenedy failed to complete a single pass in the first half against Cardiff City - he is the first outfield Premier League player to fail to complete a single pass in 45+ minutes of play since Nikola Kalinic against Birmingham City in March 2010. Passenger. pic.twitter.com/6EZbhRNI9B — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) August 18, 2018 Cardiff continued to look the more positive side after half-time and Zohore should have scored when he headed wide from Joe Ralls' cross in the 54th minute. Newcastle were finding it difficult to get out of their own half and their efforts were hampered further when Hayden was shown a straight red for a tackle from behind on the impressive Murphy. Team news Harry Arter, Victor Camarasa and Josh Murphy made their first starts for Cardiff while Keneth Zohore replaced Bobby Reid in attack. Newcastle made one change as Javier Manquillo replaced the injured DeAndre Yedlin. Harry Arter, who escaped a red for a sliding challenge from behind on Joselu, shot wide as Cardiff pressed for a winner, but in the end it was Newcastle who went closest to breaking the deadlock. Cardiff captain Sean Morrison blocked Yoshinori Muto's cross with his arm and Kenedy stepped up to take the penalty, only to see Etheridge guess right and save. What would VAR have changed? Kenedy might have been sent off after kicking Victor Camarasa in the first half. “Kenedy should have been sent off,” said Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carrgaher. “I cannot understand how the referee hasn’t seen it, because he gives a free-kick for it. He kicks out and it’s a red card.\" However, Carragher also felt Harry Arter could have been sent off for a challenge from behind on Joselu in the second half. \"That's worse than Kenedy's challenge. It's a red,\" said Carragher. Opta stats Cardiff have failed to score in three consecutive league games for the first time since November 2015. Newcastle are now unbeaten in their last 11 league meetings with Cardiff, winning 10 and drawing one, since a 0-1 defeat in February 1981. Cardiff have failed to score in their opening two games of a top-flight season for the first time since 1952/53. In all competitions, Cardiff manager Neil Warnock is now winless in his last 10 matches against Newcastle (W0 D3 L7), since a 1-0 win as Sheffield United boss in November 2006. Newcastle defender Isaac Hayden is the first sub to be sent off in a Premier League game since Daniel Amartey for Leicester City v Manchester United in December 2017. Only Everton (9), Blackburn (7) and Southampton (6) have had more subs sent off in the Premier League than Newcastle (5, also Man City, Man Utd and Sunderland). Neil Etheridge is the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in two consecutive Premier League appearances within the same season since Thomas Sorensen in December 2009 (v Arsenal and Wigan Athletic). Man of the match - Josh Murphy While his twin brother Jacob started on the bench for Newcastle, Josh made an impact from the start for Cardiff. The winger tormented Javier Manquillo in the first half and did the same to his replacement Hayden before he was dismissed for fouling Murphy from behind. What's next? Cardiff travel to Huddersfield next Saturday before a home tie with Norwich in the second round of the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, August 28. Newcastle are live on Sky Sports again next Sunday when they host Chelsea.

Theo Walcott finished off a well-worked free-kick with 15 minutes on the clock, when Leighton Baines' short pass was played forward from the edge of the box by Morgan Schneiderlin for Walcott to chip Alex McCarthy. Richarlison continued his bright start in a blue shirt with a second with half an hour gone, as Walcott turned provider to beat Ryan Bertrand down the right and provide a simple cross for the Brazilian to nod home at the near post. Southampton improved after half-time but Danny Ings' close-range finish from a corner nine minutes into the second half proved a false dawn, as Everton looked more likely to score the next goal - although they will be happy to settle for a first three points of the season. Player ratings Everton: Pickford (7), Coleman (7), Holgate (8), Keane (7), Baines (7), Schneiderlin (6), Gueye (6), Walcott (8), Sigurdsson (8), Richarlison (8), Tosun (7). Subs: Davies (7), Calvert-Lewin (7), Niasse (n/a). Southampton: McCarthy (6), Cedric (5), Stephens (5), Hoedt (5), Bertrand (5), Ward-Prowse (6), Lemina (5), Romeu (5), Redmond (5), Austin (5), Ings (6). Subs: Long (6), Gabbiadini (5), Armstrong (n/a). Man of the match: Richarlison Set-pieces were the story of much of the game, and even before Everton's first goal had provided a warning shot to Mark Hughes and his side. Michael Keane and Cenk Tosun both headed Gylfi Sigurdsson deliveries straight at Alex McCarthy, while Charlie Austin nodded wide when unmarked at the opposite end. Any warning Southampton might have heeded could not have anticipated Everton's opener though, as a short free-kick from Baines was met with a slide-rule pass from Schneiderlin forward to Walcott. He provided a composed finish over an onrushing McCarthy for a brilliantly-executed training ground move. Ings was then let-off a horrendous miss by the quality of a Jordan Pickford save in keeping out his effort from four yards after the goalkeeper had spilt a tame shot from Cedric into his path. The ball cannoned up and onto the bar with Pickford's rapid reactions, but he shouldn't have had a chance to make the save. Team news Everton's one change was enforced following Phil Jagielka's suspension, and Mason Holgate was chosen by Marco Silva as his replacement. Danny Ings was given his first Southampton start after impressing off the bench against Burnley, and Jannik Vestergaard's illness saw him miss out of the 18 entirely. Instead, after losing Schneiderlin to injury Everton showed a clinical touch to double their advantage when Walcott found space on the right and crossed for Richarlison, who had ghosted inside off the left and out-jumped Cedric to beat McCarthy at his near post. After half-time Ings did finally get his first goal for his new club, when Mario Lemina nodded on a Bertrand corner to leave him with a simple finish. But Southampton failed to build on that, and instead Walcott was guilty of passing up the only clear-cut chance left in the game, when Tosun unselfishly returned the ball when well-placed, only for him to scuff it beyond the post with the goal gaping. What would VAR have changed? Mark Hughes was incensed Jordan Pickford wasn't punished for catching Danny Ings with a foot in the stomach when clearing a ball forward in the second half, and leaving the Southampton player with a ripped shirt. Hughes felt the Everton goalkeeper should have been sent off, something VAR could have ruled on. Everton continued searching for a third goal but while they could not find it, were in fine form to see off Southampton and pick up their first win of the season. Man of the match - Richarlison The Brazilian's energy levels and willingness to get on the ball, and make things happen, were just as impressive as they had been at Wolves a week ago, although Gylfi Sigurdsson's performance would run him close in the man of the match stakes. Richarlison's looking like a player who might just be worth the inflated fee Everton paid for him on current form, although it is very early days, and showed his worth with and without the ball against Southampton. One perfect sliding challenge on Cedric well inside his own half showcased his commitment to the cause, and he took on more duels than anyone else in blue, while making more clearances too. Notes for Gareth Southgate Jordan Pickford impressed for Everton with a wondersave before half-time to keep out Danny Ings' effort from close-range. The Southampton man, who has a single call-up to England in the past, did go on to score in his first start of the season. Reaction Marco Silva: \"It's an important three points for us, it's important that it was enjoyable for our fans as well. In the first half we did very well, we tried to do things differently in the second half and manage the game. \"But things were a bit slow, and conceding the goal gave Southampton some belief. After 25-30 minutes of the second half though, we had enough to score the third goal and we would have deserved it.\" Mark Hughes: \"I'm disappointed with the outcome, clearly. In general play, in the first half we had the better of the chances but found ourselves 2-0 down. \"We had good chances - I thought Danny had missed a clear-cut chance and hit the bar, but it was a great save so credit to the lad, and I thought he was lucky to stay on later in the game with his challenge on Danny because I felt he followed through and should've been sent off.\" Opta

It was Wolves defender Matt Doherty who gave the Foxes the lead in the 29th minute as he powered a header into his own net, before James Maddison hit home on the stroke of half-time to seal the victory. Leicester ended the game with 10 men as Vardy was sent off in the 66th minute following a crunching studs-up tackle on Doherty. Wolves were denied by the woodwork on three occasions and gave the Leicester defence plenty to think about, but were unable to make the breakthrough on a frustrating afternoon.

Sixty seconds later, some good work from Raul Jimenez saw him keep the ball in play before cutting back for Doherty, but his attempted strike was kept out by the legs of Ben Chilwell. The visitors rattled the woodwork for a second time in the 22nd minute as Jimenez latched onto a loose ball at the top of the area before hitting a thunderous volley. Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel leapt to make the save - pushing the ball onto the crossbar - and was lucky the rebound off his back did not go in. Team news Claude Puel made four changes with Jonny Evans, Jamie Vardy, Nampalys Mendy and Marc Albrighton coming into the XI. Wolves had an unchanged starting 11 and club-record signing Adama Traore was named on the bench. Leicester took the lead seven minutes later although it came from Doherty's head. Albrighton whipped a lovely ball into the area from the right, with Conor Coady getting a slight touch before Doherty powered a header past his own goalkeeper. On the stroke of half-time, the Foxes doubled their lead. Ricardo Pereira strode towards the top of the box before being fouled, but the loose ball fell to a waiting Maddison who hit hard and low to send the ball past Patricio, albeit taking a deflection off Ryan Bennett on the way through. Jamie Vardy was sent off for Leicester in their 2-0 win over Wolves Wolves made two half-time changes, introducing Leo Bonatini and club-record signing Adama Traore, who was involved instantly. He lofted a ball towards the back post for Jimenez but his shot was once again blocked by the legs of Chilwell. Not long after, Demarai Gray also had a long-range effort, but his strike sailed past Patricio's upright. Leicester went down to 10 men in the 66th minute after a terrible tackle from Vardy. He launched into a challenge on Doherty and while he initially got the ball, his studs were on show as he slammed into the back of the defender's knee. At close range, referee Dean had no choice but to show a straight red card. Notes for Southgate There were strong performances from youngsters Ben Chilwell, Demarai Gray and James Maddison with U21s coach Aidy Boothroyd in attendance to see them flourish. Harry Maguire was solid at the back as ever, but Jamie Vardy showed a flash of ill-discipline to see him sent off. He will miss the next three matches, meaning he will not have any game time ahead of the September internationals which could jeopardise his place in Gareth Southgate's side. The visitors struck the crossbar for the third time in the 80th minute as Jimenez scooped a ball towards the back post for Jonny, but he struck the top corner on a tight angle. Five minutes later, and Neves went for the spectacular from 20 yards, but Schmeichel made a superb, leaping save to keep him out as Leicester won their first game of the new season. Opta stats Leicester have beaten Wolves in the top-flight for the first time since December 1983 (5-1 at Filbert Street), drawing once and losing twice also since then. Wolves have won just one of their eight visits to the King Power Stadium in all competitions (D3 L4), winning 4-1 in the Championship in May 2007. Leicester have benefited from four own-goals in the Premier League since the start of last season, a joint-high along with Tottenham. Since 2015/16, no player has picked up more red cards in the Premier League than Jamie Vardy (3, also Miguel Britos, Simon Francis, Sadio Mane and Victor Wanyama). The managers Claude Puel: \"It was not his [Vardy's] intention to make a foul and he touched the ball. He was enthusiastic and it is a pity. We need now to find a solution to replace him and it will be a good opportunity for another player to show their quality. 5:02 Claude Puel felt it was a well-earned victory for his Leicester side over Wolves Claude Puel felt it was a well-earned victory for his Leicester side over Wolves \"Perhaps after touching the ball, he touches the player. It was not aggressive and he has been unlucky with this tackle.\" Nuno Espirito Santo: \"We started well, we controlled the game and we created enough chances. We must believe we can score in every moment - at the beginning, the middle and the end of the game. 2:08 Nuno Espirito Santo says his Wolves side must believe that they can score anytime and not give up in matches Nuno Espirito Santo says his Wolves side must believe that they can score anytime and not give up in matches \"Last week we drew and today we lost, but we are playing the way we want and the team has a lot of things to improve. This is our job and we'll do what we can with the maximum of our strengths.\" The pundit Matt Le Tissier: \"There's a lot of positives to take of this game for Wolves. I was really impressed by them and they were very unfortunate to lose this game 2-0. The first goal was a very unfortunate own goal, and Wolves could've been 2-0 up at that point. They hit the woodwork a couple of times, and I thought they were the better side in the first half. 3:01 Matt Le Tissier says Wolves should be upbeat despite their defeat, believing them to have played far better than their defeat suggests Matt Le Tissier says Wolves should be upbeat despite their defeat, believing them to have played far better than their defeat suggests \"I don't think there'll be any questions marks about that [Vardy's red card]. He went in with far too much aggression that was needed for the challenge... I don't think there'll be any complaints or an appeal. Wolves actually looked more dangerous when they were playing against 11 men than they did against 10.\" Man of the match - James Maddison Demarai Gray celebrates with Marc Albrighton after Leicester's opener It was another strong performance from Leicester's No 10, who capped off his second game with a goal. Although he had a quiet opening half hour, he soon found his feet and linked up well with Gray and Pereira in attack. He deserved a goal after his efforts against Man Utd last weekend went unanswered, and Leicester fans will be hoping it is the first of many. What's next? Leicester will take on Southampton at St Mary's next weekend in the Premier League while Wolves will face a tough fixture against Premier League champions Manchester City at Molineux in the Saturday

Spurs to a 3-1 win over Fulham at Wembley. Lucas Moura gave Spurs the lead on the stroke of half-time with a wonderful curling effort from the edge of the area but Aleksandar Mitrovic equalised shortly after the break with an opportunistic close-range header. Spurs regained the lead with a quarter of an hour remaining as Kieran Trippier bent in a free-kick from distance before Kane rounded off the victory with a clinical finish. 1 - Harry Kane has scored a Premier League goal in August for the first time ever, in his 15th game in the month. Finally. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) August 18, 2018 The result means that Spurs have collected six points from their opening two games this season while Fulham, despite a promising performance, are still without a point. Player ratings Tottenham: Lloris (7), Alderweireld (6), Sanchez (5), Vertonghen (6), Trippier (8), Dier (7), Eriksen (6), Davies (7), Lucas (8), Dele (7), Kane (7) Subs: Dembele (7), Lamela (7), Winks (N/A) Fulham: Fabri (7), Fosu-Mensah (6), Chambers (6), Le Marchand (6), Bryan (7), Seri (7), Anguissa (6), Cairney (7), Kamara (6), Sessegnon (6), Mitrovic (7) Subs: Johansen (6), Christie (N/A), Schurrle (N/A) Man of the match: Kieran Trippier It had been a tough week for Spurs following the news that their move into the new stadium at White Hart Lane had been delayed but they made a fast start at their temporary home. Lucas missed a gilt-edged chance with a header before Kane saw a goal ruled out shortly afterwards when the Brazilian had been adjudged to have fouled Fabri in the build-up. Kane also had a penalty appeal waved away in a decision that incensed his manager Mauricio Pochettino. After a subdued start, Fulham grew into the game and had two decent opportunities to score after the half-hour mark as Tom Cairney and long-term Spurs transfer target Ryan Sessegnon forced Hugo Lloris into smart saves. Sandwiched in between those efforts was a Christian Eriksen free-kick that drew a good stop from Fabri. However, it was Spurs who took the lead and it was an exceptional strike that broke the deadlock. Lucas was lively from the outset and when Calum Chambers' clearance fell to his feet he confidently dispatched a curling effort with his weaker left foot beyond the despairing dive of Fabri for his first Premier League goal on 43 minutes. Team news Mauricio Pochettino made two changes to his side from last weekend's win over Newcastle with Toby Alderweireld and Kieran Trippier replacing Moussa Sissoko and Serge Aurier. Those alterations meant that Spurs started in a 3-4-3 system.Slavisa Jokanovic made three changes as Timothy Fosu-Mensah, André-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Aboubakar Kamara came into the side. Rather than being deflated by that goal, Fulham came out for the second half in confident mood and almost equalised after a couple of minutes when Mitrovic's low shot hit the post with Lloris rooted to the spot. The Serbian would not be denied, though, and soon after he was on hand to head the ball in from under the bar after Sessegnon's miscued shot had bounced into his path. Kieran Trippier's stunning free-kick restored Tottenham's lead That goal roused Spurs and they almost went ahead when Dele Alli's goal-bound effort was blocked on the line by Maxime Le Marchand before Kane smashed the crossbar from a Trippier cross. Eventually, they made their pressure pay as Trippier - recalled to the starting line-up at Serge Aurier's expense - whipped a free-kick into the bottom corner in a strike reminiscent of his effort for England against Croatia at the World Cup. Notes for Southgate Gareth Southgate will have been pleased with what he saw from his England contingent as a number of Spurs players impressed at Wembley. Harry Kane and Kieran Trippier were both on the scoresheet, Eric Dier performed well in midfield and Dele Alli was a constant threat with his intelligent movement. He would have also been pleased to see Harry Winks make his long-awaited return from injury as the midfielder came on in the latter stages for his first appearance since February. The third came swiftly afterwards as Kane, after 15 games, 1065 minutes and 49 shots, finally scored his first Premier League goal in August. Substitute Erik Lamela led a counter-attack after a Fulham free-kick appeal had been denied and laid the ball into Kane's path and he made no mistake with the finish, curling it ruthlessly into the far corner. Opta stats Tottenham have won nine of their last 10 Premier League meetings with Fulham, losing in a home match in March 2013 (0-1). Fulham have conceded in each of their last 19 Premier League away games - the longest current run without a clean sheet away in the top-flight (among the 20 teams in 2018-19). Spurs are on a run of 19 consecutive home Premier League victories against newly promoted opponents, conceding just twice in their last 10 matches. Ryan Sessegnon has either scored or assisted each of Fulham's last four goals in all competitions (1 goal, 3 assists). Since his debut for Fulham in February, Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored 13 league goals; only Mohamed Salah (14) has more in the top four tiers of English football in that time. Lucas Moura has had a hand in six goals in his seven starts in all competitions since joining Tottenham Hotspur (2 goals, 4 assists). Tottenham striker Harry Kane's goal was his first Premier League goal in the month of August. It took the England forward 15 games, 1065 minutes and 49 shots. Harry Kane has scored 24 goals in 36 London derbies for Tottenham (0.67 goals per game); only Thierry Henry has a better goals per game ratio of players to have played in 10+ London derbies (43 goals in 59 games - 0.73 goals per game). Man of the match - Kieran Trippier One of the stars of England's World Cup campaign, Kieran Trippier was given the opening weekend of the season off with Serge Aurier handed a starting role against Newcastle. An erratic performance from the Ivorian, despite an assist, opened the door for Trippier to return to the side and Mauricio Pochettino will be pleased that he made the change as he scored the crucial second goal. 1 - Kieran Trippier is the first Tottenham player to score from a direct free-kick in the Premier League since Christian Eriksen in October 2015 v Swansea. Bend. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) August 18, 2018 Aside from his excellent free-kick, Trippier was a constant presence on the right flank with only Jan Vertonghen (96) touching the ball more times than him (93) while he also completed four crosses and created two chances. An excellent all-round display. What's next? Spurs are next in action on Bank Holiday Monday when they face Manchester United at Old Trafford, live on Sky Sports Premier League. Fulham, meanwhile, will be looking to get their first points on the board against Burnley next Sunday and that game is also on Sky Sports Premier League. The managers Mauricio Pochettino: \"It was a tough game but I think we deserved the victory. We domninated completely and created a lot of chances but we dropped our performance a little bit and became sloppy and they were better in the first 15-20 minutes [of the second half]. \"Of course, it's only the beginning of the season but it is so important to win games but we can improve, we conceded too many chances today and against Newcastle. \"There were different players today and a different system, we are still building our fitness and focus out of possession and we need to be more clinical.\" Slavisa Jokanovic: \"It's a shame, we made a great effort. After we equalised we had another chance to score again and then they killed the game with one quality action and then immediately after they scored again and we didn't have the power to change the situation. \"The second goal showed the quality they have. We are team that has been playing for a week and a half, they are a team that has been playing for three years and the synchronisation of the Spurs players is better than ours.\" Pundit reaction Phil Thompson: \"This is the best game I've seen [Lucas Moura] him play. He played the whole game, and there was no thought about substituting him. \"He showed his pace, and in different areas, and he showed a lot of high press qualities that I didn't think he had in him. I thought he was just a winger, but he played his part and scored an absolutely stunning goal. Lucas Moura scored his first Premier League goal against Fulham \"For a certain spell, Fulham did alright and they got back in the game. But we've seen Trippier, how he delivers balls from corner-kicks and from free-kicks for England. This is about 30 yards out, and they've got other great technicians, but they've left it for him. It was a terrific strike. \"Fulham did alright for long periods but up front, they don't get enough people into the box to support Mitrovic. There were good things at times, it was a really good game of football. It was Thierry Henry-like the way Kane scored, and I'm sure he's delighted to get that monkey off his back.\""},{"date": "18/08/2019", "arena": "London Stadium", "attendance": 56888, "home_team":

comeback kings after recovering from a goal down to beat West Ham 2-1 at the London Stadium. A Marko Arnautovic penalty (33) had put West Ham ahead in Manuel Pellegrini's first Premier League home game in charge. However, Bournemouth - who won 21 points from losing positions last season - turned the game around thanks to Callum Wilson's solo stunner (60) and Steve Cook's header (66). Victory hands Bournemouth back-to-back wins to start the season, while West Ham fall to a second-straight defeat. Player ratings West Ham: Fabianski (6), Zabaleta (5), Balbuena (6), Ogbonna (5), Masuaku (6), Noble (5), Wilshere (5), Anderson (6), Snodgrass (5), Arnautovic (7), Hernandez (5) Subs: Yarmolenko (6), Sanchez (6), Perez (6) Bournemouth: Begovic (7), Smith (7), S.Cook (7), Ake (6), Daniels (7), Brooks (7), Gosling (6), Surman (6), Fraser (7), Wilson (7), King (6) Subs: Francis (6), L.Cook (N/A) Man of the match: Callum Wilson After a slow start, Javier Hernandez forced Asmir Begovic to make a smart save at his near post before Wilson failed to slot it past Lukasz Fabianski when one-on-one with the West Ham goalkeeper. Wilson was made to rue that miss as West Ham took the lead five minutes later, with Arnautovic slotting the penalty beyond Begovic's grasp after Nathan Ake brought down Hernandez - referee Stuart Attwell only pointing to the spot after consultation with his assistant. Marko Arnautovic scored his first goal of the season from the penalty spot David Brooks could then only glance a header wide when free inside the West Ham box, while Begovic was on hand to deny Arnautovic a second just before the break. Team news Three West Ham changes saw Pablo Zabaleta, Robert Snodgrass and Javier Hernandez come in for Ryan Fredericks, Declan Rice and Michail Antonio. Bournemouth named an unchanged XI, with £25m signing Jefferson Lerma not yet fit to make the squad. Bournemouth started the second half strongly, and after Brooks saw an effort saved by Begovic, they leveled after a piece of wizardry from Wilson on the hour-mark. The forward received the ball 10 yards inside the West Ham area, and with no team-mate near him, Wilson evaded a couple of challenges - including a desperate slide from Pablo Zabaleta - before sliding it through the legs of Fabianski. Six minutes later Bournemouth took the lead when Cook rose above Angelo Ogbonna, who had conceded the free-kick which led to what was ultimately the winning goal. Bournemouth's Steve Cook (right) celebrates after heading the visitors in front Notes for Southgate Jack Wilshere endured a frustrating afternoon for the hosts, picking up a booking and seeing a late shot easily saved by Begovic. Callum Wilson was an outside shout for England's World Cup squad, but with two goals in two league games, he is doing everything right as he targets a first call-up for September's matches against Spain and Switzerland. Opta stats The side scoring first has only won two of the seven Premier League meetings between Bournemouth and West Ham, with the Cherries winning 4-3 in August 2015, and the Hammers winning 1-0 in August 2016. Bournemouth have gained 19 points from losing positions in the Premier League in 2018; seven more than any other side. Bournemouth have won four consecutive top-flight games for the first time in their history. Bournemouth have won successive Premier League games in London for the first time since their first two visits to the capital in August-December 2015. Man of the match - Callum Wilson Wilson loves playing against West Ham. His fifth goal in five games against the Hammers was a majestic one, and it was a moment which inspired the visitors on to victory. It was some way to brush off the disappointment of missing his first-half attempt, which came before West Ham's opener, and with two goals in two Premier League games, Wilson outlined how important he will be for Bournemouth once more this season. The managers West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini: \"For me the second half we tried to keep the 1-0, and that reflect the lack of trust the players have in what they are doing. \"I talked long with them: 'We must forget last season, we have a new season, a new team, we need to adapt some players to the Premier League and find what the best team is in this moment, and the players must know each other'. But I think that was absolutely a lack of trust.\" 2:23 Pellegrini says his West Ham players showed a lack of trust Pellegrini says his West Ham players showed a lack of trust Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe: \"It was a really good win. When we conceded it was at a spell when West Ham were on top and we found it difficult, but credit to the players second half. \"We had a number of chances to score. It's a great comeback. Whenever you come here and win it's a real achievement. \"There were loads of chances that we didn't take and you think, 'Is it going to be one of those days?', but thankfully Callum's goal was the turning point. It was a great goal from him individually. That was the boost we needed to go on and win the game.\" 3:02 Howe praised another 'great' comeback from his Bournemouth side Howe praised another 'great' comeback from his Bournemouth side Pundit's view - Charlie Nicholas \"We've touched on the quality West Ham have up top with the partnership of Hernandez and Arnautovic. After 10 minutes, they got them into the play and it looked pretty exciting. \"Wilshere was on the ball a lot, and Arnautovic doesn't disappoint. They could've got two or three before half-time. But after that, it was the same old West Ham. Manuel Pellegrini has lost his first two games as West Ham manager \"There might be one or two new faces, but it's the same unforgivable mistakes. The equaliser from Wilson, all credit to him, but he had two centre-backs and two full-backs to beat. He glided past Noble and Balbuena, skipped by Zabaleta and then put it through the legs of Fabianski. It was shambolic defending. \"For Cook's goal, he has to steer it into the ground and it's a brave goal, but there's three West Ham players round him. He was keener than anyone of them, and that can't be accepted. Pellegrini has to improve that department or the crowd will get on his back.\" What's next? West Ham make the short trip to Arsenal for a 3pm kick-off next Saturday, the same time Bournemouth play host to Everton in the Premier League."},{"date": "18/08/2019", "arena": "Stamford Bridge",

Chelsea 3-2 Arsenal Marcos Alonso's late goal gave Chelsea a 3-2 win over Arsenal in a frantic encounter in Maurizio Sarri's first competitive game at Stamford Bridge. Alonso swept home from close range after being found by sub Eden Hazard, meaning Unai Emery's Arsenal have lost two from two this season. There were four goals in a dramatic first half. Pedro (9) and Alvaro Morata (20) capitalised on woeful Arsenal defending to put Chelsea 2-0 up, as both Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan missed sitters for the visitors after each goal. Player ratings Chelsea: Kepa (5), Azpilicueta (5), Rudiger (4), Luiz (4), Alonso (7), Kante (6), Jorginho (8), Willian (6), Barkley (7), Pedro (6), Morata (7) Subs: Kovacic (6), Hazard (7), Giroud (6) Arsenal: Cech (7), Bellerin (3), Sokratis (4), Mustafi (4), Monreal (5), Xhaka (3), Guendouzi (5), Mkhitaryan (6), Ozil (4), Iwobi (6), Aubameyang (6) Subs: Torreira (6), Ramsey (6), Lacazette (5) Man of the match: Jorginho But Arsenal found themselves level at the break through Mkhitaryan's 20-yard effort (37) and Iwobi's close-range finish (41), with both sides visibly neglecting their defensive duties. Arsenal crumbled again late on to allow Chelsea the winner, continuing the Blues' 100 per cent start in the Premier League under Sarri. Chelsea initially had the run of Arsenal and were ahead through Pedro as Hector Bellerin was caught high up the pitch, allowing Alonso acres to square for his Spanish compatriot in even more space. He duly swept past former Blues goalkeeper Petr Cech. Team news Eden Hazard started on the bench with Chelsea unchanged following the win over Huddersfield. Arsenal made two changes; Nacho Monreal replaced the injured Ainsley Maitland-Niles, and Alex Iwobi was in for Aaron Ramsey. Alex Iwobi battles with Morata at Stamford Bridge Aubameyang was head-in-hands just after, blazing over from eight yards from Bellerin's centre, and it was 2-0 just 55 seconds later after Morata was left one-on-one with Shkodran Mustafi from Cesar Azpilicueta's simple ball from deep. Morata wrestled Mustafi away, before sliding past Cech as Arsenal fans got a case of déjà vu at Stamford Bridge, where they now haven't won in eight. Mkhitaryan blazed over at the other end in a similar position to Aubameyang, but the Armenian made up for it with a fierce drive from the edge of the box, despite Kepa Arrizabalaga getting a touch. Arsenal levelled through Iwobi's slammed finish from 10 yards, picked out by Mkhitaryan after Chelsea gave him the freedom of west London, and Emery's side would have gone into half-time ahead if the Nigerian hadn't blazed over from near the penalty spot in space again. Alvaro Morata celebrates Chelsea's second goal in the first half Space was handed out in abundance again after the break; Kepa was down low to save from Aaron Ramsey's effort, while N'Golo Kante headed just over at the other end, but Chelsea got their winner with nine minutes remaining. Sub Hazard danced past Alexandre Lacazette with ease on the left, before finding Alonso eight yards out to sweep through Cech's legs. It would have been worse for Arsenal had Cech not kept out Hazard and former Gunners striker Olivier Giroud twice late on, but it ended 3-2 on an evening which showed neither defence in good light. 41 - Only Frank Lampard (90), Didier Drogba (55) and Gianfranco Zola (42) have more Premier League assists for Chelsea than Eden Hazard (41). Magician. pic.twitter.com/FvgPVmJoqb — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) August 18, 2018 Man of the match - Jorginho In a game lacking in defensive discipline of any kind, this was a difficult award. But Jorginho's showing, alongside a clearly energised Ross Barkley, was superb. He won the ball a team-high nine times, touched the ball a match-high 105 times, and made 99 passes at 91.6 per cent completion, with 56 in the opposition half. Chelsea fans like what they've seen so far, and they can expect more of the same to come. Notes for Southgate Barkley's clear rise in confidence can only be a good thing for England and Gareth Southgate. In his 60 minutes, Barkley was happy to drive at a struggling Arsenal defence, and came close to scoring when his angled shot was tipped wide by Cech. This was more like the Barkley of old. Opta stats Chelsea have won six of their last seven home league games against Arsenal, the exception being a 0-0 draw last season. Arsenal scored two goals against Chelsea, as many as on their previous six Premier League visits to Stamford Bridge. Unai Emery is the first Arsenal manager to lose his first two games in charge since Steve Burtenshaw, who lost his first three in charge as caretaker in March/April 1986. Chelsea winger Pedro has scored in consecutive Premier League games for the first time since February 2017. What's next Arsenal now face West Ham at the Emirates on Saturday, while Chelsea go to Newcastle on Super Sunday at 4pm, live on Sky Sports Premier League."},{"date": "12/08/2019", "arena": "Anfield",

Liverpool 4-0 West Ham Liverpool started the season in style on Super Sunday as they condemned West Ham to a 4-0 defeat in Manuel Pellegrini's first game in charge. Mohamed Salah (19) and Sadio Mane (45+2) scored open goals after ruthless attacking moves during a rampant first half at Anfield and the home side added a third eight minutes after half-time when Mane stroked home, controversially from an offside position. Daniel Sturridge came off the bench to score with his first touch of the game (88) to complete a miserable afternoon for Pellegrini, who started five new signings but had goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to thank for ensuring the scoreline was not even more comprehensive. Liverpool dominated both the chances and the possession as they overwhelmed West Ham in the first half and took a deserved lead through Salah on 19 minutes. Player ratings Liverpool: Alisson (7), Alexander-Arnold (8), Van Dijk (7), Gomez (7), Robertson (8), Keita (9), Milner (9), Wijnaldum (7), Mane (8), Salah (8), Firmino (8) Subs: Henderson (6), Shaqiri (6), Sturridge (7) West Ham: Fabianski (7), Fredericks (6), Balbuena (6), Rice (5), Ogbonna (6), Masuaku (6), Noble (5), Wilshere (6), Anderson (7), Arnautovic (7), Antonio (6) Subs: Snodgrass (6), Hernandez (6), Yarmolenko (6) Man of the match: James Milner Impressive debutant Naby Keita carried the ball into the final third and slipped in Andrew Robertson to cross low for Salah to tap in to an empty net. Mohamed Salah celebrates his goal against West Ham with Liverpool team-mates The Egyptian, who finished last season with 44 goals, was denied three times by Fabianski before Liverpool's second arrived. West Ham's goalkeeper held a header, then brilliantly denied Salah inside the six-yard box before rushing off a line to prevent another chance. But West Ham's high defensive line was punished again in first-half injury time when Robertson's cross was volleyed back into the middle by James Milner and Mane hooked in to an unguarded goal to double Liverpool's lead. Team news New goalkeeper Alisson and midfielder Naby Keita started for Liverpool while Fabinho was on the bench. West Ham included five debutants: Lukasz Fabianski, Ryan Fredericks, Fabian Balbuena, Jack Wilshere and Felipe Anderson. Roberto Firmino was the architect of Liverpool's third in the 53rd minute, cleverly feeding the ball through to Mane just inside the area to control and shoot low past Fabianski - though replays showed he was a yard offside. Sadio Mane celebrates after scoring Liverpool's third goal So comfortable was the victory, Jurgen Klopp was able to withdraw all three of his forwards - Firmino, Mane and Salah - during the second half and the final substitution immediately led to Liverpool's fourth. Sturridge, on his return to Anfield after spending time on loan at West Brom, met Milner's corner at the back post and turned the ball in to complete a dream start for last season's Champions League finalists and enhance expectations of a title push this time around. Match stats Liverpool are only the second side in Premier League history to score 4+ goals in four consecutive games against a single opponent,. West Ham have lost their season opener 12 times in the Premier League, more than any other side. Salah has scored 20 goals in his 20 Premier League games at Anfield for Liverpool. Only Andrew Cole and Alan Shearer (both 41 goals), have scored more in their first 50 Premier League appearances than Salah. Mane is just the sixth player in Premier League history to score on 3+ consecutive opening weekends Daniel Sturridge scored just 24 seconds after coming on as a substitute for Liverpool The pundit - Graeme Souness \"Liverpool were fabulous. It's what I expected. They just blew West Ham away, too much quality, too much energy, the mischief they cause in the final third... they were just far too good for West Ham. West Ham got caught in a revolving door and couldn't get out of it.\" Man of the Match - James Milner Andy Hinchcliffe (Sky Sports): \"You can talk so much about the attacking play of Mane, Salah and Firmino, but in any successful side you need an incredible amount of work-rate and unselfishness. He has the ability to pop up in a variety of different positions to bring the best out of players around him. He played a part in the first goal and the fourth goal and he has been absolutely superb.\" Jack Wilshere in action for West Ham against Liverpool Notes for Gareth Southgate The England manager was at Anfield and must surely be tempted to try and convince the brilliant Milner, who started ahead of Jordan Henderson, to step out of international retirement. Trent Alexander-Arnold's delivery was excellent all afternoon and Fabianski did well to keep out his goal-bound free-kick in the first half, while Joe Gomez looked assured on his return to first-team football. Jack Wilshere, like his fellow midfielders, was overwhelmed by Liverpool's combative midfield trio and Michail Antonio was constantly frustrated in his preferred attacking role. What would VAR have changed? Liverpool's third goal should not have stood, as replays quickly showed Mane and Salah were both offside when Firmino fed the ball through and VAR would surely have ruled it out. Naby Keita appealed for a late penalty when he was tripped by Fabian Balbuena, but while replays showed there was contact, it looked to be outside the area. What's next? Liverpool travel to Crystal Palace on August 20 for the first Monday Night Football of the new season, while West Ham host Bournemouth at the London Stadium next Saturday afternoon."},{"date":

The Clarets had the better chances in the opening half as Aaron Lennon and Jeff Hendrick were both denied from point-blank range by McCarthy, who vindicated his selection ahead of new signing Angus Gunn with an accomplished performance. Southampton struggled to assert themselves until Mark Hughes moved to a back four, with substitute Danny Ings providing greater threat, and Hart was forced into a smart save as Ings found Jack Stephens with 18 minutes remaining. Alex McCarthy keeps out Jeff Hendrick's effort on the stroke of half-time Player ratings Southampton: McCarthy (8), Soares (6), Vestegaard (8), Stephens (7), Hoedt (6), Bertrand (6), Romeu (6), Lemina (7), Armstrong (6), Redmond (7), Austin (5). Subs: Ings (7), Elyounoussi (7), Gabbiadini (6) Burnley: Hart (8), Lowton (6), Tarkowski (7), Mee (7), Ward (6), Westwood (6), Cork (7), Hendrick (6), Lennon (6), Gudmundsson (6), Wood (6). Subs: Vokes, Barnes (6), Taylor (n/a) Man of the match: Jannik Vestegaard (Southampton) Ben Mee very nearly headed into his own goal, only for Ashley Westwood to produce a fine goal-line clearance as the points were shared on the south coast. Mark Hughes cut a frustrated figure on the touchline throughout the opening 45 minutes, with the visitors by far the better side. They might have gone ahead when Jack Cork slotted beyond McCarthy, only for Southampton to be saved by the offside flag. Burnley were almost rewarded for their positive start after Wesley Hoedt headed the ball into the path of Lennon, but McCarthy got down low to his right to make a smart save. Joe Hart will be encouraged by an opening Premier League clean sheet for Burnley Team news Alex McCarthy won the battle to be in goal for Southampton's opening game with Angus Gunn taking his place on the substitutes' bench. Stuart Armstrong and Jannik Vestergaard were handed full debuts while Danny Ings and Mohamed Elyounoussi were on the bench. Sean Dyche also had a decision to make in goal with Joe Hart preferred to Tom Heaton, who had recovered from a calf injury. The rest of the Burnley starting XI had a familiar feel to it, with Chris Wood leading the line. New signing Ben Gibson was among the substitutes. The Englishman was forced into action once more on the stroke of half-time as Hendrick met Mee's hooked cross with a downward header, but McCarthy smothered the effort with his legs. Hoedt made a brilliant last-ditch block to deny Johann Berg Gudmundsson moments into the second period and it was only after Mohamed Elyounoussi and Ings were introduced that Southampton asked questions of the Burnley defence. Mee was grateful for a brilliant goal-line headed clearance by Westwood from Elyounoussi's corner before Ings found Stephens at the far post, but Hart was equal to his effort low to his left. With four minutes remaining, James Tarkowski made a brilliant block when the lively Elyounoussi was set to pull the trigger before Ings' penalty appeal under Mee's challenge was waved away in stoppage time as the points were shared. Opta stats Southampton are winless in their last five opening day matches in the Premier League (D4 L1), last winning in August 2013 away at West Bromwich Albion (1-0). Burnley have drawn on the opening weekend of a Premier League season for the very first time, after losing three and winning one of their first four such matches. Southampton have never won an opening Premier League fixture when played on a Sunday, drawing three and losing three of their six matches. Burnley have won two and drawn two of their last four Premier League matches against Southampton, this after losing back-to-back games between March 2015 and October 2016. Southampton have registered just one win in their last 12 top-flight home games, drawing six and losing five. Southampton boss Mark Hughes has won just two of his 13 opening day matches as a Premier League manager (D3 L8), the fewest number of wins of any manager to take charge of at least 13 such matches. Man of the match - Jannik Vestegaard Southampton conceded more goals than any other side in the Premier League last season from crosses, but in signing Vestegaard, Mark Hughes should improve on that record. The 6ft 6in Denmark centre-back, signed for £18million from German side Borussia Monchengladbach, won his aerial duel with Chris Wood and met countless balls into the Saints box to preserve his side's clean sheet. Vestegaard will prove just as useful in the opposition penalty area this season, and he was unfortunate not to cap a fine debut with a goal as he met Stuart Armstrong's corner in the first half only to head over. Notes for Gareth Southgate The England manager was at Anfield watching the likes of Jack Wilshere and Trent Alexander-Arnold, but it was at St Mary's where another Englishman would have caught his eye. Joe Hart insisted he had not given up hope of making the senior squad again following his World Cup ommission and with a far sterner defence in front of him than at West Ham, the 31-year-old will be confident of adding to his 75 caps. Ryan Bertrand was another suprise name to be left out of England's 23-man squad in Russia, but the Southampton full-back found himself forced back for long periods of the first half due to Burnley's dominance. The Saints improved after the break, and Bertrand's influence in the attacking third grew with it, but he will have to do a lot more to oust Ashley Young and Danny Rose from their places in the squad. The managers Mark Hughes: \"I think we edged it. Our best play was in the second half and we were a lot more in control of the game, we created more chances and got behind them. We stopped them causing us too many problems. Their outball was to hit it longer because we were putting them under pressure. \"In the first-half they were turning us around a bit too readily, but I made a change personnel wise and system wise early in the second-half and all that was lacking was the goal that would have got us maximum points.\" 2:46 Mark Hughes said Southampton created more chances Mark Hughes said Southampton created more chances Sean Dyche: \"We dominated quite a bit of the game away from home against a decent Southampton side. We had chances, but we continue to grow. I thought we dug in when he had to, and there were so many pleasing things about the performance. \"We kept the clean sheet and they came into it for the last 20 minutes but we saw the game through. Joe has provided me with a big decision to make because Tom (Heaton) has been brilliant with me for a long time.\" 2:34 Sean Dyche was pleased with \"many aspects\" of Burnley's performance Sean Dyche was pleased with \"many aspects\" of Burnley's performance What would VAR have changed? Burnley's Cork had a goal disallowed for offside in the first half in what was a borderline decision that the match officials marginally got right, while Ings went down inside the box late on as his ankle rolled under a challenge from Mee. Referee Graham Scott may have been advised to check the incident, but his decision to point for a goal-kick was not a clear and obvious error. What's next? Southampton visit Goodison Park to face Everton next Saturday in the Premier League. Burnley host Istanbul Basaksehir in the second leg of their Europa League third qualifying-round tie on Thursday before travelling to face Watford next Sunday."},{"date": "12/08/2019", "arena":

Highlights: Arsenal 0-2 Man City Highlights: Arsenal 0-2 Man City Unai Emery suffered defeat on his Arsenal debut as Manchester City kicked off their title defence with a 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium. Raheem Sterling capped a relentless start from the reigning champions with his 50th Premier League goal inside the quarter-hour mark before Bernardo Silva secured the win with an exquisite second on 64 minutes. Emery has been tasked with taking Arsenal to the next level after Arsene Wenger's departure at the end of last season - but it was a familiar, disjointed performance from the Gunners, who visibly need time to adapt to their new manager's philosophy. For Pep Guardiola and City, it was business as usual as they took their place among the Premier League's early pacesetters having started the defence of their crown with an eighth consecutive opening-day triumph. Player ratings Arsenal: Cech (5), Bellerin (6), Sokratis (5), Mustafi (5), Maitland-Niles (5), Guendouzi (5), Xhaka (5), Mkhitaryan (5), Ramsey (6), Ozil (6), Aubameyang (6). Subs: Lichtsteiner (6), Lacazette (5), Torreira (5). Man City: Ederson (6), Walker (7), Stones (6), Laporte (6), Mendy (7), Silva (8), Fernandinho (6), Gundogan (6), Mahrez (6), Aguero (6), Sterling (8). Subs: De Bruyne (6), Jesus (5), Sane (n/a). Man of the match: Bernardo Silva The sense of optimism and anticipation was tangible ahead of the start of the Emery era at the Emirates, but that soon dissipated once City had found their groove. Sterling was a constant thorn in Arsenal's side and, five minutes after drawing Petr Cech into action with a near-post drive, the England international fired City into a deserved lead, skipping past Hector Bellerin and Matteo Guendouzi before lashing the ball beyond the unsighted Gunners goalkeeper. Raheem Sterling in action at the Emirates Bellerin registered Arsenal's first attempt on target on 21 minutes, playing the ball through Benjamin Mendy's legs before testing Ederson with a swerving drive, but that proved to be a rare venture into opposition territory for the besieged Gunners. City responded immediately as Sergio Aguero fired a shot into the side netting and, from the resulting goal-kick, Cech nearly scored a bizarre own goal as City pressured the Arsenal defence, determined to play out from the back. Team news Petr Cech got the nod ahead of Bernd Leno in goal, while new signings Sokratis and Matteo Guendouzi made their Premier League debuts. Summer arrivals Lucas Torreira and Stephan Lichtsteiner started on the bench. Riyad Mahrez made his top-flight debut for Man City, who left Vincent Kompany, Kevin de Bruyne, Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus on the bench. Cech got down low to his left to keep a Riyad Mahrez free-kick out on 28 minutes, and recovered well to prevent Aymeric Laporte from converting the rebound, before Mahrez and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang flashed efforts wide before the interval. A last-gasp deflection prevented a rasping Aguero drive from doubling City's lead on 50 minutes, a lead which Arsenal could have erased had Alexandre Lacazette's dipping volley found the target five minutes later. Bernardo Silva celebrates scoring Man City's second goal Arsenal were fortunate not to go two goals behind when Cech brilliantly prevailed in a one-on-one with Aguero, after Guendouzi's missed clearance released the City forward through on goal, but a minute later City doubled their lead when Bernardo Silva ruthlessly dispatched Mendy's cutback. Aubameyang and Mesut Ozil found the back of the City net as Arsenal pushed for a response, but both efforts were ruled out for offside as Emery was left to reflect on a debut defeat. What would VAR have changed? Arsenal could well have had a penalty had Video Assistant Referee been in use. Gunners defender Shkodran Mustafi was visibly hauled to ground by Benjamin Mendy in the 69th minute, but referee Michael Oliver was unmoved by Arsenal's appeals. Opta stats Arsenal have enjoyed just two victories in their last nine opening weekend Premier League games, drawing three and losing three. Manchester City are unbeaten in their last 10 opening Premier League fixtures (W9 D1), winning the last eight in a row. Unai Emery is the first of Arsenal's last six managers (including caretakers) to lose his first league game in charge of the club, since Steve Burtenshaw lost 0-1 against Tottenham in March 1986. Pep Guardiola remains unbeaten against Emery in all competitions, winning seven and drawing four of their 11 meetings. 50 - Raheem Sterling has scored 50 Premier League goals, with his strike against Arsenal only his third from outside the box. Bullseye. pic.twitter.com/ZNrwYRh0oa — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) August 12, 2018 Sterling has been directly involved in 12 goals in his last 12 Premier League appearances for the Citizens, scoring five and assisting seven. Manchester City full-back Benjamin Mendy registered two assists in a game in Europe's big five leagues for only the second time ever (also for Monaco v Nice in February 2017) and for the first time ever away from home. Bernardo Silva has scored five goals in his last seven Premier League starts for Manchester City after failing to score in his first nine. The managers Unai Emery: \"Manchester City's performance showed us that we need to continue the process of improving. They deserved the result. We are a new team [that needs] to improve. For me today, I was frustrated that we lost but it is also one more experience and continued progression.\" 2:21 Unai Emery acknowledged that plenty of work lies ahead of his Arsenal side Unai Emery acknowledged that plenty of work lies ahead of his Arsenal side Pep Guardiola: \"Our average level is high, we cannot deny that. I've said many times I have the feeling we can improve. Still we are not good enough to know exactly what we have to do, but in general I cannot be more satisfied from what I saw against Chelsea and Arsenal.\" 1:36 Pep Guardiola is adamant his Manchester City side can improve despite a perfect start to the season Pep Guardiola is adamant his Manchester City side can improve despite a perfect start to the season Man of the Match - Bernardo Silva City were at their devastating best in parts but had a measure of control throughout, thanks in no uncertain terms to Bernardo Silva. With his namesake David not in the squad, the Portuguese effortlessly picked up the Spaniard's responsibility in midfield. And when City needed to put the game to bed, up he stepped with the most clinical of finishes. What's next? Arsenal travel to Stamford Bridge to take on London rivals Chelsea next Saturday at 5.30pm.

2-1 on the opening weekend of the Premier League season at St James' Park. Jan Vertonghen bundled the ball over the line with his head at the far post to give Spurs the lead (8) despite Martin Dubravka's best efforts on the line, before a tale of two crosses and another two headers. First, Matt Ritchie's wicked ball was converted by the head of Joselu for 1-1 three minutes later, while Alli nodded in at the far post (18) from Serge Aurier's fine delivery. Alli scored the winner for Tottenham at St James' Park Player ratings Newcastle: Dubravka (7), Yedlin (6), Clark (6), Lascelles (6), Dummett (6), Diame (6), Shelvey (7), Ritchie (6), Perez (6), Kenedy (5), Joselu (6). Subs: Rondon (6), Atsu (4), Muto (NA) Tottenham: Lloris (6), Aurier (7), Vertonghen (8), Sanchez (7), Davies (7), Dier (6), Sissoko (7), Eriksen (7), Alli (8), Moura (7), Kane (6) Subs: Dembele (6), Son (NA), Amos (NA) Man of the match: Dele Alli Both sides came close in a frenzied opening to the second half, the best chances falling to Moussa Sissoko and Kenedy at either end, while Newcastle debutant Salomon Rondon saw a deflected effort hit the bar late on. But Spurs held on for a much-needed three points after recent criticism for not making a signing this summer, and the result means Newcastle, whose fans protested against owner Mike Ashley in the city centre before the game, are without an opening-day victory since 2012. Spurs got their season off to a flying start early on, as Davinson Sanchez flicked on a Christian Eriksen corner into the path of Vertonghen, who diverted the ball just nine millimetres over the line following a Goal-line Decision System review. Team news For only the second time in Premier League history, Newcastle haven’t named a debutant in their starting XI on the opening day. New signings Schar, Ki, Muto and Rondon all started on the bench. For Spurs, World Cup-winning captain Hugo Lloris started in goal, joined in the line-up by Jan Vertonghen, Eric Dier, Dele Alli, Christian Eriksen and England captain Harry Kane. Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen celebrates his opening goal But Newcastle levelled shortly after through Joselu, ghosting in-between Spurs defenders before heading home Ritchie's wonderful ball from the right flank. Spurs regained their lead in a topsy-turvy opening, as Aurier's dangerous cross from deep on the right was nodded back across goal and into the corner by Alli, who scored in the 2-0 win at St James' Park on the opening day of last season. Tottenham had the majority of possession in the first half but couldn't force a two-goal cushion, with defender Sanchez coming closest from a glancing header wide from an Eriksen corner. Joselu equalises for Newcastle just minutes after going behind There were two fine chances at both ends during a frantic first 10 minutes of the second half; first Mo Diame hit the near post with a fierce left-footed volley from an angle, before the ball hit Alli's knee and looped into the grateful hands of Dubravka from Eriksen's cross. Kenedy then found himself in acres of space one-on-one with Hugo Lloris, only to see his touch let him down, and Dubravka kept the score at 1-2 at the other end, producing a fine stop from Moussa Sissoko's close-range volley. Newcastle brought on Rondon with half an hour remaining, and he nearly grabbed a point in the closing stages, seeing his effort deflect off Vertonghen and onto the bar. Jan Vertonghen celebrates after putting Tottenham ahead Notes for Southgate An outside shout for the World Cup, Jonjo Shelvey was again among Newcastle's brightest players, while Jamaal Lascelles was solid yet not outstanding. For Spurs, Eric Dier was booked and struggled to get a foothold in the game, and though Harry Kane was forced extremely deep, the Golden Boot winner battled hard. One for the future in Luke Amos, perhaps; the 21-year-old made his Premier League debut, coming on for the final few minutes. Man of the match - Dele Alli The gong could have also been awarded to Jan Vertonghen, but it was apt that England midfielder Alli scored the winner after a busy summer. In a contest where most of the football was played in the final third at both ends, it was Alli's defensive work that impressed, as well as his clever finish. He took up a position on the left of midfield, regularly helping Ben Davies, and gained possession nine times for Spurs, more than any of his team-mates. Opta stats Tottenham have won four of their last five Premier League away games against Newcastle (L1) - one more than they'd won in their previous 19 trips to St James' Park in the competition (W3 D5 L11). Newcastle have lost five of their last six opening games to a league season, drawing the other vs Southampton in 2015-16. Tottenham have scored in 25 of their last 26 Premier League games against Newcastle, failing only in a 0-1 home defeat in November 2013.

Callum Wilson were on target as Bournemouth kicked off the season with a 2-0 win over newly-promoted Cardiff at the Vitality Stadium on Saturday. Fraser opened the scoring midway through the first half with a close-range finish, although Bournemouth should have doubled their lead minutes later. Player ratings Bournemouth: Begovic (6), Brooks (6), Steve Cook (6), Ake (7), Adam Smith (6), Daniels (6), Gosling (6), Surman (6), Fraser (9), Wilson (7), King (7) Subs: Francis (7), Mousset (6), Defoe (6) Cardiff: Etheridge (8), Peltier (7), Bamba (7), Morrison (6), Manga (6), Bennett (6), Ralls (7), Paterson (6), Mendez-Laing (7), Hoilett (6), Reid (8) Subs: Murphy (6), Ward (6), Madine (6) Man of the match: Ryan Fraser However, Cardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge did brilliantly to keep out Wilson's penalty, only for the striker to make up for that miss with an injury-time strike to seal the points. As a result, Bournemouth won their opening match of a Premier Season for the first time ever, while after a five-year absence, Cardiff made a losing return to the top flight Notes for Gareth Southgate The England boss will have noted the sprightly display up front by Bournemouth frontman Callum Wilson on Saturday. The 26-year-old, who has been mentioned before in regard to a possible international call-up, created his side’s opener with a clever cut back. And the former England U21 then wrapped up the points late on with a neatly taken strike, meaning he was involved in more goals in this match than in his previous 13 league games combined. After an evenly contested opening quarter on the south coast, the home side took the lead after a well-worked move. Josh King's incisive through-ball sent Wilson clear in the box and the striker then pulled the ball back for the unmarked Fraser to coolly side-foot home from 10 yards out. Ryan Fraser (right) makes it 1-0 to Bournemouth Eddie Howe's side should have been further ahead just past the half-hour mark when referee Kevin Friend decided Bruno Ecuele Manga had tripped Wilson in the box. However, Etheridge - the first Filipino to play in the Premier League - guessed right and dived full length to his left to keep Wilson's well-struck penalty out. Team news This game came too soon for Bournemouth's record signing Jefferson Lerma, but fellow new signing David Brooks started in midfield. Meanwhile, Bobby Reid made his top-flight debut in attack for the visitors, although Harry Arter - signed from Bournemouth on Thursday - was ineligible due to the terms of his loan deal. The visitors were far more of a threat after the break, although the closest Neil Warnock's team came to levelling matters was midway in the second period when Sean Morrison somehow failed to score from virtually on the goal line. And Bournemouth made the game safe in injury time after substitute Simon Francis got free to the right-hand byline, and his cut back was then rolled into the far corner of the goal by Wilson lurking near the penalty spot. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe prior to kick-off at the Vitality Stadium Opta stats Bournemouth registered their first win on the opening day of a Premier League season, having lost their previous three Cardiff have lost on the opening day in just two of their last 11 seasons (W5 D4) - but both have been in the Premier League (2013-14 and 2018-19) In the Premier League, Bournemouth midfielder Fraser scored with his final shot of the 2017-18 season against Swansea City and his first shot of 2018-19 against Cardiff Warnock has never won on the opening day of a top-flight season (D1 L3), failing with four different teams - Notts County in 1991-92, Sheffield United in 2006-07, QPR in 2011-12 and Cardiff in 2018-19 There is a gap in age of 28 years and 363 days between Bournemouth manager Howe (40y 255d) and Cardiff boss Warnock (69y 253d), the largest gap in age between two opposing managers on the opening day of a Premier League season Despite failing to score a penalty in the first half, Bournemouth striker Wilson was involved in more goals in this match (2, one goal, one assist) than in his previous 13 Premier League games combined (1) Sean Morrison tackles Callum Wilson (right) Man of the Match - Ryan Fraser The diminutive wide man was the best player on the pitch at the Vitality, with Cardiff unable to lay a glove on the 24-year-old despite their best efforts. The Scotland international made the crucial breakthrough after 24 minutes with a neatly-taken strike, meaning the player scored with his final shot of last season and his first of the new campaign. And the pacy winger continued to threaten after the break, with one brilliant run almost creating a debut goal for new boy David Brooks. Ryan Fraser scores the opening goal of the game at the Vitality Stadium Managers Eddie Howe: \"Full respect for Cardiff because they gave everything to the match and it was very competitive. \"We controlled the first half without really opening them up as much as we would have wanted to but two moments of quality win us the game in the end.\" 2:29 Howe: Key moments swung it Howe: Key moments swung it Neil Warnock: \"I think the start of the game, one or two were really nervous, but as the game wore on we thought, 'bloody hell, not as good as that, is it? We haven't got to fear anything really. \"Little bit more clinical, little bit more quality in certain areas, I think we could have tested them a lot more, but that's to be worked on really. 2:16 Warnock pleased despite defeat Warnock pleased despite defeat Pundit - Paul Merson \"Cardiff needed a little more guile about them. When Arter gets in the team they will have more about them. There wasn't a lot in the game, but Bournemouth have been in the Premier League for four years and they just have the better quality of players. \"Wilson and King were lively. There are a lot Bournemouth players who would walk into the Cardiff team, but it was in the balance all the way until Wilson got the second late on. Wilson is a confidence player, and that goal will be a massive boost for him.\" What's next? Bournemouth take on West Ham United at the London Stadium next Saturday afternoon. Meanwhile, Cardiff face Newcastle at the Cardiff City Stadium in their first home match on their return to the top flight, a game you can see live on Sky Sports Premier League from 11.30am next

"report": "2:59 Fulham 0-2 Crystal Palace Fulham 0-2 Crystal Palace Wilfried Zaha opened his account for the new Premier League season as Crystal Palace beat Fulham 2-0 at Craven Cottage on Saturday. It was Jeffrey Schlupp who scored the opener in the 41st minute, hammering high into the net on a tight angle for his first Palace goal. Zaha - who was the subject of transfer rumours during the summer - doubled the lead with 11 minutes to play after new Fulham goalkeeper Fabri came off his line, leaving the goal open for the forward to slot home. It is already a marked improvement on Palace's start to last season, where they failed to score or win in their opening seven Premier League games, while Fulham looked bright in the first half but tired as the game went on. Player ratings Fulham: Fabri (5), Christie (7), Chambers (6), Le Marchand (6), Bryan (7), Cairney (7), McDonald (6), Seri (7), Schurrle (7), Mitrovic (7), Sessegnon (7). Subs used: Kamara (4), Vietto (4), Johansen (4). Crystal Palace: Hennessey (7), Wan Bissaka (8), Tomkins (6), Sakho (6), Van Aanholt (7), Townsend (7), Milivojevic (7), McArthur (6), Schlupp (6), Benteke (6), Zaha (7). Subs used: Sorloth (4), Kouyate (n/a), Souare (n/a). Man of the match: Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Fulham began well, and could have gone ahead inside 10 minutes. Ryan Sessegnon's ball across the face of goal was just missed by Andre Schurrle and the German was involved again not long afterwards, cutting the ball back for Aleksandar Mitrovic, but his effort went straight into the hands of Wayne Hennessey. Crystal Palace could have broken the deadlock bang on the half-hour mark as Andros Townsend's cross from the right was met by the rising head of Christian Benteke, but he was denied by a fingertip save from Fabri, the £5m summer acquisition from Besiktas. Team news Fulham started seven new signings, including Jean Michael Seri and Andre Schurrle, while Ryan Sessegnon and Tom Cairney were also in the XI. Crystal Palace did not start any of their new faces, but Vicente Guaita and Cheikh Kouayte were on the bench. But Palace did get the opener 11 minutes later. After good play between Townsend and Patrick Van Aanholt, it was the latter who picked out Schlupp in the box. He got ahead of Calum Chambers before hammering the ball over the top of Fabri at the near post. It could have been two just minutes later as Van Aanholt scored a very similar goal to the first after Zaha's lay-off - this time over on the right - but he was correctly flagged offside. The second half was a much quieter affair, but there was a flurry of activity around the hour mark. Schurrle was denied a penalty after having his feet swept from beneath him by Mamadou Sakho, before the goalkeepers were called into action. After a knockdown from Benteke, Zaha saw his effort saved by Fabri before Hennessey again denied Mitrovic, this time from a header. Jeffrey Schlupp wheels away after scoring the first goal of the game But Zaha put the result beyond doubt in the 79th minute. Aaron Wan-Bissaka made a driving run before threading the ball through for Zaha, who easily got in between the two central defenders. He then rounded the oncoming Fabri - who had come out to smother the ball - before slotting into an empty net to seal victory. Match stats This was only the third time in 10 Premier League campaigns that Crystal Palace have won their opening match, with all of those victories coming away from home (vs Everton in 1997/98 and Norwich in 2015/16). This was Fulham's first league defeat at Craven Cottage since October 2017 (0-2 vs Bristol City), ending a run of 15 without loss at home (W12 D3).

Patrick van Aanholt has had a hand in five goals in his last four Premier League games for Crystal Palace (3 goals, 2 assists). The managers Slavisa Jokanovic: \"Really, I cannot criticise my players because they put everything into this moment that they can offer with some players only training for one day with the team. We must adapt ourselves and work towards our goals together and we trust that we can play better football than we did today.\" 3:18 Slavisa Jokanovic says Fulham must adapt to the pace and power of the Premier League after their 2-0 defeat at home to Crystal Palace Slavisa Jokanovic says Fulham must adapt to the pace and power of the Premier League after their 2-0 defeat at home to Crystal Palace Roy Hodgson: \"We certainly have no reason to apologise for coming here today and winning because in the second half, we had quite a lot of control over the game and we created some good chances. \"Luckily, we scored a great goal which helps and another disallowed for offside, rightly so, but that is something that would have put our minds at rest a bit earlier but I thought in the second half, we played much better.\" 3:36 Roy Hodgson says Aaron Wan-Bissaka was excellent defending and going forward in his battle with Ryan Sessegnon during their win over Fulham Roy Hodgson says Aaron Wan-Bissaka was excellent defending and going forward in his battle with Ryan Sessegnon during their win over Fulham The pundit Phil Thompson: \"Fulham didn't do badly. They were the better team in the first half, but Hennessey had an outstanding game - making crucial saves at crucial times. \"Palace are now settled under Hodgson, and he kept with the same side that we saw last season. Zaha could have done better, although he scored a good goal. Wilfried Zaha celebrates doubling Crystal Palace's lead \"They managed the game far better than Fulham, and were stronger in the second half. It's no disgrace for Fulham, but they do have to improve.\" Man of the match - Aaron Wan-Bissaka It was a solid performance from the 20-year-old, who has really proven himself since coming in to cover Crystal Palace's defensive crisis last season. He was tasked with keeping the talented Ryan Sessegnon quiet and, for the most part, did his job effectively. He was in the right place at the right time on several occasions at the back, clearing balls away, and also contributed in attack with his driving run to set up Zaha's goal. He will surely be difficult to oust from the Crystal Palace XI now. Aleksandar Mitrovic takes a shot under pressure from James Tomkins Would VAR have made a difference? Perhaps - Fulham could have been awarded a penalty in the 61st minute after Sakho appeared to swipe the feet out from under Schurrle, with the crowd calling for the spot-kick. Replays show that he did not get the ball but there are questions over how much contact there actually was. Had it been given - and scored - it would have levelled proceedings. What's next? Fulham are in action next Saturday as they take on Tottenham at Wembley, although Crystal Palace have a slightly longer break, not playing until Monday Night Football when they host Liverpool at

Smith's Stadium. Jorginho, a £57m summer signing from Sarri's former club Napoli, netted from the penalty spot (45) after N'Golo Kante had opened the scoring with a first-time finish from Willian's cross (34). Steve Mounie hit the post for Huddersfield in between those goals, but Chelsea dominated the second half, adding their third goal when Eden Hazard, who started the game on the bench following his World Cup excursions, set up Pedro (80). Player ratings Huddersfield: Hamer (5), Hadergjonaj (5), Zanka (6), Schindler (6), Kongolo (6), Lowe (6), Hogg (6), Mooy (7), Billing (6), Pritchard (6), Mounie (6) Subs: Depoitre (6), Diakhaby (6) Chelsea: Kepa (7), Azpilicueta (7), Rudiger (7), Luiz (7), Alonso (7), Jorginho (8), Kante (8), Barkley (7), Willian (8), Pedro (7), Morata (6) Subs: Loftus-Cheek (6), Hazard (8), Moses (6) Man of the match: N'Golo Kante It capped a satisfying afternoon for Sarri, who also handed a debut to Kepa Arrizabalaga following his world-record £71.6m transfer from Athletic Bilbao in his first Premier League game in charge. Huddersfield never looked like getting back into the game after Jorginho's penalty on the stroke of half-time, but it looked like an even contest in the opening exchanges. Pedro celebrates with Eden Hazard after scoring his goal Chelsea enjoyed most of the possession in Sarri's favoured 4-3-3 formation, but they struggled to break the hosts down until Kante hit the opener with their first shot on goal. The World Cup-winner, who was playing in a more advanced role than last season, mis-hit his effort, but it bounced up and over Huddersfield goalkeeper Ben Hamer to give him his first Premier League goal since September 2017. Team news Maurizio Sarri gave Chelsea debuts to new signings Kepa Arrizabalaga and Jorginho. Eden Hazard was only on the bench, with Ross Barkley starting in midfield. For Huddersfield, Ben Hamer was preferred to Jonas Lossl in goal. Mounie was inches away from equalising when he headed against the inside of the post from a Huddersfield corner a few minutes later, but Chelsea soon doubled their advantage. Marcos Alonso won their penalty, drawing a foul from Christopher Schindler, and Jorginho showed impressive composure to coolly slot his finish past Hamer. Kepa Arrizabalaga marked his debut with a clean sheet Alonso then struck the crossbar with an acrobatic effort as Chelsea became increasingly dominant in the second half, with the third goal eventually arriving 10 minutes from time. Hazard was the architect, driving forward and drawing blue and white shirts towards him before releasing the unmarked Pedro, who dinked his finish over Hamer to wrap up the victory. Opta stats Chelsea's 3-0 win was the largest margin of victory in their first Premier League game under a new manager since 2008, when Luiz Felipe Scolari oversaw a 4-0 win against Portsmouth. Huddersfield have lost five of their last seven opening games of a league campaign, failing to score in each of the five defeats. Huddersfield have picked up just nine points from their last possible 36 in Premier League home games, with the first game in this run being a 1-3 defeat against Chelsea in this fixture last season. Chelsea midfielder Jorginho has scored 90 per cent of the penalties he has taken in all competitions, converting 10 of his 11 spot kicks across three different clubs (Verona, Napoli and Chelsea). Willian has been directly involved in four of Chelsea's six Premier League goals at the John Smith's Stadium, scoring one and assisting another three. The managers 1:57 Sarri was pleased with the opening win Sarri was pleased with the opening win David Wagner (Huddersfield): \"We played well. The players have shown commitment, desire, passion and created chances. We hit the bar twice. Once when we were 1-0 down after conceding a very unlucky goal from a deflection. It was Chelsea's first chance more or less out of nothing and then we conceded the penalty where we clearly made a big mistake. You can't do that against Chelsea because they will hurt you, and that's exactly what they did.\" Maurizio Sarri (Chelsea): \"I am really very happy because in the first part of the season I think that for us it is not easy to gain points. The first half was hard. If you look at the result, you can think about an easy game, but in the first half we were in trouble for 15 minutes against a very physical team.\" 3:48 Wagner said his players tried everything Wagner said his players tried everything Man of the match - N'Golo Kante As expected, Kante started in a more attacking role than in the last two seasons, lining up on the right-hand side of Sarri's three-man midfield, with Jorginho in the holding role. He took to the position without any problems, providing his usual defensive tenacity to break up counter-attacks and scoring only his fourth Premier League goal in 107 appearances. With new licence to attack, there might be more to follow. N'Golo Kante is mobbed by his Chelsea team-mates Notes for Gareth Southgate Could Barkley work his way back into England contention? The 24-year-old endured a torrid time at Chelsea last season but he has come in from the cold under Sarri and showed flashes of his ability at the John Smith's Stadium before making way for Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Southgate would be wise to keep an eye on him. What's next? Huddersfield's next game is against champions Manchester City live on Sky Sports at the Etihad Stadium on Super Sunday, while Chelsea welcome Arsenal to Stamford Bridge on the Saturday."},{"date":

Watford 2-0 Brighton Roberto Pereyra scored twice as Watford comfortably beat Brighton 2-0 at Vicarage Road to get their 2018/19 season off to the perfect start. Watford dominated from start to finish and deservedly took the lead on 35 minutes as Pereyra slammed a first-time volley into the roof of the net from a looping Jose Holebas cross. Roberto Pereyra celebrates after putting Watford ahead at Vicarage Road The pair combined again nine minutes into the second half, with Pereyra curling his effort beyond Mat Ryan from close range after wandering into space inside the penalty area. It was all too comfortable for Watford, who controlled the game impressively in the second half, while Brighton have plenty of work ahead after failing to register a single shot on target throughout the 90 minutes. Player ratings Watford: Foster (7), Janmaat (7), Cathcart (7), Kabasele (7), Holebas (8), Pereyra (9), Capoue (7), Doucoure (6), Hughes (6), Deeney (6), Gray (7) Subs: Success (5), Sema (N/A), Kiko (N/A) Brighton: Ryan (6), Bruno (6), Dunk (6), Duffy (5), Bernardo (5), Stephens (5), Propper (6), Gross (4), March (5), Knockaert (4), Murray (5) Subs: Bong (5), Bissouma (6), Jahanbakhsh (6) Man of the match: Roberto Pereyra (Watford) Alongside Newcastle, Watford were the only club in the Premier League to turn a profit on transfers in the summer and consequently, Javi Gracia's side have been tipped to struggle this season. On the evidence of their first game of the campaign, though, talk of Watford's demise has been greatly exaggerated. From the first whistle, Watford looked fresher and sharper than their opponents and Troy Deeney should have put them in front after 17 minutes when he found himself unmarked inside the area, but his shot was well parried by Ryan, with Pereyra firing the rebound well over the top. Brighton endured a difficult opening game of the 2018/19 Premier League season Brighton's cause wasn't helped when club captain and long-serving stalwart Bruno was forced off the pitch with what looked like a hamstring injury on 25 minutes. Summer signing from RB Leipzig, Bernardo, shifted across from left-back to right-back but he found it difficult to contain Pereyra who was in electric form. Set-pieces caused Brighton huge problems last season and it was from a corner that Watford took the lead. Abdoulaye Doucoure took it short to Holebas, who hoisted a high cross towards the edge of the box where Pereyra was lurking and the Argentine impressively controlled his volley to find the top corner. Team news Watford handed a third debut to summer signing Ben Foster who spent two loan spells with the club earlier on in his career.Abdoulaye Doucoure failed to feature in pre-season due to injury but he was deemed fit enough to start for the hosts.Brighton made a host of signings during the transfer window but only one started the game with defender Bernardo lining up at left back. Glenn Murray went close to equalising for Brighton when he steered his header wide from a Pascal Gross cross on the stroke of half-time but instead it was Watford who got the game's second goal. Holebas smuggled the ball behind the out-of-position Bernardo and into Pereyra's path in the inside-left channel and the unmarked Watford winger picked his spot, firing clinically past Ryan. 12 - Watford are unbeaten in their last 12 opening games to a league season (W6 D6), with their last defeat coming against Everton in August 2006. Streak. pic.twitter.com/OQ5cX7Qi5x — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) August 11, 2018 There was very little goalmouth action of note from either side after Pereyra's second but, if there was one small positive for Chris Hughton to take back to the south coast, it was that new recruits Yves Bissouma and Alireza Jahanbahksh had a couple of promising moments after coming on. This was Watford's day, though and they are unlikely to enjoy as comfortable an afternoon as this for the remainder of the Premier League season. Opta stats Brighton are winless in their last 14 Premier League away games (W0 D4 L10), the longest current such run in the division. Watford have lost only one of their last nine Premier League matches at Vicarage Road (W5 D3). Watford's Roberto Pereyra has scored five Premier League goals in his last five games at Vicarage Road, this after netting just three in his previous 19. Roberto Pereyra has had a hand in each of Watford's last six Premier League goals, scoring five and assisting one. Ben Foster made his first Premier League appearance for Watford since May 13, 2007 vs Newcastle (4108 days ago) - the second-longest gap between two games for a single team in the competition after Wayne Rooney for Everton (4837 days). The managers Javi Gracia: \"I am very happy because we got a good result but the way we did it was even better. We controlled the game, created many chances and Brighton didn't have any shots on target. \"We did very good work in pre-season but I'm sure Brighton did as well. The first game is different, we played in front of our own fans so it was a bit easier but I'm sure Brighton will have a very good season as well. Javi Gracia wasn't surprised by Roberto Pereyra's match-winning performance \"It didn't surprise me, I know he [Roberto Pereyra] is capable of doing these things. I'm very happy for him. From when I arrived in January, Roberto was the one who was causing the most goals in the team.\" Chris Hughton: \"I thought we were second-best in most departments. We had a good period 20-25 minutes before the end of the game but when we did get into good areas we weren't able to produce that quality. Watford deserved their victory and we've got a lot of work to do. \"I don't know why we were off the pace. Our preparation was probably the same as Watford's, we had a good week coming into the game, we probably didn't score enough goals in pre-season, but in regards to players being up to speed we've got no excuses.\" Man of the match - Roberto Pereyra There could be only be one candidate. Watford's match-winner has suffered injury problems since joining from Juventus in 2016 but he looked extremely sharp from the outset here, causing Brighton problems with his movement and directness. Technically, his first goal was executed almost perfectly as he watched the ball out of the sky, all the way onto his right foot and while Mat Ryan got a hand to it, the power in the strike was enough to beat him. Jose Holebas provided Pereyra with assists for both of his goals and Javi Gracia will be hoping that they can maintain their positive relationship on Watford's left wing for the rest of the season. What's next? Next up for Watford is a trip to Turf Moor to take on Burnley next Sunday before they return home for the visit of Crystal Palace seven days later, live on Sky Sports. Rather worryingly for Brighton, their next two matches are against two of last season's top four as they host Manchester United at the Amex next Sunday, live on Sky Sports, before travelling to Anfield to face Liverpool the following Saturday."},{"date": "11/08/2019", "arena": "Molineux", "attendance": 31231, "home_team": {"name": "Wolverhampton Wanderers", "lineup": [{"name": "Rui

at Molineux. Everton forward Richarlison looked like he would take the headlines after the £40m summer signing scored two goals either side of half-time (17 & 67). Sandwiched between those was a controversial equaliser for Wolves, who levelled after Phil Jagielka had been shown a red card for bringing down Diogo Jota as he was clean through on goal, with replays inconclusive as to whether he had got the ball first - and Ruben Neves fired in the resulting free-kick (44). But with Wolves struggling to manufacture clear-cut chances on the whole, Jimenez made the most of an excellent cross from Neves to nod into the floor beyond Jordan Pickford and ensure the spoils were shared (80). Player ratings Wolves: Patricio (7), Doherty (6), Bennett (6), Boly (5), Coady (6), Jonny (5), Neves (8), Moutinho (7), Costa (7), Jimenez (7), Jota (6). Subs: Bonatini (6), Vinagre (6), Gibbs-White (n/a). Everton: Pickford (6), Coleman (6), Jagielka (5), Keane (7), Baines (7), Gueye (7), Schneiderlin (7), Walcott (5), Sigurdsson (6), Richarlison (8), Tosun (7). Subs: Holgate (7), Niasse (6), Digne (n/a). Man of the match: Richarlison Two teams full of confidence and intent began at a good pace at Molineux, but Everton looked the more likely to create early on with Wolves' wing-backs often pegged back. The first shot on target of the game brought the opening goal, with Richarlison involved throughout. The Brazilian was fouled on the left by Matt Doherty, and Gylfi Sigurdsson's free-kick fell kindly for Richarlison to instantly answer the critics of his big-money move. It took Wolves 36 minutes to register a touch inside the Everton box, and they struggled to get in behind their visitors, but with half-time approaching they were gifted an advantage when Jagielka stretched to win the ball ahead of Jota after a heavy touch, and appeared to catch the Wolves man as he headed through on goal. Team news Richarlison was the only new signing to start for Everton, with Lucas Digne on the bench and Andre Gomes, Bernard and Yerry Mina not involved. Wolves persisted with their 3-4-3 from last season, with Raul Jimenez starting in attack and new boy Rui Patricio between the sticks. Ryan Bennett got the nod ahead of Saiss in defence. A red card followed - but worse was to come for Everton as Neves stepped up to fire home the free-kick moments later, with Jordan Pickford let down by his positioning. After half-time, Everton regrouped impressively and rarely looked like a side with a man light; and they took the lead again when Richarlison took a lay-off from Cenk Tosun in his stride, drove into the box and bent a low shot beyond Rui Patricio and into the far corner. That looked like being it for 13 minutes until a rare quality delivery, from Neves, found Jimenez who had peeled off Michael Keane before nodding in. Opta facts Wolves are now seven league matches without a victory against Everton (D5 L2) since a 2-1 win in May 2004. Everton have drawn their last three opening day Premier League matches against newly-promoted sides, also doing so in 2014-15 against Leicester and 2015-16 against Watford - all finished 2-2. Richarlison found the net with his first two shots in the Premier League for Everton, having failed to score with any of his last 53 shots as a Watford player. Since the start of last season, Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves has scored more goals from outside the box than any other player in the top four tiers of English league football (7). Everton defender Phil Jagielka was sent off for only the second time in his Premier League career - he is the oldest Englishman (35y 359d) to be red carded in the top-flight since Chris Powell (37y 81d) in November 2006. Everton's red card was their 90th in the Premier League - more than any other side. Wolves defender Matt Doherty made his second Premier League appearance - 2,513 days after his first in September 2011; only two outfield players have had a longer wait for their second appearances - Erik Nevland (3,667) and Darren Pratley (2,835). Ruben Neves both scored and assisted for Wolves - the last Portuguese player to achieve that in a Premier League game was Nani in April 2012, also against Everton. Man of the match - Richarlison For a man with a considerable weight of pressure on his shoulders and a £40m price tag on his head, Richarlison played with freedom and intent. A fortunate bounce left him with a finish he couldn't miss for the opener, but his second was all his own work. RIcharlison strokes home his second at Molineux Finally fully fit after a first prolonged break in 18 months, Richarlison chipped in going forwards and at the back - making three tackles, winning the ball back six times and blocking one shot. What's next? Everton are at home to Southampton at 3pm on Saturday, while Wolves face a tricky test at Leicester at the same time."},{"date": "10/08/2019", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 74439,

Highlights: Manchester United 2-1 Leicester Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw scored in each half as Manchester United ushered in the new Premier League season with a 2-1 victory over Leicester at Old Trafford. France international Pogba coolly converted a third-minute penalty after Daniel Amartey was penalised for handball, before Shaw wrapped up the victory seven minutes from time with his first goal in senior football. Leicester pulled one back two minutes into added time through Jamie Vardy's close-range header, but United withstood a late onslaught to secure Jose Mourinho the third successive opening-day victory of his tenure at the club. Player ratings Man Utd: De Gea (8), Darmian (6), Bailly (6), Lindelof (6), Shaw (8), Fred (7), A Pereira (7), Pogba (8), Mata (6), Rashford (6), Sanchez (6). Subs: Lukaku (5), McTominay (5), Fellaini (5). Leicester: Schmeichel (6), Amartey (4), Morgan (5), Maguire (6), Chilwell (5), Ndidi (5), Silva (6), R Pereira (6), Maddison (7), Gray (6), Iheanacho (6). Subs: Vardy (6), Ghezzal (5), Iborra (5). Man of the Match: Luke Shaw. There were only 75 seconds on the clock when Pogba was handed, literally, the chance to score the first goal of the Premier League season, as a blocked Alexis Sanchez shot hit Amartey's outstretched arm. Up stepped United's captain, who showed no sign of fatigue after his World Cup-winning summer, to dispatch the spot-kick beyond Kasper Schmeichel into the roof of the net. Paul Pogba scores an early goal from the penalty spot United continued on the front foot but any hopes of putting Leicester to the sword in a blistering opening spell subsided as the visitors got a foothold, Wilfred Ndidi drawing David de Gea into action at full stretch with the Foxes' first attempt on target after Fred's poor clearance. The Spanish goalkeeper was forced into action on 29 minutes as his stunning point-blank save denied James Maddison a goal on his Premier League debut, after Ricardo Pereira's cut-back found the Leicester new boy in space in the area. Fred and James Maddison made their Premier League debuts for their respective new clubs And when the resulting corner was cleared as far as Ricardo - another new Leicester signing - Pogba was on hand with a crucial last-gasp deflection to preserve United's lead through to the interval. United had Eric Bailly to thank for keeping them ahead on 62 minutes as the Ivorian showed great strength to outmuscle Kelechi Iheanacho after he had been played through on goal. Team news World Cup winner Paul Pogba captained United, while summer signing Fred made his Premier League debut. Romelu Lukaku and Anthony Martial started on the bench. Harry Maguire lined up against United having been linked with a move to the club all summer. New signings Ricardo Pereira and James Maddison started too, but Jonny Evans and Rachid Ghezzal were named on the bench. The insurance of a second goal proved elusive for Mourinho's men, who thought they should have had a penalty when Juan Mata's shot deflected behind off Wes Morgan's elbow, but not even a corner was awarded. And their slender lead faced its greatest threat when substitute Vardy picked Shaw's pocket and crossed for Gray on 75 minutes, but again De Gea proved impenetrable with another fine save. Luke Shaw scores Manchester United's second goal of the game Substitute Romelu Lukaku should have put the game beyond Leicester on 78 minutes, but the onrushing Schmeichel diverted his effort onto the roof of the net. Shaw then secured the victory when he fired past Schmeichel from a narrow angle, with Vardy's late effort mere consolation for the Foxes. Shaw celebrates his first senior goal Opta stats Manchester United have won on the opening day in each of their last four seasons, their joint-longest run in the Premier League (also four in a row between 2000-01 and 2003-04). Leicester City are winless in their last 16 away top-flight matches on the opening day of the season (D8 L8) since a 3-2 win at Aston Villa in August 1933. Manchester United have won eight of their last nine home Premier League games against Leicester City (D1), winning all three under manager Jose Mourinho. Jose Mourinho is unbeaten in all 18 of his opening league matches of a season as a manager (W11 D7), winning nine of his 10 in the Premier League (D1). Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has scored in 11 Premier League games and ended on the winning side in all of them - a joint-record he shares with former Liverpool player Ryan Babel. Leicester City have conceded the first goal of the Premier League season in each of the last three seasons, also doing so in 2016-17 against Hull City and 2017-18 against Arsenal. Paul Pogba's goal inside three minutes was Manchester United's fastest goal scored in a Premier League season - the previous fastest was Dwight Yorke after seven minutes against Everton in 1999-2000. Manchester United full-back Luke Shaw registered his first senior goal in his 134th appearance in all competitions (67 games each for Southampton and Man Utd). Leicester's Jamie Vardy has now ended on the losing side in four of the last five Premier League matches in which he's found the net (W1). Man of the Match - Luke Shaw While his first senior goal will grab all the headlines, Shaw's overall performance showed signs that the often-maligned full-back is starting to fulfil his potential at Old Trafford. Shaw was United's standout performer, he made the most touches, successful passes and won back possession seven times in his defensive third. What's more, no one had more touches than he did in the opposition box or shots on target. With options at Mourinho's disposal at a premium, it was a timely reminder to his manager of the talents he possesses. 1:55 Shaw says that his first goal is the highlight of his career so far Shaw says that his first goal is the highlight of his career so far What's next? After the nine remaining games on the opening weekend of the Premier League season, United travel to Brighton - live on Renault Super Sunday at 4pm - while Leicester host newly-promoted Wolves at 3pm on Saturday."}]
