They were inferior to their rivals by a glaring 16 goals, with Louis van Gaal’s strugglers beating opposition goalkeepers 49 times, the club’s poorest return since the 46 of 1989-90.\n\nThis win confirms the Dutchman’s side will play in the Europa League but this is not the goal that Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, demanded of his manager for the campaign.\n\nLast season United qualified for the Champions League and to his credit Van Gaal acknowledged his team is in reverse. “Of course because our aim in the first year and also the second and the third shall be Champions League,” said the 64-year-old.\n\nLeicester City arrive in Thailand for a victory tour Read more\n\nHe is, though, confident of still being in charge for the first match of next season. “Yes. Because I have signed a three-year contract,” the Dutchman insisted.\n\nVan Gaal was booed before he said a few words to the sparse crowd ahead of the players’ “lap of appreciation”. The manager said: “I want to thank you for your unconditional support. Wherever we have played, however the things have gone on the field, you never let us down. Thank you for that and we want to bring the FA Cup home to you.”\n\nAsked later about the jeers, Van Gaal said: “The fans are expecting a lot but I think these expectations are much too high. We are a team in transition and I said that when I started here at Manchester United. Maybe I need to bring over the message much clearer than I have done.”\n\nDespite this Van Gaal claims United can win a 21st championship next term. “It is always possible because Leicester City was more or less a relegation team,” he said. “We are fourth and fifth. But in sport nothing is normal, you have to show it and fight for it.”\n\nVan Gaal can partly repair his reputation by beating Crystal Palace at Wembley on Saturday to claim the FA Cup, but whether it will be sufficient to save his job is to be decided. “I came here to win a title,” he said, “and the FA Cup is a very important title.”\n\nThe Dutchman has to face the fact that the threadbare attendance, which followed Sunday’s postponement of this fixture due to the discovery of a dummy bomb , contained many dissenters. The banners reading: “Time to go Louis, not good enough” and “Hopefully bye bye Van Gaal” were a fair summation of how far his stock has fallen, though at least he came through with no injuries after fielding the same XI that had been due to start on Sunday.\n\nInto the entertainment vacuum which was the opening half stepped the visiting fans, who had a veritable ball at the expense of their opposite numbers. To the trusty standby of “is this a Library?” were added “Champions League you’re having a laugh”, and “we’ve got the Special One” in praise of Eddie Howe, Bournemouth’s manager.\n\nTelling here was the lack of comeback from the United support. Instead they were becalmed, much like the slumbering outfit Van Gaal so often sends out.\n\nUnited claimed a couple of corners and the impressive Wayne Rooney, again a playmaking midfielder, pinged the ball around. Yet what Van Gaal would characterise as scheming football designed to dismantle a side was actually the plodding fare many of the faithful cannot stomach.\n\nRooney showed his undoubted class by starting and finishing the move that gave his side the lead. The captain stroked the ball left to Cameron Borthwick-Jackson. He found Anthony Martial, who engineered a one-two with Juan Mata, and when the Frenchman crossed Marcus Rashford dummied and there was Rooney to make it 1-0 with an 18th goal of the campaign.\n\nUnited brightened after the break. Michael Carrick came close to doubling the lead, in a rare moment of direct action from this Van Gaal team. Instead of the chess-move strategy, the midfielder decided to unleash a 30-yard rocket that swerved a couple of times and crashed back off Adam Federici’s bar.\n\nThis helped raise the atmosphere as the hubbub normally heard at a high-end game now filled the stadium. United were coasting though while they held only a single-goal lead they had to take care to protect their advantage. They did rove forward whenever possible, Juan Mata the next player to trouble Federici, with a low shot the goalkeeper saved well.\n\nUnited’s second came when Rooney’s pass found Antonio Valencia and he nodded back across goal for Rashford to bang home. Young, a late replacement, added the third from another excellent Rooney pass. Bournemouth scored a consolation in stoppage time when Max Gradel’s shot, which would otherwise have sped wide, was diverted into his own net by Chris Smalling. This meant David De Gea missed out on a share of the Golden Glove.\n\n“Mentally for the players, they had a lot of plans beyond the game on Sunday and those had to change,” said Howe. “Mentally when you think the season is over, to have to extend it was difficult. We did our best, but Man United were too good for us.”\n\nBut are they good enough to save their manager’s job? This is the question only Woodward can answer."}, {"date": "15/05/2016", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60007, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Wilshere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [5, 78, 80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mikel Arteta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Mark Bunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [90], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Lyden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Kevin Toner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aly Cissokho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Micah Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carles Gil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rushian Hepburn-Murphy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rudy Gestede", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It has happened again. For the 21st season in succession Arsenal finished above Tottenham Hotspur, and this time the result came coated in black comedy – at least, as far as the red half of north London was concerned.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum leads Newcastle in astonishing rout of Tottenham Read more\n\nArsenal’s victory here against the most abject Aston Villa team in recent memory was never in doubt and, when it was coupled with Tottenham’s 5-1 capitulation at Newcastle United, the Emirates Stadium crowd could laugh and gloat loudly. A few weeks ago, Spurs were vying with Leicester City for the title. But they must now reflect on having somehow trailed in third in a two-horse race. How Arsenal gloried in it all and the Emirates Stadium has not felt this happy for quite some time.\n\nOlivier Giroud was barracked by sections of the home crowd but he still managed to score a hat-trick and the occasion was completed when Mikel Arteta, the club captain, came on as a late substitute on his farewell appearance. He almost marked it with a goal, too, but his injury-time shot came back off the crossbar, hit the Villa goalkeeper Mark Bunn and went in for an own goal.\n\nArteta was in tears at full-time. A few minutes after that, the Arsenal players returned to form a guard of honour for Tomas Rosicky, another stalwart who will leave the club. They wore No7 shirts, with Rosicky’s name on the back. It was a nice touch and, as the emotion swirled and Spurs were ridiculed, it was possible for the fans to temporarily forget their failed title challenge. This was the season when it had opened up for Arsenal and, when the dust settles, their first runners‑up finish since 2004-05 will be of no consolation. Arsène Wenger sought the silver lining and yet there was still a hollowness to his words. “We are not happy about being second but 18 other teams would be happy to be in our position,” the manager said.\n\n“Our target was to be first and, for a while, we believed we could do it. Today, we could only play with the target we had, which was to finish second. For a while, our supporters have not been going home happy from here. At least, they had some satisfaction today.”\n\nIt had felt as though the serious business was 275 miles to the north, where Arsenal needed Newcastle to beat Tottenham, and the loudest cheers of the afternoon came when the news of Newcastle’s goals filtered through. Arsenal had scored early on when Alexis Sánchez released Nacho Monreal and he crossed for the unmarked Giroud to head past Bunn. It was a strange afternoon for the Arsenal centre-forward because, until his second and third goals towards the end, he had been a lightning rod for the fans’ frustrations. The home crowd howled at him whenever he made a bad decision and even when there were bad decisions made by others around him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsène Wenger during the lap of honour at the end of the match. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters\n\nArsenal squandered the chances in the first half to make things easier, most notably when Jack Wilshere, starting his first game of the season, miscued into the side-net. He had been unmarked on Sánchez’s cross. The cameras panned to Roy Hodgson, the England manager, who wore a rueful smile. Perhaps mindful of it being the last game before Hodgson names his squad for Euro 2016, Wilshere played within himself. He was substituted on 68 minutes. Theo Walcott, meanwhile, was ruled out with a tight hamstring. The injury is one that is expected to keep him out for 10 days.\n\nWhen it was only 1-0, there was a bit of nervousness for Arsenal. Sánchez had twice gone close in the first half while the substitute Mohamed Elneny volleyed over in the second period and Santi Cazorla, making his comeback from knee ligament surgery, drew a save out of Bunn.\n\nArsenal finish second after Tottenham collapse: Premier League clockwatch – live! Read more\n\nThe Villa fans, many of them resplendent in fancy dress, had cheered when Ashley Westwood mustered a shot on target in the 16th minute and they went wild when they won two corners in quick succession around the hour. Jordan Ayew showed one or two flickers for them but that was about it.\n\nGiroud changed the mood entirely when he swept in Mesut Özil’s cross for his second. It had looked clear that Tottenham would lose and now, there was no longer any danger for Arsenal. Giroud scored his third from a Héctor Bellerín pass and, after Sánchez and Elneny had again gone close, Arteta helped to force home the fourth.\n\nMan of the match Olivier Giroud (Arsenal)"}, {"date": "15/05/2016", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41494, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Baba Rahman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [54]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bertrand Traoré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [53]}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Pato", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [54], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tammy Abraham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [53], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fikayo Tomori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [82], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This whole occasion degenerated into a dissection of the body language of a player who had not even taken part.

But, as ever, the timing added resonance.\n\nTerry pledged that the club he joined at 14 would “be back next year and fighting for the title”. That drew wild cheers, not for the tone of defiance but for the implication he would still be among their number when Antonio Conte starts pre-season preparations in mid-July, a fortnight after the expiry of his current contract.\n\n“This season has been tough for me, very emotional... Chelsea is my life, as it is yours,” he said. “You’ve been a big part of the best moments of my life inside this stadium.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leicester City receive a guard of honour from Chelsea and the match officials before the final game of the season. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Imag\n\nThe praise he subsequently lavished on Guus Hiddink, pointing out the “grace” with which the Dutchman had conducted himself over a second spell in interim charge, was swiftly drowned out as a chorus of “we want you to stay” swept round the arena. Cue tears stinging his eyes. Then came the crux. “We all want the same thing,” he said. “For a very long time I’ve said I want to be here for the rest of my career. We’ve had a few days speaking to the club, and I want to stay. The club knows that. The fans know that. I want to stay.”\n\nThat drew applause not least from a beaming Roman Abramovich, surveying the scene from his box up in the west stand. Yet it did not necessarily add anything new. The offer of a new one-year contract has been on the table since Wednesday, the terms of which are clearly inferior to those being proposed by clubs in China. Terry’s heart will always be to stay. At 35, and in the likelihood of having to endure a reduced role in the side next year, his head could yet tell him the time has come to move on. Perhaps there is still scope to renegotiate the offer. The next few days or weeks should provide proper clarity.\n\nClaudio Ranieri: an apology | Marcus Christenson Read more\n\nTerry’s domestic season ended with him being granted the bumps by his team-mates out on the turf. As bizarre as it was for a suspended player to draw such focus, Chelsea’s other players were probably privately relieved they could shuffle around the pitch almost unnoticed in the captain’s shadow given how underwhelming this campaign has been. In that respect it was appropriate this was an occasion when the football felt incidental. When the home fans were not bellowing support for Terry, chorusing his name and holding up his number in the 26th minute, they were serenading Leicester’s staggering achievement in wresting away their Premier League title, or welcoming Ranieri back to familiar haunts.\n\nThe Italian had been met in the tunnel by Abramovich, the photographers neatly placed to capture the oligarch offering the first Chelsea manager he had sacked 12 years ago a warm embrace and congratulations. “He just said ‘welcome to the champions’,” Ranieri said. “It was very warm. The emotion was at a maximum today. It was a fantastic welcome back. Amazing.

No one begrudged them their glorious equaliser eight minutes from time as Danny Drinkwater belted the ball into the corner of the net from 30 yards. The shot had dipped wickedly just in front of Thibaut Courtois, an utterly fitting way for the champions to conclude a season where they have been 10 points better than the next best opponent. That chasm from the rest is testimony to their dominance.\n\nChelsea only briefly threatened to inflict a fourth league defeat of the season on Leicester, Nemanja Matic feigning to shoot from the edge of the area and luring Jeffrey Schlupp to ground as he sought to block. Matic duly took a touch round the player and drew the contact, with Cesc Fàbregas converting from the penalty spot. Kasper Schmeichel had done wonderfully well to deny Willian before then but, ultimately, it mattered little. This was all about the appreciation of a team of champions, and a public airing of a game of politics that is still being played by club and stalwart player. There will be further twists and turns yet before that matter is resolved.\n\nMan of the match Danny Drinkwater (Leicester City)"}, {"date": "15/05/2016", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance":

prediction that Roberto Martínez’s successor would be “sitting on a goldmine” of talent that resonated most at Goodison Park. Teenage debutants shone as Everton ended a tumultuous week and season with a convincing victory against Norwich City.\n\nDavid Unsworth, the under-21s coach in temporary charge following Martínez’s dismissal on Thursday, believes that Everton have “seven or eight players who are ready now or in 12 months to play in the first team”. He backed those words with action, handing the 17-year-old Tom Davies and the 18-year-old Kieran Dowell full debuts in midfield and giving the under‑21s captain Jonjoe Kenny his first senior outing from the bench.\n\nAll three excelled as Everton recorded only their second win in 11 matches thanks to goals from James McCarthy, Leighton Baines and Kevin Mirallas, although the uncertainty around Goodison includes whether the trio will also be valued by whoever is in permanent charge next season.\n\nRafael Benítez could talk to Everton but is negotiating with Newcastle Read more\n\n“I think they will play a part in the club’s future because they are good players,” Unsworth said. “You know from seeing Tom, Kieran and Jonjoe today that they are here to stay. I had no hesitation in putting Jonjoe in. Kieran showed flashes of genius and the quality he’s shown for the under-21s all season. And for me Tom Davies was man of the match. He was everything we want in an Everton central midfield player – all action, good on the ball and quick to spot danger. It was a great all-round midfield performance.”\n\nUnsworth’s selection, taken in conjunction with Joe Royle and the first-team coach Duncan Ferguson, was also instructive for the omission of Ramiro Funes Mori and Oumar Niasse. Young potential is part of Martínez’s legacy at Goodison but so too is the £24m spent on two imports who did the former manager few favours before this summer’s recruitment drive.\n\nDavies and Dowell repaid their coach’s confidence with assured, creative displays. They had the trust of senior players, judging by how they were given the ball at every available opportunity, and were instrumental in the defeat of a Norwich team that brought commitment but precious little quality to Goodison.\n\nJohn Ruddy, the visiting goalkeeper, had saved twice in quick succession from Romelu Lukaku before McCarthy swept Everton ahead. The goal owed plenty to Dowell’s determination and Unsworth’s decision to play the Republic of Ireland international in a more advanced role. The teenager drove at the heart of the Norwich defence and, when the ball broke loose 20 yards out, the midfielder sent an excellent first time finish inside Ruddy’s left-hand post.\n\n“The first goal summed us up this season,” lamented Alex Neil, who could only say it “looks likely” he will be Norwich’s manager in the Championship next season. “Cameron [Jerome] has a good chance from eight yards out, the keeper makes a comfortable save and 20 seconds later it is in the back of our net. It was a good strike by McCarthy but you’ve got to look at how it’s got there.”\n\nNathan Redmond and Matt Jarvis both put decent chances to equalise over Howard’s crossbar. The veteran goalkeeper was making his 414th and final appearance for Everton after a decade at the club. A clean sheet and an emotional farewell to the Gwladys Street provided the perfect send-off for his move to Colorado Rapids.\n\nUnsworth’s side doubled their lead, somewhat fortuitously, when Romelu Lukaku collapsed inside the Norwich area following slight contact from Robbie Brady. Goodison erupted with ironic cheers when Leighton Baines stepped forward to take the penalty having had the responsibility removed under Martínez. Baines duly sent Ruddy the wrong way from 12 yards. “It was really soft and changed the dynamic of the game,” Neil claimed.\n\nEverton’s third was a rewarding moment for the club’s academy, Unsworth included. The tenacious Davies regained possession with a strong tackle in central midfield, Dowell released Kenny down the right and when the full-back’s cross deflected across the Norwich goalmouth, Kevin Mirallas was unmarked to convert at the back post.\n\nDowell had a brief spell in his favoured playmaker’s role as Unsworth shifted to a 4-4-1-1. His awareness and his accurate left foot had Goodison purring before he departed to a deserved standing ovation when replaced by Ross Barkley. The future appears both bright and blurred for Everton.\n\nMan of the match Tom Davies (Everton)"}, {"date": "15/05/2016", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52183, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [86], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chancel Mbemba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheick Tiote", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [19, 73], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [67], "own_goals": [], "goals": [39], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Freddie Woodman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamie Sterry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Clinton N'Jie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua Onomah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Oh what might have been. On an afternoon when Tynesiders devoted virtually the entire 90 minutes to imploring Rafa Benítez to stay on as Newcastle United’s manager next season his previously underachieving team belatedly remembered they could actually play a bit.\n\nMauricio Pochettino apologises to Tottenham fans for Newcastle shambles Read more\n\nIn the process Aleksandar Mitrovic created one goal, scored another and was sent off for a truly appalling challenge as Tottenham Hotspur’s chances of finishing above Arsenal for the first time since 1995 were shredded. Mauricio Pochettino’s players needed only a point to finish second but ended up third and looking anything but a team capable of competing in next season’s Champions League.\n\nAny Championship managers watching this will most definitely not be looking forward to next season’s meetings with Newcastle, which rather begs the question: how on earth did it come this?\n\nWhile Benítez’s players shrugged off the inhibitions imposed by fear of relegation, Tottenham’s shockingly abject performance emphasised their failure to recover from the blow of losing out to Leicester in the title race.\n\nAt other times, on other days, St James’ Park might have staged protests against their watching owner, Mike Ashley; instead Newcastle were politely applauded on to the field before kick-off. If part of that was probably about old habits dying hard, a bigger reason was the “Keep Rafa” agenda.\n\nIt meant that, rather indulging in “sack the board” chants, home fans held up placards proclaiming: “Rafa the Gaffa. Please stay. The Toon need you.” Such messages were backed up an incessant two-word soundtrack set to the tune of La Bamba. “Rafa Benítez, Rafa Benítez,” fans chorused, with the volume being raised appreciably once Gini Wijnaldum gave them lead.\n\nSpurs had begun in unusually jaded fashion with Toby Alderweireld fluffing an attempted clearance and the ball falling to Moussa Sissoko who played in Mitrovic. The Serbia striker’s deft lay-off found Wijnaldum who shot low into the bottom corner from 12 yards. It was the Dutchman’s 10th goal of a season he had started so brightly before sinking into a prolonged midwinter slump.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Georginio Wijnaldum, right, opened the scoring at St James’ Park as Newcastle ended a disappointing season with an emphatic victory. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\nFortunately for Wijnaldum, the crowd were clearly in a forgiving mood and the Gallowgate End briefly celebrated with a few blasts of “Stand up if you love the Toon,” before reverting to their previous refrain. Their spirit was barely dampened by the sight of a small aeroplane circling the skies above them trailing a large banner bearing the message: “Auf Weidersehen Prem: Tyne to go.” It offered proof that some people really do have more money than sense – there are surely much better ways to spend the best part of £1,000.\n\nAs if determined to defy that mocking eye in the sky Newcastle swiftly scored a second. Sissoko delivered a fabulous cross from the right and, having beaten both Alderweireld and Kyle Walker to the ball, Mitrovic evaded Hugo Lloris’s reach with an imperious header. Loud as the resultant applause was it seemed bitter-sweet, underscored by a certain sadness. Spurs, meanwhile, had created a solitary first-half chance which featured Karl Darlow doing well to block Christian Eriksen’s fierce shot.\n\nArsenal finish second as Olivier Giroud hat-trick sees off Aston Villa Read more\n\nAs the half wore on, the prospect of second spot and putting Arsenal in their place receded ever faster for Tottenham. Admittedly they reduced the deficit but the consequences stemming from the moment Harry Kane and Eric Dier combined to free Érik Lamela down the left were destined to serve as the most academic of footnotes. Initially it looked as if Lamela would cross but instead, from a seemingly impossible angle, he unleashed a shot which beat Darlow at his near post, the ball deflecting off the keeper and into the roof of the net.\n\nIf Darlow appeared less than delighted about that concession, Mitrovic should have been disgusted with himself for an appallingly reckless high, over the top, challenge which caught Walker on the shin and could easily have resulted a broken leg for England’s right back. Mitrovic even tried to contest the inevitable red card before being ushered off by Sissoko.\n\nThis being a perverse sort of afternoon 10-man Newcastle’s reaction was merely to extend their lead. When Sissoko’s long legs took him into the penalty area he collapsed dramatically after Eriksen’s perceived interception and Wijnaldum sent Lloris the wrong way from the spot.\n\nBuoyed by that rather generously awarded penalty, Andros Townsend hit a post, Daryl Janmaat crossed and Rolando Aarons half-volleyed a brilliant goal. Turning creator, Aarons’s pass then picked out the overlapping Janmaat whose low shot defied Lloris. St James’ Park reverberated to a by now familiar theme. “We want you to stay,” they roared. “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay.”\n\nMan of the match Gini Wijnaldum (Newcastle United)"}, {"date":

Everton’s hopes by staying at Southampton Read more\n\n¢“Leading Saints into a new era,” read the headline on the cover of the Southampton matchday programme, emblazoned across the image of Virgil van Dijk. In recent summers that might have seemed an overly bold promise but on what became a buoyant afternoon at St Mary’s the sense of possibility was tantalising.\n\nFew teams have played with anything resembling the verve and ambition of Ronald Koeman’s team since the turn of the year and now, with the minimum reward of a place in the Europa League third qualifying round, the chance to build upon a wonderfully bright and talented core looks too good to pass up.\n\nThat is the primary concern for Koeman, who will discuss his future with the club this week and reiterated after a mildly flattering margin of victory that a new contract on top of his remaining year “depends on the ambition of the club”. His tone at that moment was serious but there was much more to revel in; Southampton won 12 of their final 18 Premier League games and here, eventually picking off a much-changed but willing Crystal Palace, was further evidence of the elan that might have yielded even greater reward had an awkward early winter spell not given them ground to make up.\n\nSadio Mané, who has played as if reborn in recent weeks, was Palace’s main tormentor. He had already come close when, gifted the chance by a weak Julian Speroni punch, he lofted a shot into the unguarded net towards the end of a first 45 minutes that had tended to meander. After the substitute Graziano Pellè, with a trademark hanging header from Cuco Martina’s cross, had swapped second-half goals with Jason Puncheon – whose clean left-footer was the pick of the afternoon – Mané outpaced Adrian Mariappa to win a penalty that was converted confidently by Ryan Bertrand.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Southampton manager Ronald Koeman was serenaded by the home fans, with the Dutchman recently linked with the vacant job at Everton. Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters\n\nSouthampton’s second and third goals were contested by Alan Pardew, who claimed Pellè had committed a foul and probably had a point in believing Mané was impeded just outside the box. “I’m not saying for one moment that we deserved to win the game but we could have eked a draw out of it,” the Palace manager said, but the regret will not linger long. He had made five changes with the FA Cup final against Manchester United on Saturday in mind, giving the 36-year-old Speroni – who equalled John Jackson’s record of 388 appearances for a Palace goalkeeper – the sentimental vote and throwing another bone to Emmanuel Adebayor, who did nothing to suggest he has long-term prospects at Selhurst Park.\n\nPremier League 2015-16 fans’ verdicts part two: Newcastle to West Ham Read more\n\nKoeman hopes his own team’s future is clearer. “I call this season even more special than last year, with great football, great players and the big support of our fans,” he said. All were in evidence when Steven Davis, finishing crisply after a cute Pellè chest-down, completed the scoring to a backing track of jubilation that Stoke City were doing the required job against West Ham.\n\n“What we did this season is maybe more than the maximum we can do as a team and it’s a big compliment to the players,” said Koeman, who attributed greater squad depth as the primary factor behind his team’s relentless late-season performance. That will need to be reinforced if Southampton, who will begin their European campaign at the group stage if Manchester United lose to Bournemouth in their rearranged fixture, intend to carry on breaking ground; persuading Koeman to sign on for the long term before he goes on his holidays next weekend would, though, send out the clearest signal of all.\n\nMan of the match Sadio Mané

secure their place in Europe needs to be put into perspective, then it is worth remembering that it was five years to the day since Avram Grant was sacked in the tunnel at the DW Stadium after relegation to the Championship was confirmed by a 3-2 defeat against Wigan Athletic.\n\nA banner in the away end at the Britannia Stadium, given a rousing send-off by Stoke City before Bet365 takes over the naming rights, captured the overriding mood of positivity amongst West Ham’s supporters. “Be careful what you wish for,” it read, a wry reference to all those grave warnings about the dangers of letting go of Sam Allardyce last summer, and it is impossible to regard Slaven Bilic’s debut season as anything other than a success bearing in mind that even his bosses regarded his appointment as a gamble.\n\nManchester City draw at Swansea City to all-but ensure top-four finish Read more\n\nWest Ham have finished in their best position in 14 years, achieved their highest points tally in the Premier League and ended with a positive goal difference for the first time since 1986, while finishing seventh means that they will enter the third qualifying round of the Europa League if Manchester United beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final on Saturday. Maybe West Ham’s supporters will travel to Wembley to give United’s team bus a rapturous reception.\n\nEqually, however, there is clear room for improvement given that West Ham dropped 11 points from winning positions and conceded 20 goals in their final 10 league matches, which helps to explains why they relinquished sixth place to Southampton or Manchester United and Bilic came into his press conference admitting that he was gutted.\n\nThis was their season in a nutshell. Despite the absence of the injured Dimitri Payet, who suffered a minor foot injury in the win over United last Tuesday, they dominated for long spells and should have killed off Stoke after Michail Antonio’s early opener. “I said to the players at half-time that if it was basketball we would be 15 or 20 points clear,” Bilic said. “But it is football.”\n\nIt was a familiar story. Shortly after Diafra Sakho spurned a glorious chance to make it 2-0 early in the second half, shooting straight at Shay Given from close range after splendid wing play from Antonio, the impressive Giannelli Imbula hauled Stoke level with a powerful shot from 20 yards and Mark Hughes’s side snatched an unlikely win, their first since 19 March, thanks to Mame Biram Diouf’s late winner.\n\nDiouf’s header from Charlie Adam’s corner in the 88th minute meant that Stoke rose above Chelsea to finish ninth for the third consecutive season. “It was more difficult this year,” Hughes said. “We put ourselves in a fantastic position six or seven games ago but we were clearly hurt by losing Jack Butland.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mame Biram Diouf paid tribute to his late mother with his celebration – she was killed in last year’s stampede during the annual Hajj pilgrimage. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nFor all Stoke’s resolve, however, West Ham threw it away. They knew that a win would clinch European football and the only possible disappointment for the visitors when Mike Jones blew for half-time was their failure to add to Antonio’s goal in the 23rd minute. Winston Reid headed Manuel Lanzini’s corner back into the middle and although there was a hint of handball as Antonio brought the ball down with his chest, the winger swivelled and drove a low finish past Shay Given for his 13th goal of the season.\n\nStoke were on the verge of capitulating in the moments after West Ham took the lead, with the home fans exasperated by their team’s fragility at the back, and they surely would have collapsed if Sakho, who also wasted two clear sights of goal in the first half, had converted Antonio’s low cross.\n\nThe mood changed when a powerful shot from Imbula, who had a swashbuckling game in midfield, fizzed past Darren Randolph. It had taken Stoke 55 minutes to register their first meaningful effort and West Ham must have suspected it was not going to be their afternoon when Cheikhou Kouyaté’s overhead kick was hacked away by Glenn Whelan, with the ball millimetres away from crossing the line.\n\nBefore losing to Swansea City last weekend, West Ham still had an outside chance of qualifying for the Champions League. Yet their lack of ruthlessness held them back. Enner Valencia and Emmanuel Emenike were wasteful after coming off the bench and Diouf’s accurate header was a rare show of composure.\n\n“I will be a Manchester United fan,” Bilic said. “We really deserve to be in Europe. We are desperate.”\n\nMan of the match Giannelli Imbula (Stoke City)"}, {"date": "15/05/2016", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20934, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Kingsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kenji Gorré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Fulton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Modou Barrow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Vickers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [41], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [5], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "So Pep Guardiola need not worry about acquainting himself with the Europa League at the start of next season and a Manchester City supporter has gone home with Manuel Pellegrini’s club blazer. Those were the headline facts on an afternoon when City secured the point that guarantees them fourth spot and a shot at the Champions League group stage provided they can negotiate a play-off round in the middle of August.\n\nDanny Drinkwater’s late goal earns champions Leicester a final point at Chelsea Read more\n\nIt is not the way that City envisage gaining entry to Europe’s premier club competition and the celebrations among the travelling supporters at the final whistle were probably a mixture of relief at keeping that door open as well as joy at their neighbour’s expense, given that Manchester United will be absent guests when the Champions League gets underway next season.\n\nCity’s players went over to their fans at the final whistle and Pellegrini followed them, removing his jacket on the way before throwing it into the crowd. It looked like a good fit judging by the picture of the supporter that ended up with it on. “I don’t have a shirt so that was my way to say thanks to the fans,” Pellegrini said.\n\nIt was Pellegrini’s final act as manager and his post-match press conference turned into a defence of his record as he reeled of all sorts of statistics, including the number of points City have accumulated and the number of goals that they have scored during his three-year reign. The only numbers that really matter, though, at a club with City’s ambitions relate to trophies.\n\n“It’s been a good season because we won the Capital One, after that we reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, it’s not easy for the first time in the club’s history,” Pellegrini said.\n\n“Maybe we didn’t play in the way I like it against Real Madrid. But we finished qualifying the team for next season and unfortunately in the moment that we had to prioritise one competition, we couldn’t continue playing the FA Cup. We were for the third season the highest scoring team of the Premier League and the team that won more points if you compare the big teams. I think that’s a good cycle of three seasons here.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest André Ayew equalised with a deflected strike for Swansea City to set up a tense finish at the Liberty Stadium. Photograph: Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUltimately it feels like City have underachieved this season, although in Pellegrini’s defence it was a strange situation that he found himself in when the club announced on 1 February that Guardiola would be replacing him as manager on 1 July.\n\nCity were second in the table, three points behind Leicester City at the time – and it is difficult to know how big an impact, if any, that decision had on the manager and his players.\n\nThe requirement for Pellegrini and his players in south Wales on Sunday was straightforward and although the scoreline suggests that City could have been vulnerable to missing out on a place in the top four, Swansea never really liked getting a winner.\n\nPellegrini’s team had 18 shots compared to Swansea’s four, yet the fact that only five of them were on target tells its own story.\n\nSergio Agüero should have scored the goal that would have seen him tie with Harry Kane for the golden boot, and on another day Kelechi Iheanacho could have grabbed a hat-trick. In fairness to Iheanacho, he was in the right place at the right time to score City’s opener – prodding in from six yards after Kristoffer Nordfeldt had repelled Agüero’s initial attempt to turn home Kevin De Bruyne’s low centre – for his 15th goal of the season. It will be fascinating to see how Guardiola harnesses the 19-year-old’s precocious talent.\n\nDespite Swansea being without all four of their Euro 2016 players, who were given an extended break, as well as Ki Sung-yueng, who had to return to South Korea to take part in military service, they played with confidence. The Welsh side had as much possession as City, yet the absence of an out-and-out striker – André Ayew was dropping deep and playing almost like a false nine – meant that too many neat passages of play came to nothing. Swansea did have the ball in the net shortly after Iheanacho scored but Mike Dean penalised Jefferson Montero for pushing Bacary Sagna.\n\nMay the fourth be with you: United and City in final-day battle of Manchester | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nWhatever the rights and wrongs of that decision, good fortune was not smiling on Pellegrini’s side at the end of the first half. After a couple of free-kick routines that went horribly wrong and looked like they had been planned on the back of a fag packet, Swansea equalised from a set piece in first-half injury time. Ayew’s left-footed shot deflected off the head of Fernando, who was stood in the wall, and flew into the opposite top corner, leaving Joe Hart stranded.\n\nCity played with greater intensity after the break. Eliaquim Mangala profligately headed De Bruyne’s cross over the bar and five minutes later the ball broke kindly to Iheanacho, only for it to get stuck between his feet and wriggle out the wrong side.

This was a world removed from the great majority of Sunderland’s season, a day in which the sun shone, the fans sung incessantly and the manager could make nine changes, give debuts to three promising young players, leave the man credited with single-handedly saving their top-flight status, Jermain Defoe, on the bench and still enjoy a convincing, and very nearly match-winning, performance.\n\nControlled explosion at Old Trafford after Manchester United abandon final game Read more\n\nAllardyce was too relieved to criticise the match officials furiously, although he did appear tempted. “We’re very glad those decisions had no bearing on where we finished in the league,” he said. “If we’d needed three points today we’d have been in serious trouble, with offsides we didn’t think were offside and a penalty we didn’t think was a penalty.”\n\nHe explained his team selection by saying: “The players who worked so hard to get us safe had no need to come out and exert themselves any more, and put themselves through the mill.” However, the decision to field a starting XI featuring a left flank, in the left-back Tom Robson and the winger Rees Greenwood, populated entirely by 20-year-old debutants, carried with it a risk that a wildly promising conclusion to the season would end on a slightly downhearted note. Instead, they offered only further encouragement.\n\n“These were 11 players who don’t play on a regular basis, yet they matched a Watford side that was at full-strength on their own ground,” Allardyce said. “If you consider we averaged two points per game over the last six games, that’s top-six stuff. If we can start where we’ve left off, we can have a better season than this one. Next season let’s get 12 points from the first six games, not the last six.”\n\nWatford’s season, on the other hand, ended precisely as it began: with a 2-2 draw. For all their reliance on the match officials, they fashioned many more opportunities than their opponents, ending with a 21-6 advantage on shots taken, although many of them were sent from distance either into the hands of Jordan Pickford or, more frequently, into the crowd.\n\nQuique Sánchez Flores ended his final match as Watford manager “completely happy” – both with the game and his single season in charge. “I think the first year [after promotion] is the most difficult year,” he said. “To build a squad in pre-season was completely difficult because players want security and Watford was new in the division. Watford is now established in the Premier League, so next year is coming more players, more quality.”\n\nThe home side made the better start, with Almen Abdi, Sebastian Prödl, Odion Ighalo and José Manuel Jurado coming close in the opening half-hour, but Sunderland proved much more clinical, scoring from their first significant opportunity. Prödl’s slip on the halfway line allowed Dame N’Doye to run unhindered down the left before passing inside to Jeremain Lens, whose drive was well saved. The ball was immediately worked back to Lens and this time his low centre was turned into a now totally exposed goal by Jack Rodwell.\n\nFrom there, Sunderland could have had the game won by half-time. Two minutes later Duncan Watmore had a goal disallowed, even though Nathan Aké appeared to have played him onside, and two minutes after that N’Doye was denied a fine chance by Prödl’s last-ditch challenge.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Quique Sánchez Flores acknowledges the fans at the end of his last game in charge of Watford. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters\n\nThree minutes after the break Watford equalised, Prödl heading in Adlène Guedioura’s corner, though he appeared to shove his marker, John O’Shea, out of the way first. When Watford won another corner two minutes later O’Shea wasn’t taking any chances, with both arms around the giant Austrian defender as the ball came in. It was cleared, Sunderland broke and moments later Watmore played in Lens, who turned inside Aké and scored from 10 yards.\n\nSunderland might have felt those two incidents evened themselves out but eight minutes later they were cursing. Sebastian Larsson’s right-wing free-kick was headed in by a diving Lens at the far post – but again it was disallowed for an extremely marginal offside. Watford took the free-kick, sped up the other end and promptly won a rather soft penalty, after O’Shea and Lamine Koné simultaneously ran into Jurado, the referee blaming the former as he blew his whistle.

The draw meant Jürgen Klopp’s team finished eighth in the Premier League but their season will end in glory – and qualification for next season’s Champions League – if they beat Sevilla in Wednesday’s Europa League final.\n\nHenderson, who had been out of action with knee trouble since early April, is now in contention to feature in that game, and most of the players in line to start in Basel spent Sunday training at Melwood while a largely second-string held their own in a keenly contested conclusion to the domestic campaign at The Hawthorns. Divock Origi also trained at Melwood as he continues his recovery from an ankle injury but seems unlikely to be fit enough to feature on Wednesday.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum leads Newcastle in astonishing rout of Tottenham Read more\n\nKlopp scoffed at the suggestion that he could be punished by the Premier League for not fielding his strongest available side here. “I thought I decide what’s the strongest side?” he said. “The problem would have been that we come with other players and they already have their minds on the next game, which would be absolutely normal for human beings. You cannot change this. If the situation is that [if] I come here with those players everybody thinks I’m silly, and if I don’t come here with those players everybody thinks I did not do the right job, then obviously it’s not possible for me to do the right thing.”\n\nThe German was pleased that Henderson and Ings showed no ill-effects of the knee injuries that had kept them out of action – for five weeks in the case of the captain, for 224 days in the case of Ings. Klopp suggested that fielding the striker was “about giving this really nice lad something before the break, being able to say: ‘I am back and able to play football again,’” whereas Henderson could play on Wednesday. “I haven’t made a decision yet about the lineup for Wednesday but it’s nice to have the option,” he said.\n\nAfter a well-judged tribute by Albion to the victims of the Hillsborough tragedy, sporting hostilities at The Hawthorns got under way, and with slightly less ruggedness than when the sides met at Anfield in mid-season, when Klopp was angered by Albion’s approach. Tony Pulis’s side had no intention of making things easy for the visitors here but it was magic rather than muscle that inflicted the first wound on Liverpool in the 13th minute.\n\nJonathan Leko, a 17-year-old with thrilling dribbling skills, seized on a slack ball by Joe Allen before skedaddling past three defenders and flipping a clever pass through to Rondón. The Venezuelan smashed a low 10-yard shot in at the near post. The drive was ferociously struck but Adam Bogdan, making his first appearance since January, might have done better.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jordan Ibe scored his first league goal of the season at West Brom. Photograph: James Baylis - AMA/WBA FC via Getty Images\n\nLiverpool were looking lethargic until Ibe injected urgency in the 23rd minute. The winger made Jonny Evans seem oafish as he feinted his way past him on the right and then glided 20 yards forward before racing into the box, past Jonas Olsson, and firing into the net despite an attempted block by Craig Dawson. If you are going to wait until the final game of the season to score your first Premier League goal, best make it a beauty.\n\nLiverpool, Ibe included, offered little by way of attacking threat thereafter even if they retained possession quite well for the remainder of the first half. Albion refocused during the break and almost regained the lead soon afterwards, Rondón darting between Christian Benteke and Allen to head a free-kick by Craig Gardner against the post and then skew the rebound over the bar from a tight angle.\n\nRondón went close again in the 61st minute after another fine run by Leko, who offloaded for Dawson to fizz a cross from the right into the near post. Rondón got to it first but glanced his header wide. Four minutes later the Venezuelan was presented with yet another chance but miskicked when left free at the back post. He shanked his second effort wide.\n\nLamenting his side’s failure to win here and ignoring grumbles about the dull style of his team throughout most of the campaign, Pulis declared this a triumphant season for Albion. “You can’t become blase because you just have to look at the teams that have gone down this year and look at what we have done,” he said.\n\n“We will be the only West Midlands club in the Premier League next year and that’s the first time in 138 years, so I think that’s something to be proud of.”\n\nMan of match Craig Gardner (West Bromwich Albion)"}, {"date": "11/05/2016",

match but losing the fight for survival Alex Neil said Norwich’s relegation was largely his fault. “When you go up from the Championship everyone says how great you are and you sit there and take the plaudits, so when the team goes down I’ll take the brunt of the blame,” said the Scot. But most Norwich fans made it clear they disagree.\n\nThe way the Carrow Road crowd serenaded Neil during a lap of appreciation following an entertaining but ultimately futile win over Watford showed that most Norwich supporters seemingly want the 34-year-old to stay in charge and lead the club to another promotion, having guided the team into the Premier League following his appointment in January 2015.\n\n“That made it tougher, I feel like we’ve let them down,” said Neil of the fans’ acclaim. “I feel as if we’ve come up short as a group, as a club.” But he was not prepared to guarantee he will remain at the club for next season.\n\nThe man who appointed him, David McNally, resigned as the chief executive on Monday, a move that highlighted upheaval in the club as it digests a second relegation from the top flight in three years. “There’s a lot of soul-searching and discussions to be had to decide how the club is going to move forward,” said Neil.\n\n“A lot has happened in the last week. At this moment I’m just trying to come to terms with what’s happened on the pitch and where we find ourselves. The club has to decide what road they want to go down. I want to sit down with the owners and have a good chat with them. I’ve got absolutely no complaints with anybody who’s been here. They’ve given me the utmost support, I can’t grumble with anything.”\n\nBy that he obviously meant that grumbles deserved to be spread around. “We made too many errors at crucial times in games, missed too many chances, my decisions at certain times throughout the season could have been better and at the start of the season we needed to strengthen the squad probably more than we did,” he said. “When you combine those four things, to survive at this level is going to be tough.”\n\nAt least the nature of Norwich’s win meant they retained their pride. They looked in danger of going down without a fight when Troy Deeney scored early but Neil’s team stormed back with a performance that confirmed they have spirit and a degree of skill. Their campaign was undermined by a lack of in-depth quality rather than any character flaws. There is some consolation in that.\n\nHow Neil must wish he had a strikeforce as deadly as Deeney and Odion Ighalo. That duo combined to give the visitors the lead in the 11th minute. Deeney headed a long pass on to his partner and then, after John Ruddy pounced at Igahlo’s feet, rolled the breaking ball into the empty net from nine yards.\n\nThings were looking ominous for Norwich but four minutes later they drew level thanks to Nathan Redmond and, in part, Heurelho Gomes, the Watford keeper beaten by a routine shot at the near post after Redmond exchanged quick passes with Steven Naismith.\n\nIn the 18th minute Norwich seized the lead. Redmond was again instrumental, as his curling shot deflected off a defender and on to the far post. The rebound fell to Dieumerci Mbokani, who tapped it into the net from close range.\n\nQuique Sánchez Flores watched aghast as his team unravelled alarmingly in the face of Norwich’s new-found verve. The home side’s third goal summed up the visitors’ deterioration, as Allan Nyom slipped while attempting to intercept a pass, allowing Wes Hoolahan to send in a low cross that Craig Cathcart diverted into his own goal.\n\nThe Carrow Road crowd started to sense events might just turn in their team’s favour after all, but news that Sunderland had taken a two-goal lead at the Stadium of Light quashed hope.\n\nWatford pulled a goal back just after the interval when Deeney outmuscled Russell Martin down the right and crossed for Ighalo to slot from six yards. But Redmond helped restore Norwich’s lead by threading a lovely pass through to Mbokani, who finished daintily.\n\nFlores said the contest felt like an end-of-season “party match” as his players “lost intensity and did not take care of little details”.\n\nWatford’s sorry second half to the season means he is a manager under pressure. He, too, will hold talks with the club’s owners to see whether he will continue in his job. “We need to meet and see what our feelings are,” said the Spaniard.\n\nSunderland safe after Lamine Koné double sinks crumbling Everton Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dieumerci Mbokani scores his second goal of the game to put Norwich 4-2 up against Watford.

Their status as a Premier League club is preserved for another season and the jubilation was no doubt made all the sweeter because of the malicious sense of pleasure from seeing Newcastle go down as a result.\n\nSunderland 3-0 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThey were euphoric moments as Sam Allardyce reflected on another impressive feat of escapology for his portfolio of achievement and the crowd went through their victory songs. Sunderland had taken only three points from eight games when Allardyce inherited Dick Advocaat’s side in early October but their improvement can be gauged by the fact they have lost only one of their past 10 matches. Three of the last five have been won and once the goals started flying in, the latest was a relatively stress-free occasion, equalling their biggest victory of the season. The soundtrack was “Are you watching Newcastle?” and a relieved, cackling stadium felt happier than for a long time.\n\nAllardyce may even be entitled to think his team should probably have made it an even more punishing result for Everton on another night that leaves the inescapable feeling Roberto Martínez must be on borrowed time. All three goals came from set pieces – first, Patrick van Aanholt’s free-kick, then two close-range finishes for Lamine Koné from badly defended corners – and Martínez was fooling no one when he talked about his team “fighting for everything”. He has a habit of trying to make defeats sound heroic, like a conjuror’s deception, and a more realistic appraisal would be Everton did not start creating noteworthy chances until it barely mattered. For long passages they were overwhelmed by a side who had spent 237 days in the relegation quicksands.\n\nMartínez’s team have won only seven out of 30 games since 28 September and six of them have been against teams now in the bottom five. They are lacking confidence and leadership and he has to be vulnerable, to say the least, when their flaws have become such a recurring theme.\n\nThey had started the game reasonably well and while it was goalless the home side looked slightly inhibited by nerves. The crowd were apprehensive and Everton, to give them their due, did not look as anaemic as in their previous away fixtures at Leicester and Liverpool. Yet there was still enough disorganisation in their defence to concede two goals late in the first half and it was almost a surprise Sunderland added only one more.\n\nJoel Robles had a wretched match, at fault for two of the goals, but Everton’s problems were probably summed up by the parlous state of their defensive wall when Van Aanholt opened the scoring. They simply melted away and the defender’s curling shot, almost straight down the middle of the goal, beat Robles because the goalkeeper had taken a step to his left, completely wrongfooting himself for what ought to have been a routine save.\n\nAs the tension in the stands was released and the volume went up, Sunderland’s second goal was another demonstration of how Everton can be exposed in defence. Robles had turned away Jermain Defoe’s header but Martínez’s side never properly cleared their lines from the corner. Yann M’Vila headed it back and Koné was suddenly alone six yards out, volleying the ball into the roof of the net.\n\nNorwich beat Watford but are relegated as Mbokani comes good at last Read more\n\nTen minutes into the second half, Defoe had another chance, clipping his shot over Robles only for John Stones to dash back and make a fine goalline clearance. Sunderland had another corner and when Wahbi Khazri swung it over from the left Robles misjudged the trajectory of the ball towards his near post. Desperately trying to atone, he managed to claw it away but, in doing so, the ball ricocheted to Koné. He was unmarked, only a couple of yards out, and hooked his shot into an exposed goal.\n\nThe goals had come early enough for Sunderland to start enjoying themselves, knocking the ball around confidently and seemingly not content to sit on their lead. Defoe, in particular, looked eager to get in on the scoring. No other player has contributed more to Sunderland’s survival, with almost a third of their league goals, and he was a frequent danger for the beleaguered Everton defence.\n\nRoss Barkley was substituted at half-time and when Everton did start to endanger their hosts, with Stones and Kevin Mirallas forcing saves from Vito Mannone, it was at a stage of the game when it was largely inconsequential. It was Sunderland’s night and the loud, boisterous crowd made sure to dedicate it to the team just up the road."}, {"date": "11/05/2016", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 43210, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [48], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Bogdan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oluwaseyi Ojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baba Rahman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Bertrand Traoré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Alexandre Pato", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marco Amelia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kasey Palmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tammy Abraham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fikayo Tomori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A Belgium international belatedly illuminated Anfield, though it was not Christian Benteke with the injury-time equaliser that preserved Liverpool’s unbeaten home run. Eden Hazard rolled back the months with a display reminiscent of his role in Chelsea’s title victory last season but it is his country, not his club, that stands to benefit from his return to fitness and form.\n\nSunderland safe after Lamine Koné double sinks crumbling Everton Read more\n\nChelsea’s away support chanted for a new contract for John Terry and unveiled a banner showing the trophies won under his stewardship complete with a call to “sign him up”. Yet the performance of their mesmerising No10 showed there are other, younger assets that Stamford Bridge can ill-afford to lose this summer.\n\nHazard capped a fine evening with an outstanding individual goal, only his fourth in the Premier League this season, and his recovery comes just in time for Belgium’s Euro 2016 campaign. But Guus Hiddink’s team paid the price for failing to kill the contest in the second half.\n\n“He had a difficult year,” Hiddink, Chelsea’s interim manager, said of the Belgian.\n\n“He was one of the best last year and this year he was falling into injury, coming back nearly, falling back into injury and that made him vulnerable physically. You get frustrated. The last few weeks he has been working on a programme to be fully fit and now steadily he has got his shape and then you can see what he is able to do. He has a lot of talent, is clever and can play one-on-one. He is conceding a lot of physical contacts but he goes on and it is nice to see. He is physically and mentally fit and it is a pleasure to see those sort of players.”\n\nFor Jürgen Klopp, there was an element of fortune in Liverpool’s unbeaten run at Anfield reaching game No13. A ninth Premier League defeat beckoned in the manager’s 50th match in charge until the Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic was deceived by Sheyi Ojo’s cross and pushed the ball on to the head of the waiting Benteke. The combination of the two Liverpool substitutes for the equaliser reflected well on the team’s attitude and the manager’s decision to go for broke, but Klopp will need much more from what appeared his Europa League final side when it reconvenes against Sevilla next week.\n\nKlopp said: “For the first 15 minutes we played wonderful football without scoring and I said after the game it was the most important game of the season. We showed in the first 15 minutes what we were capable of. There was not enough faith in our own quality and so we lost patience and when you lose patience it is always difficult and we lost formation.\n\n“We didn’t defend together but we invested a lot and that made us tired. That was the problem of the game. Maybe they could have scored the second one but Simon Mignolet did brilliantly and Kolo [Touré] and Dejan [Lovren] saved our life at this moment. We had two or three really good moments and we used one to get a draw. The last 10 minutes it was not too lucky but we could have lost today.”\n\nHazard opened the scoring with a quite exquisite goal. There was minimal threat to the home defence when the playmaker collected possession deep in the Liverpool half and even after exchanging passes with Cesc Fàbregas. But then he accelerated past four weak challenges with a deft touch and a drop of the shoulder and, from the edge of the penalty area, swept an outstanding finish into the far corner of Mignolet’s goal. It served as a reminder of the form and talent that brought Hazard player of the year awards last season and has been sorely missed at Stamford Bridge for the majority of this campaign.\n\nBertrand Traoré, the youngster Tammy Abraham and Hazard all had chances to secure the away win but, with Mignolet saving well and opportunities wasted, Liverpool always had hope of a reprieve. Benteke provided it with a close-range header before Klopp led his squad on a lap of anticipation.

Manchester United manager could not summon the trick when he needed it so sorely.\n\nManchester United coach ‘smashed up’ on way to Upton Park Read more\n\nThe equation had been simple enough. Win here and, with Manchester City stumbling, Van Gaal would have a shot at the redemption of a fourth-placed finish in his own hands on the final day of the season. It has felt for a long time that the Dutchman needs qualification for the Champions League to keep himself alive at Old Trafford.\n\nVan Gaal has used up a clutch of lifelines during a trying season and, for a period in the second half, he could enjoy control of his destiny. West Ham should have been out of sight at half-time, such was their dominance but they were not and, when Anthony Martial conjured a pair of finishes on the counterattack, the result that Van Gaal craved was on.\n\nMartial had been passed fit after a minor hamstring injury and, not for the first time, United could be grateful to the summer signing who has become their best outfield player by a distance. His pace and power, allied to his precision, have marked him as a beacon of hope.\n\nBut this was West Ham’s party and no one was going to spoil it. Van Gaal’s team are blighted by vulnerabilities and West Ham exposed the one he had highlighted beforehand to complete a thrilling and deserved comeback. Van Gaal said he was worried about his team’s lack of height and physicality on set pieces and twice, West Ham made capital from Dimitri Payet deliveries.\n\nThe first saw him retrieve his initial effort, which had been blocked, to cross for Michail Antonio, who outpaced Antonio Valencia to convert. For the second, Payet picked out Winston Reid, who was too strong for Daley Blind and his header had too much on it for David de Gea. The visitors’ lead had lasted four minutes. Four minutes after that the Boleyn Ground could begin the countdown to an emotional triumph.\n\nGoodbye bash at Upton Park has its downside after the fiesta at Leicester Read more\n\nThe practical consideration for West Ham had been to secure a win to fire their Europa League qualification hopes but the evening was about more than that. Much more. The script had called for victory to sate the rocking hordes in claret and blue and, although they wobbled, they came through.\n\nSlaven Bilic felt tears well at full time. It was some sendoff to the old ground, before next season’s move to the Olympic Stadium, and none of the 34,602 who were present will forget it. The party continued long into the night.\n\nVan Gaal argued his team were not dead in terms of the top four; they still have an outside chance on the final day, when they play Bournemouth at Old Trafford but they will need Manchester City to lose at Swansea City. It was West Ham who shaped the occasion and they embraced it.\n\nThe scenes before kick-off had been disturbing. United had arrived late and it had not been a pretty entrance. As their team bus was snarled up on Green Street, it was pelted with bottles. The reinforced windows did their job but, more serious, were the chaotic scenes around them. Briefly, there was panic. Parents lifted their children on to their shoulders. Witnesses talked of a crush.\n\nWhen the football started, West Ham tore into their opponents. The hot atmosphere drove them. Van Gaal’s team were all over the place at the outset and they might have been further behind by half-time. Andy Carroll was denied one-on-one by De Gea, while Payet jinked inside and ballooned his shot. Payet and Manuel Lanzini buzzed around Carroll. It was one-way traffic.\n\nThe breakthrough had come when Aaron Cresswell slipped a pass to Lanzini, who was in yards of space in the inside-left channel, and Diafra Sakho dropped smartly off Blind for the cutback. Sakho shot first time and his effort flicked off Blind to spin beyond De Gea and into the corner.\n\nWest Ham v Manchester United: last game at Upton Park – live! Read more\n\nThe half-time scoreline was a reprieve for Van Gaal but he and his players set about making the most of it. The equaliser came from United’s first chance of any note and it followed a bit of tomfoolery from the West Ham fans behind De Gea’s goal. They refused to give the ball back to the goalkeeper but they did when another one was supplied for him.\n\nDe Gea promptly drove United up the field with a long clearance and, suddenly, there was Marcus Rashford feeding Juan Mata and he crossed for Martial, who tapped home. The goalkeeper turned to pump his fists and his hips at the fans behind him. A bottle was thrown in his direction.\n\nWest Ham created further chances for Payet, Sakho and Carroll but Martial hit them hard when he beat Darren Randolph at his near post after Wayne Rooney and Rashford had created a break. Van Gaal sensed the smash and grab.

The consequence is that they have left it open for their rivals, Arsenal, to give this crazy season yet another twist.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Tottenham were in a two-horse race with Leicester City to finish on top of the Premier League but after this defeat by a Steven Davis-inspired Southampton, which followed draws with West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea, they could yet finish in third.\n\nSánchez goal for Arsenal takes Manchester City’s fate out of their hands Read more\n\nIt would be a ridiculous finale to what has been a season of high achievement at White Hart Lane but that is what will happen if and when Arsenal beat Aston Villa at home and Tottenham were to lose at Newcastle United in the final round of fixtures next Sunday.\n\nThere is not, in general terms, a massive amount of difference between coming in second rather than third. Both places come with the guarantee of qualification to the Champions League group stage. But this is Tottenham and Arsenal. And Tottenham have not finished above their rivals since 1994-95.\n\nFor the third game in succession, Tottenham squandered the lead and the manner of both concessions to Davis were alarming from their point of view. Pochettino described them as “very soft” and there could be questions asked of Hugo Lloris, the Tottenham goalkeeper.\n\nOn the first, the Frenchman was slow to react when Davis diverted Dusan Tadic’s cross goalwards – the ball squirming home – and for the winner, he could not get across to keep out the Southampton midfielder’s low shot through a crowd. Lloris might have seen that one late. Davis had arrived with two goals all season for Southampton but, having doubled his tally, he kept his club on course for the Europa League qualification that they desire.\n\nPochettino said that he did not care about Arsenal and his focus was purely on his team. If they took care of their side, he added, they could aspire to finishing above everyone, and not just Arsenal. The preoccupation with their neighbours was a waste of energy. But, with Arsenal having drawn at Manchester City later in the day, it is a fair bet that there will be Tottenham nerves at Newcastle.\n\nTottenham were fast and aggressive in the first half, and they might have been in front at the interval. Their goal came when Son Heung-min ran around Fraser Forster before jinking inside two challenges and tapping home. Forster had hesitated when Erik Lamela played the ball into the area because Harry Kane had been in an offside position. It went down as Lamela’s ninth assist of the league season and Son’s fourth goal. The £22m signing from Bayer Leverkusen has eight in all competitions.\n\nTottenham had a number of first‑half chances, with Kane being denied by Forster at close quarters with the best of them, having robbed José Fonte. Forster also saved smartly from Christian Eriksen early on. But Southampton, who have now won six in eight matches, had theirs, too.\n\nThey might have taken the lead only for Tadic to blast low beyond the far post, with Davis unmarked in the middle and the equaliser followed trademark slick approach work. Taking Cuco Marina’s floated ball, Tadic slipped a low cross over for Davis and his first-time finish deceived Lloris. Tottenham were unhappy that the play was not stopped for an injury to Kyle Walker.\n\nSouthampton looked dangerous on the counter-attack, with the pace of Sadio Mané and Shane Long, and the composure and drive of Davis. Even when Mané went off in the 65th minute – he had taken a heavy knock from Lamela towards the end of the first half – his replacement, Graziano Pellè, posed a physical and aerial threat.\n\nTottenham not interested in topping Arsenal, says Mauricio Pochettino Read more\n\nThe second half was less frenetic, with the space much tighter and the chances fewer. Perhaps the heat was a factor – there needed to be a drinks break in the 68th minute. Southampton clicked in a defensive sense and they came to call the tune. Long headed off target when well placed from Tadic’s cross on 54 minutes and Davis’s second came when he swapped passes with Tadic and moved inside from the left of the area.\n\nConfronted by Eric Dier, he continued to skate to the right before he unloaded a shot for the far, bottom corner. It seemed to take an age to get there, through the crowd of bodies but when it did, he and Southampton could celebrate.\n\nKoeman had a compliment for Tottenham. “Football-wise and in terms of ball possession, they are the best team in the Premier League,” he said. But they failed to turn up in the second-half, which was curious after their positive first-half showing.\n\nThere was no spark or incision to their play and, when Forster blocked from the substitute, Nacer Chadli, in stoppage time, Southampton knew it would be their day. “We spoke about it being a special season last season,” Koeman said. “But this one could be even more special.”\n\nMan of the

U-turn at Anfield but only in respect of his invitation to Liverpool fans to flock en masse to Basel for the Europa League final. His team’s momentum on home soil remains consistent.\n\nThere was little between Watford and a much-changed Liverpool pursuing a sixth-place finish in the Premier League aside from an end product – a significant difference, admittedly, and one that explains why Quique Sánchez Flores was again left defending his position and achievement this season after an encouraging display yielded zero return. Liverpool gave his players a lesson in execution.\n\nJoe Allen and the substitute Roberto Firmino punished two defensive lapses to extend Liverpool’s unbeaten run at Anfield to 12 matches in all competitions, the Brazilian becoming the team’s first player to 10 league goals this season in the process.\n\nUefa unbowed by Liverpool and Sevilla’s need for a bigger Europa League boat | Barry Glendenning Read more\n\nKlopp made eight changes to the side that swept beyond Villarreal and into the Europa League final and, though a typical end-of-season affair took the place of Thursday’s intensity, the Liverpool manager was left with few complaints from a routine win. There was only one concern – his advice to those without tickets for the final to travel to Switzerland for the showdown with Sevilla on 18 May.\n\nUnprompted, Klopp opened his post-match press conference by saying: “I just learned this is my 49th game – you usually need one and a half years for that – and that’s about 5,000 press conferences. I’ve said lot of things in these press conferences and the last time I spoke, about Basel, I spoke like a supporter. I do that sometimes because I like this game.\n\n“I invited all Liverpool fans to Basel and that was not too smart, to be honest. It is a nice city but it’s not ready for us and that was my mistake. So I have to take back my invitation to the fans. Please, only people with tickets should go there, because otherwise everything else will be chaos. If you cannot be there, then stay at home or come to Liverpool and watch the game with your friends and let’s have a party afterwards. It’s really, really important you listen. It’s important we only send the team and the 10,000 fans.”\n\nLiverpool’s penultimate Premier League game at Anfield unfolded at a pedestrian pace on a sweltering Merseyside day. Watford were content to sit deep with two banks of four and hit Klopp’s team on the counterattack, an approach that might have paid dividends but for late interventions by Liverpool defenders and hesitancy in front of Simon Mignolet’s goal. Odion Ighalo broke through a makeshift central defensive pairing of Martin Skrtel and Lucas Leiva from the visitors’ first break and was taking aim when Alberto Moreno dived in to Liverpool’s rescue. A misplaced pass from Allen offered Ighalo opportunity to chip Mignolet from over 30 yards, the effort sailing just wide, and Almen Abdi volleyed over from Ikechi Anya’s break down the left.\n\nFlores’s side cut through Liverpool’s rearguard too easily in the first half, although the defence received little protection in midfield. José Manuel Jurado had time and space to float an inviting ball over Skrtel for Ighalo to break into the area. Once again, just as the striker shaped to connect, a Liverpool defender’s boot intervened. Skrtel nicked the ball from Ighalo and made another block from Abdi’s goalbound drive at the resulting corner.\n\nDespite the best endeavours of Sheyi Ojo, Liverpool’s dominance in possession did not yield many clear-cut openings but they were far more clinical with the chances that did arrive. Watford were handed a punishing lesson in the cost of losing concentration in the Premier League.\n\nLiverpool’s Daniel Sturridge shows desire to become Jürgen Klopp’s main man Read more\n\nHeurelho Gomes in the Watford goal had been troubled only by a shot from Philippe Coutinho that deflected narrowly wide before the home side took the lead under minimal pressure from those in yellow. There was no defender near Christian Benteke when Coutinho’s cross picked out the recalled striker inside the Watford area. Benteke cushioned a header towards the penalty spot where the unmarked Allen steered the ball under the hesitant Gomes. Ighalo thought he had drawn Watford level when Troy Deeney’s touch released him inside the area and, having stepped away from Moreno’s challenge, his shot was destined for the top corner only for Mignolet to produce a superb finger-tip save.\n\nLiverpool made the game safe when Anya’s attempted clearance was charged down by Ojo and rebounded to Firmino. The Brazilian was given a free run at goal as Watford’s defenders backed off and his low shot took a slight deflection before sailing through Gomes’s unconvincing guard. “Speculation in football is normal,” said Flores amid uncertainty over his position at Vicarage Road.\n\n“You need to live with this kind of talk but sometimes life is ridiculous. I’m really proud of the players and how Watford have played during the season. It is important to be realistic and to enjoy the moment we are living with Watford. I can be sad if people around me are not enjoying the experience.

reaching Champions League again Read more\n\nIn Pellegrini’s final home match as manager, City knew that beating Arsenal would pile maximum pressure on United who would have to win at West Ham United on Tuesday or see their own top‑four challenge ended.\n\nInstead, a breathless end-to-end affair closed with the Sky Blues on 65 points and Arsenal 68 with next Sunday’s final games to go. If West Ham are beaten, United will lift themselves to 66 points and become favourites to edge out their cross-town rivals for fourth place.\n\nTowards the end, the usually lethal Sergio Agüero steered a left-foot volley wide and later Pellegrini threw on Yaya Touré and Wilfried Bony – who hit the bar three minutes from the close – but it was to no avail.\n\nCity had required only eight minutes to take the lead and two to let it slip. They pressed the visitors back as Kevin De Bruyne took an opening corner from the left, then the first free-kick from the same channel.\n\nEach of these yielded nothing but when play switched to the right this changed. Jesús Navas was one of four players in City’s XI who survived from Pellegrini’s opening home game in August 2013 – a 4-0 defeat of Newcastle United – along with Joe Hart, Fernandinho and Agüero. The Spaniard is maligned for lacking devilry but the scooped ball to Fernandinho to turn Arsenal’s defence belied this. From here the Brazilian headed down and back towards Agüero. The Argentinian made a mug of Mohamed Elneny with a touch that created the chance and his left foot did the rest, beating Petr Cech for a 24th Premier League strike this season.\n\nIt was precisely the start City wanted. Yet within seconds they ceded the advantage and could only blame themselves. The corner from which Olivier Giroud would beat Hart was a gift, after Clichy decided to head a cross back to the goalkeeper only to wrong-foot him and come close to registering an own goal, the ball going wide to the right.\n\nFrom the ensuing kick City compounded this sloppiness by failing to mark Giroud. The Frenchman’s header past Hart was convincing but the nearest to City player to him, Fernando, only reacted afterwards: in anger, perhaps at himself.\n\nAfter the game it was confirmed that Vincent Kompany’s thigh problem will ensure he misses Belgium’s 2016 European Championship campaign and the start of the Pep Guardiola era.\n\nTwenty-one minutes in Danny Welbeck suffered his own injury. The striker went down after trying to tackle Bacary Sagna, and having sustained a suspected lateral meniscus problem of his right knee his availability for England at Euro 2016 is now under threat, too. What the No23 left behind was an entertaining if uneven match as each side struggled to establish any rhythm.\n\nManchester City v Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nAn illustration of the helter-skelter fare came when Fernando claimed the ball near the centre spot and sent it skimming towards Agüero, who burned off Laurent Koscielny. Cech came hurtling out but his challenge left him on the floor and, with Agüero still in possession, Arsenal were fortunate the score remained even.\n\nThe second half began as a listless affair until De Bruyne took charge. Héctor Bellerín will not wish to see video analysis of how he allowed the Belgian to outmuscle him near halfway. From here De Bruyne still had work to do, and he did it – leaving Bellerín trailing as he drove at a back-pedalling Arsenal, cut inside and banged a right-foot finish past Cech, inside the right post.\n\nThis had Pellegrini and the Sky Blue faithful roaring. It stunned the visitors and wrestled the initiative City’s way. However, Arsenal came back to enjoy a period of dominance and they came close to equalising via Theo Walcott.\n\nA 59th-minute replacement for Alex Iwobi, the England player got in behind but a clumsy touch meant the ball ran away from him. Then, Arsenal did score. Nacho Monreal was involved along the left before Alexis Sánchez took over. He fashioned a slick one-two with Giroud and let fly a shot that beat Hart for his 13th league goal this season.\n\nBeforehand Pellegrini was thanked by the owner, Sheikh Mansour. Writing in the programme, Al-Mubarak said: “Manuel has [won] two domestic trophies, a memorable Premier League title, and our best finish to date in Europe’s premier competition. Significantly, he has ensured these achievements have been reached by attacking, entertaining football. Our club will always be grateful.”\n\nThe emotion may seriously dampen if City finish only in fifth.

Manchester United were nothing more than mediocre but kept up their challenge for Champions League qualification thanks to wasteful finishing and goofy defending by their hosts, who will have to improve hugely in their two remaining matches if they are to escape relegation.\n\nAlex Neil was not exactly gushing optimism: “It’s not over but [the loss] is a major blow,” said the Norwich manager. “It looks a real tough situation to get out of.”\n\nNeil was all too aware that his team were not good enough to beat a side who looked ready for the taking. If one of the themes of United’s season has been curious managerial decisions, another has been bad luck with injuries. The two blended here to make the blandest of cocktails but Norwich contrived to enable the visitors to enjoy the taste of victory anyway.\n\nWest Ham’s Europe hopes plunge as Routledge starts Swansea onslaught Read more\n\nLouis van Gaal omitted Marcus Rashford and Daley Blind to allow them to rest before Tuesday’s game at West Ham, explaining that recent performances by the teenager, in particular, have betrayed signs of weariness. “You see in a game he is not doing things any more that he was doing in his first and second match,” said Van Gaal. “At first you deny it. But maybe it’s tiredness. I hope this two days off gives him the stimulus.”\n\nThe omissions left a manager who cherishes control at risk of falling foul of the “law of Murphy” that he had already bemoaned this season. Misfortune soon struck. Anthony Martial pulled out of the starting line-up after injuring his knee in the warm-up and then, shortly after kick-off, Matteo Darmian was carried off on a stretcher with a damaged ankle and was replaced by Cameron Borthwick-Jackson.\n\nWhat was obvious is that Martial’s absence was felt acutely, as without their ingenious Frenchman the visitors lacked speed and creativity. Wayne Rooney, recently deployed in midfield, was restored to the centre-forward role and confirmed he is no longer suited to it. Norwich’s second-string centre-backs contained the England captain easily until a calamitous misjudgment by Sébastien Bassong gifted the striker the chance to set up the winning goal for Mata.\n\nBassong was playing because Norwich have also had bad luck, illness and injury forcing them to field their reserve central defensive pairing as Ryan Bennett and Timm Klose watched from the stands. Those stands were awash with sunlight and yellow clobber as the crowd generated a cheery hubbub aimed at helping their team to climb out of its predicament. Briefly that looked possible.\n\nAs the hosts swarmed over the visitors early on, Rooney had to boot a ball to safety as Bassong sent it goalward following a third-minute corner.\n\nTwo minutes later Cameron Jerome should have scored after a nifty dribble and cross by Nathan Redmond. The striker met the delivery with a firm downward header but it was too close to David de Gea. “Those are the types of opportunities that, when other teams get them against us, they end up in the back of the net, but we don’t seem to finish them,” said Neil, whose team have failed to score for four matches in a row.\n\nAfter their explosive start Norwich fizzled out: their will was strong but their quality deficient. On Saturday evening their chief executive, David McNally, claimed on his Twitter feed he had resigned. Replying to a fan who called on him to leave the club, McNally tweeted: “that’s ok and I understand your view. I’ve resigned tonight and I hope that the club can now progress.”\n\nUnited were no better than their opposition. One team is challenging for Champions League qualification and the other trying to avert a descent into the Championship, but this match seemed a meeting of sadly limited equals. It took the visitors 30 minutes to muster a shot on target, with Jesse Lingard spooning an effort into the arms of John Ruddy from 25 yards.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Juan Mata celebrates scoring the only goal of the game. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters\n\nUnited summoned more vigour after the break and began to exert more pressure around the home side’s box. But they remained predictable and still failed to trouble Ruddy. The first real opening of the second half fell to Norwich, but Gary O’Neil swiped wildly at the ball.\n\nTwo minutes later Dieumerci Mbokani, introduced from the bench as Norwich sought a winning goal, added his name to the list of dire finishers, botching his timing as he tried to head into the net from five yards.\n\nAll season Norwich’s bluntness up front has been compounded by brittleness at the back. So there was no surprise when, soon after those misses, Bassong misjudged a long pass and allowed the ball to land in front of Rooney. Russell Martin caught up with the striker but Rooney offloaded to Mata, who fired into the net from 10 yards.\n\nNorwich continued to flail about gamely but never looked like landing a punch.

Other results were going Newcastle United’s way until Sunderland fought back in their game against Chelsea, and with only one more match to play, to Sam Allardyces’s two, this tepid draw against powderpuff Aston Villa returns Rafa Benítez to the bottom three, with limited hope of climbing out, five match unbeaten run or not..\n\nNewcastle’s away form has been abysmal all season, but this was supposed to be their get-out-of-jail card. A team fighting for survival could not ask for more accommodating opponents than a home side who could not manage a shot on target, but if Villa were predictably ordinary Newcastle were surprisingly lacklustre. Even for them. Survival is now out of their hands and on the evidence of this performance - a massive missed opportunity - they cannot argue with the home crowd’s verdict. They are going down with the Villa, possibly as soon as Wednesday unless Benitez’s favourite small club can do him a huge favour.\n\n“We didn’t play well,” the Newcastle manager said. “Maybe there was too much anxiety, when you are under pressure you make mistakes. Villa changed their system last week against Watford and with five at the back they were very hard to break down. Our survival now depends on Sunderland more than us, but there is only one thing left for us to concentrate on now. If we get a chance to go into the last day with hope, we have to be ready to take it.”\n\nJermain Defoe downs Chelsea to give Sunderland hope of escaping drop Read more\n\nThe first half was an uneventful and unhurried stroll in the sunshine, the lack of urgency and inspiration all too typical of an end of season game.\n\nWhile that might have been par for the course for the participants whose relegation was confirmed weeks ago, it was distinctly worrying for Newcastle, who were meant making a bid to escape. Apart from the cheers from the travelling sans when Chelsea took the lead at Sunderland, you would never have guessed. Benitez probably spent the entire interval spelling out that if you cannot raise your game at a Villa Park with beachballs and balloons drifting all over the pitch, an aircraft circling the ground bearing the message that Randy Lerner is a Blue and Joleon Lescott being booed by his own fans every time he touched the ball, there could well be a few regrets when the season comes to a conclusion.\n\nApart from the Holte End making slightly more noise than usual almost nothing of note took place before the interval. Papiss Cisse could not get on the end of an early cross from Vernon Anita, and when he had a far post chance half an hour later he volleyed into the ground, though the bottom line was that in 45 minutes of football neither goalkeeper was called upon to make a save. Villa hardly bothered to attack at all until they realised that Newcastle were not exactly putting them under the cosh. When they did their efforts were insipid, summed up by an incident when Kevin Toner spent so long in space on the left waving for the ball that the crowd cheered when he received it, only for the teenager to put his cross straight out of play.\n\nThe second half promised better when Andros Towsend sent in a threatening cross from the right that might have produced a goal for Newcastle had Cisse managed a better connection or Jack Colback kept his follow-up shot lower. That turned out to be the misfiring Cisse’s last contribution, Benitez replacing him with Aleksandar Mitrovic six minutes into the second half. It would be an exaggeration to suggest that the effect was immediate, but without exactly laying siege to the Villa goal Newcastle did step up their attacking efforts after the break as well as beginning to play with a little more intent. Mitrovic missed a difficult chance when Cheick Tiote hooked the ball over Villa’s back line and the striker’s volley cleared the bar as well as the goalkeeper, at which the home crowd enthusiastically took up their chant of “You’re going down with the Villa”.\n\nThat refrain was repeated as news filtered through of Sunderland’s fightback against Chelsea, the altered scoreline making a Newcastle win imperative. Play had to be held up 15 minutes from the end while the pitch was cleared of a fresh infestation of plastic inflatables. Benitez, who has seen enough of beachballs to last a lifetime, did not look impressed. He looked even more fed up when six minutes of stoppage time ended with no clear-cut chances but a free kick from which Townsend could try his luck.\n\nLast week against Palace a late wonder strike won Newcastle the points.

that they will not be able to sign Saido Berahino on a cut-price deal this summer, after seeing West Brom’s winless Premier League run stretched to eight games with a draw at Bournemouth.\n\nThe 22-year-old striker has been linked with a move to Watford and is about to enter the final 12 months of his Baggies contract, but Pulis insists the club will not let him leave on the cheap.\n\n“I don’t think my chairman does bargains,” he said, when asked if Premier League rivals are eyeing a knock-down price for Berahino.\n\nPulis had seen Salomón Rondón head West Brom into an early lead at the Vitality Stadium, but Claudio Yacob’s mistake gifted Matt Ritchie a late leveller for Bournemouth. Craig Gardner also missed a first-half penalty for the visitors, which Pulis and the Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, agreed turned the game.\n\n“I think we deserved to win the game,” said Pulis. “We’ve not got the results we’ve deserved in the last five or six games. And this was another game where I’m really disappointed for the players, because their attitude and application was very good.\n\n“Obviously, we needed Gards to score to make it 2-0, and if it goes to 2-0 I think we go on and comfortably win the game.\n\n“It’s a boiling hot day and it would have been easy for the players to have their sandals on and they didn’t. We worked hard.”\n\nDwight Gayle makes Crystal Palace safe with comeback against Stoke Read more\n\nBournemouth’s attack proved toothless for the majority of the game, the hosts hogging possession but wasting almost all that superiority.\n\nThe visitors were happy to let Bournemouth knock the ball about in front of them, lurking with intent to hit the hosts on the break.\n\nIt paid off as they opened the scoring on the quarter-hour, Jonny Evans’s neat cross allowing Rondón to hustle in front of the defensive cover to nod the ball past Artur Boruc.\n\nTommy Elphick’s rustic challenge on Craig Dawson led to the penalty chance for West Brom but Boruc palmed Gardner’s average strike on to the bar, and the midfielder was unable to connect cleanly with the rebound.\n\n“It was an outstanding save,” said Howe. “It was a massive moment for us because if we’d gone down 2-0 it might have been a bridge too far. Before the season started we’d have bitten off arms, legs, whatever was available to be in this position that we’re in now.”\n\nAfter the break, Pulis threw Berahino into the mix in a bid to drag his players slightly further up the field – and the striker drew a smart low save from Boruc with his first meaningful touch.\n\nThen, suddenly, Bournemouth were level. Steve Cook’s long throw drew an unforced error from Yacob, his unwitting flick gifting Ritchie the equaliser.

Theirs has been a limp to the finish line ever since form collapsed from mid-December, a run of one win in half a league season masked by progress into the second FA Cup final of the club’s 111-year history. But, by edging out Stoke City, Alan Pardew’s side survey the scene more comfortably from lower mid-table and can focus with relish on thoughts of Wembley.\n\nThis was predictably tight, anxiety flaring in home ranks late on as Jonathan Walters and, most notably, Marko Arnautovic spurned tantalising opportunities to draw Stoke level. The latter had collected Stephen Ireland’s pass beyond Palace’s back-line and wriggled round Wayne Hennessey, the open goal gaping, only to sky his finish horribly over the bar. It was a comical miss to sum up his own team’s recent slump, but it actually spared the hosts’ blushes. Too many teams have prospered at Selhurst Park this season, yet this was an occasion which ended with the home team safe, their players performing a lap of appreciation and the support bellowing of the Cup final ahead.\n\nWest Ham’s Europe hopes plunge as Routledge starts Swansea onslaught Read more\n\nThey will approach that occasion more encouraged, and with some of those previously on the fringes of the squad pressing claims for a starting place against Manchester United. Principal among them was Dwight Gayle, whose brace ultimately secured safety. There have been times this season when the forward’s days in south London seemed numbered, when Bristol City thought they had signed him for £9m and Norwich City were hoping to persuade Palace into a sale. As it was he ended up signing a new deal last month, albeit with his desire for regular game-time made clear, and his celebrations here lanced a season of frustration.\n\nHe, alone, for Palace offered urgency throughout this performance. Where the hosts had dawdled through the opening period, trailing to a slickly constructed Charlie Adam goal, Gayle had been energetic and eager. His rewards duly came upon the restart. Yannick Bolasie’s first positive contribution of the afternoon was key to the first, the Congolese driving beyond Glenn Whelan, Phil Bardsley and Ryan Shawcross into the penalty area before the ball broke free from Geoff Cameron’s robust challenge. Gayle, loitering at the winger’s side, crisply side-footed in a second Premier League goal of the term beyond Jakob Haugaard.\n\nHis third quickly followed with team-mates revived, and his strike partner Connor Wickham’s influence growing. The latter had nodded against the outside of a post by the time Gayle drew a foul from Shawcross 25 yards from goal. His free-kick was struck with venom, a slight slip as he struck the ball perhaps assisting the whip, and flew beyond Haugaard’s outstretched left hand. “Gayley’s had a funny season, but he’s put himself in contention,” said Pardew, who hopes to sign a new contract of his own soon, the deal having long been agreed but put to one side by the team’s toils. “It was important status was secured for me to warrant a new contract. Now it is, I will happily sign it.”\n\nPardew still hopes to establish Palace as south London’s biggest club, a process that will require further investment in the infrastructure, “three or four additions”, but one they can at least pursue as a member of the elite. Lessons must be learned from that dismal slump after Christmas and, for a while, it had appeared as if Stoke might deepen the gloom. They led when Giannelli Imbula burst clear, Arnautovic collecting, spinning and expertly clipping Adam free. The Scot had charged from deep, splitting Damien Delaney and Pape Souaré in the process, and slid a fine finish back across Hennessey and into the far corner.\n\nIt was his first goal since last May and should have established Stoke’s dominance. Xherdan Shaqiri might have registered another only for Hennessey to block, but Mark Hughes departed grumbling as much about Kevin Friend’s performance as his own team’s rather limp opening to the second half which proved so damaging. He, too, has issues to address this summer.

guaranteed Premier League survival.\n\nJohn Terry red card rules him out of Chelsea’s final two games Read more\n\nTheir first opportunity to do so will come on Wednesday, when an Everton side clearly focused on the distractions of summer travel to the Stadium of Light, but given the latest failings of Newcastle and Norwich it is entirely possible that Sam Allardyce already has enough points in the bag to be sure of continuing his proud record of never having been relegated as a manager from the top division.\n\n“I’d be gutted if we didn’t stay up from this position,” said the Sunderland manager. “But still we’ve got to be professional and driven on Wednesday night and make sure when we finish that game, we’re safe.\n\n“Our destiny is in our own hands and hopefully we won’t jangle the nerves any longer than we need to. So many people – staff, fans – were biting their nails in the last few minutes.\n\n“But we needed that today and it was a miraculous way to get a victory, given the circumstances, the pressure we’re under and the team we’re playing.”\n\nThat team they were playing are a pale shadow of the Chelsea side that strode to last season’s title and their miserable season was neatly summed up deep in injury-time when John Terry, possibly in the final month of his Stamford Bridge career, fouled Wahbi Khazri and was sent off for a second bookable offence which will carry a two-match suspension – as it is his second dismissal of the season – and end his campaign.\n\n“We don’t know what his future is but, for this season, it’s sad,” said the outgoing interim manager Guus Hiddink. “We would have liked to have him in our last game at home to Leicester, the champions, and having a nice ‘party’ game.”\n\nTerry had already played an underwhelming part in Chelsea’s second-half surrender, although it owed as much to the forward Diego Costa, who twice found himself alone in the Sunderland area, with his team leading 2-1, and twice struck the ball too close to the impressive home keeper Vito Mannone.\n\nIn the 67th minute, Sunderland, picking up a head of steam from their intense following, equalised as Fabio Borini was found by Patrick van Aanholt’s neat pass and scored from just inside the area with a shot that Thibaut Courtois, unsighted by Terry, could only help into his own net.\n\nThen three minutes later, Defoe, who had previously scored only three home goals this season, was on hand 12 yards out to meet a DeAndre Yedlin cross, touched into his path by Mikel John Obi, before again scoring via a touch off the Chelsea keeper, his 15th goal of an extraordinary season.\n\n“For a team in the bottom three for most of the season, that’s a miraculous return for Jermain,” said Allardyce. “He hasn’t been starved of service but, for me, the pleasing factor is he scores goals continuously while playing up front on his own.

This was a match the hosts were meant to win at a canter but instead they were ruthlessly and deservedly defeated by a Swansea side who continue their transformation from relegation candidates to mid-table entertainers under Francesco Guidolin.\n\nThe Italian’s name was sung by those who filled the away end while from the home supporters came little else but a sense of muted shock. And no wonder, given what they were witnessing. West Ham came into this match having lost only twice here all season and on the back of a 10-match unbeaten run. They had also recorded their highest points total in the Premier League, 59. Another three points felt guaranteed, especially given there were six changes to the Swansea line-up on the back of them securing their top-flight status with victory over Liverpool last week. But instead it was the visitors who imposed and impressed, securing their fourth away win of the season thanks to goals from Wayne Routledge, André Ayew, Ki Sung-yueng and Bafétimbi Gomis.\n\nWest Ham now find themselves five points behind Manchester City in fourth and four points behind fifth-placed Manchester United with two matches to play, the first of which is against United, on what is sure to be an emotional occasion as West Ham fans, officials, players past and present bid farewell to their home of the past 112 years. Should they fail to beat Louis van Gaal’s side, the Londoners will also have to deal with being mathematically out of the running to finish in the top four. A win for Manchester City on Sunday against Arsenal will do that in any case.\n\nFailing to qualify for the Europa League is also a very real possibility for West Ham, as their manager, Slaven Bilic, is fully aware. “What I’ve kept saying for the last three or four weeks is that, unfortunately, the gap between us and the top four is bigger than the gap between us and Southampton and Liverpool, and that’s the gap that I’m concentrated on,” he said. “I could not say we did not want it [the Champions League] but I wanted to approach it game by game and the good thing is we have an opportunity on Tuesday in maybe the most special game ever at Upton Park to make up for this.”\n\nTo do that West Ham will have to perform markedly better than they did here. Bilic described himself as angry with his team’s showing, claiming there were too many “passengers” in claret and blue. They started brightly and with purpose but after a quarter of an hour became increasingly disjointed and sluggish, with no one in the home ranks suffering a more torrid afternoon than Michail Antonio, who looked every part a right winger operating at right back. He was at fault for Swansea’s second and third goals, first allowing Stephen Kingsley too much time and space to play in a cross that Ayew thumped past Darren Randolph from close range on 31 minutesand then being turned and beaten too easily by Modou Barrow shortly after half-time, allowing the Swansea winger to put in a delivery that Ki swept home from near the penalty spot. Frankly, it came as no surprise to see Bilic move Antonio to a more advanced position on the hour mark.\n\nFor all West Ham’s failings, Swansea deserve credit for how they performed here, passing the ball with intelligence and speed having weathered the early period of pressure. It also bodes well for their future that most of players that came into the team impressed, no one more so than Ki, who dictated the visitors’ tempo and played a part in their opening goal, sweeping a pass out to Kyle Naughton that was turned in from close range by the unmarked Wayne Routledge.\n\nGomis, a substitute, wrapped up victory following a sweeping counterattack and after Kingsley had scored an own goal. “This was a good performance and we can now say it is not a bad season,” said Guidolin, who has lifted Swansea from 18th to 11th since becoming manager in January yet remarkably still does not know if he will be kept on by the Welsh club beyond next Sunday’s final match of the season, against Manchester City.\n\nManchester United’s Juan Mata leaves Norwich City in relegation

are the moments Leicester City’s supporters will never want to forget. They had longed for this day, and after all the emotion at the start, the dewy-eyed speech from Claudio Ranieri and the guard of honour that ushered his team on to the pitch, their heroes quickly set about showing everyone why they now go by the title of champions of England.\n\nTheir only minor disappointment, amid all the colour and cacophony, is that Jamie Vardy did not manage a hat-trick to nab the ball as a souvenir and move alongside Harry Kane as the Premier League’s leading scorer. Vardy’s wild penalty miss felt incongruous to the story of the day, especially as he had scored one eight minutes earlier, but it was only really a footnote.\n\nVardy has more than done his bit and it probably summed up the mood that the crowd had been singing for one of the other players to take it anyway. Kasper Schmeichel waved politely, took a couple of steps forward then decided to hang back, after all.\n\nLeicester City’s title-winning season summed up with bonkers party | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nNo matter. They reckon this ground hit 0.3 on the Richter scale earlier this season. This time, the noise was different. These were victory songs, rather than the impassioned pleas that have been heard at other times. Mexican waves snaked round the ground. The rain came down but, with apologies to Morrissey, this was anything but a humdrum town.\n\n“Les-tah”, as the T-shirts say, may never throw a more colourful, vibrant party and Ranieri’s men played as though absolutely determined to show that the best week of their professional lives would not affect their focus. The world was watching, and they played as if they knew it.\n\nUnfortunately for Everton, it was also true that the party could probably not have had more obliging guests. Even when Kevin Mirallas scored a late goal that his team scarcely deserved, the home supporters joined in with the half-hearted cheers from the away end. The pressure is growing on Roberto Martínez, and the sleepwalking nature of this defeat makes him look even more vulnerable.\n\nThe truth is that 3-1 barely did justice to the home side’s superiority. Leicester could probably have been excused if a little weariness had crept in – nobody, Ranieri said, had slept a great amount over the past week – and for the first time this season it was the occasion, perhaps, rather than the result, that mattered. And yet Ranieri’s men quickly made it clear they were not going to let the game pass them by.\n\nPerhaps it suited them as well that the pressure had finally been released.\n\nAt one point in the first half, long before he got his hands on that trophy, Wes Morgan danced through the visitors’ defence before striding into the penalty area and, perhaps realising how ridiculous it all was, tried to find a team-mate when he probably would have been better letting a shot fly off his boot.\n\nLeicester attacked with wit, enthusiasm and penetration and, more than anything, they looked as though they were enjoying themselves. They played football like it made them happy.\n\nThe Leicester Supremacy – a triumph that was never supposed to happen | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nEverton, in stark contrast, looked shot. Martínez’s side have now won only seven out of their 29 Premier League games since 28 September and, astonishingly, that includes two against Aston Villa, two against Newcastle and one against Sunderland.\n\nThey look what they are: an unhappy, confused side, in the bottom half of the table. Their body language was as unsatisfactory as their passing and, on this evidence, it is not easy to see how Martínez saves himself.\n\nHis only possible mitigation is the club’s extensive list of absentees, but it was still alarming to see the way his players stood off the ball, the absence of marking for the first two goals and the rashness that led to the giving away of two penalties in quick succession.\n\nMatthew Pennington was fortunate not to be sent off for the first one, bearing in mind he had already been booked, and it was a senseless tackle from the substitute Darron Gibson that gave Vardy his hat-trick chance. Vardy’s shot flew over the crossbar but the England striker can still reflect on another fine performance when his pace and directness made him a continual threat to a beleaguered Everton defence.\n\nAfter five minutes, Andy King was unmarked at a throw-in, with the time and space to pinpoint his cross, and Vardy was quicker than his opponents, in speed of thought as well as across the ground, darting between Bryan Oviedo and John Stones to turn a first-time shot beyond Joel Robles.\n\nThis kind of defending has been a recurring theme for Everton and it was the same again when King was left in far too much space to make the score 2-0 in the 33rd minute.\n\nRiyad Mahrez, a constant menace, had wriggled through a couple of half-hearted challenges from Leighton Baines and Tom Cleverley. King, deputising for the suspended Danny Drinkwater, was anticipating the pass and supplied an assured finish.\n\nFor Everton, it was another reminder that, at this level, a team cannot expect to get away with marking so negligently. It flattered them, late on, when Mirallas eluded a couple of challenges to slot the ball past Schmeichel, and it must be startling for their supporters that Leicester are 36 points ahead.\n\nMartínez talked after the game about his team playing “like individuals”, of them not understanding what was expected of them and, in short, the exact opposite of what Ranieri said about his own players.\n\nOutside, a party was going on – a hell of a party, featuring ticker-tape, tears and a trophy Leicester never once imagined could be in their possession."}, {"date": "02/05/2016", "arena":

Mamma Mia. Even Claudio’s 96-year-old mother, with whom he shared lunch on this astonishing day, could not have seen many tales quite like this.\n\nLeicester City are Premier League champions. They were helped over the line by the deposed title-holders as Chelsea showed the kind of defiant streak they seldom mustered this season to pierce a briefly buoyant Tottenham. Leicester’s closest challengers, 2-0 up at half-time, brimmed with intent to fight to the last. But Chelsea’s second-half riposte cut them down. The equalising goal, a superb arrowing strike from Eden Hazard, brought a theatrical end to it all. Guus Hiddink fielded a phone call from Ranieri shortly after the final whistle to hear heartfelt thanks. The Italian’s voice was trembling.\n\nAs climaxes go, this was of the purest nerve-shredding, tension-fuelled variety. It was also malevolent – as brutal physically as it was emotionally. Chelsea’s role as kingmakers during this title finale provoked them into some spark and spite. That was the dominant tone for a feisty encounter that was on the limit of control from the moment the ball began rolling. At times provocation and reactions crashed over the line of acceptability and when the dust settles both teams may well face consequences.\n\nAs Tottenham’s fading league hopes evaporated their discipline lapsed completely. Twice Mauricio Pochettino, who spent most of the evening pacing his technical area like a coiled spring, raced on to the pitch to deal with altercations. At the end of the game chaos engulfed the route into the tunnel and Hiddink ended up sprawling. The Dutchman took it in good spirits. His Argentinian counterpart did his utmost to explain it all away as one of those things under the circumstances. “This is the end of the season, the emotion, we are human,” he said.\n\nHiddink, who played the role of peacemaker frequently, had some sympathy. “There was a lot at stake for them and for us prestige was at stake. It was an emotional game between two big clubs. I had to come in between a lot of people.”\n\nThe worst of the episodes involved Mousa Dembélé, who gouged at Diego Costa’s eyes during a wider mêlée sparked by a confrontation between Danny Rose and Willian. Retrospective punishment is likely to be on the agenda. Cesc Fàbregas accused Érik Lamela of stamping on his hand. Some of the tackles were more suited to rugby by the end. Frankly it was almost impossible for Mark Clattenburg to keep up, and there were 12 yellow cards (it could have easily been worse). Frantic is something of an understatement.\n\nThe hostilities were helterskelter, with a screeching tempo in front of a salty atmosphere. Somewhere amid this ferocity Tottenham’s mission was to find composure. The game’s pendulum swung in the 33rd minute as they broke to seize the lead. The move was based on slick build-up play on the edge of the box as the ball was pinged from Christian Eriksen to Lamela, who prodded forwards to Harry Kane. Tottenham’s top scorer, who found time in possession hard to come by during this breathless wrestle, was suddenly handed one of those moments where the clock almost slowed. Played onside by John Terry, Kane enjoyed a moment of clarity. He sidestepped Asmir Begovic and planted the ball in the net. The England striker was elated to claim his 14th goal in his last 15 games.\n\nThe Tottenham celebrations increased shortly before half-time when they doubled their lead. Kane won the ball in midfield and there was Eriksen, who orchestrated beautifully once again. His subtle pass, shifting play forwards and into Son Heung-min’s path, unlocked the door for the South Korean to finish crisply.\n\nChelsea did not appear to have the quality to match from a technical point of view, and at half-time Hiddink introduced Hazard for the largely ineffective Pedro. The home team found refreshed verve. Just before the hour mark they found a method to finally make a footballing impact. Willian’s floated corner fell for Gary Cahill, who escaped Toby Alderweireld to unleash some of Chelsea’s frustration bylashing the ball past Hugo Lloris.\n\nThe Leicester Supremacy – a triumph that was never supposed to happen | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nThe mood changed. A minute later Costa raced goalwards only to tumble before he could shape to shoot. Chelsea sensed an opportunity to sting their old foes. Willian was the next with a chance but Lloris saved capably. Chelsea threatened again when a ball flashed across the face of goal and Walker just managed to clear as Costa lurked for a tap-in.\n\nThen came Hazard’s blistering coup de grace. “After the whole season and the dream to be champion it is difficult to take off this feeling,” said Pochettino. “Our players are disappointed and sad we need to feel that for the future.”\n\nOn Sunday 15 May the visitors here at Stamford Bridge will be Leicester.

Jürgen Klopp’s team all but surrendered any hope of reaching the Champions League through a top-four finish, as they turned in a performance that practically invited defeat by Swansea City. The Welsh team swaggered to a win that confirmed their own presence in next season’s top flight and proved they are a force not to be taken lightly.\n\nAndré Ayew scored twice, once either side of a delicious long-range strike by Jack Cork. Christian Benteke’s goal for the visitors after being introduced from the bench meant nothing in terms of the result but ensured some satisfaction for a player in need of it. That, and a decent display by the goalkeeper Danny Ward, was about all Liverpool could be content with from a match in which they finished with 10 players, Brad Smith being sent off for two bookable offences. “I’m disappointed and frustrated because I know we could have played better,” said Klopp.\n\nThe German made eight changes to the Liverpool side that lost the Europa League semi-final first leg at Villarreal on Thursday, evidently preserving several players for the second leg. With a clutch of inexperienced youngsters given rare league starts, including a top-flight debut for the 18-year-old Pedro Chirivella, the Reds looked decidedly green, especially in midfield, where Chirivella and Kevin Stewart found it difficult to cope with the slick hosts. Swansea, who had lost their previous two matches heavily, had been accused of taking a leisurely approach to the end of their campaign but there were no such complaints here. “We were not on the beach,” said their manager, Francesco Guidolin.\n\nLiverpool had won at Bournemouth with a youthful team two weeks ago but never looked comfortable here. Klopp was not about to draw hasty conclusions. “I can’t change my mind every two days,” he said. “Two weeks ago everybody said ‘oh my God, how good are these young players!’” And they are good. But the life of a professional footballer is not always honeymoons. You have to persevere and deliver. We all have to improve.”\n\nLiverpool’s youngsters could have benefited from better support from their senior team-mates here. Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge, in particular, sometimes had the air of laggards, only really coming alive when presented with the ball.\n\nSwansea v Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWhen Sturridge lost possession to Jefferson Montero in midfield in the 14th minute, he stood and observed as Swansea built an incisive move that might have yielded a goal if Ayew had not volleyed wide from 16 yards.\n\nSix minutes later another shot by Ayew was deflected behind by Dejan Lovren for a corner that led to the opening goal. Gylfi Sigurdsson delivered with customary accuracy and Ayew showed better timing than any visitor to head the ball into the net from close range.\n\nWard, making his second league start in place of Simon Mignolet, then made an excellent save with his feet to deny Cork after another flowing move by the hosts. But Cork left the goalkeeper grasping at air in the 33rd minute when slovenliness by Liverpool allowed him to retrieve the ball in midfield and he strode forward and guided a curling shot into the net from 20 yards.\n\nSheyi Ojo, an enterprising 18-year-old, tried to wake Liverpool up. In the 36th minute he released Sturridge with a canny pass from the centre circle. The England striker clipped a first-time lob over Lukasz Fabianski but just the wrong side of the post.\n\nKlopp could not let Liverpool continue as they were. He made two substitutions at the break, introducing Benteke and Lucas Leiva for Coutinho and Chirivella. That helped Liverpool get a slightly better grip. Benteke, a player with even more to prove than any of the tyros, made his presence felt in the 65th minute, stooping to head in a corner by Ojo. But that was not the start of a comeback, merely the prelude to more Liverpool bungling. In the 67th minute Lucas received a pass midway inside his own half and lapsed into a reverie, allowing Montero to relieve him of the ball and skip past Martin Skrtel and into the box, where slapstick defending failed to distract him. Montero looked up and picked out Ayew, who scored.\n\nThere was still time for the afternoon to deteriorate for the visitors. Smith, booked in the first half for pulling back Routledge, was shown a second yellow card for bumping into Kyle Naughton after the defender lifted the ball over him. Klopp’s reaction suggested he found the decision poor. His team’s performance was worse.\n\nThe season could yet end with smiles and a Europa League triumph. Otherwise, Liverpool fans may find themselves in the funny position of having to hope Manchester United win the FA Cup final if Anfield is to see European action next season.\n\nMan of the match

Claudio Ranieri’s team did not quite have the chutzpah to confirm themselves as implausible, eccentric champions at the home of England’s most successful club but they walked off the pitch to a remarkable ovation and this could still be a valuable point, ultimately, given its implications at the top of the table.\n\nTheir disappointment was obvious after the final whistle when Manchester United’s fans clapped them all the way to the tunnel and the body language of Ranieri’s players made it clear how much this tough, obdurate team had wanted to avoid delaying the process. It spoke volumes for the ambitions of these players but, in simple terms, they had still put themselves in a new position of strength given that Tottenham Hotspur now have to win all their remaining three fixtures to stand any chance.\n\nLeicester’s lead is eight points and, even if Spurs keep up the chase by beating Chelsea on Monday, the leaders can make it arithmetically certain with a solitary win, or even two draws, from their home game against Everton on Saturday and their own trip to Stamford Bridge the following weekend.\n\nTheir goal difference is inferior to that of the team in second but, in reality, it would take something extraordinary for Leicester to surrender their advantage, especially when they will have Jamie Vardy back from suspension for their last two fixtures. Ranieri’s men might have swatted Swansea aside without their leading scorer last weekend but they felt his absence here during the passages of play, particularly in the second half, when they stretched United’s defence without having the killer instinct inside the penalty area.\n\nManchester United v Leicester City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThe downside for Ranieri’s men is that another of their key players will be suspended for the Everton game because of Danny Drinkwater’s sending-off against the club where his career started. Drinkwater’s tug on Memphis Depay, having already been booked, earned him a second yellow card and Leicester were fortunate the punishment was not more grievous. Depay’s foot was on the line of the penalty area but the referee, Michael Oliver, decided it warranted only a free-kick and Leicester were spared the possibility of a late defeat.\n\nLeicester had looked increasingly dangerous during the second half, with Riyad Mahrez prominently involved, but the champions-in-waiting have certainly played better during other parts of their run-in and in the opening 45 minutes their use of the ball must have been slightly bewildering for the global television audience.\n\nPerhaps it was just inevitable their quick counter-attacking would not carry the same menace without Vardy and it was certainly a difficult first half for the league leaders, with Anthony Martial giving United an eighth-minute lead and the home side moving the ball far more purposefully than the crowd at Old Trafford have seen for most of the season. Louis van Gaal described it as “one of our best matches this season” and, even if he was exaggerating at times, talking about their opening 35 minutes being “unbelievably good,” it says a lot about Leicester that they refused to crumple. Van Gaal’s top-spin did not really fool anyone but United were the better side in the opening half.\n\nBoth teams had chances to win it after the interval and both had grievances with Oliver’s refereeing on a day when Mahrez might also have won a penalty and Marouane Fellaini reminded us of his apparent inability to go through a football match without swinging his elbows into an opponent.\n\nOn this occasion he connected with Robert Huth’s windpipe, followed by a secondary swipe at Leicester’s centre-half. Van Gaal argued that Huth had grabbed Fellaini’s considerable hair and claimed it ought to have been a penalty but the Football Association’s disciplinary department will surely take action. Fellaini is a serial offender and faces a ban that will rule him out of United’s last three league games.\n\nAs for Mahrez, perhaps there was a suspicion in Oliver’s mind that the newly crowned player of the year had thrown himself into Marcos Rojo, rather than the other way around, but the defender can consider that 39th-minute incident a let-off during an afternoon when Leicester seemed to have identified him as a possible weak point. Wes Morgan’s equaliser stemmed from him outmuscling Rojo to head in Drinkwater’s free-kick and there were at least two other set pieces when Leicester’s captain eluded him again.\n\nUnited will wonder whether it might have been a more profitable day, as they try to clamber into the Champions League qualifying places, if it had not been for Kasper Schmeichel’s one-handed save to keep out Jesse Lingard, with the score at 1-0. They were dominant at that point and their supporters will also think back to that moment, just after the half-hour, when Lingard ran clear after Danny Simpson’s mistake before going to the floor under the defender’s challenge.\n\nOn this occasion the referee was probably right to give Simpson the benefit of the doubt, with the home crowd baying for a red card, but Leicester looked unusually hesitant during that period when Lingard combined with the overlapping Antonio Valencia to set up the opening goal. Valencia’s cross off the outside of his right boot caught the Leicester defence static and Martial took advantage of some lax marking to rifle in his 15th goal of the season.\n\nHowever much Van Gaal tried to dress it up, Leicester looked the more rounded team for a 20-minute spell at the start of the second half when, attacking on the break, they started finding the space to get behind the home team’s defence. What they could not do was find the decisive goal but the late penalty decision went their way and Ranieri still left the impression that his flight to Italy, for lunch with his 96-year-old mother, would be a happy one.\n\nMan of the match Wes Morgan (Leicester)"}, {"date": "01/05/2016", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31472, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name":

This was as comfortable a match for Southampton as it was a wretched one for Manchester City, depleted and disconnected while Sadio Mané tore them to shreds.\n\nMané’s hat-trick capped a rampant display from Saints and, while Manuel Pellegrini can rightly argue about being hung out to dry by the Premier League schedule, this result will hardly immerse his squad in confidence before a daunting European semi-final in the Spanish capital on Wednesday.\n\n“Are you watching, Real Madrid?” chanted the City fans ironically once Mané had completed his hat-trick, with Shane Long having given Southampton the lead and Dusan Tadic orchestrating things beautifully in midfield. Kelechi Iheanacho was the only City player to emerge with any pride, scoring one goal before half-time and a stunning late consolation.\n\nThe result meant City finished the day four points above Manchester United, having played a game more, and with their rivals having three matches left to play after their earlier draw against Leicester. Louis van Gaal had conceded some ground in the battle for a top-four place after his side’s match, but this performance means the race is not quite over yet.\n\nFor City, only three players who started here also did in the midweek first leg against Real Madrid, which ended goalless. Joe Hart, Nicolás Otamendi and Fernandinho remained, and this unrecognisable side were sliced through with ease on numerous occasions. There were too often gaping spaces for Southampton to exploit in wide areas, with Pablo Zabaleta and – in particular – Aleksandar Kolarov regularly abandoning their defensive duties.\n\nTadic caused major problems yet it was Mané who walked away with the match ball. It was his second Premier League hat-trick – his first being the quickest in history, last season – and it propelled Ronald Koeman’s side above Liverpool into seventh.\n\nOf Mané, the Southampton manager said: “He is still a young player and sometimes they need to be more consistent and that is why we train and work with all the players. A bit unpredictable but he was focused and clinical. That was one of my critics to all the strikers but we are very productive at home with more chances to score more.\n\n“You can talk about the changes of Manchester City but that is not fair. Give all the credit to Southampton because the performance was fantastic.\n\n“From the start we caused them a lot of problems with the movement of Sadio and Shane [Long]. Dusan and [Steven] Davis were fantastic.”\n\nFraser Forster had palmed away a Raheem Sterling shot after Iheanacho had outmanoeuvred Virgil van Dijk on the touchline but Southampton were into their stride early on and within eight minutes of that chance for Sterling, City were two down and blue shirts in defence wore vacant stares.\n\nThe Saints right-back, Cuco Martina, lofted a ball through for Tadic in the 25th minute and, with the Serb flying at pace, he deftly lifted it across goal with a single touch of the left foot and Long prodded past Hart.\n\nSeconds later City were cut apart again. Once more the opportunity arose from a lack of cohesion down City’s left, Victor Wanyama breaking up play in midfield and feeding Tadic, who advanced and slipped a precise ball between Kolarov and Eliaquim Mangala to Mané, who emphatically finished past Hart.\n\nIheanacho clawed City back into the match before half-time and the 19-year-old was the only City player injecting a sense of urgency into their play. In the 44th minute he fed Samir Nasri out wide right and headed the resulting ball in past Forster following a ricochet off Martina at the far post.\n\nPellegrini was impressed by Iheanacho but admitted it was unlikely the youngster would force his way into the side for the Real game. “We start thinking tomorrow about what will be the starting XI for Wednesday,” said the City manager. “Kelechi today scored two goals and is doing well in all the games but for the moment I am not thinking about that.”\n\nIn the 57th minute Southampton had a third. Davis whipped in a corner and, although Van Dijk’s header was tipped excellently on to the bar by Hart, the rebound hit the turf and fell to Mané at the far post who swept home.\n\nThe Senegalese attacker completed his hat-trick in the 68th minute. Van Dijk outmuscled Iheanacho in midfield and Tadic fed Mané on the counterattack, with the finish once again assured.\n\nThere was still time for a pearler from Iheanacho on the edge of the Southampton penalty area, but as the home fans sang: “Gareth Bale, he’s coming for you,” Manchester City’s heads dropped and hope faded.\n\nMan of the match Sadio Mané (Southampton)"}, {"date":

the feeling against him now. Any notion a first win in eight games would ease the pressure on him was swiftly disabused. More than an hour after the final whistle, a hardcore of perhaps 200 supporters remained in Goodison Park, chorusing for the Spaniard’s dismissal.\n\nWest Ham and Mark Noble keep European dream alive by beating West Brom Read more\n\nOne Evertonian had come to the manager’s aid, that fan turned full-back Leighton Baines delivering the decider, but others stayed steadfast in their opposition. The final whistle was the cue for some in the Gwladys Street End to unveil four flags reading “Martínez out”.\n\nMartínez did his best not to take it personally. “Football is a game full of passion and emotions and I understand what comes when you have not won enough games,” he said. The afternoon’s change of tone, from unity to dissent, mirrored feelings during his three-year reign. Evertonians had weightier issues than the Spaniard’s future to consider before kick-off. They have spent 27 years displaying solidarity with those affected by the Hillsborough disaster and, in the week a jury ruled the 96 victims were unlawfully killed, Everton again paid their respects.\n\nThe cover of the matchday programme pronounced it “the biggest victory in the history of football” and the words “truth” and “justice” appeared on the big screen as members of the victims’ families were applauded on to the pitch. A sign proclaimed: “Justice at last, 96 brothers in arms.” Under the circumstances, it would have felt crass to unveil others calling for the manager’s head and his critics within the ground duly waited. Those above it did not, a plane trailing a message that read: “Time to go, Roberto.”\n\nHe refused to accede to their wishes. “My intention is to be successful and that doesn’t change,” he said. A putative successor was quick to rule himself out of the reckoning. “I am absolutely committed to Bournemouth,” said their manager, Eddie Howe. “I will be staying at the club.”\n\nMartínez’s prospects of continued employment are altogether cloudier. If he is going, he is doing so his way. One who has plotted an idiosyncratic path was quixotic in his choices. His top scorer, Romelu Lukaku, and preferred goalkeeper, Joel Robles, were benched, forgotten men installed at either end of the pitch. Oumar Niasse’s belated first start, three months after his £13.5m signing and following only 19 minutes’ league football, was an undistinguished affair, save only for an audacious attempt to divert a Baines corner in with a backheeled volley. Otherwise, he cut a hapless figure.\n\nThe recalled Tim Howard, who wore the captain’s armband on his 413th and penultimate Everton appearance, fared better. Greeted with sarcastic cheers towards the end of his long reign as first choice, he met with warmer applause and made a fine save from Callum Wilson. The departing American is heading for Colorado Rapids and Everton began swiftly, albeit with a microcosm of Martínez’s reign as their fine work in attack was undone by a needless concession.\n\nWatford’s Troy Deeney inflicts more indignity on sorry Aston Villa Read more\n\nTom Cleverley, an ally from his Wigan days, capped a slick passing move by drilling Everton ahead. Yet, deprived of an entire back four by injuries and suspension, their frailty was apparent. Hurriedly brought back from a loan spell at Walsall, the league debutant Matthew Pennington eventually acquitted himself commendably. But he started badly when Wilson was too streetwise for the newcomer, who was left arguing he was fouled when the striker centred, Josh King miscued and Marc Pugh drilled a shot in off the diving Howard. “We felt very hard done by,” said Martínez.\n\nSuch feelings were alleviated by a winner. Baines had suggested Everton lacked chemistry earlier in the month but illustrated why he is one of the School of Science’s prize pupils. Aaron Lennon’s cutback eluded everyone until he reached it at the back post to lift his shot into the roof of the net.\n\nThe crowd had spent the previous 20 minutes calling for a full-back to shoot: just not Baines. Tony Hibbert, who has never scored in a 15-year career, came on for his first appearance since 2014. Probably wisely, the veteran did not listen to the supporters. While indicating he will try to defy them, even Martínez may not be able to ignore them."}, {"date": "30/04/2016", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52107, "home_team": {"name":

third-choice goalkeeper, for the final eight games of this season many Tynesiders believed they were as good as relegated. Instead, Darlow’s slightly unorthodox, yet efficient, approach to the job has made him an unlikely hero, something emphasised on Saturday when he threw his team-mates a survival lifeline by saving Yohan Cabaye’s second-half penalty.\n\nComing in the wake of Andros Townsend’s exquisite free-kick, Darlow’s intervention not only ensured Alan Pardew endured an unhappy return to Tyneside but lifted his former club out of the relegation zone.\n\nLeighton Baines finds right chemistry to fire Everton past Bournemouth Read more\n\nWith Newcastle one point ahead of Sunderland and two better than Norwich, who both have a game in hand, their position remains precarious, but what once seemed the merest flicker of hope is now a genuine flame.\n\nSam Allardyce is sufficiently worried by the Geordie renaissance to have suggested that, by way of celebrating reaching the FA Cup final, Palace would have been “on the pop” all last week.\n\nIf it was an attempt to provoke the visitors – who Sunderland’s manager also claimed would pull out of tackles in order to avoid injury – into action it seemed to be working during a first half largely controlled by a physically imposing visiting side for whom Yannick Bolasie and Newcastle’s former favourite Cabaye gave Newcastle frequent cause for concern.\n\nPardew may have his critics on Tyneside – although he was largely ignored by a former public who barely even acknowledged his technical area presence – but Palace’s manager is no tactical mug and clearly did a job on his former employers during a scrappy opening half. During that nervy, scratchy period Palace were consistently first to second balls and persistently prevented Newcastle from building up any sort of tempo or attacking momentum.\n\nWith Bolasie deployed wide on the left with a clear brief to target Vurnon Anita, the diminutive midfielder Rafael Benítez is deploying at right-back, at every opportunity and Cabaye cleverly preventing the home side taking command of central midfield, St James’ Park witnessed a few nervous moments.\n\nBy half-time anyone who dismissed Pardew’s hiring of Eddie Jones, the England rugby union head coach, to issue Palace with a pep talk this week as a mere publicity stunt, would almost certainly have revised their opinion.\n\nHad it not been for the ultra-sharp reflexes of Darlow – whose positioning was, at times, scarily unconventional – Cabaye and Bolasie could have found themselves on the scoresheet.\n\nInstead their respective shot and volley were well saved by a home defence that, despite having Chancel Mbemba booked for a foul on Bolasie as early as the sixth minute, had just about held itself together. If that was partly thanks to a combination of Anita’s diligence in the face of concerted pressure and Cheik Tioté’s combative presence in a midfield anchoring role, it was also down to Jamaal Lascelles.\n\nThe central defensive partnership of Lascelles and Mbemba has been a particularly encouraging facet of Benítez’s tenure and, appropriately, it was a tremendously timed tackle from the former that denied Connor Wickham an inviting chance just as Palace’s striker shaped to shoot.\n\nA similarly smart interception on Scott Dann’s part thwarted Papiss Cissé following his connection with Tioté’s cute pass but bar making a fine low save when Mbemba unleashed a surprisingly good 25-yard shot, Wayne Hennessey was largely unemployed.\n\nWatford’s Troy Deeney inflicts more indignity on sorry Aston Villa Read more\n\nWhen it comes to the execution of free-kicks, Townsend is a specialist and, sure enough, no sooner had he been brought down by Dann than the winger was standing over the ball 20 yards out. Dispatched with his left boot, the ball curved elegantly over the wall and, much to the disgust of a wrong-footed Hennessey, into the far, top corner.\n\nIf Townsend’s role in Newcastle’s renaissance cannot be overstated, neither should Darlow’s. When Moussa Sissoko was, perhaps unfairly, adjudged to have handled a Cabaye corner he faced one of his biggest tests and passed with flying colours.\n\nAs Cabaye took the penalty Darlow hurled himself to his left, pushing the ball to safety and the home bench into a series of relieved hugs. It was far from the best the Frenchman has taken, but it still ranked as a fabulous save. Should they ultimately survive, it could yet come to be regarded as having been worth £100m to Newcastle.\n\nAs chants of “Rafa, Rafa, Benítez” echoed around the ground to the tune of “La Bamba” Pardew looked a little haunted.

Allardyce marched towards the tunnel, Sunderland’s manager could be seen beating his chest with his fist and telling the supporters massed in the away end not to give up.\n\nOnce the euphoria passed, however, it was difficult to know whether the positives outweighed the negatives for Sunderland. In the cold light of day, they may end up regarding this 1-1 draw with Stoke as a missed opportunity because, before Defoe sent a surge of belief and relief through the Sunderland ranks by ramming his penalty past Jakob Haugaard in the fourth minute of stoppage time, Allardyce had spent most of the afternoon wearing the expression of a man who had discovered he was going on a camping holiday with Arsène Wenger and Rafael Benítez this summer.\n\nHe had witnessed a choked, spluttering display from his players – Allardyce blamed it on nerves – and Sunderland had played with none of the adventure that might have been anticipated from a side embroiled in a frantic, three-way battle to stay out of the Championship. They slipped into the bottom three because of Newcastle United’s 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace and although they have a game in hand on their north-east rivals, meaning that their fate is still in their own hands, it cannot be guaranteed that Sunderland possess the guile required to beat Chelsea, Everton and Watford in their final three games given that they have now drawn six of their past eight matches.\n\nThey knew that a victory would keep them in 17th place in the table, regardless of how Norwich City and Newcastle fared against Arsenal and Palace respectively, yet Sunderland were unambitious to a baffling extent against potentially fragile opponents in the first half and, until Geoff Cameron brought down Defoe in the 94th minute, were bereft of inspiration after falling behind to Marko Arnautovic’s opener for Stoke.\n\nSunderland’s lack of incision during the first half was summed up by Allardyce storming into his technical area to remonstrate with his left-back Patrick van Aanholt for shooting straight at Haugaard from 18 yards instead of playing in Wahbi Khazri. The visiting side were laboured and unimaginative in possession, guilty of dwelling on the ball in midfield, overhitting crosses and sending too many long passes towards Defoe.\n\nSunderland’s lone striker was dangerous on the fleeting occasions when he received the ball to feet. Defoe has scored 14 of their 40 Premier League goals, but Allardyce’s team did little to test Stoke, whose defence had been breached 12 times in their previous three matches.\n\nStoke were the more enterprising side for long spells, despite the sense that their season is drifting towards an unsatisfactory conclusion, and created the clearest opportunities in the first half. Peter Crouch went close with two headers and Arnautovic blazed over after fine work from Giannelli Imbula.\n\nAfter the break, Allardyce ditched his 4-1-4-1 system and moved Fabio Borini alongside Defoe, yet the change in formation failed to produce the breakthrough Sunderland so desperately craved. Instead their task became even harder when they fell behind after 50 minutes. Charlie Adam picked out Crouch with a high cross from the left and he beat Younès Kaboul and nodded the ball down for Arnautovic, who shook off Lamine Koné before driving a low volley under the Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone.\n\nAllardyce was furious, arguing that Crouch had pushed Kaboul in the back. “My problem was I think it [Defoe’s penalty] could have been the winner for us because I don’t think Stoke’s goal should have stood,” he said, before criticising the officials for failing to spot an earlier handball by Cameron in the Stoke area. “Defoe tells me he couldn’t believe the referee didn’t give it,” Allardyce added.\n\nCraig Pawson, the referee, disagreed on both counts and the bigger problem for Sunderland was that Newcastle were winning. Defoe aimed two shots too high from promising positions and Sunderland appeared to have run out of ideas long before the board went up to show four minutes of stoppage time. Stoke were pressing for a second and, as the minutes ticked away, Imbula raced through and shot wide.\n\nThat reprieve spurred on Sunderland and when Yann M’Vila found Defoe just inside the Stoke area, he was fouled by Cameron after a clever turn, allowing the striker to send Haugaard the wrong way from the spot.\n\nFor all Sunderland’s togetherness and defiance, however, there is going to have to be a vast improvement in their final three matches for them to stay up.\n\nNewcastle and Andros Townsend sink Crystal Palace to pressure rivals Read more"}, {"date": "30/04/2016", "arena":

towards repairing their relationship with the fans. Relegated Villa were once again mocked and jeered by the travelling supporters during the early stages here, but by the end they were applauded off the field despite letting a rare victory slip through their fingers thanks to two late Troy Deeney goals.\n\nBlack, the acting manager, said: “It’s a fantastic football club with fantastic supporters and maybe it’s just one little step towards getting the supporters back on side. The players have been criticised, and justifiably so, but not today. Ultimately, you need to win games but there was a lot to be encouraged by.”\n\nThe match initially settled into a miserably familiar routine for Villa, camped in their own half while being jeered by their own fans. The Watford striker Odion Ighalo, playing despite the death of his father last weekend, could have twice opened the scoring but for a block by Joleon Lescott and a sharp near-post save from Mark Bunn.\n\nBen Watson was then denied a goal-of-the-season contender when the Watford midfielder flicked the ball up some 30 yards out and launched a dipping volley that crashed against the crossbar.\n\nHowever, after 25 minutes Villa made it into the Watford half and even managed a shot at goal. Jordan Ayew’s effort was way off target – but the away fans launched into a mock celebration as if their side had scored. So imagine their surprise two minutes later when Ashley Westwood swung in a corner and Ciaran Clark nipped in ahead of Miguel Britos to power home a header.\n\nLeighton Baines finds right chemistry to fire Everton past Bournemouth Read more\n\nFor the first time since February Villa were leading a match and they almost doubled their advantage when Aly Cissokho’s cross was headed on to the foot of the post by Ayew.\n\nNormal service looked to be resuming when Almen Abdi curled in a superb free-kick to level on the stroke of half-time, but three minutes into the second half Villa scored again, Ayew exchanging passes with Rudy Gestede before drilling a low shot from the edge of the area past Heurelho Gomes. Moments later Gestede should have made it three when he was played in by Westwood but the big striker blazed his shot over from six yards out.\n\nWatford came close to equalising for a second time when Deeney headed goalwards from a corner, but Westwood was on hand to hack the ball off the line.\n\nVilla were reduced to 10 men when Cissokho saw red for tripping Ikechi Anya as he raced through on goal.\n\nBut they were not far from registering their second away win of the season until Deeney nodded in a Steven Berghuis cross.\n\nIn stoppage time Deeney lashed home a half-clearance from the edge of the area to leave Villa with an unwanted place in the history books.\n\nThe boyhood Birmingham fan loves scoring against Villa more than any other team and celebrated wildly after heading in the equaliser, then lashing in a stoppage-time winner.\n\nIt meant a club-record 11th straight defeat for Villa, but Black felt they deserved more. “It was harsh in some regards,” he said. “The effort of the players was outstanding, they showed desire and hunger, but the sending-off changed the whole context of the game. At 2-1 up we looked like the team who were going to score again. The key moment is the sending-off.”\n\nWatford’s Quique Sánchez Flores still faces an uncertain future with rumours that he will be replaced in the summer, and defeat to the bottom club would only have added fuel to the fire. He said: “It was important because now mathematically we are [safe] in the Premier League and for Watford that is amazing.\n\n“We deserved to win the match. We had control, but we conceded two silly goals and had to work pretty hard. We have to fight against these sort of teams.\n\n“The speculation is not good for the players. The players always want to focus on the main target and the main target is the match. Speculation is not important.

Noble’s toe-poke and a crashing volley from Andy Carroll’s cross means he has now scored four times in his last two matches, with the club he joined as a 13-year-old now odds on to at least secure a place in the Europa League for next season.\n\nLeighton Baines finds right chemistry to fire Everton past Bournemouth Read more\n\nNo wonder the visiting supporters sarcastically serenaded him with “Too good for England” at the final whistle.\n\nThe victory had been set in motion by Cheikhou Kouyaté’s header from a delightful Dimitri Payet cross after West Ham had ridden an early storm inspired by West Brom’s teenage winger Jonathan Leko.\n\nBut after watching his side take their chances, Bilic admitted he was delighted with the victory. “It was a great performance to come here and win,” he said. “They were better in the first 25 minutes – we were too sloppy and casual. But after that we started to play some good football. I’ve told him [Noble] so many times that his role is more a team player but today he was fantastic. It’s not just his goals today, he’s been exceptional for the whole season. When your holding midfielders score all your goals, you know you are playing great football.”\n\nLeko was handed his full debut by Tony Pulis. That made the newly turned 17-year-old the eighth graduate of West Brom’s academy to be selected in a matchday squad this season.\n\nIn contrast, Bilic’s only homegrown player in an unchanged starting lineup was Noble, although their bench did feature their own talented teenager, Reece Oxford, who has been linked with a move to Manchester City in the summer.\n\nA lack of depth in West Ham’s squad has undermined their push for a top four finish in recent weeks and last week’s victory over Watford was their first since the start of March. But even though there was still plenty to play for, initially it appeared that the hosts were more up for the fight. Within six minutes, Leko, who was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo but moved to England aged eight after his father was granted asylum, showed why he is so highly rated in these parts.\n\nEngland left-back hopeful Aaron Cresswell was dumped on his backside by a whirr of quick feet and Leko’s ball picked out Craig Gardner perfectly. Angelo Ogbonna cleared the first effort, before Adrián saved his follow up. Gardner was to spurn two further chances to put West Brom ahead before Kouyaté eventually opened the scoring.

But not yet it seems. In front of a grouchy but hardly volatile home crowd Arsenal completed a very Arsenal-ish April afternoon. An underwhelming 1-0 victory represents a significant step towards a place in the top four at the end of the season, this late-Arsène Wenger team sinking into that familiar low-pressure end-game like a comfortable old armchair.\n\nArsenal 1-0 Norwich City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nDanny Welbeck scored the only goal and was the home team’s most purposeful presence. Not that there was much competition, as Arsenal provided a reprise of that striking ability to look drained and heavy-legged even while, on the face of it, putting on another show of nimble, fluent-passing football.\n\nFor Norwich the future looks more bleak. They competed feistily here but defeat leaves them second bottom and needing to win at least one of their final two home fixtures, against Manchester United and Watford. Afterwards, Alex Neil, the Norwich manager, dwelt ruefully on pair of fine first-half saves from Petr Cech.\n\nBefore kick-off the atmosphere inside the Emirates was more a low-level anxiety than anything more bellicose. There was a loud cheer for the return to the bench of Santi Cazorla, a classy, waspish influence who has been badly missed since his injury against the same opponents in November. Otherwise Arsenal lined up in the usual 4-2-3-1, with Olivier Giroud given another chance to continue his haggard The Revenant-style quest for a first league goal since January.\n\nA point for Sunderland and three for Newcastle earlier in the day had increased the sense Norwich really did need to get something from this game. The hard-running Nathan Redmond came in on the right and had the game’s first chance on six minutes, taking Martin Olsson’s cross and shooting low, only for Cech to save well with his legs. Ivo Pinto was drafted in at right-back and it was down his flank that Arsenal’s first twitch of life came, Alex Iwobi shuttling through but shanking a left-footed shot wide.\n\nThe promise of protests had circled this game with various entities, including Red Action and the scary-sounding Black Scarf Movement, calling for a show of dissent. “Time For Change” is the mantra, the object of protest that sense of a luxury vessel simply drifting. Get rid of certain players; start getting to the last eight not the last 16 of the Champions League; stop being overly pleased about making a profit: as ultimatums go it’s a fairly slow-burn affair, and no doubt fans of Charlton, Aston Villa and Leeds will all come out in sympathy some day soon.\n\nNot that the discontent of the Reds and the Blacks should be undervalued. It is simply a novel kind of protest, a reflection perhaps of the wider weirdness of modern football, a broader alienation.\n\nThe demo duly came on 12 minutes, marking one for every year Arsenal have been deprived of the Premier League title. There were around 300 banners held, accompanied by a mix of booing, jeering and applause as Wenger stood in his rectangle pretending to watch the football, but looking a little sad and thin and brave. There were chants of “We love you Arsenal”, followed by “One Arsène Wenger”. It was a slightly meandering, slightly inconclusive Arsenal demonstration. Or in other words, an Arsenal demonstration.\n\nArsenal confirm two Sydney fixtures against A-League sides Read more\n\nAfter which nothing much continued to happen. Giroud had a shot blocked. Redmond had another good chance on the right, Cech again saving well. And overall Norwich looked slightly more threatening in a scoreless first half, with Jonny Howson beavering to good effect in central midfield.\n\nAs the second half kicked off, Arsenal looked in need of an injection of urgency, fear, desperation – anything really. Redmond again wandered unimpeded down the right and flashed a cross through the six-yard area. Per Mertesacker departed with what looked like a hamstring pull. Little was seen of Aaron Ramsey or Mesut Özil running beyond the last line of defence. Giroud looked horribly short on confidence.\n\nThere were huge cheers as Wenger made an early change for once. With 55 minutes gone Welbeck came on for Iwobi and changed the game almost immediately. He was assisted by Giroud, who produced a lovely cushioned header, under no pressure from Sébastien Bassong, giving Welbeck the time to pivot and smash the ball into the corner. It was Welbeck’s fifth goal since his return in February, and much-needed, not least taking the sting out of the second stage of the Wenger-not-quite-out protests.\n\nDieumerci Mbokani almost got on the end of another low Redmond cross, but was blocked by Gabriel Paulista. And Arsenal hung on a little at times as Norwich pressed energetically to the end.\n\nWenger was magnanimous enough about the protests, repeating his view that you can’t please all the people all the time. More significantly, perhaps, he was also open about his team’s inability to vary the pattern of attack. “We lost in the first game of the season against a team [West Ham] that sat very deep, didn’t come out and after that all the teams came here and sat very deep and we did not find a way to score the goals,” he said. “We have not solved that problem against teams who sit deep.” For all the protests, downloadable placards and diffuse dissatisfaction, it is this lack of drive – a dwindling away into a neat, lightweight, overfamiliar team – that is perhaps the wider story of Arsenal’s

damp silence. Tottenham Hotspur’s players knew in those moments they had almost certainly blown it. They had chosen a bad night to start unravelling and before the long, almost funereal walk back to the dressing room, they just stood around, hands on hips, taking it all in beneath the floodlights of a stadium that had wanted so much more.\n\nTottenham Hotspur-West Bromwich Albion: five talking points | David Hynter Read more\n\nAt this stage of the season Spurs knew their only realistic chance was to win all their remaining fixtures. Yet this was the first time we saw the inexperience of a team who are entirely new to this position. It was a ragged second half from Mauricio Pochettino’s side and the ramifications will be serious unless Leicester City, squatting defiantly at the top of the Premier League, suffer a late, almost inconceivable meltdown in their final three fixtures.\n\nThe problem for Spurs is that there has been absolutely nothing to suggest that might be likely – quite the opposite, in fact – and it was reflected in the body language of Mauricio Pochettino’s players at the end. They knew, in effect, it was over as soon as the referee, Mike Jones, brought the whistle to his lips for the final time. The gap to Leicester is seven points and the sums are now simple – it will all be over if Claudio Ranieri’s team beat Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.\n\nBy that stage Spurs might also be taking in a three-match ban for Dele Alli that would effectively end his season, having swung a punch into the midriff of Claudio Yacob out of the referee’s sight. As punches go, it was a short, low swing, rather than an old-fashioned haymaker, but the television cameras pick up everything these days and the likelihood is a Football Association charge of violent conduct.\n\nThe more grievous damage, however, came in the 73rd minute when Craig Dawson headed in the goal that broke the home team. Dawson’s own-goal had given Spurs the lead after 33 minutes and the first half was so one-sided one of the club’s former players, Micky Hazard, took a microphone at half-time and boldly proclaimed this could become “the best Spurs side in all our history”. Leicester, he predicted, would lose their last three matches, leaving the way clear for the Premier League trophy to be paraded at White Hart Lane. And the crowd roared its approval.\n\nInstead, it was Spurs who succumbed to the pressures. For the first time there were obvious signs of tension and, suddenly, this tough, obdurate West Bromwich side showed an attacking intent that simply had not been there earlier in the match. “Get into them,” Tony Pulis could be heard yelling on the touchline. And a team that began the night 14th in the table did exactly as he demanded. Salomón Rondón twice came close to scoring before Dawson did so from a corner that also resulted in Eric Dier being injured.\n\nSpurs still had 17 minutes of normal time, and another five of stoppages, to concoct a winner but their cohesion had gone. Passes were rushed, shots were wild and the onslaught that might have been expected never materialised. If anything, West Bromwich looked the more dangerous team in the closing stages. There is only one team, Aston Villa, who have managed fewer goals this season but, equally, Spurs ought to have known that a side managed by Pulis would never crumple as obligingly as Swansea City had done at Leicester.\n\nEarly on, that did not seem to bother the home side. They struck the woodwork twice in the opening 12 minutes and there were some lovely exchanges when Alli could be seen gliding away from opponents and, best of all, the brilliant piece of improvisational skill with which Mousa Dembélé eluded Darren Fletcher.\n\nLeicester City’s Jamie Vardy given extra game’s ban for improper conduct Read more\n\nThe early pressure failed to produce a breakthrough but Spurs kept advancing and nobody could possibly argue the opening goal was unwarranted even if there was a great deal of fortune attached to it. Christian Eriksen’s swinging free-kick was arched into the penalty area. Dawson was trying to prevent Jan Vertonghen applying a decisive touch and as the two players went sprawling, the ball landed beneath Albion’s right-back, squirting out past the goalkeeper Boaz Myhill.\n\nThe goal came at a good time for Spurs, interrupting their only lull of the first half, but the complexion of the match completely changed after the interval. Spurs will reflect on the moment, after 57 minutes, when Erik Lamela clipped a shot against a post and the earlier incidents when Myhill turned Harry Kane’s effort on to an upright and Eriksen’s free-kick skimmed the crossbar. Yet the home team lost their momentum in the second half and never really got it back.\n\nAlli’s season conceivably ended once Pochettino had substituted him. Kane was crowded out and the two full-backs, Danny Rose and Kyle Walker, stopped overlapping with the frequency of the first half. Spurs had moved the ball with speed and thought in that opening period but the deterioration was so stark it left the impression of a side that had hit the wall. They have put up a hell of a fight but, ultimately, nobody could have left this ground thinking it was anything but a fatal blow."}, {"date": "24/04/2016", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance":

The visiting manager will not have been amused by the Tunisia winger’s success in catching Aaron Ramsey day-dreaming, pouncing on a loose ball and unleashing a shot ultimately deflected for a corner. With a newly fit Jack Wilshere warming up on the touchline it did not seem the day for Ramsey to let his concentration wander.\n\nYet, if Arsenal were also mightily relieved to see a free-kick from the much- improved Patrick van Aanholt hit the woodwork after arcing over the wall and leaving Petr Cech wrong-footed, they too had their moments.\n\nUnfortunately for Wenger the vast majority of these attacking cameos featured half-chances, fashioned under intense pressure from not just Koné and Kaboul but the abrasive central midfield attentions of Lee Cattermole, Jan Kirchhoff and Yann M’Vila. That trio’s assiduous interceptions went a long way to explain why Arsenal’s crisp one-twos did not always quite come off and why their slick passing sequences were generally shorter than usual.\n\nEven so Vito Mannone, once one of Wenger’s goalkeepers, must have been delighted to see Alex Iwobi shoot wide when well placed and Olivier Giroud do likewise following his connection with Nacho Monreal’s cross.\n\nWith Giroud similarly off target after meeting a cute lob from the generally disappointing Alexis Sánchez, Sunderland found themselves reprieved by a combination of poor visiting final balls and the rewards of all that chasing and closing down on the part of Cattermole and company. Allardyce’s problem was that, despite Khazri’s best efforts,, Sunderland’s own passing was poor and their inability to retain possession restricted Jermain Defoe to tight rations.\n\nSignificantly, when Defoe did manage to unleash a shot it could have resulted in a penalty after hitting Per Mertesacker’s arm from point-blank range. It left Mike Dean with a big decision to make but, almost certainly correctly, the referee refused to buy Sunderland’s claims. Arsenal subsequently had a handball penalty appeal of their own rejected after Iwobi’s shot struck DeAndre Yedlin.\n\nSunderland v Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nConsidering Sunderland had re-emerged for the second half in newly ferocious mood, Cech needed to be at his best to parry Defoe’s shot in the wake of Kirchhoff’s stellar pass before saving M’Vila’s follow-up and later did well to repel Khazri’s low shot.\n\nAware that nothing was really coming off for Mesut Özil and friends, Sunderland advanced with growing conviction. Defoe’s audacious attempt to lob Cech failed to come off – but only just – while the former England striker shot fractionally wide after meeting an unusually high-calibre Cattermole pass.\n\nHeeding the warning signs, Wenger attempted to reassert his side’s authority by introducing Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck in place of Iwobi and the under-achieving Giroud and looked set to celebrate when the otherwise commanding Mannone unwisely dashed out of his area and watched in horror as the ball bounced over his head. For a split second Sánchez looked odds-on to score but then Kaboul galloped in to make a last-ditch clearance.\n\nThe time had come for Wenger to withdraw Özil and send Wilshere on for his first appearance in 11 months but, welcome as the England midfielder’s return from a broken leg was, he proved powerless to influence a game by then heading inexorably for a draw.\n\nMan of the match Petr

"report": "Perhaps the most impressive part is the way Leicester City, closing in on an almost unimaginable piece of football history, made the latest stage of what increasingly resembles a victory procession such a stress-free occasion. This was their biggest win of the season, just when the heat of the pressure was supposed to be rising dangerously close to intolerable. The goals flew in, the crowd sang “Barcelona, we’re coming for you” and the place has never felt happier.\n\nClaudio Ranieri and Leicester ramp up electricity with finish line close Read more\n\nClaudio Ranieri’s team played as though immune to nerves, apart from a few minutes at the start before they realised that Swansea City, with their accident-prone defence and end-of-season drift, would be obliging opponents. After that, it was a stroll that suggested Leicester are thriving, rather than wilting, on the weight of expectation. “Four-nil to the one-man team” was another chant, as the evidence was supplied about how daft it was to suspect Leicester without Jamie Vardy would take on the form of a flower without water.\n\nThere will certainly be more difficult assignments in the coming weeks as Leicester finish the season against Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea and at this stage, with an eight-point lead, it would be harrowing for them, to say the least, if this previously unremarkable club cannot end the most eccentric year of their lives in possession of the Premier League trophy.\n\nThey need five points from their remaining fixtures to be certain but that assumes Tottenham Hotspur, in second position, win their final four games, and there was absolutely nothing in this performance to suggest a late meltdown from a team whose durability and mental fortitude had been questioned – unfairly, by some degree – on the back of the wild 2-2 draw against West Ham last weekend.\n\nAs it turned out Vardy’s replacement, Leonardo Ulloa, scored two of the goals while Ranieri’s decision to bring in Jeffrey Schlupp on the left was vindicated with an outstanding performance. Schlupp gave Leicester the pace and directness that they might have been missing in Vardy’s absence and as an insight into the togetherness of this team, there was a lovely exchange when he was taken off late on and Marc Albrighton took over. Albrighton had lost his place in the starting line-up but the two players still shared a joke and a warm embrace and within a couple of minutes, the substitute had added the fourth goal.\n\nClaudio Ranieri hails his team’s ‘fantastic answer’ to Jamie Vardy absence Read more\n\nLeicester had played with the belief, structure and enthusiasm that, by now, we are all acquainted with. Danny Drinkwater and N’Golo Kanté were indefatigable in midfield. Riyad Mahrez, scorer of the opening goal, showed his refinement in attack and, defensively, there were only sporadic occasions when Kasper Schmeichel’s goal was seriously threatened. Leicester have now kept seven clean sheets in their final nine fixtures and look, in short, like champions-in-waiting.\n\nSwansea, in stark contrast, look like a side that may need to reinvent themselves next season. When Ulloa headed in Drinkwater’s free-kick to make it 2-0 after half an hour it was the 20th time this season that Swansea have been caught out at a set-piece, accounting for almost half their goals-against column. Their manager, Francesco Guidolin, abandoned his striker-less formation at half-time and the game was a personal ordeal for Ashley Williams given his level of culpability in the first goal, presenting Mahrez with the ball from a lazy pass out of his own penalty area.\n\nMahrez accepted the gift in a typically unhurried fashion, taking his time, steadying himself and aiming a precise shot inside the near corner of Lukasz Fabianski’s goal. From that point onwards there was a huge imbalance between the sides.\n\nUlloa eluded Williams to score the second from a twisting header and it probably summed up this Leicester team that the free-kick for that goal came from Wes Morgan, of all people, on the left wing, dispossessing Wayne Routledge and winning a foul in the process.\n\nAfter that, the game was so one-sided it seemed perplexing that Guidolin talked about being impressed with his team’s work ethic. Swansea’s manager also repeatedly mentioned the way his players had passed the ball in the opening six minutes. Their problem, unfortunately, came in the other 84, especially when Schlupp was running at them or Mahrez had it on the other side.\n\nLeicester City understudies shine to make light of Jamie Vardy’s absence Read more\n\nLeicester’s third goal started from their own penalty area, a quick ball out from Schmeichel and Schlupp getting away from Ángel Rangel and Federico Fernández to burst clear on the left. Williams blocked the first attempt to play in Ulloa, running in from the right, but Schlupp picked out his team-mate the second time and it just needed a touch at the far post.\n\nThe home team were rampant by the time Albrighton turned in the fourth goal, firing high into the net after some fine work from another of the substitutes, Demarai Gray, and the noise at the end was as loud as at any other time this season. The only flicker of apprehension came when Ranieri was asked afterwards about the Barcelona chants. “God, not Barcelona,” he said. “It would be a fantastic experience, but come on, man.” Yet Leicester, one imagines, would give it a go.\n\nMan of the match Jeffrey Schlupp (Leicester City)"}, {"date": "23/04/2016", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53974, "home_team": {"name":

Yet the way he zoomed along the right then selflessly created the third goal for Kelechi Iheanacho was a moment worthy of marking his 300th appearance for the club.\n\nThe Nigerian’s 10th of a breakthrough campaign allowed his team to cruise home, and Iheanacho scored a second towards the end after the substitute Wilfried Bony played him in.\n\nOn Tuesday Real Madrid are at this stadium for the Champions League semi-final first leg and this was ideal preparation. The win lifted Manuel Pellegrini’s men up to third place on 64 points with three matches remaining, though Arsenal can leapfrog them if they win at Sunderland on Sunday.\n\nPellegrini said: “It was very important to have our mind focused on this game and not on Tuesday. I always say a big team must be able to have their minds in both competitions.”\n\nIn the buildup Pellegrini said Vincent Kompany had suffered no reaction following Tuesday night’s 1-1 draw at Newcastle. That game was a first start following a knee injury yet when the match-day squad was announced the captain was not in the 18. In explanation, the manager said: “For Vincent it was a risk to play two games in 72 hours. He is OK, he worked this morning.”\n\nKevin De Bruyne was stood down to the bench to protect him as Iheanacho was given a first league start since a 1-0 win at Sunderland on 2 February.\n\nManchester City 4-0 Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIn the reverse fixture in early December Pellegrini’s side were taught a lesson, Stoke beating them 2-0. The start on Saturday suggested a different story. There were chances for each team but none of the slick passing and domination Mark Hughes’s side enjoyed at the Britannia Stadium.\n\nJesús Navas was the key man in the opener. The Spaniard had already danced inside towards traffic when possession returned to him. Now, he raced to the byline and hit a low cross which was turned away for a corner. Navas pinged over a ball that found Fernando and his glancing header beat Shay Given at the far post.\n\nThis was 35 minutes in and just reward for City. They had a second as the interval neared. What can be missed in Sergio Agüero’s act as a supreme goalscorer is how sweet a footballer he is. So it was that the 27-year-old played a killer pass along the right touchline that would lead to the penalty he converted for a 23rd Premier League strike of another standout campaign.\n\nWhen the play eventually reached Stoke’s area, Iheanacho was pulled down by Ryan Shawcross and the referee, Robert Madley, pointed to the spot. Up stepped Agüero to give Given no chance to his right.\n\nFA Youth Cup final first leg: Manchester City peg back Chelsea Read more\n\nAt the break Hughes might have reminded his players of the maxim about taking chances with particular reference to Shawcross. During the first half the captain was handed a free volley from a corner, but missed to Joe Hart’s right.\n\nGiven’s inclusion at 40 made him the first in Stoke colours to feature in the league in his fifth decade since Sir Stanley Matthews. But the goalkeeper was withdrawn at half-time because of a groin injury and Jakob Haugaard took his place. The Dane was in action immediately, tipping away Iheanacho’s long-range attempt.\n\nAfter David Silva was withdrawn three minutes before the hour – Fabian Delph coming on – Stoke brightened briefly. Marko Arnautovic cut inside from the left and hammered a shot at Hart that the goalkeeper beat out.\n\nNow, though, came the Iheanacho show, with fine support from Zabaleta and Bony. There was a scare near the end as Yaya Touré went down injured and he might have come off. Pellegrini hopes the Ivorian will be fine. “Yaya, maybe the doctor will see him tomorrow, he finished with a muscle injury, we’ll see,” said the Chilean.\n\nFor Stoke, it was a second 4-0 defeat in six days, after Monday’s home thumping by Tottenham Hotspur, and a third game in a row in which they have conceded four.\n\nThere was further bad news as Hughes said midfielder Ibrahim Afellay suffered a serious injury in training on Friday. “Unfortunately, one moment, he just brought down a ball from a high position, landed on his knee, twisted it and looks he has had a snapped a cruciate.

We are winning again and putting the pressure on them. That’s what we like to do and we have to do it next week.\n\n“Liverpool have a tough schedule with the Europa League and that’s always difficult to keep the momentum in the Premier League.

It’s a good mentality because he had some good possibilities to score. He knows himself he had more opportunities to score and I like it.

In December Eddie Howe’s side produced one of the results of the season at Stamford Bridge during the last days of José Mourinho’s reign but this was a performance more like the champions of old, led by Cesc Fábregas and Eden Hazard.\n\nFábregas was superb, elaborate flicks combined with clinical passing to cut Bournemouth open time and again. Howe’s men showed attacking intent themselves but, in doing so, ceded space in their own half, which Chelsea exploited. Pedro opened the scoring before Hazard and Willian also capitalised on Fábregas assists, rendering Tommy Elphick’s header immaterial.\n\nHazard added another late on and these were his first Premier League goals since May 2015. Some drought for last season’s PFA Player of the Year but, though there were still signs of rust after five games out, this was a vastly improved display compared to some this season.\n\nYet it was Fábregas who ran the show. Guus Hiddink, the interim Chelsea coach, said of the Spaniard: “He was enjoying it very much, he’s one of the few players who has this vision. He knows when he’s on the ball that he can execute what he is thinking and creating, we know when he’s on the ball that we need players running.\n\n“There were some decent games but this one was one of his best. I like it when they get the camera and attention but these players can play like that when there is good balance around him. We made some little positional changes at half-time and from there on I think we controlled and were very dominant. It was good to see the players enjoying playing and looking for the attack.”\n\nChelsea play Tottenham next and the away fans voiced their desire to end Spurs’ tilt at the league title. Mikel John Obi started in central defence here alongside Branislav Ivanovic, with Hazard making his first appearance since the Champions League defeat at home to Paris Saint-Germain. The Belgian was welcomed into the game early on by a thudding challenge from Lewis Grabban but after wincing and clutching his leg, Hazard picked himself off the turf and went on to have a decisive impact.\n\nFirst, though, Pedro did. Bournemouth had made an energetic start to the match and the left-back Charlie Daniels was advancing high. However, after Daniels’ low cross into the opposition penalty area was cleared, he was caught out. Chelsea swiftly broke and, following a precise ball from Fábregas, Pedro found space cutting inside from the right and demonstrated a fine touch and finish.\n\nBournemouth have conceded many early goals this season and tried to respond immediately. Josh King shot over the crossbar from Daniels’ corner before Steve Cook squandered an excellent chance. Asmir Begovic – deputising for the suspended Thibaut Courtois – could only palm a corner tamely into Cook’s path, but the defender made a hash of his effort and sliced over.\n\nSoon, Chelsea had two. Hazard, who has endured a largely torrid, injury-beset campaign, ran inside and was laid off following a deft flick from Fábregas. Space opened up and he fired through the legs of Elphick and in from 25 yards.\n\nAt that stage it seemed Bournemouth were in for a torturous afternoon, yet they clawed their way back into the game moments later. A corner was taken short to Francis and his cross found the head of Elphick, who made just enough contact to guide the ball past Begovic.\n\nUnfortunately for Bournemouth, that was as good as it got. With the exception of a Junior Stanislas shot that fizzed wide in the 66th minute, they could not create the same attacking verve they had previously shown.\n\nAnd so Chelsea ensured victory with 20 minutes remaining, Willian found by Fábregas once more and finishing coolly past Artur Boruc, before Hazard scored his second in injury time. Nemanja Matic played a one-two with Fábregas and pulled the ball back for Hazard to finish with ease.\n\nHowe said: “A number of their players played at a high level today, Fabregas, Hazard, Willian, Costa. You have to admire their quality. We’re learning all the time and that’s key for us. We’re still finding our feet at this level and learning some harsh lessons.”\n\nJack Colback seals stirring comeback as Benítez’s Newcastle hold Liverpool Read more"}, {"date": "23/04/2016", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 43837, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Randall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Stewart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [53], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [30], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [2], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oluwaseyi Ojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chancel Mbemba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheick Tiote", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Freddie Woodman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mbabu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A day to forget for Jürgen Klopp could ultimately prove one to savour for Rafael Benítez. Liverpool began the day under a cloud courtesy of Mamadou Sakho’s failed drugs test and Newcastle United’s stirring recovery from two goals down ensured they stayed there. Belief, character and a touch of fortune, all the ingredients required in a relegation contest, were evident as the visitors collected their first point on the road since 13 December.\n\nRafael Benítez: Newcastle showed the character needed for great escape Read more\n\nBenítez had asked his former club for a favour in his quest to preserve Newcastle’s Premier League status and the ex-Sunderland goalkeeper Simon Mignolet obliged. Liverpool were coasting at the interval to a fifth straight win in all competitions but Mignolet’s mistake allowed Papiss Cissé to reduce the arrears and, from nowhere, Newcastle had a fighting chance. They capitalised to close the gap on fourth-from-bottom Norwich City to one point and maintain the momentum that is building under their belatedly-appointed coach.\n\n“Maybe before the game Newcastle thought they could win at Anfield,” said Klopp. “But now I would say they are happy with a point. Two shots on target, two goals. It is not too good to be honest but we have to accept it.” The Liverpool manager may also have to accept whatever sanction is heading Sakho’s way for failing a Uefa drugs test after the Europa League tie at Old Trafford on 17 March. In purely football terms, and Klopp could not say much about Sakho given the defender has until Tuesday to respond, Liverpool’s resilience in his absence was not encouraging.\n\nSakho sat in an executive box with his family as his team-mates eased into a two-goal lead in the first half. Any hopes Newcastle harboured of two encouraging displays at St James’ Park translating into improvement on the road were put on hold after 58 seconds. That was all the time it took for Daniel Sturridge to reassure Anfield in the absence of the injured Divock Origi and score his seventh goal in his last seven starts against Newcastle.\n\nBenítez was warmly serenaded by the Kop on his return to Anfield – it was not so easy last time he was in the opposition dugout as Chelsea’s interim manager – and he had just reciprocated with a wave when Liverpool were awarded a free-kick on the halfway line. Klopp’s team had gone long and early with two balls into the Newcastle area from the kick-off and the reason why was underlined from Alberto Moreno’s set piece. Sturridge had two defenders on his shoulders as Moreno’s ball dropped on the edge of the penalty area yet he was given space to control neatly, turn sharply and stroke a clinical left-foot finish into Karl Darlow’s bottom left-hand corner.\n\nThe visitors’ gameplan to contain Liverpool with a 4-1-4-1 formation was damaged before it had been executed. Newcastle lacked the aggression or the confidence to react positively in the first half, their performance was far removed from Tuesday’s committed show at home to Manchester City, and Liverpool inflicted further punishment on their passive opponent with another fine goal on the half-hour.\n\nDejan Lovren found Roberto Firmino in space and the stylish Brazilian released Moreno down the left. Liverpool’s full-back produced his second assist by picking out the unmarked Adam Lallana in the centre. From 20 yards, the midfielder swept a stunning finish into the top corner and three more points beckoned.\n\nMamadou Sakho sidelined by Liverpool after failed drugs test Read more\n\nLiverpool’s latest commanding display was not the only reason to suspect the contest was over. Their only concerns of the first half were slight knocks to Moreno and Lovren, neither serious, and referee Andre Marriner’s refusal to award a penalty for handball. Marriner was a late replacement for Martin Atkinson who reportedly suffered an injury on a Uefa fitness course. Newcastle had offered nothing, which made their second-half fightback all the more surprising and, for Klopp, galling.\n\nBenítez’s side were gifted a lifeline shortly after the restart when Vurnon Anita broke down the right and crossed deep into the Liverpool six-yard box. Mignolet rushed from his line but his fists made no contact with the ball, only with the unfortunate Lovren, and Cissé headed into the unguarded goal.\n\nCissé should have levelled and left Anfield enraged when Sturridge was denied a penalty having been clipped inside the area. Marriner waved play on, Newcastle broke through Moussa Sissoko and the captain put the Senegal international clear on goal. The striker wanted too long on the ball, however, and could only pass back to Andros Townsend who blazed high into the Kop.\n\nFirmino tapped in from close range after Darlow saved from Joe Allen’s header but an offside flag came to Newcastle’s rescue.

He often does so with an apologetic sort of demeanour and it was more pronounced than usual here. The number read 59,568. So was the Emirates Stadium actually full?\n\nThe figure is based on tickets sold, remember, rather than the number of fans who pass through the turnstiles. The reality was that there were at least five or six thousand no-shows – maybe nearer to 10,000 – as Arsenal’s season petered out towards its likely third- or fourth-placed finish, which will bring with it Champions League qualification but not true satisfaction.\n\nAlexis Sánchez does enough to keep the weary Arsenal fans awake | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nArsenal moved up to third with this Alexis Sánchez-inspired win and it was a strange kind of non-event, given Arsenal’s superiority from the outset and West Bromwich Albion’s lack of body-on-the-line endeavour. This was not really a Tony Pulis performance but, then again, his club’s season is set on an even more certain course. Their Premier League safety has felt guaranteed for some time.\n\nSánchez has found form, albeit a little late in the day, after the hamstring injury that derailed him at the end of November and held him back for longer than expected. He scored his 15th and 16th goals of the club season, five of them coming in the last four games, and Arsenal could enjoy only a fifth league win in 14 matches.\n\nThe attendance was one sub-plot and there were degrees of apathy on show. Some regulars had decided that they would not turn up and proactively put their seats on a ticket exchange for fellow members. Others could not be bothered to do that, and they simply did not show.\n\n“My message to our fans is to come and support your team,” Arsène Wenger, the Arsenal manager, said. “If you love football, you go out there. I think you see quality football. It’s what we try to give to our people.”\n\nAnother line was the return to the middle of the referee, Jon Moss, after his controversial performance in last Sunday’s 2-2 draw between Leicester City and West Ham United, when he sent off the Leicester striker, Jamie Vardy, for diving and awarded two debatable penalties.\n\nThere were flashpoints in the second-half when Alex Iwobi and Mohamed Elneny went down inside the area, the latter a little theatrically, but Moss gave neither penalties nor yellow cards – which would have been noted by Vardy. Moss also pressed on with his campaign against grappling, whether inside or outside of the box. He booked Gareth McAuley for a tussle with Olivier Giroud close to halfway.\n\nSánchez was in the mood at the outset and the breakthrough was marked by his sharpness of mind and body. Sandro was badly caught out. In the time that it took Sánchez to collect Aaron Ramsey’s pass, spin 180 degrees and tee up a right-footed shot from the edge of the area, Sandro was barely able to complete his own half turn. Sánchez’s effort flashed low into the bottom corner.\n\nArsenal called the tune, with Iwobi also to the fore, but West Brom did go close to an equaliser when McAuley rose unmarked to thump Darren Fletcher’s 29th minute corner against the crossbar, while there had been a curious moment just beforehand. Sánchez miscontrolled a high ball inside the area and he sent it into his hand, which was raised. Moss, correctly, ruled that it was accidental and there was no penalty. After Saido Berahino’s two misses from the spot in the home loss against Watford on Saturday, perhaps it was just as well.\n\nSánchez’s second came after Claudio Yacob tripped Ramsey on the edge of the area and West Brom’s defensive wall failed to do its job. Per Mertesacker and Giroud stood on the end of it and, when they parted ways, Sánchez blasted through the gap. Ben Foster was rooted.\n\nPulis brought on the striker Salomón Rondón at half-time and asked Berahino to play off him, but his team was off the pace. The West Brom manager said it was the first time he had managed in England on a Thursday night and he suggested that the unusual scheduling, which had been dictated by broadcasters, had scrambled his preparations.\n\nMesut Özil had a fistful of chances but it was not his night. He saw one in the 34th minute squirm through Foster’s legs only to be hacked off the line by Craig Dawson while his best opportunity on 68 minutes, which was laid on by Sánchez, led to a smart block from the goalkeeper. Joel Campbell, the Arsenal substitute, and Giroud went close before the end. It was not a game that will lodge in the memory.\n\n“You look at the table and you know that every point is important for us at the moment,” Wenger said. “We are under permanent pressure for everything again so it was important to have an early lead and focus on the way we wanted to play football.”"}, {"date": "20/04/2016", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34857, "home_team": {"name":

Read more\n\nThe striker scored his sixth goal in five Premier League appearances and, backed up by Dimitri Payet and Diafra Sakho, was at his troublesome best against this makeshift Watford side who rested players in preparation for their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace on Sunday. The opposition may not have been the strongest, but on this evidence Carroll is a man in as good nick as he has ever been.\n\nPayet was also excellent and Mark Noble accomplished in midfield. It was the West Ham captain who scored twice from the penalty spot before Sebastian Prödl pulled one back for Watford with a fine finish, Troy Deeney missed a late penalty and Nordin Amrabat was sent off.\n\nYet despite their penalty miss, Watford were never in this game and their manager, Quique Sánchez Flores, insisted afterwards that he was not concerned about reports that his position is under threat even though he has steered the club to safety in their first season back in the top flight.\n\nFor Slaven Bilic, there was satisfaction. A first win since early March and, following the recent Cup defeat against Manchester United and late draw at Leicester, a smile. “We said before that every game is important at this stage of the season but this was a decisive game that will determine if we look up, or if we don’t win look down,” he said. “Of course Liverpool are in good form but it’s nice to have five-point cushion [over Southampton in eighth].”\n\nAsked if the pressure was on the teams above West Ham, who will attempt to make a late push for a top-four finish, Bilic said: “The pressure is on us as well, it’s great pressure and positive pressure. It’s not like the pressure that Sunderland, Newcastle and Norwich have. It’s the pressure you are grateful for, worship for, go to church and pray it’s going to be the same for the next six years.”\n\nIt did not take long for West Ham to exert control here. Watford made seven changes following the weekend victory against West Bromwich Albion – a first Premier League win in seven attempts – ahead of their FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace at Wembley on Sunday.\n\nHowever, they were undone within 11 minutes. Payet, who has been in sublime form all season following his move from Marseille last summer, cut inside and lifted a precise ball over the defence for Carroll, who prodded home with his left foot past Heurelho Gomes.\n\nWest Ham’s second came controversially as José Holebas grappled with Cheikhou Kouyaté and the referee, Mike Dean, awarded a penalty. Noble sent Gomes the wrong way from the spot.\n\nRamiro Funes Mori sees red as Liverpool coast past 10-man Everton Read more\n\nBilic’s men did not have to wait long for another, following a few minutes to forget for Almen Abdi. Watford should have pulled one back through their Swiss midfielder and moments later he gave away a blatant penalty after lunging at the West Ham right-back Michail Antonio, who had made a bustling run forward. Again Noble stepped up and again he scored, down the middle.\n\nWatford’s fans had something to cheer. in the 64th minute when the centre-half Prödl timed his run well from Steven Berghuis’s free-kick and finished sweetly with a left-footed half-volley. It was a dramatic last few minutes as Deeney, brought on at the death, had a penalty saved by Adrián after Prödl was adjudged to have been fouled by Angelo Ogbonna, before Amrabat was sent off following a second yellow card.\n\nAsked about his job security, Flores said: “I am happy. I feel good. I think it is an amazing time we have now, four matches to finish and we have 41 points, it’s amazing. We are in a position that is very comfortable. We are in the semi-final of the FA Cup, but my future does not depend on one thing.

Part one of a defining week for the Everton manager was “disastrous” and “a feeling of embarrassment” – his words. Liverpool accepted the invitation to inflict a humiliation.\n\nEverton’s Roberto Martínez admits to ‘embarrassment’ after Anfield disaster Read more\n\nJust when Martínez needed a show of character, purpose or resistance – preferably a combination of all three – his team imploded. Jon Woods, the deputy vice-chairman and most senior Everton director present in the absence of the chairman, Bill Kenwright, and majority shareholder, Farhad Moshiri, had seen enough of the shambles by the 60th minute and left his seat. The self-inflicted nature of a defeat that amounted to a duck-shoot for Liverpool ensured sympathy for Martínez was non-existent from both sets of supporters.\n\nThe in-form Divock Origi opened the scoring with his 10th goal of the season but was forced off on a stretcher as a consequence of a dreadful challenge by Ramiro Funes Mori. Mercifully Liverpool confirmed there was no break to the ankle but the Everton defender was rightly dismissed and misses the semi-final against Manchester United through suspension.\n\nIllness prompted the departure of John Stones moments after he gifted Liverpool their third goal and, with Martínez inexplicably starting the derby without a defender on the bench, the 10 men played the final 37 minutes with the midfielders James McCarthy and Muhamed Besic in central defence. They may have to start there at Wembley unless Phil Jagielka recovers from a hamstring injury.\n\nMamadou Sakho, capitalising on yet more woeful defending, Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho added further punishment to the dishevelled Everton back-line. Origi’s injury was the only stain on Jürgen Klopp’s first taste of the Merseyside derby. The Liverpool manager spent most of the second half in fits of laughter and his admission that the second half lacked enjoyment because “there was no real fight any more” was as damning a verdict on Everton’s night as it gets.\n\nIt was difficult to recall by the final whistle, but Everton had actually started brightly. Then, with two crosses from the left foot of James Milner in the space of three minutes before the interval it was all over. Everton’s attempts to deal with both were shambolic. Unfortunately for Martínez and seasoned observers of his team, it was no surprise and they were powerless to quell Liverpool’s gathering momentum.\n\nJames Milner rises to big occasion with a cool head for Liverpool | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nGareth Barry was handed the captain’s armband on the night he equalled David James’ record of 571 Premier League starts and the 35-year-old was at the heart of the visitors’ determined opening. It counted for little, however, as Ross Barkley failed to provide sufficient support for Romelu Lukaku, several promising counter-attacks did not trouble Simon Mignolet and Bryan Oviedo endured a woeful night as an emergency right-back. Barry also joined the injury list at the interval with a groin problem.\n\nLiverpool’s opener was a replica of Origi’s recent goal against Stoke City. Milner swept a delightful cross to the back post where the striker rose above Stones to head home. The challenge from the central defender was non-existent and worse followed for the visitors with the final act of the half. Again, Everton cleared a set-piece only for the ball to return to the taker, Milner. He exchanged passes with Adam Lallana and broke to the by-line, crossing from the left for the unmarked Sakho to head into the roof of Joel Robles’ goal.\n\nUltimately, being two goals down in the derby at half-time proved the least of Martínez’s concerns. Within five minutes of the restart Everton were down to 10 men as a result of a disgraceful challenge by Funes Mori. There was no threat to the visiting goal as Origi collected Alberto Moreno’s pass out near the right touchline but the Argentina defender came over the top, studs first, straight into the striker’s ankle. The referee, Robert Madley, had no hesitation in showing a straight red card yet Funes Mori had the temerity to protest before walking off while pulling at his Everton crest in a misguided show of pride. An immediate three-match suspension will follow.\n\nLudicrously, despite his injury problems in defence and Callum Connolly’s impressive debut against Southampton last Saturday, Martínez had no defenders on the bench. His last fit and available centre-half, Stones, went off with stomach cramps moments after playing a careless pass out of defence straight to Lucas Leiva.\n\nLiverpool v Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nLucas accepted the invitation to return the ball through a gaping hole in the Everton rearguard for Origi’s replacement, Sturridge, to slot his 50th goal for the club into the bottom corner. That was the cue for Woods to leave.\n\nLiverpool’s fourth arrived after a flowing move involving Nathaniel Clyne and Joe Allen ended with Coutinho firing a trademark finish into the far corner. The only surprise was the home side’s failure to inflict further humiliation on Everton from 37 attempts on goal. Klopp’s team coast on.

Arsenal and Manchester City in the hunt for a Champions League place.\n\nDo Manchester United fans want fourth if it means Louis van Gaal stays? | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nOn Wednesday night the manager was given both as his team cruised past a soporific Crystal Palace, who judging by this effort are fifth-bottom for good reason. The victory takes United to 59 points, one behind Arsenal and two behind City, though the Gunners have a game in hand, hosting West Bromwich Albion on Thursday.\n\nAsked if this display was perfect before Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Everton Van Gaal stuck to his script. “I want three points. That is the most important thing,” he said. “We needed three points and that is what I said to my players. We have to win and we must win and now is another game. First you can enjoy but you must recover also because within two days you have to play again.”\n\nYet given the high stakes of this contest it was played out in a strangely muted atmosphere before an Old Trafford that was hardly packed. This reflects the apathetic feeling towards Van Gaal’s tenure and will surely trouble the executive should more numbers stay away in the final two home matches. Asked about this Van Gaal said: “I didn’t see quite a lot of empty seats but you have seen it because you want to see it. Then you have to write it tomorrow in your paper.”\n\nAfter City dropped two points at Newcastle the task for United was to take advantage and keep up their challenge for a top-four finish. Before this the first question concerned how Van Gaal’s men would line up. An XI that showed only Morgan Schneiderlin as a bona fide central midfielder meant the manager was shifting shape from his usual 4-2-3-1 to a loose 4-1-4-1, in which the middle quartet formed a diamond with Wayne Rooney at its tip behind Marcus Rashford.\n\nIf this was designed to wrongfoot the visitors, it worked inside five minutes. Old Trafford was still settling when Matteo Darmian, United’s left-back, moved along his flank and pinged over a cross. It appeared innocuous but not to poor Damien Delaney. He stabbed at the ball, then watched in dismay as it beat Julián Speroni to the visiting goalkeeper’s right.\n\nVan Gaal has drilled his players incessantly in the art of keeping the ball and smothering opponents and for the next 10 minutes or so United pinned Alan Pardew’s team in their own half.\n\nWhen Palace finally made it into United territory the foray was over in a flash and United again threatened along the right, via Jesse Lingard.\n\nThe closest Palace had thus far managed was a move engineered by Wilfried Zaha. The winger hit a ball in from the right, Lee Chung-yong headed back across goal, and Emmanuel Adebayor shinned his shot wide of David de Gea’s goal.\n\nAs the contest meandered and the stadium went close to quiet there was a jocular moment when Pardew hopped in irritation at a United challenge and the manager dropped his ever-present notebook on the pitch.\n\nAt the interval it remained 1-0 so United needed to convert their chances to kill Palace off or they would be vulnerable to a sucker punch that Pardew’s side had delivered at Arsenal on Sunday.\n\nAndy Carroll and Mark Noble fire West Ham to victory against Watford Read more\n\nPerhaps this was the message Van Gaal gave his team because as soon as the action recommenced Rooney came close to doubling the lead. A shot with his left foot was goalbound but at the last moment out came Papa Souaré’s leg and the ball was cleared.\n\nThe next time United threatened they did have a second. This came after Adrian Mariappa dispossessed Rashford in the area, the ball rolled to Juan Mata and his shot won a corner. When this came over from the left the ball broke to Darmian and the Italian finished with a sweet 20-yard effort that pinballed in off Speroni’s right post for the Italian’s first goal for the club.\n\nThis was a goal to go with his earlier assist though this did not come as a shock to Van Gaal. “Darmian was surprising me on Monday in the training session,” he said. “We did a sort of finishing session and he was the top scorer in that time and we tried to exercise with his left and right foot and he did it also with his left foot like he did tonight.”\n\nFrom here it was a keep-ball exercise for United. They now travel to Wembley to meet Everton with morale high, especially given their opponents’ trouncing by Liverpool. Palace also have a semi-final, on Sunday against Watford. Pardew said: “The FA Cup for United is a big event. For us it is a huge event. I could see a bit of blurred focus from our players. I can understand that.”"}, {"date": "19/04/2016", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 46424, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [],

"With Cheik Tioté and Moussa Sissoko back to their best Newcastle United not only hinted at what might have been had Rafael Benítez’s appointment come a little sooner but also highlighted Manchester City’s slapdash tendencies.\n\nAt the final whistle it felt like two points lost for a Newcastle team who at least confirmed that if they are to be relegated they will go down with all guns blazing but, significantly, Benítez’s players are in touching distance of Sunderland and Norwich, one and two points behind respectively.\n\nIf that pair have reason to be nervous Real Madrid – City’s Champions League semi-final opponents next week – should be quietly confident. As exceptional as Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Agüero are, Manchester United, too, have cause for cautious optimism that Manuel Pellegrini’s sublime yet at times sloppy side may yet be leapfrogged in the quest for a Champions League place.\n\nRafael Benítez finds Newcastle’s heart to give Gallowgate renewed belief Read more\n\nIt might have been worse for City had Georgino Wijnaldum, newly off the home bench, polished off a late chance to win a thoroughly compelling game that Benítez’s side had seemed likely to lose once Agüero’s 100th Premier League goal put them behind.\n\nWith Sissoko, Tioté and Andros Townsend to the fore, Newcastle battled as a, for once, truly united team, Vurnon Anita scored an unlikely equaliser, and Benítez’s team selection was again vindicated.\n\nThe Spaniard has always liked to rotate and sure enough, he was at it again here. Refreshingly, Steve McClaren’s successor had no compunction about leaving the best part of £45m on his bench either in the shape of Wijnaldum, Jonjo Shelvey, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Henri Saivet.\n\nThat quartet watched their side very nearly enjoy an ideal start when Townsend advanced down the right and deceived Aleksandar Kolarov with a lovely slice of skill before crossing invitingly for the on-rushing Papiss Cissé. The striker made a decent connection but his header skimmed the bar, landing on the roof of the net.\n\nYet for all their encouraging commitment, Newcastle were initially up against it, looking vulnerable every time the excellent De Bruyne took possession. City’s then seemingly inevitable breakthrough came from a free-kick awarded for Townsend’s foul on Kolarov. The otherwise disappointing left-back delivered an incisive dead ball and Newcastle offered Agüero a free header. Barely believing his luck the striker – a good yard offside – registered his 22nd goal of the league season.\n\nIt should never have stood but it was still incredible to think only City have spent more on players than Newcastle this season. The St James’ investment has been bereft of balance, however, with Benítez having inherited such a mixed bag he was forced to field Anita, a midfielder, out of position at right-back.\n\nJamaal Lascelles’s inexperience at this level showed when the centre half – who nonetheless possesses real promise – attempted to play the ball out from the back and instead passed straight to De Bruyne, whose shot proved uncharacteristically wayward.\n\nSuitably reprieved, Newcastle began waking up to City’s fallibilities. Vincent Kompany, back from injury, was not exactly on top form for City, while Fabian Delph and friends had few answers to Sissoko’s surges and power. Deployed in his preferred central-attacking role and again named as captain, the France midfielder, like Tioté, shone. After one of his interceptions – featuring the pickpocketing of Kolarov – Sissoko charged 50 yards only to spare Joe Hart by shooting too early.\n\nAppropriately Sissoko helped inspire the resounding choruses of Blaydon Races that greeted Anita’s leveller. He had not scored for more than two years but when Sissoko drifted to the left and cleverly switched play by lifting a crossfield pass to the right, the scene was set for the Dutchman to become the hero. Accepting the ball, Anita proceeded to dodge Kolarov before cutting inside, transferring possession on to his supposedly weaker left foot and unleashing a low shot through a tangle of legs and in off the inside of the far post.\n\nWith Delph and Kolarov weak City links, Newcastle could glimpse tantalisingly possibility. Fulfilling it depended on retaining the new-found shape and organisation Benítez has drilled into them – they were playing like a side starting to believe salvation really is possible.\n\nSuch optimism remained extremely fragile. Agüero saw a penalty appeal against Chancel Mbemba turned down (almost certainly correctly) after being very smartly played in by De Bruyne and Karl Darlow was required to make a superb save to keep out Jesús Navas’s curving shot.\n\nDespite City’s considerable attacking menace Darlow had actually been surprisingly underemployed. If Hart was hardly hyperactive either the England goalkeeper must still have been mightily relieved to see Pablo Zabaleta make a superb clearance from Townsend’s cross just as Mitrovic, on as a substitute, seemed likely to apply his forehead to it.\n\nWijnaldum’s failure to keep his head cost Newcastle victory. After Kolarov fluffed a clearance, a shooting chance materialised but neglecting to keep his cool, he shot straight at a grateful Hart."}, {"date": "18/04/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium",

Alli, Mousa Dembélé and Érik Lamela were all prominently involved while Kane has re-established himself as the top division’s leading scorer, two ahead of Jamie Vardy with 24 goals. On this evidence there is not an obvious weakness in the team.\n\nHarry Kane has look of predator as Tottenham’s title hunt gains pace Read more\n\nMore than anything, they left the impression they are relishing the chase. A lesser team might have been slightly apprehensive at the start or in that long period after Kane’s opener, scored in the ninth minute, when they could not add the second goal that would to all intents have ended any realistic hopes of a Stoke comeback. Not Spurs, though. Their superiority was unbroken apart from a five‑minute spell in the first half and even then there was no grave danger for a team that has conceded fewer away goals, 13, than any other side.\n\nTheir second goal finally arrived, overdue, in the 70th minute when Eriksen’s expertly weighted through-ball left Alli running clear and the 20-year-old dinked a clever shot past Given and, after that, Stoke collapsed in a way that was uncommon to witness, especially on their own ground.\n\nKane rolled in the third goal after Lamela had sprung the offside trap from Alli’s pass. Alli then slashed a volley past Given to make it 4-0 and further enhance his team’s goal difference, now 13 superior to Leicester’s. Three goals had arrived in a glorious 15-minute spell but it would be a mistake to think they did all their damage in that period. The truth is they were too good for Stoke from the start. Kane’s performance was another reminder of his credentials to win the industry’s player-of-the-year awards and it was rare to see Ryan Shawcross coming off such a poor second best against a direct opponent.\n\nKane must be regarded on this form as the most complete all-round striker in the league and his early strike was another outstanding goal to add to his collection, cutting inside from the left and eluding Philipp Wollscheid before adjusting his body shape and curling a diagonal shot, left to right, into the far corner.\n\nThe England striker had been let down by a poor first touch a few minutes earlier when Lamela’s pass gave him his first chance of the night and, by half-time, Stoke were fortunate to be only one behind. One move, in particular, highlighted the away team’s superiority, culminating in an exquisite flick from Alli to send Eriksen through the middle. The Dane had a clear run at goal but the finish was slightly wild over Given and struck the crossbar.\n\nLeicester’s Jamie Vardy charged by FA and facing extra game ban Read more\n\nStoke’s most encouraging moment in that period came via Marko Arnautovic with a 25-yard shot but Mark Hughes’s team were strangely subdued all night and, in keeping with what often happens here, he and the club’s supporters reverted to concocting a series of exaggerated grievances about the officiating.\n\nIt was a cop-out and, if anything, Stoke were fortunate during the second-half blitz that Shawcross got away with wrestling Toby Alderweireld to the ground inside the penalty area. One of Danny Rose’s surges forward from left-back ended with him slipping over after Kane had sent him running clear and there were other chances for Alli, Lamela and Kane to add further goals.\n\nPochettino had been agitated at 1-0 but Stoke looked so ordinary there were only fleeting moments when Hugo Lloris’s goal was under genuine threat. Spurs had outclassed them. They might not win the league but they are playing the most cohesive, joined-up football of any team and Leicester could be forgiven for looking over their shoulders."}, {"date": "17/04/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11386, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tommy Elphick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Max Gradel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Rhoys Wiggins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun MacDonald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Grabban", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eunan O'Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Randall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oluwaseyi Ojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Stewart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [41], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Flanagan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "If questions remain over Daniel Sturridge and his place in England’s squad for the European Championship finals in June, the striker is doing a good job of answering them. He scored one and played a key role in the other as Liverpool, showing 10 changes from the side that won so famously against Borussia Dortmund on Thursday, tempered Bournemouth’s hopes of ending their debut Premier League season in the top half.\n\nLeonardo Ulloa steals in at last to earn Leicester draw against West Ham Read more\n\nRoberto Firmino, who struck the opener four minutes before half-time, was the only starter from their stunning comeback against Jürgen Klopp’s former team in midweek. Instead the German put plenty of faith in his young players to earn a third win in eight days.\n\nSturridge, however, was undeniably the story. After another campaign troubled by muscle problems, he suddenly looks sharp. He gave Tommy Elphick and Steve Cook a torrid time here, scoring his sixth league goal in only his eighth start. This was his fourth consecutive league start, moreover – the first time that has happened in two years.\n\nKlopp was not too interested in speaking about the game’s best player, though, reacting in an unusually prickly manner to questions about his performance. The manager did say Sturridge “was very good, he’s a brilliant player”, but was more interested in basking in the glory of giving three players winning league debuts.\n\n“This is a game with 11 players,” he said when asked to assess the striker’s performance. “Each player had an influence. I understand this as a team game. I enjoyed the game of Daniel Sturridge today because he’s a great player.”\n\nDanny Ward notably impressed in goal on his full debut only to lose his clean sheet in added time when Joshua King halved the deficit and ensured a frantic final minute, while Connor Randall and Brad Smith completed 90 minutes in the full-back positions.\n\nHigher up the pitch Kevin Stewart looked assured in a holding midfield role; Sheyi Ojo showed flashes of danger in the first half; and Jordon Ibe played a part in both goals.\n\n“I said to the boys before the game that we would have absolutely no chance with the same team against Bournemouth,” Klopp said. “That’s why we changed a lot of times.” He is likely to rotate heavily again for Wednesday’s Merseyside derby.\n\nThe game took quite a while to get going, though. A couple of half-chances aside, the bulk of the opening 40 minutes of action took place in a congested midfield. Perhaps the much-changed visitors just needed time to gel. When they did they required only five minutes to score the decisive goals, though Bournemouth might question their own feeble defending for both.\n\nEddie Howe, their manager, said a slow start proved costly despite a good second-half battle. “It was a difficult first half, we didn’t play well at all,” he said, and did not think they deserved a point. “I wouldn’t say so. I thought the game got away from us in the first half. We didn’t do enough and we conceded two soft goals.”\n\nCertainly the marking was off for the opener. Firmino had started the move on the right, working the ball left from where Ibe played a low cross to Sturridge. He drew four Bournemouth players but still managed to backheel goalwards. Artur Boruc, at full stretch, got a hand to it but Firmino, left completely untracked after feeding Ibe, instinctively darted towards the back post. He tapped in from close range.\n\nBournemouth may also be disappointed at their inability to get close to Sturridge for the second goal in added time. Ibe’s lofted free-kick, after he was fouled by Matt Ritchie, was met by Sturridge, who climbed above Elphick too easily before planting a clinical header into the bottom-left corner.\n\nIn search of a third to kill off any chance of a fightback, Firmino zipped a left-foot half-volley wide two minutes after the interval, while an audacious lob from Sturridge, after a delightful through-ball from Joe Allen, beat an onrushing Boruc but bounced narrowly wide.\n\nThe Cherries were denied a route back into the game in the 61st minute when Mike Jones failed to penalise Kolo Touré for a blatant handball when under pressure from Lewis Grabban. Callum Wilson’s home return – having been introduced in the final moments at Aston Villa last week following seven months out with a knee injury – buoyed the home side but a fine save from Ward after a Grabban header kept the two-goal buffer entering the final 10 minutes.\n\nBournemouth did drag one back in added time when King pulled down a long ball from Andrew Surman before firing low past Ward. Immediately after the restart the hosts piled forward and Cook almost grabbed an unlikely equaliser when directing a Marc Pugh cross on to the roof of the net.\n\nMan of the match Daniel Sturridge

"After all the breathless controversy, high drama and bewildering refereeing the bare facts are that Leicester City’s lead on top of the Premier League has been extended to eight points and at the final whistle there was so much noise and defiance to create the lasting impression that nobody here envisages any reason to consign those “Champions” scarves to the shredding machine.\n\nBut where to start? The second half was bedlam. Both teams left the pitch with a pile of grievances and the lingering image is of the referee, Jon Moss, being escorted off the pitch at the final whistle by a man wearing the look of a nightclub bouncer.\n\nWest Ham’s Andy Carroll slams referee Jon Moss after Leicester draw Read more\n\nMoss has been one of the Premier League’s more erratic referees for some time and a decision was clearly taken that he needed some strong-arm security after a day’s work featuring a red card for Jamie Vardy, a penalty for each side and so much scrutiny that, if nothing else, he is assured of a part in the film that is being planned about the striker’s life.\n\nLeicester’s complaints all went back to that moment, after 57 minutes, when Vardy was sent off for an alleged dive and Claudio Ranieri’s team were denied a penalty that would have given them the chance to make it 2-0. Vardy had already been booked and that decision threatened to have serious ramifications when West Ham scored twice, in the 84th and 86th minutes, to turn the game upside down.\n\nAt 1-0 Leicester had been advancing towards a position whereby they could have sealed the most implausible title success of the modern era if Tottenham, in second position, lost at Stoke City on Monday and Ranieri’s men beat Swansea City next Sunday. In the space of a few minutes Leicester suddenly looked as vulnerable as they have done for a long while, on the brink of a harrowing defeat, with a suspension looming for their leading scorer and the sudden, jarring damage that might be inflicted to their confidence levels.\n\nYet there was still time for Moss to add one final twist and, for all Leicester’s complaints, the bottom line is that his most wretched decision was the one that saw the home team being awarded a penalty in the fifth minute of stoppage time. Moss must have seen something not many others did in Andy Carroll’s innocuous challenge on Jeffrey Schlupp. All that really can be said for certainty is that it gave Leicester their get-out-of-jail card and Leonardo Ulloa took his penalty well to save a point. It was the final kick of a wild, eccentric match.\n\nSlaven Bilic, West Ham’s manager, called it a dive on Schlupp’s part and shook his head blankly as he tried to make sense of it. Carroll called Moss’s performance “unacceptable” and it is not often a referee manages to upset just about everybody, from both teams, in the stadium. Leicester’s goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, had to restrain Robert Huth from confronting him at the end and Vardy went too far after his red card with a finger-jabbing reaction that might warrant the attention of the Football Association’s disciplinary department.\n\nShinji Okazaki finds value in the small details to paint Leicester’s big picture | Michael Cox Read more\n\nThe red card will polarise opinion and, though it is not easy second-guessing Moss, perhaps it was lodged in the referee’s mind that Vardy has a habit of initiating contact from defenders by deliberately adjusting his body direction, often at high speed, so he turns into them rather than the other way round.\n\nOn the flipside Angelo Ogbonna did have his hand on the player’s shoulder before they tangled legs and, when Moss blew his whistle, the majority of the crowd expected a penalty.\n\nVardy had opened the scoring with a breakaway goal starting from a West Ham corner and set up by the ubiquitous, indefatigable N’Golo Kanté, in the 18th minute, but Bilic’s team had always looked dangerous and, to give Moss his due, several Leicester defenders had been guilty of grappling with opponents at set pieces before the referee decided to punish Wes Morgan and award the first penalty. It was, strictly speaking, the correct decision and, as Bilic noted, it has long been a favoured tactic of Leicester’s defenders. Yet it was perplexing, too, that it was punished only once, after Winston Reid went to ground, and that later in the match Moss waved on play when Ogbonna did something similar to Huth at the other end.\n\nWhen Carroll made it 1-1 from the penalty spot it was the first goal Leicester had conceded in nine hours and 34 minutes, going back to the 2-2 draw against West Bromwich Albion on 1 March, and it was followed by a peach of a shot from Aaron Cresswell to take the lead with a slashing volley into the top corner.\n\nAmid everything else Bilic was not even asked about that moment, barely 70 seconds into the match, when the France midfielder Dimitri Payet clipped a free-kick into the penalty area and Cheikhou Kouyaté’s header flicked off Schmeichel’s glove, ricocheted off the inside of one post before striking the opposite side of the goal frame and, almost in slow motion, rebounding into the goalkeeper’s grateful arms.\n\n“There was everything,” Bilic said. “Goals, penalties, a red card, tackling, crosses, everything.” Everything except a winner. Yet the final act ended with Schmeichel clenching his fists and roaring at the Leicester fans. “That was worth more than one point,” Ranieri said of Ulloa’s penalty. “Psychologically we are there again.”\n\nMan of the match N’Golo Kanté (Leicester City)"}, {"date": "17/04/2016", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59961, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech",

"report": "In a season in which Chelsea have imploded, Manchester City have been erratic, Manchester United have laboured and Liverpool have been in transition, Arsenal remain determined to finish in fourth. This was a microcosm of the club’s perennial frustrations – a game they largely controlled and would reasonably have expected to win but found a way to squander.\n\nArsène Wenger had called for a flawless final six matches from his Arsenal players in an attempt to keep alive their slim Premier League title hopes but, after last Saturday’s skittish 3-3 draw at West Ham United, they once again fell short. The dream is over and the weeks ahead will feature anxious looks over shoulders, as much as anything else, as they seek to keep fifth-placed Manchester United at bay.\n\nLooking up, rather than down, Arsenal would love to reel in Tottenham Hotspur and a third-placed finish would be better than fourth, given that the latter comes with the requirement to pre-qualify for the Champions League. But there is the unmistakable sense of anticlimax.\n\nAlexis Sánchez brought urgency and he put Arsenal in front in first-half injury‑time with his 14th goal of the club season. The home team hogged possession and Mesut Özil was typically eye-catching but they did not create enough clear-cut chances, with Wenger lamenting the lack of accuracy in their final ball. He also noted how freedom and a change of pace was missing.\n\nCrystal Palace made them pay. Alan Pardew’s team created little in the final third but all three of his attack-minded substitutions made contributions and, eventually, the visitors made something happen. Bakary Sako, who came on at half-time, worked Petr Cech from a Yohan Cabaye corner in the 76th minute and the equaliser came shortly afterwards.\n\nEmmanuel Adebayor, another substitute and one who, predictably, was booed by the fans of his former club, got away up the left before he rolled the ball back to Yannick Bolasie. The forward drifted inside, waiting for the right moment, and shot low and sweetly for the near corner. Cech ought to have done better. The goalkeeper was slow to get down and across and, although he got his hands to the ball, he could not keep it out.\n\nIt was not the way Cech would have wanted to mark his return to the team and it was Palace who might have nicked it. They have impressive pace and power on the counterattack and the final substitute, Wilfried Zaha, robbed a dawdling Laurent Koscielny but he could not release Adebayor in the middle.\n\nPardew talked afterwards of how visiting teams could “exploit that last period of the game” if they were still in it, because of how Arsenal always push their full-backs high and wide. “They over-commit, at times,” the Palace manager said. “It gives you an opportunity.”\n\nPalace took theirs and Pardew could be pleased with the lift the goal gave to Bolasie. He was also relieved that the key defender, Scott Dann, who was hurt in a challenge with Gabriel Paulista, escaped greater injury.\n\nPalace have their eyes on the FA Cup semi-final against Watford at Wembley next Sunday and, particularly after this point, it is difficult to see them getting sucked into the relegation dogfight. They have won one and drawn three of their past four league matches.\n\nArsenal were on the front foot for most of the game and, at the end an underwhelming first half, they went ahead, when Danny Welbeck expertly picked out Sánchez with a ball over the top. The Chilean got there before Wayne Hennessey to score with a looping header. The move had started when Dann played Mile Jedinak into trouble and he was robbed by Welbeck.\n\nArsène Wenger disappointed by referee change for Stoke v Tottenham Read more\n\nSánchez had laid on the clearest chance of the game previously, when he sent Özil through on 43 minutes but, under pressure, the playmaker could not get his shot past the goalkeeper, who blocked.\n\nPardew had started with two up front but he would shuffle his pack. Sako replaced Jedinak and the formation went to 4-1-4-1, with Bolasie moved to the right and Jason Puncheon deployed off the striker. Pardew went on to swap Adebayor for Connor Wickham and, finally, Zaha for Puncheon and his team, belatedly, came to threaten.\n\nArsenal had a number of half-chances when the score stood at 1-0 and it was Sanchez who went the closest, flicking a header from Özil’s cross past the far post. It was Palace, though, who finished the stronger.\n\nMan of the match Alexis Sánchez (Arsenal)"}, {"date": "16/04/2016", "arena": "Carrow Road", "attendance": 27117, "home_team": {"name": "Norwich

Sunderland eased their way to victory over Norwich City that left the home team looking ominously deflated.\n\nSunderland came to Norfolk four points behind Norwich with a game in hand and just about clinging on by the cuticles. The result here suggests the three-way struggle to avoid joining Aston Villa in the Championship will stretch out into the season’s endgame. The performance, with Sunderland clinical where Norwich were vague, suggests Allardyce may just get to trumpet his record in marshalling escapes one more time.\n\nFabio Borini converted the opening goal from the penalty spot and the lively Jermain Defoe scored the second, his 10th in 14 away games. Duncan Watmore added a lovely third. The referee, Andre Marriner, also played his part, giving Norwich very little all afternoon.\n\nThe result was good news for the north-east generally as Newcastle’s flickering hopes of escaping the drop were also given the faintest breath of oxygen. For Sunderland defeat would have been close to terminal. As it is, they are now lurking only a point off Norwich, buoyed by the decisive nature of this victory.\n\nOutside Carrow Road before kick-off a small clutch of Norwich fans could be heard singing “He’s big, he’s Swiss, he’s bought a house in Diss, Timm Klose.” Unfortunately, Norwich’s best player was absent, having failed to recover from the knee injury picked up against Crystal Palace. Klose is unlikely to play again this season. The slightly hair-raising Sébastien Bassong took his place here and contributed to this result with some slightly frantic defending.\n\nAs the teams kicked off the stadium was a febrile place, the air inside this low-rise, clattery corrugated arena crackling with lunchtime anxiety. There was an early sign of tension as both benches rose to engage in a minor scuffle after DeAndre Yedlin was shoved into a rather close advertisement board by the dugouts, with Allardyce himself wading into the middle of the melee. “I was defending my box,” Allardyce said afterwards. So much for the Friendly Cup.\n\nSunderland set out in a rigid-looking 4-1-4-1, early attacking intent limited to long diagonal passes towards Defoe. Robbie Brady hoisted one tasty-looking cross towards Dieumerci Mbokani. Jan Kirchhoff, a vast ambling midfield-pylon, got to grips with the roving Steven Naismith.\n\nSteadily Sunderland did begin to press at Norwich’s soft centre. Albeit the opening goal on 41 minutes arrived more or less from nowhere, a penalty awarded correctly for Andre Wisdom’s stamp on Borini’s ankle under a bouncing ball. Alex Neil suggested Wisdom touched the ball first but a stamp is still a foul, ball or no ball. Borini got up and planted the kick firmly to John Ruddy’s right, before haring off to the corner flag to celebrate wildly in front of the home fans.\n\nNeither team deserved to take the lead at that stage, Sunderland probably less so. But the goal was reward for some lively movement from Borini, who may lack composure when it comes to shooting, but moves with an intelligence and energy a cut above anything else on show here.\n\nThe ground went quiet under the teeming rain as the away fans bellowed and danced. Neil responded by bringing on Nathan Redmond for Brady at half-time, and Redmond made his presence felt, clipping the outside of the post with a low drive. Almost immediately, Norwich were punished again.\n\nKirchhoff shouldered Bassong off the ball: possibly a foul, more likely just a strong challenge. Having strayed so far from the middle Bassong really had to win the challenge. Albeit, Sunderland’s ruthlessness in punishing a momentary slip was thrilling, perhaps also a little baffling for the fans who have followed them around the country all season. Kirchhoff fed Borini, whose low cross was weighted perfectly for Defoe’s sprint into exactly the right place to poke the ball home.\n\nAston Villa relegated from Premier League after defeat by Manchester United Read more\n\nAs Norwich pressed Marriner waved their claims away twice as Mbokani was hauled down by Younès Kaboul. The first should have been a penalty. Mbokani was making space to shoot. The second was a grapple at a corner, shortly before Lee Cattermole cleared off the line.\n\nNorwich’s fans slumped further in their seats as Cattermole organised the Sunderland resistance to a series of energetically vague attacks, with Naismith a disappointment as a wandering No10. And by the end Norwich looked like what they are: a game, spirited team lacking real incision, undone by moments of class from wasteful but narrowly more thoroughbred opposition.\n\nWhatever happens from here the Sunderland survival blueprint is hardly stirring. Ellis Short once said he would “appoint the devil” if it mean keeping Sunderland in the Premier League but even the Lord of the Flies himself would probably purse his lips and look a little askance at the jumbled cut-and-shut incoherence of Sunderland’s acquisitions’ policy over the last few years. Here at least they looked like a team with a plan, and enough razor edge to claw their way out of trouble.

Read more\n\nMitigating circumstances lay behind the draw with an equally subdued Southampton but the result guaranteed Everton will finish the season with their lowest ever points tally at Goodison since the introduction of three points for a win. They have taken a mere five from the last 27 available on home soil.\n\nStewards seized the idiotic pitch invader before he got too close to Martinez and he was widely booed by the crowd – though a few applauded – but impressive debuts for the teenagers Callum Connolly and Tom Davies were the only other consolations for an increasingly beleaguered manager.\n\n“We all understand the results at home haven’t been anywhere near what we expect,” said Martínez who, regardless of Everton’s results for the past two seasons, does not deserve to be treated so shamefully. “It’s understandable you get that frustration but after 10 months we have an opportunity to take advantage of being in the FA Cup semi-final.”\n\nThis was an end-of-season affair in all its passionless, pedestrian stupor – and Ronald Koeman’s team had European qualification to play for. “The total team performance was not sharp enough,” the Southampton manager lamented. “The final pass was not good enough and we didn’t have enough shots on target. We have scored 14 away goals and 31 at home. The difference is too big. We need to improve in that respect.”\n\nEverton at least had an excuse for putting the Goodison faithful through another trying afternoon. Injuries, James McCarthy’s suspension and the need to protect Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley for the Merseyside derby and FA Cup semi-final produced a makeshift selection from Martínez. One of the few regulars who did start, Seamus Coleman, suffered a hamstring injury that is expected to keep him out of the trips to Anfield and Wembley. And, amid all the change, there was still no sign of the £13.5m January signing Oumar Niasse.\n\nA full-strength Everton side would have struggled to rouse Goodison on current form but the weakened version managed a positive start before the open spaces in and around their defence invited Southampton to attack. Three times Southampton struck the frame of Joel Robles’s goal. Dusan Tadic turned an awkward volley on to the top of the crossbar, Shane Long sent a glancing header from Ryan Bertrand’s against the far post and Tadic hit the bar again with a powerful drive early in the second half.\n\nHeurelho Gomes’s double penalty heroics help Watford past West Brom Read more\n\nColeman’s replacement, the 18-year-old Connolly, enjoyed a fine debut and it was from his dangerous low cross towards Kevin Mirallas that Everton won the corner that produced the breakthrough. Mirallas’s set piece found Ramiro Funes Mori unmarked at the back post and, though Long blocked the Argentina international’s header, the rebound fell perfectly for the otherwise struggling defender to lash home via a deflection off Bertrand.\n\nNot for the first time this season, Everton let a lead slip too easily. Tadic was faced by three blue shirts as he cut into the area from the right wing. Challenges were non-existent. Funes Mori should have cleared but instead his weak touch struck the visiting winger, rebounded behind John Stones and allowed Sadio Mané to pounce from close range.

Aston Villa have lost their Premier League status and the dearly departed would like to thank Manchester United and their supporters for the respectful 90 minutes of silence.\n\nThe stricken, bottom-of-the-table side were granted a short stay of execution when Norwich failed to take anything from their game against Sunderland, but they barely managed to cross the halfway line here let alone find the goals necessary to beat the drop once Marcus Rashford’s seventh goal of the season provided a rare moment of quality in the most tepid of encounters.\n\nManchester United v Aston Villa: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nPlease do not drop Rashford to make way was the overwhelming response from United fans when Louis van Gaal indicated he was ready to bring back Wayne Rooney and the manager gave Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard a rest instead. The former, in fairness, has played in almost every game this season and United do have a midweek match against Crystal Palace coming up.\n\nWhile not every manager would make changes after such a convincing performance as the one at West Ham in the last match, it must be abundantly clear by now that Van Gaal is not every manager. In any case, if you cannot take a few risks against a team who have lost eight games in a row and are about to be relegated, when can you?\n\n“I wanted to rest Rashford too,” Van Gaal said. “He is young and could do with a break, but I needed his momentum and he was very positive. He wanted to play so I let him.” A good thing too. Without Rashford’s momentum this game might have ground to a complete halt.\n\nGallows humour from the Villa supporters was evident after precisely one minute, when the away section broke into a chant of: “It’s only nil-nil, how shit must you be?” When they reprised the ditty midway through the first half it woke everyone up, because the contest was proceeding at a snail’s pace and United were beginning to prove their point.\n\nScoreless first halves have been a feature of this weird United season but few imagined Van Gaal’s players would find it hard to impose themselves against doomed visitors who were merely going through the motions. Thankfully this time it only proved to be a scoreless first half hour. Rashford broke the deadlock in the 32nd minute with an assured finish from the six-yard line after Rooney’s marvellous crossfield pass had played Antonio Valencia behind the Villa cover on the right.\n\nCue “We’ll meet again, don’t know where, don’t know when” from the travelling support, which was poignant and apposite, though not as amusing as “Let’s pretend we’ve scored a goal” or “Joleon Lescott: he’s got a new car”.\n\nNewcastle grab lifeline as Andros Townsend caps vital win over Swansea Read more\n\nIf by now you are forming the opinion that the only entertainment on offer was being provided by the paying customers in a small corner of the ground you would not be far from the truth. Rooney was playing quite well in his find space in midfield and hit measured passes mode, but there was little urgency or excitement and at times the stadium was eerily quiet considering there were 75,000 present. Though the teams were playing in the same colours as Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund on Thursday a visitor from space would never have worked out they were supposed to be engaged in the same activity.\n\nQuite early in the second half it became clear Villa were not going to throw caution to the wind and go out with a bang but continue staying compact at the back in an attempt to keep embarrassment to a minimum.\n\nRashford went close shortly after the restart, Juan Mata brought a save from Brad Guzan after an hour and Memphis Depay sent a free kick over the bar, though what summed up the afternoon was the foul that led to the last. Depay was running purposefully towards the Villa area with the ball when Kieran Richardson, formerly of this parish, arrived on the scene to hack him down, raising a hand to accept the inevitable booking as he did so. Nothing could have better illustrated the gulf between the two sides. Villa could not get close to their opponents and this was not even one of United’s good days.\n\nThere was a brief flurry of incident around the United goal once Rudy Gestede came on with a close-range effort blocked and then a shot rebounding from an upright, before a Ciaran Clark header brought David de Gea’s first real save with five minutes left on the clock.\n\nIt was not remotely enough, which has been the story of Villa’s season. “Cheerio, cheerio,” sang the Villa fans on their way out."}, {"date": "16/04/2016", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 48949,

against relegation has just become very interesting.\n\nRafael Benítez says Newcastle’s new-found self-belief can save them Read more\n\nNo matter that the performance was not always quite as convincing as the final scoreline, Rafael Benítez celebrated his 56th birthday with a fully deserved first win in five attempts since succeeding Steve McClaren last month.\n\n“Rafa, Rafa Benítez,” sang an exultant Gallowgate End in between bouts of serenading the Spaniard with “Happy birthday to you”. It may yet prove a false dawn but goals from Jamaal Lascelles, Moussa Sissoko and an especially impressive Andros Townsend were sufficient to leave Newcastle – who face Manchester City here on Tuesday night when victory would lift them out of the bottom three – breathing down the necks of Norwich and Sunderland.\n\nBenítez’s team sheet made interesting reading. Jonjo Shelvey, McClaren’s marquee £12m signing from Swansea and Newcastle’s recent captain, was dropped to the bench, thereby facilitating a midfield recall for Cheik Tioté.\n\nFew would have expected to see the armband handed to Sissoko but not only did the former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager offer the France midfielder that role but he permitted him a rare outing in his preferred “in the hole” position.\n\nWith Aleksandar Mitrovic – the sort of traditional centre forward Swansea’s Ashley Williams and Federico Fernández relish marking – dropped to the bench, Sissoko found himself operating behind the fleeter-footed Papiss Cissé.\n\nBenítez was rewarded by much- improved displays from the recently anonymous Sissoko and Gini Wijnaldum while Tioté’s sometimes bruising ball-winning abilities helped diminish Swansea’s initial enthusiasm for the contest.\n\nThere were cameos when Newcastle still looked horribly vulnerable and a decided edginess inhibited their passing but, encouragingly, importantly, they were winning virtually every second ball.\n\nYet if Francesco Guidolin’s team were largely on the back foot, Lukasz Fabianski initially did not have an awful lot to do. True, the goalkeeper reacted well to scramble a cross to safety before diving low to swoop on an early Townsend shot but generally Swansea defended intelligently enough to keep a nervous audience in fairly muted mode.\n\nSignificantly though, a distinctly ersatz home rearguard, featuring Vurnon Anita out of position at right-back, was succeeding in subduing the dangerous Gylfi Sigurdsson while ensuring Karl Darlow first involvement – the goalkeeper’s retrieval of a deflected shot – did not come until the 35th minute.\n\nThe odd patch of sustained visiting pressure apart, Newcastle largely continued doing a very good job of strictly rationing Swansea’s possession by gobbling up all those second balls and this strategy – a hallmark Benítez game plan – paid dividends when they finally took the lead for the first time under their new manager’s charge.\n\nThis breakthrough was delivered by the slightly unlikely figure of Lascelles. Sigurdsson was tugging him back as Townsend whipped in a corner but the centre-half shrugged off the Icelander before bravely putting his head where it hurts, throwing himself at the ball and powering home a header which went in off the helpless Fabianski.\n\nNewcastle fans – and even Benítez – seemed so startled by what they had just seen that there was a momentary collective pause, a sense of suspended animation, before the celebrations began. It was as if no one could quite believe that something had finally gone right for a team which, despite its manifold faults, has been all out of luck just lately. Early in the second half Lascelles might have scored again but, tantalisingly, he failed to apply the decisive touch after very nearly connecting with the fall out from a free-kick.\n\nAll in all it was perhaps not the best day for Jason Levien – who, along with his fellow American Steve Kaplan, is in talks about potentially completing a takeover at Swansea this summer – to be casting an eye on his prospective new investment from the directors’ box.\n\nThere are suggestions the new owners want to replace Guidolin with Brendan Rodgers which, given the Italian’s success in steering a once apparently Championship-bound side to safety, seems rather harsh.\n\nFurious Everton fan confronts Roberto Martínez after Mané levels for Southampton Read more\n\nBenítez’s replacement of the tiring Tioté with Shelvey possibly, coincidentally, served as the cue for Guidolin’s players to finally wake up and create some chances. After Williams half-volleyed narrowly wide, Jefferson Montero and Bafétimbi Gomis both missed presentable shooting openings.\n\nIt was time for Newcastle to reassert themselves and Sissoko could not have chosen a better time to score his first goal of the season. The increasingly influential Townsend delivered another stellar corner and, following a bit of pinball, the Frenchman extended one of those telescopic legs and forced his shot past Fabianski from around eight yards.\n\nTownsend deserved a goal and, appropriately, the England winger registered the third, defying Swansea’s offside trap to shoot beneath Fabianski’s body after being played in by Mitrovic.\n\nBenítez’s birthday cake must have tasted particularly good."}, {"date": "16/04/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25515, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion",

the striker for the home defeat to Watford.\n\nThe 22-year-old striker saw both his spot-kicks saved by the brilliant Heurelho Gomes, whose heroics ensured that Ben Watson’s first-half goal halted a six-game run without a win for the Hornets in the Premier League.\n\nBerahino, who in August had a written transfer request turned down by the club amid several rejected offers for him from Tottenham and has struggled for fitness and form since, saw his first penalty in the 67th minute beaten away by Gomes diving to his right.\n\nWith three minutes remaining, the Brazilian goalkeeper repeated the feat, this time getting down to his left-hand side to divert Berahino’s goal-bound effort away from the bottom corner of the net.\n\nAsked if Berahino was feeling down after the game, Pulis said: “I would say that’s an understatement. He’s really disappointed. It’s a cruel game at times, but it happens. Good strikers miss penalties. That’s football. He’s a good player.\n\n“Since I’ve been here he’s always been the penalty taker, and he’s always been competent as well. He wanted to take the second one. I think if he lacked any confidence he’d have walked away from it. You can’t have a go at him as the keeper has made a fantastic save for the second one. It was a well-struck penalty and it was a fantastic save.”\n\nBerahino was not the only West Brom player to find Gomes in fantastic form. The 35-year-old enjoyed a storming afternoon, producing smart saves to twice thwart Stéphane Sessègnon in the first half and acrobatically deny Gareth McAuley shortly after half-time.\n\nA laboured start to the game was broken after 17 minutes when Adlène Guedioura’s low shot from the edge of area went narrowly wide. At the other end, Sessègnon’s well-hit free-kick brought a parried save from Gomes before the West Brom attacker then put the rebound wide. Shortly afterwards Watford were ahead. Guedioura’s corner was steered into the far corner of the net by the former Albion loan player Watson.\n\nWest Brom responded well to the setback and James McClean burst past two defenders before getting caught in two minds about whether to shoot or try to cross the ball for Berahino. In the end he did neither and a good position was wasted.\n\nJust before half-time some neat build-up play between Craig Dawson and Salomón Rondón resulted in a shooting opportunity for Sessègnon but his effort was brilliantly diverted wide by the fingertips of Gomes.\n\nDuncan Watmore seals Sunderland victory over Norwich in survival battle Read more\n\nMcClean sent a shot into the side-netting within a minute of the restart before another fingertip save from Gomes, this time to help McAuley’s header over the crossbar. At the other end, Ben Foster produced a similarly fine save to deny the Watford captain, Troy Deeney.\n\n“Like I said, it can be a cruel game at times,” said Pulis. “I thought we played well. We’ve had something like 40-odd crosses, 16 efforts on goal and two penalties and not got anything from the game. How that’s happened I just don’t know.\n\nBut that’s the way it goes sometimes, it just wasn’t our day in front of goal. Obviously the lads are really disappointed, some of them put in really good performances.”\n\nThe hosts could not find a way past Gomes. He blotted his copybook as the midway point of the second half approached by rushing out and bringing down Berahino. However, he redeemed himself by saving the West Brom striker’s penalty.\n\nAlbion applied some late pressure and it looked like they would be rewarded when Étienne Capoue tripped McClean for a second penalty. Berahino grabbed the ball, keen to make amends, but once more he saw his effort saved by Gomes as the FA Cup semi-finalists hung on for the three points.\n\nWatford’s manager, Quique Sánchez Flores praised his goalkeeper. “We are happy we didn’t concede a lot of chances, just the two penalties, and when he had to Heurelho made the saves. He is important for us,” he said. “I think a clean sheet is always important for the team. I’m not sure exactly how we conceded two penalties but he [Gomes] had to save them, this is normal.\n\n“We are really happy for the performance of Heurelho because he is one of the main players for us this season.” PA"}, {"date": "16/04/2016", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41212, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [78], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baba Rahman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Pato", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bertrand Traoré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Miazga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Samir Nasri", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33, 54, 80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Manchester City are finishing with a flourish. This was a comprehensive thrashing of a Chelsea side pining for the season to end, a humiliation imposed by Sergio Agüero’s hat-trick and inspired by the fluid invention and menace of Kevin De Bruyne, back in familiar territory and tormenting former team-mates. The hosts shuddered at the brutality of it all but when this City team click they can feel untouchable.\n\nThe frustration is that the charge is coming so late. A side and squad of this talent, capable of subjecting the faded champions to their first defeat here by three goals since Carlo Ancelotti’s team subsided to Sunderland in November 2010, should have made this title their own, for all the brilliance offered up by Leicester and Tottenham Hotspur above them and the injuries that have eaten at times into Manuel Pellegrini’s options.\n\nThat a three-match winning burst still leaves them 12 points from the summit damns management and playing staff but this was no time to complain. There was too much zip and pace to their performance in which to delight, with their attacking play irrepressible.\n\nAgüero inevitably drew the focus with the sheer brilliance of his finishing, the hat-trick leaving him with 13 goals from his past 12 Premier League appearances and 21 in 26 for the campaign. He has achieved that tally in seven fewer league appearances than it has taken Jamie Vardy. Harry Kane has scored 22 over 33 games but, while both Englishmen have illuminated their respective teams’ campaigns, Agüero’s ruthless efficiency is eclipsed by none of his top-flight peers. In that context it is baffling he did not feature on the Professional Footballers’ Association six-man shortlist for the player of the year. “It’s very strange that Sergio has played here so many years and has not been [recognised as] the best player,” Pellegrini said. “I’m sure Sergio is the best striker in the league.”\n\nChelsea, shorn still of John Terry, could not cope with him. The Argentinian was for ever scuttling into space, unnerving his markers at will and finishing as crisply as ever, even if the supply line was key to his scoring. Samir Nasri enjoyed his best game of a season stunted by injury, while De Bruyne’s excellence had the locals chuntering in dismay that he was once one of their own. The Belgian had not previously returned to these parts since forcing through an £18m transfer to Wolfsburg, much to José Mourinho’s frustration, in January 2014. This was a display to justify the £55m price tag that accompanied his return to England, all clever movement and deceptive pace. Chelsea never came close to quelling his threat.\n\nIt was the 24-year-old whose burst beyond Branislav Ivanovic and cutback almost presented Agüero with a third-minute tap-in, and his run between Baba Rahman and César Azpilicueta on to Yaya Touré’s perfectly measured pass forced Thibaut Courtois to save smartly with his right leg. The goalkeeper did well to deny Nasri, too but would not see out the contest, dismissed for the second time this term, for a professional foul on Fernandinho – the Belgian will miss the games with Bournemouth and Tottenham – with Agüero duly completing his hat-trick from the spot. By then the contest had long felt settled, the glum look on Roman Abramovich’s face as he played idly with his mobile phone up in his executive box summing up the local mood. This season cannot end soon enough.\n\nMismatches like this expose the size of the task awaiting Antonio Conte. Guus Hiddink suggested his team had been outdone “by smartness” rather than completely outplayed, pointing to City’s power on the counterattack, but that was a kind assessment. This was a fourth defeat in six games in all competitions as they meander uncharacteristically in mid-table. City were streetwise, a quality Chelsea once considered their own.\n\nThe ease with which the hosts were lacerated by City’s gallops upfield was disturbing, not least for the opening goal. It was Mikel John Obi who surrendered possession to Agüero at a corner before De Bruyne took over. He scorched away from Rahman and, having reached the penalty area unchecked, squared for the unmarked Agüero in the middle. The striker cut inside Gary Cahill and found the bottom corner via a deflection from the centre-half’s left boot.\n\nThe second was just as slickly taken, De Bruyne exploiting Azpilicueta’s hesitancy inside the City half to spring up-field and eventually clip Nasri free at his side. The Frenchman waited for Agüero to check his run and the forward’s 20th league goal of the season was converted crisply across Courtois.\n\nRuben Loftus-Cheek offered flashes of his quality in riposte and Nicolás Otamendi did hack a Pedro shot from the goalline but, even for the home team’s elder statesmen, this felt like an education."}, {"date": "13/04/2016", "arena": "Selhurst Park",

present, there is precious little joy for either to be had in the Premier League. The point secured here was arguably a minor triumph for Everton, a team whose top-flight form has rather collapsed of late, given they played most of the second period a man down. Even so, both these sides are staggering towards an unsatisfactory conclusion to the campaign.\n\nManchester United into FA Cup semi-finals with narrow win at West Ham Read more\n\nRoberto Martínez, perhaps inevitably, would disagree but his insistence that the timing of his team’s performance had been “perfect” felt rather baffling. Admittedly there was much to admire in their rugged refusal to wilt when Crystal Palace finally built up a head of steam late on. The goalkeeper, Joel Robles, was outstanding and the centre-half pairing shielding him were stubborn and effective.\n\n“It’s great to see we’re learning from hard lessons,” Martínez said, “and to keep a clean sheet and manage the game in that way was perfect timing. It’s now you want to hit your top level. You want to shine in the last few weeks of the season and we showed the solid approach today.”\n\nYet, given this was a contest between teams who now have four league wins between them from 26 games in 2016, to hear him lavishing such praise on the display was more a reflection of Everton’s recent lull. His team had offered flashes of their threat as Ross Barkley struck the crossbar from distance, might have won a penalty when Séamus Coleman was tripped, and tested Wayne Hennessey throughout the first period. But their approach was undermined by James McCarthy’s dismissal for fouls on Jason Puncheon and Yannick Bolasie to ensure the last 38 minutes became an exercise in concentration. There is probably no easier team in the division to nullify with depleted numbers, though, than this gummy Palace lineup.\n\nIt was the sight of the hosts’ substitutes combining nine minutes from time that best summed it all up. Emmanuel Adebayor rose gracefully above his marker on the corner of the six-yard box and nodded down for Connor Wickham with Everton momentarily out of shape and there for the taking. The opportunity seemed easier to take than miss, only for Wickham to mistime a swipe with his right foot and scuff the ball on to his standing leg. The majority inside the arena howled in frustration, though they will have recognised the profligacy. Palace’s approach play can be exhilarating but there is no consistent bite with which to capitalise.\n\nNigel Pearson emerges as the favourite to be next Aston Villa manager Read more\n\nAlan Pardew pointed to the rustiness affecting Wickham, recently back from a thigh complaint, and Dwight Gayle. Adebayor, too, has been struggling for fitness and he guided a series of late headers wide. Puncheon might also have added to Saturday’s much-needed winner against Norwich City, but the zip had gone from Palace’s approach. Both Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha had off-nights.\n\n“They’ve been the key to this team since I’ve been here, and have to offer a bit more for us than they did out there,” said the manager. Certainly the collective will have to raise their game if they are to claim anything from daunting trips to Arsenal and Manchester United in the week ahead.\n\nThe date with Watford at Wembley follows those games and, 11 points clear of the bottom three, at least Palace can approach that occasion with more optimism that they have done enough to remain in the division after their recent 14-match winless run. “Five points from the last three is not too bad,” added Pardew. “We have to accept that after the run we’ve been on.” Yet Watford, another side on the slide, will hardly be quaking in their boots and neither will Manchester United at the prospect of confronting Everton.

On a day when hope and fear collided, when Leicester City moved within touching distance of a most unexpected title and Sunderland were shoved a step nearer to relegation, it seemed a wholly appropriate image.\n\nAt the end Claudio Ranieri was crying, Leicester’s manager apparently overwhelmed by his side’s enduring achievements. Emotionally at least Sam Allardyce is far too old-school, much too British, to shed any public tears – of joy or otherwise – but privately Sunderland’s manager must have felt like howling his heart out in despair at the damage done to his team’s survival prospects by Jamie Vardy’s two goals.\n\nClaudio Ranieri sheds tears and dedicates win to Leicester’s supporters Read more\n\nIn truth Leicester were not at their best and, for lengthy periods, Allardyce’s team held their own, playing reasonably well. Ultimately, though, they lacked a Vardy-esque cutting edge, something emphasised when the substitute Jack Rodwell missed an excellent chance to equalise.\n\nWhile Vardy’s contribution in the wake of his minor goal drought – none in six league games – was sufficient to preserve the visitors’ formidable lead over Tottenham Hotspur at the top of the table, Sunderland’s fate now looks to hinge on Saturday’s trip to Norwich City.\n\n“It’s a game we’ll try to win but we can’t afford to lose,” said Allardyce, whose team are four points behind Alex Neil’s side with a game in hand. He could have done with travelling to Carrow Road with at least one more point on the board. “A draw against Leicester would have been fantastic but Jack Rodwell missed that chance,” said Sunderland’s manager.\n\nHis pain was exacerbated by the fact that Sunderland’s principal “slip” involved a failure to cut out the trademark Leicester long ball that created Vardy’s opener. “Everyone knows they play lots of long balls over the top and we couldn’t afford to give him a chance like that,” Allardyce lamented before indulging in a slight dig at Ranieri’s perceived fundamentalism.\n\n“Leicester are unique,” said Allardyce. “They don’t have to be pretty. Fans of bigger clubs might moan about the way they play but their fans love it. And each of their players is playing better and with more consistency than they’ve ever done in their life. That’s the beauty of it; that’s what confidence gives you.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sunderland’s Jack Rodwell spurns a glorious chance to equalise against Leicester. Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters\n\nIndeed for a team that were supposed to have come over all defensive in the past few weeks, Leicester began in startlingly high-tempo, front-foot mode. It took some last-ditch interceptions and wince-inducing challenges on Sunderland’s part to keep them at bay.\n\nHaving caught their breath, Allardyce’s team enjoyed a decent first half with Jan Kirchhoff making his presence felt in central midfield. At 6ft 5in Kirchhoff casts quite a shadow and, at times, even N’Golo Kanté found himself in the unusual position of being eclipsed by the German. With Lee Cattermole also in real ankle-biting, snappy tackling mood, Kanté and Danny Drinkwater certainly had their work cut out.\n\nCattermole made a couple of vital interventions, most notably to deny the strangely anonymous, unusually erratic, Riyad Mahrez and, even when Sunderland seemed in danger of coming undone at the hands of Leicester counterattacks, Lamine Koné and the initially excellent Younès Kaboul held firm. With Vardy deceptively subdued Vito Mannone did not make a single save until almost an hour had passed.\n\nConsidering Kasper Schmeichel was similarly underemployed it had become a day where the game’s fascination lay largely in the assorted midfield sub-plots. Most notable among them was Kanté’s increasingly successful efforts to reimpose himself on proceedings.\n\nAlthough Sunderland had a half-hearted penalty appeal when Robert Huth appeared to handle Patrick van Aanholt’s cross and Schmeichel, finally called to arms, saved smartly to keep out Fabio Borini’s deflected shot, much of the finishing was either scuffed or horribly wayward.\n\nPerhaps lulled into a false sense of security, Sunderland’s defensive mind-set was about to switch off momentarily. Shortly after seeing Mannone finally required to make a save, the Italian diving to smother Drinkwater’s fairly benign shot following Mahrez’s clever dummy, they succumbed to a by now familiar bout of self-destruction.\n\nSunderland 0-2 Leicester: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWith minds and bodies tiring, Allardyce’s players lost concentration as Drinkwater launched a long, looping, simple ball forward. Having flown over the home defence it was met by the rapidly advancing Vardy who, with Kaboul now trailing in his wake, beat Mannone with a ruthlessly incisive shot into the bottom corner from an awkward angle.\n\nIt was Vardy’s 20th Premier League goal of an extraordinary season and immediately prompted choruses of “Gonna win the league” from the away end.\n\nThe unmarked Rodwell had an ideal chance to silence them but, with time seeming to stand still, the midfielder froze, panicked and sidefooted over the bar from eight yards after a blocked shot had been deflected into his path. When the music stops next month that could be regarded as a very big miss.\n\nIt meant victory belonged to Leicester well before the moment, deep in stoppage time, when Vardy sped beyond Van Aanholt, rounded the advancing Mannone and shot into the empty net.\n\nTottenham really have their work cut out now – and so, too, do Sunderland.\n\nMan of the match Jamie Vardy (Leicester City)"}, {"date":

mounted up for the biggest home win of his Liverpool reign. The performance in the technical area reflected his team’s out on the pitch – calm, carefree and ultimately in control, the perfect Sunday stroll before the Europa League showdown with Borussia Dortmund. “I picked a team to win,” he said. “But I didn’t think it would be like this.”\n\nFor Stoke City, an encouraging start disintegrated into a display of dissent and dismal defending at Anfield. Mark Hughes substituted Erik Pieters moments after a heated exchange with his hapless left-back and was left ruing not only key absentees but a defeat that damages his club’s hopes of qualifying for Europe next season. “The story of the game for us unfortunately was our ability to stop the ball coming into our box and that we lacked the ability to clear them when they did,” he said.\n\nLeicester march on towards title after Jamie Vardy sinks Sunderland Read more\n\nFor Liverpool, the stories were positive and plentiful. Divock Origi’s impressive development continued with two goals. Daniel Sturridge was also on the scoresheet and showed a good understanding with his young strike partner as the home side dominated the second half.\n\nKlopp could afford to rest several players before the quarter-final second leg against Dortmund – as did Thomas Tuchel for his side’s 2-2 draw against Schalke – and give Sheyi Ojo and Kevin Stewart their full league debuts, partner Kolo Touré alongside Martin Skrtel in central defence and watch his balanced, flexible team cruise to victory.\n\n“Divock has learned everything from me,” Klopp joked when asked about the Belgium international’s rise in confidence and productivity. “When he came here everything was different for him at first. Expectations were really high because he is a really highly rated striker but he had a lot of little injuries. He used the last injury to work on his body strength and now he has to wear a different shirt. You can see the confidence too. His second goal was only possible with confidence.”\n\nThursday’s exertions in Germany and Sunday’s selection could have disrupted Liverpool’s rhythm but there was no evidence as they leapfrogged Stoke in the table. The home side were ahead early through Alberto Moreno’s first goal in 65 games and a collective lapse in concentration among the Stoke defence. Phil Bardsley was penalised for a foul on James Milner, who played a quick free-kick inside to Moreno. No defender came near the Liverpool left-back as he controlled, took aim and beat the unconvincing goalkeeper Jakob Haugaard from 20 yards.\n\nOne bright first-half spell apart, Stoke were weak and passive but in Xherdan Shaqiri, and his set-piece delivery in particular, possessed one player to unnerve Liverpool. The Switzerland international produced an audacious flick to release Bardsley down the right and, though Joe Allen intercepted on that occasion, and many others, Shaqiri created Stoke’s equaliser with an inviting free-kick from their next attack. Three Stoke players were kept onside by Touré as Shaqiri’s cross swung over and Bojan Krkic ghosted in unmarked to send a glancing header beyond Simon Mignolet.\n\nRemarkably, it was Stoke’s first Premier League goal at Anfield and their first league goal here since 1983. It also confirmed that Liverpool’s weakness at defending set pieces had returned. Klopp’s team had gone two months without conceding from a set-piece until Mats Hummels’s equaliser for Dortmund last Thursday. Now it is two in two games and but for Shawcross’s poor header wide and Mignolet’s fine save from Geoff Cameron, both from Shaqiri free-kicks, it would have been more.\n\nNot that a Liverpool victory was ever in doubt from the moment Sturridge restored their lead. Credit for the second goal belonged to Ojo. The 18-year-old gave a glimpse of his potential by beating Shaqiri to the byline with skill and pace before floating a perfect cross towards the back post. Unmarked and with Stoke’s defence awol once again, Sturridge could not miss with a close-range header.\n\nHughes and Klopp were embroiled in an argument after Shaqiri won a free-kick for leaping over Moreno’s challenge but the Stoke manager’s ire should have been reserved for his players. They displayed no fight and little threat, save for a Peter Crouch goal correctly disallowed for offside, and the contest was over four minutes after the restart. Origi, Ojo’s replacement, continued his excellent week with a fine header beyond Haugaard from Milner’s cross from the right. Yet again, no Stoke player was near the scorer.\n\nRoberto Firmino and Origi both went close to extending Liverpool’s advantage before the latter delivered the fourth. The striker’s powerful effort appeared intended for Sturridge’s run across the six‑yard box. He just failed to connect, but the ball flew beyond the Stoke keeper and inside the far post. “He really wanted to shoot, it was not a cross,” Klopp said. “Even on the bench, I was not surprised.”\n\nMan of the match Divock Origi (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "10/04/2016", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35761, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo

What a strange game this was, and how bizarre Manchester United were on so many levels, but Mauricio Pochettino’s team found that three quick-fire punches towards the end added up to the knockout.\n\nThere had been a measure of deflation in Tottenham’s ranks beforehand when the leaders, Leicester, closed out their victory at Sunderland. Pochettino and his players had hoped that this would be the day when Leicester slipped but the excruciating wait goes on.\n\nIt was left to Tottenham to do their job, to keep up what pressure they could on the unlikely leaders and, in a game that took an age to come to the boil, they did precisely that. United had gone close to the opening goal through Anthony Martial in the 61st minute – their only chance of the afternoon – but the tide turned when Dele Alli ran on to Christian Eriksen’s cross from the left to sweep past David de Gea.\n\nWhat happened next advertised the ruthless streak that Pochettino has instilled at White Hart Lane, together with United’s emptiness and odd melancholy. Toby Alderweireld lost Marcos Rojo on an Érik Lamela free-kick to head the second and Lamela landed the final blow, when he pounced in front of Daley Blind to ram home Danny Rose’s low cross.\n\nThe three goals had come inside six minutes and it could have been a more chastening experience for United but De Gea tipped over a Harry Kane header, Kyle Walker hit the post and Mousa Dembélé went close in a one-on-one.\n\nPochettino could justifiably salute the character of his team but what of United? They had arrived late after their team bus was snarled up in traffic – the kick-off was delayed by 30 minutes – and they were in contention until Alli’s goal without ever imposing themselves.\n\nLouis van Gaal talked a great deal about Martial’s chance, which was entirely of his own making and ended with him shooting too close to Hugo Lloris but it was United’s only moment of note as an attacking force and, not for the first time, the performance left their supporters feeling flat.\n\nVan Gaal seems to think that it is acceptable merely to stay in a game – with the chance to nick a result – and, if not, take the draw. It remains a tough sell and this was a setback to the club’s hopes of scrambling to a top-four finish.\n\nUnited got nothing because they fell apart in defence. Timothy Fosu-Mensah had played well at right-back but when he was forced off through injury to be replaced by Matteo Darmian, United were vulnerable. Darmian conceded the free-kick for Alderweireld’s goal while Tottenham’s other two came up his flank.\n\nAt full time, the United assistant manager, Ryan Giggs, had to order the players to go over to applaud the travelling fans. Apart from Michael Carrick, they gave the task a wide berth. The half-heartedness spoke volumes.\n\nLeicester march on towards title after Jamie Vardy sinks Sunderland Read more\n\nThe travails of the United team bus had led to plenty of gags – many of them based on the notion that Van Gaal’s team have not turned up all season – and it all felt pretty strange. But the pre-match mood-killer from Tottenham’s point of view was the Leicester result.\n\nUnited were good for the first 20 minutes or so, giving Tottenham little room for manoeuvre with their pressing. And yet there was precious little incision from them and one moment summed things up. Morgan Schneiderlin took out two Tottenham players with a 24th-minute back-heel but Rojo ballooned the subsequent cross too deep.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 3-0 Manchester United: Premier League - as it happened Read more\n\nThe only glimmers of threat before the interval were crammed into a 90-second spell before the half-hour. They all came from Tottenham. De Gea flapped at a cross and, just when Kane scented an opportunity, he was snuffed out by the impressive Fosu-Mensah.\n\nTottenham recycled the move and Eriksen’s cross was made to measure for Lamela. Unmarked at the far post and only six yards from goal, Lamela headed wide. It was a horrible miss by the Argentinian. Walker then made a driving run and he jinked inside Rojo but Fosu-Mensah leapt into a tackle that stopped him.\n\nVan Gaal made a change at half-time, when he withdrew the ineffective centre-forward, Marcus Rashford, and sent on Ashley Young.\n\nTo general surprise, it was not for Young to play on the left and Martial to switch through the middle; rather a straight swap. Young, the winger and sometime full-back, who last scored almost a year ago, would lead the line.\n\nVan Gaal is nothing if not quirky. His lineup continued to feature Jesse Lingard, a winger, in the No10 role and Mata, a No10, on the right. When Fosu-Mensah was forced off for treatment in the 63rd minute, Young briefly dropped to right-back. At 3-0, Van Gaal brought on Memphis Depay for Mata, switched Young to the right and pushed Martial up front.\n\nTottenham worked De Gea on a number of occasions in the first part of the second half without extending him fully, and it was United who almost went ahead. Martial ripped past three defenders and the shooting chance opened up but Lloris stood tall.\n\nHow Tottenham then turned the screw. Alli was booked for diving in the 90th minute but it did not matter.

"report": "The harsh reality confronting Arsène Wenger is that his team’s self-destructive tendencies have flared up on too many occasions this season, leaving them desperately hanging on to Leicester City’s coattails instead of closing the gap on the leaders, and Arsenal’s chances of winning their first title since 2004 are all but over because of their maddening capacity to bewitch and infuriate their manager in equal measure. After dropping two more points against a demented West Ham United, they are relying on a Devon Loch collapse from Leicester in their final six matches.\n\nArsène Wenger admits Arsenal title hopes are fading after West Ham draw Read more\n\nGiven that Arsenal threatened to humiliate West Ham for much of the first half, it beggared belief that Wenger later found himself criticising his players for failing to play with enough urgency after Alexis Sánchez doubled their lead 10 minutes before half-time.\n\nUnable to deal with Andy Carroll’s aerial might, they allowed the West Ham striker to score his first hat-trick since August 2010 and although Laurent Koscielny salvaged a point, Arsenal were once again let down by their lack of focus and ruthlessness. Champions win these games.\n\nThere was warm applause at the end of a pulsating 3-3 draw that ultimately did little for either side. Arsenal will fall 13 points behind Leicester if Claudio Ranieri’s side beat Sunderland on Sunday afternoon, while West Ham needed a win to keep up with the Manchester clubs in the race for Champions League qualification. “This is a blow,” Slaven Bilic said.\n\nWest Ham’s manager was infuriated that Manuel Lanzini’s header was incorrectly ruled out for offside when the game was goalless but Bilic preferred to talk about the game instead of the officials. He praised West Ham for a spectacular performance, even though the afternoon began with such promise for Arsenal.\n\nThey have played with greater fluency since adding the flair of Alex Iwobi to their attack. For a player who only came into the starting XI last month, the 19-year-old Nigeria forward has shown a startling lack of fear in all of his appearances, creating the goals that allowed Arsenal to cruise into a 2-0 lead, carving West Ham’s back three apart with a couple of splendid assists for Mesut Özil and Sánchez.\n\nWest Ham used the 3-4-2-1 system that worked so effectively in their win over Tottenham last month but they looked vulnerable whenever their midfield was bypassed. Arsenal flowed forward on the break repeatedly and made the breakthrough when Iwobi found Özil in the area with an incisive pass. Played onside by Angelo Ogbonna, the German’s finish was cool.\n\nIwobi was outstanding in the first half and his assist for Sánchez’s goal was even better, a scoop over the West Ham defence for the Chile forward, who rolled the ball past Adrián.\n\nFor all Arsenal’s dominance, though, there had already been a hint of the defensive deficiencies that Carroll would exploit in an electric spell either side of half-time. Özil’s opener came four minutes after Lanzini’s header was incorrectly ruled out for offside, with replays suggesting that the Argentinian midfielder had been played onside by Héctor Bellerín. West Ham would later have another goal chalked off, although they could not complain when Dimitri Payet’s goal was chalked off for Carroll’s blatant foul on Koscielny.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Laurent Koscielny celebrates scoring Arsenal’s equaliser in the 3-3 draw at West Ham United. Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images\n\nOne of the more impressive features of this West Ham side has been their ability to regain their composure in difficult moments, however, and they demonstrated by their powers of recovery by hauling themselves level shortly before half-time.\n\nThey had barely threatened before Carroll attacked Aaron Cresswell’s cross from the left brilliantly, thudding a header low to David Ospina’s left, and the roof nearly flew off Upton Park when the striker equalised in stoppage time. Mark Noble chipped a cross in from the right and although Carroll’s first effort was blocked, he adjusted superbly to hook an acrobatic volley past Ospina.\n\nCarroll, starting for the first time in the league since 12 December, was in the side after Diafra Sakho was omitted from the squad altogether. Bilic claimed that Sakho was carrying a minor injury.\n\nWest Ham 3-3 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHowever Carroll would never have had the chance to torment Arsenal if he had been punished more severely for a wild challenge on Koscielny. Arsenal also seethed when he appeared to catch Gabriel Paulista with an elbow.\n\nThe referee, Craig Pawson, settled for giving a yellow card for the tackle on Koscielny and Carroll completed his hat-trick when he met Michail Antonio’s cross from the right with an unstoppable header at the far post in the 52nd minute.\n\nWest Ham were more solid when Bilic switched to a back four at half-time, taking off James Tomkins and moving Antonio to right-back, but they could not hold on. Although Lanzini denied Nacho Monreal with a goalline clearance, Koscielny crashed the ball high past Adrián after Danny Welbeck miscontrolled Özil’s cross in the 70th minute.\n\nBoth sides had chances to win it. If this was the end of their faltering title hopes, at least Arsenal will never forget their final visit to Upton Park."}, {"date": "09/04/2016", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 31057,

was accompanied by the cold comfort of defeat for their rivals Norwich City at Crystal Palace.\n\nBournemouth’s deserved victory, secured by goals from Steve Cook and Joshua King, took them to 41 points and their own safety. But Villa’s long membership of the top flight, stretching back to 1987, will be over on Sunday should Sunderland, who host Norwich next week, beat Leicester City. But it is more a case of timing rather than plausibility anyway.\n\nThere is a strong sense at Villa Park that things will get worse before they get better. Supporters booed the names of their own players when the teams were read out before kick-off – except for Jordan Lyden, the academy graduate making his full Premier League debut – and again at half-time after Villa conceded the opening goal with the penultimate kick of the half.\n\nBournemouth have epitomised what a strong team bond allied to purposeful management can bring even for a lesser group of players. In their first season among the elite, Eddie Howe’s players, having lost to Villa on the opening day of term, have long since staved off any realistic threat of relegation, despite losing their last two games.\n\nEric Black, Villa’s third manager of the season, has urged the players to start giving something back to the 31,000 supporters who keep turning up for home games. The caretaker was not critical of their efforts but pinpointed a deficiency in quality at both ends.\n\n“We have to be professional to the end,” Black said. “We’ve got some difficult games left against some of the best teams in the world. We have to be professional and I’ll have to constantly demand that. It’s not a great state of affairs and there’s a lot of disappointment in the dressing room. But we have to go again Monday morning and get something back into this wonderful club.”\n\nCrystal Palace’s Jason Puncheon takes his side closer to safety against Norwich Read more\n\nNeither did Black expect supporters to lay off their criticism. “I can fully understand them,” he said. “We’ve won 18 or 19 games at home out of 80, that’s four and a half games a season, so that’s not going to get the fans jumping up and down with confidence. Fans have every right to voice their feelings and I must admit if I was one of them, I don’t think I’d be jumping up and down. I think the time has come for the club to give something back to the fans now.\n\n“This club will I’m sure one day come back but it’s going to be a mighty challenge. I went down with Birmingham City and we came straight back up but my goodness it is huge turnaround.\n\n“It’s not going to be an overnight fix. There’s a lot of hard work to be done but we’ve got to give the fans something to get excited about.”\n\nVilla set up cautiously, which was understandable after conceding 15 goals in their previous four home games. Kieran Richardson, one of five changes from last week’s 4-0 humbling by Chelsea, blasted a shot over from the edge of the area after Idrissa Gueye ran on to Jordan Ayew’s ball wide but Villa were edgy in possession, aware that the home crowd would not take much to turn on them.\n\nSure enough, Villa were jeered off at the interval after conceding two minutes into stoppage time. Simon Francis played a short corner to Matt Ritchie and ran on to the backheel to the byline whence he pulled the ball back for his fellow defender Steve Cook to replicate the kind of finish Jamie Vardy mustered for England against Germany recently with a flick of his right heel behind the left.\n\nVilla’s demoralised players were taunted with the accusation “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” as they left the field. Lyden was withdrawn from further trauma at the interval and replaced by Rudy Gestede, who had scored the winner at the Vitality Stadium back in August, as Black resorted to 4-4-2. The Benin target man was one of 12 summer signings made in a £52m attempt to replace the departing talent of Fabian Delph, Christian Benteke, Ron Vlaar and Tom Cleverley, a quartet who had helped Tim Sherwood lead the team to safety and an FA Cup final. But, like so many of the newcomers, Gestede has flitted in and out as Sherwood then Rémi Garde and now Black have attempted to put together a jigsaw that makes a coherent picture.\n\nGomes shines as José Holebas earns point for Watford against Everton Read more\n\nVilla’s latest defeat was in effect sealed 16 minutes from time, when King capitalised on Ciaran Clark’s poor touch and dinked the ball over Brad Guzan. Ayew latched on to Gueye’s pass five minutes from time to score for Villa but Bournemouth were already celebrating. A good day for the visitors was made better when Callum Wilson returned from seven months out with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament injury. “That was a big moment for everyone connected with the football club,” Howe said. “Callum’s been such a pivotal figure for us.”\n\n“We’re Premier League,” sang the travelling fans.

The left-footed finish was curled deliciously inside John Ruddy’s far post, with the subsequent eruption of joy among those in the Holmesdale end behind the goal virtually sucking the match-winner into the crowd. This was his first goal of a strangely anaemic season, and one that was celebrated with gusto.\n\n“Punch carries this football club in his heart,” said Pardew of a player who grew up a stone’s throw from the arena. “Players are professional and do their jobs, but they don’t all have that emotional tie with a particular club. Jason was born here. His family are all from here, and were probably all in the stands today. He was feeling the pain of this run. His return from injury recently has been a huge lift for us, with his personality and leadership. He represents everything that’s right about a black player coming from this area and going on to play for his club. The way he conducts himself around our younger pros, particularly those of ethnic origin … the inspiration he provides. It couldn’t be more fitting that he got the goal.”\n\nGomes shines as José Holebas earns point for Watford against Everton Read more\n\nThe reward was breathing space stretched to 10 points from Sunderland, and the knowledge that victory over Everton here on Wednesday could actually hoist Palace back to the relatively giddy heights of 12th place. Yet, for all that they conjured some fine late opportunities to stretch their lead – the substitute Wilfried Zaha in particular stretching the visitors, with Ruddy twice forced to block vicious efforts – it would be foolish to suggest they are playing like a mid-table side. This team were cramped by nerves too often, with Pardew admitting his players had been hindered by the occasion far more obviously than City.\n\n“I know how it affects you, I can see it in certain individuals,” he said. “They’re tense, they’re edgy. They play a little bit like that. Funnily enough, I thought Norwich were a bit more relaxed than us, but that’s a massive win. Maybe it will settle us down and allow us to play a bit more football.” This team had not basked in a league victory since winning 2-1 at Stoke on 19 December and had lost their previous six at Selhurst Park. A weight has been lifted from their shoulders.\n\nSwansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson sees off Chelsea to ease relegation worries Read more\n\nThe same cannot be said for Norwich. Alex Neil will watch Sunderland’s game against the leaders, Leicester, hopeful his side’s four-point cushion is not eroded before the Wearsiders’ visit to Carrow Road on Saturday. He described this as a “nonevent”, a contest as drab and jittery as the one his team won at West Bromwich Albion last month. He was even loth to bemoan the failure to award a first-half penalty when Damien Delaney barged Matt Jarvis off the ball and the referee gave the visitors a corner. Pardew described that as “a robust challenge”. Jarvis was still protesting as the players departed the pitch at the interval.\n\nThe loss of Timm Klose to a knee injury darkened the mood further but, while there were late free-kicks and corners pumped into the Palace penalty area with Wayne Hennessey atoning in part for some early indecision by pushing away Ryan Bennett’s poked volley, Norwich did not create enough against a team who had not kept a clean sheet in the league since 28 December. The FA Cup semi-finalists leant on their old guard with Scott Dann, Delaney and the captain, Mile Jedinak, finally strong-arming them over the finish line.\n\n“I said in the dressing room it was a day for the skipper: all bombs and guns and artillery, bullets in the trenches, and he deals with that situation really well,” added Pardew. “This win was everything for us.”"}, {"date": "09/04/2016",

Newcastle intend to fight for survival, their days in the Premier League are numbered. They have six matches left to do far better than this but do not seem to have any real clue how. The only positive they could take here, apart from a fine goal by Andros Townsend after Shane Long, Graziano Pellè and Victor Wanyama had scored for Southampton, is that four of their remaining games are at home.\n\nCrystal Palace’s Jason Puncheon takes his side closer to safety against Norwich Read more\n\nOn the road they are about as useful as a lazy bunch of truckers, this result meaning their haul from 17 away matches this season stays at seven points. Rafael Benítez had called on his team to play with the boldness that they showed in the second half of last week’s defeat at Carrow Road – as opposed to the fretfulness of the first half – and he compiled his lineup accordingly, with Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ayoze Pérez deployed up front from the start.\n\nHow Benítez would like to have been able to change Newcastle’s defence, too, but he felt obliged to stick with a ramshackle back four, with Vurnon Anita remaining at left-back because Paul Dummett was only fit enough for the bench following injury. Southampton read the visitors’ away record, and perhaps their teamsheet, as an invitation to attack and did so with glee.\n\nKarl Darlow saved a close-range header from Pellè in the second minute but two minutes later the goalkeeper was beaten by Long after being left to fend for himself again, the defence’s attempt to disrupt a one-two between Long and Pellè in the buildup having consisted of little more than a bemused expression on Steven Taylor’s face.\n\nNewcastle briefly raised their chins, and José Fonte had to make a strong block to turn away a shot by Pérez in the sixth minute. The visitors did not shoot again until the second half.\n\nJonjo Shelvey, notionally his team’s playmaker, put Taylor in trouble with a slack pass in the 12th minute, and Taylor, in turn, underhit a backpass to Darlow. The goalkeeper, at least, was sharp and hurtled out of his box to clear just before Long pounced again.\n\nDusan Tadic narrowly missed the far post with a curling free-kick in the 21st minute, by which time Benítez looked exhausted from all his hollering and gesticulating. The Spaniard has gained one point from four matches in charge and for a manager who craves control, the disjointedness of his team, and an attitude from some players that looked like fecklessness, must seem a cruel kind of torment. Travelling supporters resorted to gallows humour before even half an hour had elapsed, chanting “we’re going down” with mock triumphalism. The most powerful barrier between Southampton and more goals, at this stage, was a creeping tendency to showboat. Long and Tadic both fired off shots from over 30 yards while well-placed team-mates awaited through-balls.\n\nAston Villa’s relegation all-but confirmed by Bournemouth’s win Read more\n\nBut in the 38th minute the hosts got the goal they obviously sensed would come, and again the feebleness of Newcastle’s resistance was striking. Bad luck compounded the visitors’ disjointedness, as Daryl Janmaat slipped while trying to intercept a pass by Wanyama. The Dutchman hurt his groin in the fall and had to be replaced, but only after Tadic had helped the ball on to Long, whose gauche first touch turned into a pass to Pellè, who drove the ball into the bottom corner of the net.\n\nTaylor’s performance demanded a half-time substitution, though Benítez, showing exemplary defensive qualities, said later he made the change because Taylor was feeling “stiff”. The manager also said he told his players at half-time their display had been unacceptably limp.\n\nNewcastle perked up in the second period and it was 10 whole minutes before they fell further behind. Sadio Mané delivered a ball into the box and after one shot was blocked, the rebound came to Wanyama, who swept it into the net to make it 3-0.\n\nBenítez must bear some of the blame for his team’s ineffectiveness. These players, for now at least, are patently incapable of intricacy so there seemed little point in them trying to piece together cunning moves, yet that is what they persisted in doing, rather than the more direct approach that worked in the second half at Carrow Road. Deprived of service, Mitrovic spent watched most of the match in useless dismay.\n\nIn the 65th minute, Townsend scored with a fine solo goal, skedaddling in-field from the right before walloping the ball into the top corner from 20 yards. Too little, too late: a sentiment Benítez might recognise as he contemplates what to do in the time given to him at Newcastle."}, {"date": "09/04/2016", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance":

Chelsea manager was not down to the announcement that Antonio Conte will be in charge at Stamford Bridge next season.\n\nSwansea confirm talks with American investors over controlling stake Read more\n\nHiddink had not lost any of his 14 Premier League games since succeeding José Mourinho in December, but his side came unstuck here as Gylfi Sigurdsson’s 25th-minute volley took Swansea City City to 40 points, the usual mark for safety.\n\nChelsea announced this week that Conte will be taking over after leading Italy at Euro 2016 in France, but Hiddink said: “What we did in the second half was good. I don’t think they had it in mind to look to next season.”\n\nChelsea won 5-0 at Swansea last season on their way to the title, but there were only three survivors from the side that produced one of the real high points of Mourinho’s second spell in charge. Hiddink was without several first-team players because of injury or suspension, among them John Terry, Gary Cahill, Nemanja Matic, Willian and Diego Costa, but he sprang a surprise by preferring Asmir Begovic to Thibaut Courtois in goal.\n\n“He [Begovic] has done his job as a professional very well,” Hiddink said. He is 100% committed in every training session and that is why I rewarded him with the chance to play.\n\n“We created some chances in the first 20 minutes but we were sloppy in taking those options. The second half we were on the front foot but did not create many chances and it is a disappointing defeat.”\n\nThe Chelsea defence was an accident waiting to happen with Jefferson Montero tormenting them in the same fashion as he had on the opening day of the season in a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge.\n\nBegovic had to cling on to Montero’s deflected effort at the foot of a post before Matt Miazga carelessly conceded possession in the corner. Montero found Sigurdsson who forced a save from Begovic, but the defence was not to survive after Àngel Rangel failed to find the target from a promising position.\n\nManchester City on track for top four as Samir Nasri sees off West Brom Read more\n\nMiazga was at fault again as his poor header from Montero fell perfectly to Sigurdsson, who rifled home his ninth goal in 14 games to reward Swansea’s superiority.\n\nThis was Swansea’s third win in four games and their head coach, Francesco Guidolin, said: “I think we are safe now. We know it is not completely done, but now we can see a way forward and are not looking behind. It is an important moment for the club. This is a proud day for me and for the players. We need to finish the season well.”\n\nGuidolin took charge in January and he has won six of his 12 matches to stave off the threat of relegation. “That was the best performance since I took over,” he said. “The first half we were very good. I knew we could play this way, but as a new manager I had to get to know my players and today I saw my team play as I want – with intensity, quality and aggression.\n\n“We miss only one thing.

This was an even match between two teams struggling for form but more significant were the banners in the away end that read “Baines is one of us” and, quite simply, “Martínez Out”.\n\nSwansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson sees off Chelsea to ease relegation worries Read more\n\nLeighton Baines was the player who said Everton lacked chemistry after last weekend’s defeat to Manchester United and, while Martínez attempted to explain in midweek that the left-back’s comments were misinterpreted, on this evidence it is clear who the fans agree with.\n\nThe manner in which Everton conceded here will have added fuel to the growing frustration. This was no classic, but after James McCarthy put the away side in front in first-half injury time following a bad error from Miguel Britos, getting in to half-time ahead should have been a formality for Martínez’s men.\n\nIn the end, there was almost a sense of resignation when José Holebas headed in just 38 seconds later and, following a series of impressive saves from Heurelho Gomes, Everton were denied a first victory since they beat Aston Villa in early March.\n\n“The fans are allowed to express their views and once the game started the support was magnificent,” said Martínez. “We felt that support and for me they are the best fans in world football. Every time we play we can rely on our support.\n\n“We were unfortunate to concede so close to half-time. What’s more disappointing is the nature of the goal, it’s a dead-ball situation, a header that bounces off the back of a player and in. That’s the nature of good fortune or bad fortune at times.”\n\nAs it was, neither side had much chemistry during a fragmented match that provided two goals following defensive lapses. Watford had lost their previous four league matches and Everton three, yet both have an FA Cup semi-final – Watford against Crystal Palace and Everton against Manchester United or West Ham – this month to keep interest kindled.\n\nThirty-two years have passed since these teams met in the final of that competition and Everton supporters still have a banner from that afternoon, when they won 2-0 at Wembley. Here at Vicarage Road, “Sorry Elton, I guess that’s why they call us the Blues” was held up in the away end, among the demonstrations of discontent. Watford and Everton could yet meet in another FA Cup final next month but, to get there, both sides’ form will surely need to improve. John Stones, in particular, had a poor first half in front of Roy Hodgson and both goals were preventable.\n\nEverton, who will test Ross Barkley after the midfielder sustained a knock to his knee and Phil Jagielka who suffered a late hamstring problem, took the lead through McCarthy in first-half injury time. The midfielder capitalised on a poor piece of control from Britos at centre-half, muscling the defender off the ball before firing low and left-footed past Gomes.\n\nHowever, only seconds later Watford equalised. Stones, who had already shunted the ball straight out of play on three occasions, put Robles under pressure unnecessarily with a heavy backpass and the goalkeeper sliced it out for a corner. Ben Watson crossed to the far post, where Holebas, the Greece international full-back, headed back across goal and in following a deflection off Séamus Coleman.\n\nIn the 55th minute Gomes kept Watford level with a fine save to keep out Aaron Lennon’s low shot from 25 yards and the Watford goalkeeper was called upon late on when Everton were awarded a free-kick on the right-hand side. The substitute Kevin Mirallas hit a low shot but Gomes dived to keep it out and Romelu Lukaku’s follow-up hit the bar.\n\nQuique Sánchez Flores, the Watford manager, said: “It was a fair result. Everyone is talking about the FA Cup, but the players and staff have also to talk about the Premier League because we have six more matches and we have to prepare for these.”"}, {"date": "09/04/2016",

memorable but Manchester City did what they had to if they intend to hang on to fourth place, managing another win without expending so much energy as to blight their chances in Europe. They needed to come from behind to do so, and bring on their key players to help kill off a resilient West Bromwich Albion, but no one is fooling themselves at this stage that the Premier League is where City need to shine brightest.\n\nManchester City 2-1 West Brom: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“We are always looking up, not over our shoulder” Manuel Pellegrini said drily when asked it if was possible to catch Arsenal in third. “The win was the main thing today, and staying clear of injuries. Kun [Sergio Agüero] had a kick at the end but will not be a problem for Tuesday.”\n\nCity have a potentially season-defining meeting with PSG in the Champions League in midweek and Pellegrini made a conservative selection, restricting Kevin De Bruyne and Yaya Touré to the bench as they eased back after injuries and leaving out David Silva to rest an ankle problem. He still insists the plan is to take maximum Premier League points between now and the end of the season, and everyone at the club is aware of the danger of allowing Manchester United to sneak past them and leaving Pep Guardiola looking at Thursday night football when he takes over in the summer, though once again City’s defence was too easily breached as the visitors raced into a fifth-minute lead.\n\nFirst City gave the ball away on halfway, then failed to prevent James McClean’s overhit cross being rescued in leisurely fashion by Stéphane Sessègnon on the edge of the penalty area then, with Aleksandar Kolarov not quick enough to close down the shot, Joe Hart was comprehensively beaten at his near post. It took City only a dozen or so more minutes to level, Agüero marking his 200th appearance for the club with a goal from the penalty spot after Sessègnon was adjudged to have tripped Kolarov, though that was hardly the point. City will not progress very much further in Europe if they keep putting themselves under unnecessary handicaps, while Hart knows the new manager is already considering bringing in a new goalkeeper.\n\nCity’s defensive cohesion was so ramshackle at times that at one point just before the interval Agüero came all the way back to show there was nothing particularly difficult about bringing the ball safely and securely upfield, earning a knowing round of applause from the home fans in the process. Agüero showed some neat touches up front too, which was only to be expected. Unfortunately, they only served to point up the rather more leaden contributions of his strike partner Wilfried Bony. The former Swansea player is having one of those spells where nothing will go right, and frustration from the crowd is increasingly evident, though most people would suffer in direct comparison to Agüero. Bony did not do too badly at the less glamorous aspects of his job, such as winning the ball in the air and holding it up in forward positions. It was not his fault if Samir Nasri and Jesús Navas did not manage to do much with the resulting opportunities.\n\nNewcastle and Rafael Benítez look lost against showboating Southampton Read more\n\nSessègnon had much more idea of what to do with the ball in wide areas, as he showed when getting the better of Kolarov again at the start of the second half to send over a cross. Albion had lost some of their attacking edge when Salomón Rondón pulled up midway through the first half but they still kept trying. Appeals for a penalty when Sandro backed into Eliaquim Mangala from a Sessègnon cross were predictably and probably correctly turned down. Tony Pulis did a little war dance of disappointment in his technical area but the Albion manager would have been properly incandescent had such a decision been awarded against his own side. “I thought it was a penalty,” Pulis said. “And I think all the teams trying to get into the Champions League positions will be disappointed with the decision as well.”\n\nCity kept trying too, with Agüero bringing a save from Ben Foster just before the hour, though exactly on the hour Pellegrini decided the game needed rescuing from tedium and sent on Touré and De Bruyne. The effect was not quite immediate: City had to wait five more minutes before taking the lead, though as a consequence of the substitutions West Brom quickly found themselves pinned back. The game stopped being a shapeless midfield contest and turned into a battle of wits between slicker City passing and defenders suddenly obliged to up their concentration. De Bruyne made the breakthrough on the right, supplying Navas for a cross that led to an Agüero shot being blocked before Nasri tucked away the loose ball.\n\nAlbion were not done. Saido Berahino had a couple of chances to beat Hart including one that looked suspiciously offside, yet failed to test the goalkeeper on either occasion. Perhaps the best chance of all was 10 minutes from time when Craig Dawson’s low cross went right across the face of goal with Berahino inches from a touch to tap in at the far post. Agüero tested Foster at the other end and saw the visiting goalkeeper save with his legs, before the striker picked out Nasri with a deft pass only to see the winger’s attempted curler fly just wide.\n\nNasri, making his first start in over six months, was quite effective in the closing stages, though it was never a comfortable win. City hearts were in their mouths when McClean fired narrowly wide at a stoppage-time corner but the points were safely gathered in the end.

He was still checking the game had concluded with the fourth official as his team fractured into little groups, small huddles of manic celebration. Even when he was properly sure, there was no dramatic punch of the air, no clenched fist flung towards the chairman up in the stands. The Italian was the picture of calm. Even he looks as if all this is starting to feel routine.\n\nLeicester City’s lead at the top now gapes at seven points with six matches to play, their latest narrow victory a dagger to the hearts of the chasing pack. To put that into context, a year ago to the day they had languished the same number of points adrift of safety at the foot. This team may go through periods of games where they look defensively ragged, a muddle of bodies inside their own penalty area heaving to repel their opponents’ threat and Southampton, like so many teams before them, always felt they were one pinpoint cross or clever creative interchange from hauling themselves level. But that is the deception offered up by Ranieri’s collective. Five of their last six games have now been claimed with a solitary goal.\n\nThey keep emerging unscathed, whether through the rugged defiance of those across their back-line or the feverish energy and work rate of N’Golo Kanté or Danny Drinkwater in central midfield. When Southampton threatened most coherently, particularly in a passage of play around the half-hour mark, they found a way to cling on, leaning on Kasper Schmeichel’s agility or Danny Simpson’s ability to recover. Ronald Koeman did suggest post-match, albeit with the caveat that “they will not have won it thanks to the referees”, that they have also taken on that happy good fortune of winners. Michael Oliver might have deemed Simpson’s block on Sadio Mané’s attempt as handball, the ball striking the right elbow locked to the full-back’s side, or penalised Robert Huth for a similar offence on Charlie Austin’s cross late on. But, while both perceived offences were debatable, even luck is rolling with Ranieri.\n\nWhat is more damning is that opponents have still not found a way of bypassing them. Southampton, like Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Watford and Norwich immediately before them, flung in their crosses and winced at the near misses, pushing for parity and convincing themselves they were the better team, but found no reward. They had rather run out of ideas before the end, when Leicester carried the greater threat on the counterattack and Fraser Forster was forced to push away José Fonte’s sliced clearance and paw out Simpson’s close-range attempt when a second goal seemed inevitable. That opportunity had come from a Drinkwater backheel and Jamie Vardy’s burst to the byline beyond Cédric Soares – a reminder of the creative quality this side possess.\n\nTheir winner came from an unlikely source. Wes Morgan’s last goal had come in a 3-0 win over Newcastle last May in that unfeasible late charge to Premier League safety. Yet, when an attacking free-kick from the flank broke down just before the interval, the centre-half remained upfield in hope as that irrepressible midfield reclaimed possession and spread the play out to Christian Fuchs on the left. The Austrian’s main threat up to then had been from long throws, but his centre was inviting, Jordy Clasie was caught slightly on his toes and Morgan thumped his header down and beyond Forster. The Jamaica international had returned from international duty with a head cold, which had made his participation here vaguely doubtful. He ended up as his side’s inspiration.\n\nHis principal involvement was in repelling Southampton, a side who had started with aspirations of making the top four, and he played his part as significantly as doing his day job. All Leicester’s defenders excelled when called upon: Schmeichel tipped over Fonte’s long-range attempt at full stretch, Huth and Fuchs hooked a succession of dangerous crosses away in the frantic second period, and then there was Simpson. He had initially been at fault for the chance enjoyed by Mané just after the half-hour, the Senegalese running on to Graziano Pellè’s delicious reverse pass inside the right-back and granted the freedom of the Leicester half.\n\nSchmeichel was poorly positioned this time, too advanced on the edge of his own penalty area and in retreat, with the invitation there for Mané to chip. Instead, he wriggled round the goalkeeper while Simpson sprinted round the outside desperately seeking to provide cover on the edge of the six-yard box. He deserved praise for trying to recover the situation, even if he did end up blocking the forward’s rather panicked shot with his elbow. Mané’s appeal for a penalty was rather choked in disappointment, and possibly guilt at the sight of an unmarked Victor Wanyama to his right seeking answers for the non-arrival of a pass. The Kenyan would have had a tap-in.\n\nAs it was, the rat-a-tat of late Leicester opportunities made the result feel far more justified than the scoreline might have done at the interval. Four more wins from their remaining six games, starting at relegation-haunted Sunderland on Sunday, and the title will be theirs whatever the other distant contenders can muster. “I hope they will win it,” said Koeman. “They deserve to win the title. And, if they continue with a little bit of luck with referees’ decisions, then for sure they will win it. But I don’t say they win the title thanks to the referees. They will win it, if they do, because they’ve had a fantastic season.”\n\nRanieri would not admit it but the glorious finale feels close.\n\nMan of the match Wes Morgan (Leicester)"}, {"date":

youth and zest of Marcus Rashford, Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Anthony Martial, who combined for the last of these three to score a sweet winner that ensures United maintain pressure on Manchester City in the race for the final Champions League berth.\n\nAfter West Ham United drew on Saturday Louis van Gaal’s side took full advantage to overtake them into fifth place with seven matches remaining.\n\nAs the manager said: “I have said in the dressing room after the match that it was very important to win, otherwise the victory against City [in the derby] was worthless. We keep in touch, one point behind. We keep in touch with Arsenal, five points behind. We have to play Tottenham [on Sunday], not an easy match but normally we are playing very well against the top teams. If we continue like that I am very happy.”\n\nManchester United 1-0 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nVan Gaal was relieved as he detected fatigue following the international break, having to remove Marcos Rojo for Fosu-Mensah at half-time due to “jet lag”, and Blind towards the end to give him a breather.\n\n“It was more or less a stolen victory. We didn’t play so well, it looked like we were not fresh,” he said. “Daley Blind has played [virtually] every match and he is at the end of his strengths. I shall give him two days off.”\n\nUnited were fair value for the win, though they hardly convinced that they will romp home to the maximum 21 points and closing total of 75 that would surely secure the top-four finish they crave.\n\nThe afternoon began with the South Stand being renamed after Sir Bobby Charlton and the injured Wayne Rooney bashfully waving a red flag along with the rest of the support to greet this tribute to one of the club’s legends.\n\nThe on-field action commenced after the same XI that won the Mancunian derby strode out for United. It meant that day’s hero, Rashford, continuing as the No9, with Juan Mata and Martial either side of Jesse Lingard in the attacking trident behind.\n\nEverton had begun by swarming over United. In this period Gerard Deulofeu was their most potent option. Twice the Spaniard dismantled the home defence by skating beyond Rojo but each time there was no reward.\n\nRoberto Martínez dropped Muhamed Besic and Ramiro Funes Mori from the side that was beaten 2-0 by Arsenal at Goodison Park a fortnight ago, instead selecting John Stones and Deulofeu. Given the array of talent – led by Romelu Lukaku, Ross Barkley, Stones, Seamus Coleman and Phil Jagielka – available to Martínez, it seemed a poor return for his team to arrive on 38 points from 29 outings.\n\nYet as the opening half wore on and United pinned Everton back the clue to this low yield was in the lack of control offered by a midfield manned by Barkley, James McCarthy and Tom Cleverley.\n\nInstead Morgan Schneiderlin and Michael Carrick provided the platform on which Martial, Lingard, Mata and Rashford buzzed in and around the visitors’ area and when the referee, Andre Marriner, blew for the break Everton were fortunate still to be level.\n\nA stark fact, though, was that this was the 10th league game of 15 here that arrived at the interval goalless. As United began the second half hoping to break the deadlock and in search of their 1,000th Premier League goal in this stadium, Fosu-Mensah replaced Rojo and he popped up early on to deliver a cross.\n\nWhen United finally made the breakthrough the Dutchman was pivotal. Fosu-Mensah had swapped with Matteo Darmian, who moved into Rojo’s former role as the 18-year-old operated at right-back. It was from here that Fosu-Mensah again roved forward as Mata trapped the ball neatly and passed inside to Rashford. The striker’s back-heel into Fosu-Mensah was as clever as the cross that found Martial at the far post and he tapped home for a 13th goal of the season.\n\nJagielka came close to puncturing Old Trafford’s joy instantly and relief. The visiting captain rose highest from a corner to beat David de Gea but the bar saved United.\n\nAs the end neared Fosu-Mensah did the same when Everton pressed hard, superbly turning away a dangerous Coleman cross and United hung on.\n\nAt the final whistle the visitors were booed off by their fans, a response Martínez suggested was understood by the team. “You can hear our boos in the dressing room,” he said. “The frustration is we all see the quality we have.”\n\nNext Sunday Van Gal’s men hope to deflate Spurs’ title challenge and keep up their own bid to qualify for the European Cup.

It took 63 days for Alexandre Pato to make his first Chelsea appearance, but the Brazilian needed only 22 minutes to break his duck as the visitors finished with three debutants.\n\nMatt Miazga, a January acquisition from New York Red Bulls, also made his bow, starting at centre-half, while Jake Clarke-Salter was given 15 minutes. Ruben Loftus-Cheek impressed for 90 minutes in an attacking midfield role, providing proof that despite a season to forget, Chelsea have something to look forward to in the near future.\n\nTottenham’s Harry Kane earns draw at Liverpool but title dream fades Read more\n\nFor Villa, the horizon is far more bleak. There was a new man in charge – albeit temporarily – in Eric Black, but it was the same pitiful story. Only Jordan Ayew showed any fight and it said much that the disgruntled home fans were barely surprised to witness another embarrassing defensive surrender. Villa have long been down, but their relegation could be confirmed as early as next week depending on the results of Norwich and Crystal Palace.\n\nIt is hard not to feel sorry for the supporters who are still turning up to witness a weekly horror show from a team containing more Villains than Villans. “Proud history. What future?” read several hundred pieces of paper displayed on the Holte End before kick-off. A scrawled bedsheet behind the opposite goal went further: “No fight, no pride, no effort, no hope”.\n\n“It’s not pleasant,” Black said of the rancourous atmosphere. “I’m only here a couple of months but it’s not been overly enjoyable. However, I can fully understand it.”\n\nTheir quest between now and May must solely be to restore some pride but Black said: “A massive turnaround is required at the club and people need to understand it’s going to take time.”\n\nMartin Olsson snatches breathless victory for Norwich over Newcastle Read more\n\nSuch has been the absence of quality here this season that when Villa strung a few passes together after 20 minutes shouts of “Olé” went up from all four stands. That was as good as things got. After the move broke down, to a predictable chorus of sarcastic boos, Cesc Fàbregas pitched forward to Pedro, who was marginally offside before lofting the ball over Brad Guzan. His tasty finish was correctly scratched out.\n\nChelsea did not have to wait much longer for the opener, but first came the arrival of Pato, who replaced Loïc Rémy after 23 minutes due to a groin and tendon injury.\n\nGuus Hiddink said there was a temptation to throw Pato in a few weeks earlier “but he would have been killed”. The Brazilian’s impact when finally sprung was almost instant, starting the move for Loftus-Cheek’s first league goal. It was Mikel John Obi who displayed the samba-like dance moves, though, jigging past Carlos Sánchez and Ashley Westwood and then feeding Pedro, who found César Azpilicueta. The defender’s cross from the right was met by Loftus-Cheek, taking a deflection off Joleon Lescott en route.\n\nAyew did have a couple of chances to equalise denied by Thibaut Courtois but the result was, as Hiddink said, “over” when Pato was brainlessly hauled down in the penalty area by Aly Cissokho in first-half injury-time. Pato slotted the penalty to Guzan’s right.\n\nFifty-one seconds of the second half had elapsed when Pedro deepened Villa’s wound, finishing off a lovely move involving Pato and the half-time substitute, Oscar and Pedro scored his second when tapping in after Guzan parried an elementary save from Pato before the hour mark.\n\nThe four-goal gap allowed Hiddink to bring Clarke-Salter on for the final stages. “It’s good to see [young players] coming in,” the interim manager said. “I always like to bring in youngsters and we have the rest of the season to bring in guys more frequently.”\n\nGuzan was greeted by ironic cheers when he managed to smother a tame Branislav Ivanovic free-kick 11 minutes from the end, while Alan Hutton was shown a second yellow by Neil Swarbrick after a late tackle on Loftus-Cheek five minutes from time.\n\nBy that point Villa’s fans had found more entertainment in a paper plane contest from the aforementioned protest material.

It certainly made a change from “Wenger out” and veins bulging in foreheads, which has been the vibe at this stadium in recent matches.\n\nArsenal have not been this comfortable at home for some time, probably not since the 2-0 win against Bournemouth on 28 December and Arsène Wenger, the relentlessly under-fire manager, could take reassurance from a stroll.\n\nIt was impossible to believe that this was the same Watford who had won here in the FA Cup quarter-final three weeks previously. They barely contributed this time and it was left to Alex Iwobi, Arsenal’s 19-year-old attacking midfielder, to steal the show.\n\nIt felt fitting that as Arsenal remembered David Rocastle, who died 15 years ago this week, another academy product should step forward to impress. Iwobi created the opening goal for Alexis Sánchez while he scored the second himself and his performance was marked by fearlessness, mobility and cutting edge.\n\nWenger made the point that Iwobi, who came to Arsenal at the age of eight, was steeped in the club’s values – one of which was to give young players a chance. “Not many clubs can say that,” Wenger said, during a slightly haughty press conference.\n\nHe suggested that the principal difference between this performance from his team and some of those of late was their ruthlessness, which rather skated over other issues. “We had the same dominance in the cup tie against Watford but we could not score,” he said. “Recently, we haven’t made the maximum of our chances.”\n\nWenger also referenced the number of matches in different competitions that his team have had to play during what has been a disastrous run and it was easy to detect a measure of frustration in him. If only, Wenger might have said, Arsenal could have played a bit more like this from mid-January.\n\nWatford have offered the impression that they are preoccupied with the FA Cup – they play their semi-final against Crystal Palace on 24 April – and it is remarkable that since the memorable home win over Liverpool on 20 December, they have won just two Premier League matches.\n\nQuique Sánchez Flores’s team were second best and the die felt cast when they went behind early on. Iwobi picked out Sánchez with a ball in from the left and, having drifted in behind Nathan Aké, the Chilean extended Heurelho Gomes with a header before beating him on the rebound. Happily for Arsenal, Sánchez was in the mood.\n\nArsenal’s control of the first-half was total and so the thought occurred that they would allow Watford back to 1-1. Not here. They got the second goal when Francis Coquelin released Sánchez with an incisive pass and he returned Iwobi’s earlier assist with a smart cut-back. Iwobi arrived to slam a low, first-time shot past Gomes.\n\nThe Emirates crowd saluted the late, great Rocastle with applause in the seventh minute and there were other uplifting snap-shots, not least Héctor Bellerín’s Zidane-style 360 spin, which got him away from two Watford players. The Arsenal fans loved it when Mesut Özil jogged over to take a corner in front of the away enclosure, who booed him, as they were unhappy at what they perceived to have been a dive from him moments earlier. Özil responded by applauding them.\n\nArsenal might have been further in front by half-time. Danny Welbeck scuffed one chance and was narrowly off-target with another, while Iwobi worked Gomes with a wonderful curling effort and Sánchez did likewise with a free-kick.\n\nQuique Sánchez Flores gestured at his substitute’s bench as soon as Sánchez had burst up the right to lay on the second and he hooked Étienne Capoue. The Frenchman, who had played at left midfield, jogged straight off down the tunnel; it is never anything but a humiliation to be withdrawn in the first half. Flores, who took off Odion Ighalo at half-time because he said the striker was tired after international duty with Nigeria, accepted responsibility for getting things wrong.\n\nBellerín scored the third straight after the interval with a shot that deflected off Ben Watson and, thereafter, Arsenal pressed cruise control. Iwobi hit the crossbar in the 50th minute and perhaps the stand-out memory of the second half was that of Allan Nyom scything through Özil, having been rattled by the Arsenal playmaker’s flicks and tricks. Nyom, who was booked, thought that Özil was taking the mickey.\n\nFor Watford, Sebastian Prödl had a header cleared off the line by Nacho Monreal and Troy Deeney was denied by an acrobatic save from David Ospina, but Arsenal had the last word when one substitute, Joel Campbell, beat Nyom and crossed for another, Theo Walcott, to tap home."}, {"date": "02/04/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium",

been wrapped up long ago. A clinical performance inspired by the returning Kevin De Bruyne saw Manuel Pellegrini’s side end their long wait for a Premier League away victory and keep alive any faint title hopes they may still harbour.\n\nCity’s decline since De Bruyne tore ligaments in his knee and ankle in the Capital One Cup semi-final victory over Everton in January has been stark. Trailing the leaders, Leicester, by three points and in second place, they have picked up seven points from the seven matches the Belgium international missed to reduce significantly the chances of sending Pellegrini off into the sunset with another championship winners’ medal.\n\n“Kevin demonstrated how good a player he is,” City’s manager said in his typically understated manner.\n\nThe damning statistic before this match was that City were unbeaten in 16 matches against clubs in the bottom half of the table so it was hardly surprising to see them race into a 3-0 lead inside 20 minutes thanks to goals from Fernando, De Bruyne and Sergio Agüero against a side they had thrashed 5-1 in October.\n\nBut after a run of four defeats in six matches, it was the manner Bournemouth were swatted aside here that made an impression as City prepare for Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg against Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nDeployed almost up alongside Agüero in a central attacking role, De Bruyne was into the action from the start as his clever backheel almost played in David Silva. From the resulting corner, Bournemouth should have cleared, but it still took an expert piece of readjustment from Fernando to hook the ball into the net.\n\nThe hosts, who were without striker Benik Afobe due to a hamstring injury, had created the opening chance of the game two minutes earlier only for Josh King to screw horribly wide when played through by Lewis Grabban. It was a moment they would live to regret.\n\nCity’s second goal was everything that a combined £116m in transfer fees should buy you. Agüero’s cunning lob played Silva in behind the defence and his ball to pick out the onrushing De Bruyne to lash home was simply sublime.\n\nThe Belgian – signed for a cool £54m last August – should probably have doubled his tally shortly afterwards but for once his radar was off target and the ball sailed over the bar.\n\nIt hardly mattered as Agüero effectively sealed the points in the 19th minute when he rose highest to nod home from Jesús Navas’s cross. A Fernandinho rocket from 25 yards that struck the woodwork spared Bournemouth more misery in a horribly one-sided first half.\n\n“We played very well especially the first 45 minutes where we pressed high and scored three beautiful goals,” said Pellegrini.\n\n“That gives you a lot of trust, as a team, and after that as individual players, when they have the performance they did. That’s the way I like to see this team play, that’s the style I like us to play the game.\n\n“The most important thing was that we were focused just on this game, that’s the best way to prepare for the next game, which is a very important one in the Champions League.”\n\nEven with games against Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United to come, Bournemouth should have no worries about preserving their Premier League status. But while recognising that his side had been beaten by a superior team, Eddie Howe admitted they must recover quickly from a second successive loss.\n\n“From my perspective it doesn’t matter what stage of the season you want to win every game, you owe it to everyone at the club,” he said.\n\n“I still don’t think we’re safe. I’ve told my players that. We’ve got work to do. We’ve played Tottenham and Man City and they’ve been too good for us.”\n\nSo disappointed was Howe by his side’s performance in the first half that the players were sent out for the second half five minutes early. Yet within 60 seconds of the restart normal service was resumed as Agüero was unlucky to see his effort saved by Artur Boruc. De Bruyne then slammed a shot just past the post as City continued to pour forward.\n\nHe was given a standing ovation when replaced by Aleksandar Kolarov soon after, with Samir Nasri also making his first appearance since the win over Bournemouth back in October.\n\nBoth spurned chances to seal this victory late on before Kolarov finally found the net in injury time, even if by that stage the match had been over as a contest for some time."}, {"date": "02/04/2016", "arena": "Carrow Road", "attendance": 27137, "home_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "John Ruddy",

His first goal of the season could not have been struck more crisply, nor at a better time – right at the end of an incredibly dramatic contest that was full of action and laden with consequences for both teams. The left-back’s stoppage-time winner triggered an eruption of joy all over Carrow Road. Except in the away end and dugout, where Newcastle fans and staff were again confronted by their worst fears.\n\nWhile Norwich City emerged with renewed confidence in their ability to stay in the Premier League, Newcastle United and Rafael Benítez find themselves in a deeper hole. This defeat came on a day when all four teams directly above them picked up points, leaving the north-east club six points from the team in 17th place – Norwich. What makes that position all the harder for them to bear is the knowledge that they could have closed the gap on Alex Neil’s side if not for familiar sloppiness.\n\nPerhaps Benítez must bear some blame too. He chose to leave Aleksandar Mitrovic on the bench and give Papiss Cissé a first Premier League start since December. The move backfired, as the Senegalese was guilty of an egregious miss before Mitrovic was introduced just after the hour and helped transform Newcastle so much that for a while they looked the more likely victors. Mitrovic equalised twice, the second time from a contentious penalty in the 84th minute. Yet Newcastle still contrived to lose away for the eighth time in a row. All roads lead to the Championship with form like that.\n\nBoth managers had been forced to make alterations to the lineups here, partly by injuries and partly by alarming performances. But Norwich knew that Newcastle needed the win more urgently and began as if daring the visitors to come at them full tilt. But Benítez, aware of how scatty this team can be, had apparently been preaching composure and Newcastle seemed more intent on respecting their team shape than unhinging their opponents. It is one thing being patient but if everyone is waiting for someone else to do something, then nothing gets done. The only Newcastle player that regularly took initiatives in the first half was Andros Townsend but he lacked the accuracy to make good on bold intentions. The Norwich goalkeeper, John Ruddy, did not have to dirty his gloves in the first period.\n\nOnce Norwich realised their opponents did not carry much threat, they put down their shields and brandished their arms. Karl Darlow, the inexperienced goalkeeper whom the home crowd attempted to spook with taunts throughout the first half, kept them at bay with a fine save from a close-range shot by Dieumerci Mbokani in the 33rd minute. As half-time approached Norwich must have been regretting their failure to convert pressure into a lead, but that concern vanished just before the break. After Cheik Tioté committed his umpteenth needless foul, Robbie Brady delivered an in-swinging free-kick and Timm Klose, having shaken off a negligent marker, nodded the ball into net from eight yards.\n\nBenítez had spent most of the first half gesticulating to his players from the sidelines. It was not obvious that they knew the meaning of their manager’s signals. At half-time he had a chance to deliver his message more clearly, and also to replace Tioté, a red card waiting to happen, with Ayoze Pérez. Five minutes after the resumption, the manager’s feelings were plain for everyone to see: he, like Newcastle’s players and fans, was aghast when Cissé shanked the ball wide from five yards after John Ruddy spilled a long shot by Townsend.\n\nBut Newcastle, in general, were looking more dangerous. Townsend, in particular, raised his performance and began tearing holes in the home defence with jagged runs. On the hour, Benítez withdrew the makeshift left-back Vurnon Anita and threw on Mitrovic. The Serb’s aerial strength troubled the hosts. It was no surprise when, in the 71st minute, he headed a cross by Townsend into the net. Now the momentum seemed to be with the visitors. But, as so often, Newcastle had flattered to deceive: within three minutes they were behind again.\n\nPanicky defending prevented Newcastle from making a proper clearance after a renewed Norwich attack, and Mbokani collected the ball wide on the left before walloping a shot past Darlow and high into the net.\n\nThe game hurtled from one end to the other. Newcastle catapulted crosses towards Mitrovic. But Norwich appeared set to hold on – until four minutes from time, when the ball hit Gary O’Neill’s arm as Pérez tried to flip it past him, and the referee, Mike Dean, awarded a penalty. Mitrovic kept cool and converted.\n\nNorwich seemed to be clinging on for just a point as Newcastle stormed forward for the win. Cissé almost atoned for his earlier miss by redirecting a Mitrovic header towards goal, but Ruddy foiled him with a full-length save. Then Olsson joined in one last Norwich attack, firing a superb shot into the net and Newcastle into deep trouble."}, {"date": "02/04/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27649, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jakob Haugaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philipp Wollscheid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Gianelli Imbula", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [13], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [53], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed El Ouriachi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Leroy Fer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Paloschi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Francesco Guidolin was taking nothing for granted but Swansea took another step towards Premier League safety as they came back from two goals down to draw here. The visitors’ head coach said: “I asked after our match about Sunderland and saw their result. The season is not finished – for us or any of the teams.”\n\nThe Europe-chasing Potters looked destined for a fifth win in seven games after Ibrahim Afellay, on his 30th birthday, and Bojan Krkic had put them 2-0 up with goals in the 13th and 53rd minutes respectively. But Jakob Haugaard – in the Stoke goal as a replacement for the injured Jack Butland – was then beaten twice on his Premier League debut, by Gylfi Sigurdsson’s strike in the 68th minute and then the substitute Alberto Paloschi’s deflected shot 11 minutes later.\n\nThe result means 15th-placed Swansea remain 10 points clear of the relegation zone, while Stoke stay eighth in the table, to the frustration of Mark Hughes. “I thought we were good value at 2-0 and quite comfortable in the game,” the Stoke manager said. “The key thing was who was going to score the next goal, and obviously Swansea got it.”\n\nIt was the visitors who fashioned the contest’s first attempt on goal, with Bafétimbi Gomis’s strike deflecting narrowly wide in the eighth minute. There was then a nervy moment seconds later from Haugaard as he met the resulting corner with an unconvincing punch.\n\nStoke, however, soon took control and grabbed the lead when neither Federico Fernández nor Àngel Rangel did enough to stop Marko Arnautovic on the left, and he delivered a fine cross that Afellay, more or less unmarked, had little trouble converting with his head from close range.\n\nBojan then doubled Stoke’s lead shortly after the interval, the Spaniard collecting the ball from Glenn Whelan in the middle of the Swansea half, being allowed by the away defence to advance to the edge of the box and hitting a shot that Fabianski got a hand to and perhaps should have saved.\n\nHowever, the Welsh side pulled a goal back when Sigurdsson received Wayne Routledge’s cross, turned on the edge of the area and unleashed an effort that bamboozled Haugaard.\n\nThe introduction of Jefferson Montero, on just before Sigurdsson’s goal, had helped invigorate the visitors and soon another Swansea substitute, Paloschi, made a telling impact as he got away from Geoff Cameron and sent a deflected effort past Haugaard – though Hughes was unhappy that the goal stood. “We are disappointed with the decision on the second goal because there was a player in an offside position who made a movement towards the ball, meaning he was interfering with play, so it shouldn’t have been given.”\n\nStoke desperately sought to regain the lead in the last few minutes but it was to no avail, as Arnautovic put a free-kick into the side-netting and Afellay struck his shot over."},

Championship next month Sam Allardyce may wish to pin a small part of the blame on Ben Foster.\n\nWest Brom’s goalkeeper performed persistent wonders to earn Tony Pulis’s unambitious team a point and a clean sheet on a day when Foster looked every inch the England international he once was and maybe still should be.\n\nLeaving Vito Mannone a virtual bystander, the visitors neglected to direct any shots on target and seemed mightily relieved when Dame N’Doye’s last-gasp, hooked-in effort was disallowed for offside.\n\n“We broke West Brom’s well-organised defence down time and time again but unfortunately there was an outstanding guy in their goal who denied us at least two or three goals,” said Allardyce. “I can only tell the players that if they continue to play like that, they’ll win enough games to stay up. Sooner or later it will turn in our favour.”\n\nHis side remain third-bottom but Sunderland do have a game in hand on 17th-placed Norwich who they visit on Saturday week. First though, Leicester travel to Wearside next Sunday and on this evidence Claudio Ranieri’s title favourites have no cause for complacency.\n\nAt least they are unlikely to arrive with a defence staffed by four centre-halves – a favourite Pulis ploy – and four central midfielders further up. The resultant constriction made for a rather congested, often incoherent afternoon when one thing swiftly became crystal clear – Wahbi Khazri was by far the most menacing creator on view.\n\nAlternating between the right and the left flank, Sunderland’s Tunisia winger was invariably at the heart of the game’s more uplifting moments. There was the outrageous early dummy he sold James Chester before crossing for Jermain Defoe whose audacious backheel flick was easily held by Foster.\n\nLater, Khazri crossed superbly only for the leaping Defoe to somehow, untypically, miss the ball and then had a penalty appeal rejected after his collision with Sandro.\n\nIf that decision represented good refereeing, Khazri’s subsequent through-pass to Lee Cattermole should have led to a goal. Unfortunately for Allardyce, the recalled midfielder – captaining Sunderland in the absence of the benched John O’Shea – proved unequal to the task, Foster all too easily batting away his attempted chip with an outstretched glove.\n\nClearly content to settle for a point, the wingless visitors retreated ever deeper in a one-sided second half featuring Pulis’s backline repeatedly being bailed out by Foster.\n\nWhen Jan Kirchhoff made a rare advance from his deep-sitting midfield role and steamrollered his way through a couple of challenges before shooting, the visiting goalkeeper bravely diverted the danger by taking the full force of the ball in his face. Shortly afterwards Foster stretched every sinew to scramble Borini’s swerving 20-yard shot to safety.\n\nLife at Sunderland, where the game is stale, the club is rotten and relegation is inevitable Read more\n\nIf Khazri’s penalty claim against Sandro after the ball struck the midfielder’s arm was perhaps slightly ambitious, Borini will have been disappointed to volley DeAndre Yedlin’s stellar cross wide.\n\nRealising something needed to change, Pulis replaced one Sunderland old boy with another, Craig Gardner making way for James McClean with the latter greeted by resounding booing from his less than adoring former public. Next in line to be hooked was the thoroughly underwhelming Saido Berahino as West Brom’s manager sent 16-year-old debutant Jonathan Leko on in the striker’s stead.\n\nIt was a big moment for Leko but Foster refused to be eclipsed and did especially well to keep out another Borini curler before saving smartly from Defoe with a leg after Yann M’Vila’s pass bisected Pulis’s rearguard.\n\nThat department came undone once again as N’Doye briefly believed he had broken the deadlock but they were rescued by a linesman’s flag. “We’re pleased,” said West Brom’s manager with considerable understatement. “Sunderland just pushed us back but Ben’s a top goalkeeper.”"}, {"date": "02/04/2016", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34857, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup":

Yet West Ham United’s supporters were aiming their anger at Mark Clattenburg after he sent off Cheikhou Kouyaté midway through the second half. Slaven Bilic was engaged in a long, heated debate with the official as they made their way down the tunnel at the end of a thrillingly feisty London derby and even Alan Pardew thought that it was a harsh red card, not that his magnanimity did anything to soothe West Ham’s fury.\n\nCrystal Palace, playing with enough verve and ambition to suggest that they are more than capable of putting relegation worries to bed in the coming weeks, were level thanks to a moment of opportunism from Dwight Gayle within eight minutes of Kouyaté’s departure and West Ham’s frustration was exacerbated by the knowledge that their push for Champions League qualification has been compromised by dropping four points in their past two matches after debatable refereeing calls.\n\nThree points behind fourth-placed Manchester City, West Ham will drop to sixth if Manchester United beat Everton this afternoon. Bilic said: “If you want to write about it, write about it. I can’t say a lot.” While the Croatian had cooled down by the time he emerged from the dressing room, West Ham’s manager was adamant that Clattenburg had called it incorrectly when Kouyaté caught Gayle with a high challenge, although he was probably pushing it by claiming that the Senegalese midfielder did not even deserve a yellow card.\n\nIt had looked like the latest exhibition of Dimitri Payet’s set-piece brilliance, a stunning free-kick that swung and swirled away from Wayne Hennessey, was going to keep West Ham within a point of City. Yet Gayle hauled Palace level with 15 minutes remaining, capitalising on a mix-up between Angelo Ogbonna and Winston Reid, and the hosts had to defend stoutly to earn a share of the spoils during an edgy finale, with Adrián required to make an excellent save from Jason Puncheon in the 93rd minute.\n\nUnder the circumstances, West Ham had to be satisfied with a 2-2 draw considering how open the game became as it wore on. Palace were vibrant in the second half, even before it became 10 against 11, and Pardew’s decision to replace Wilfried Zaha with Gayle and move Yannick Bolasie back to the wings during the break proved inspired. Pardew was right to say that Palace had some of their old verve back and the only disappointment for Palace, seven points above the bottom three, was that they were unable to score the third goal that would have brought them their first win in 14 matches despite some concerted late pressure.\n\nPalace host Norwich City next week, and Pardew said: “I certainly think with our goal difference 38 points will be enough but you can’t legislate for a late run and the Premier League has a history of that.”\n\nPalace’s manager had held a meeting with his players on Friday night, warning them not to underestimate the severity of the situation, and the visitors took the lead after 15 minutes when Adrián clawed Bakary Sako’s inswinging free-kick back into the middle to present Damien Delaney with the simplest of headed chances.\n\nWithout Yohan Cabaye’s guile in midfield and the physicality of Emmanuel Adebayor up front, Palace had looked to play on the break, with Bolasie leading the line. Yet their lead lasted for just three minutes, an attempted clearance from Scott Dann falling to Manuel Lanzini, who lashed the ball past Hennessey and into the net.\n\nPardew had warned his players not to commit any stupid fouls in Payet territory and Palace were eventually shown why it is such a bad idea to let the Frenchman, the scorer of a brilliant free-kick in his country’s win over Russia last Tuesday, set the ball down within shooting distance and work out the angles when Joel Ward brought down West Ham’s biggest creative threat four minutes before the break.\n\nPayet had already had one sighter but this one was only a couple of yards outside the area, a little to the left of the D, and instead of going for whip and curl, he demonstrated his versatility by opting for power, swerve and dip. Hennessey was rooted to the spot as the ball flew high to his left. “I was expecting him to try to bend it over the wall,” Bilic said. But his smile could not hide his disappointment."}, {"date": "02/04/2016", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44062, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [24], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [51], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brad Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [63], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua Onomah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Tottenham Hotspur’s title challenge faltered at a ground where they rarely manage to win, a comeback from a goal down allowing them to share the points without putting the desired amount of pressure on Leicester. The gap between first and second is now four points instead of two, and Claudio Ranieri and his players can increase that to an improbable seven if they manage to beat Southampton at home on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThis was not a bad Spurs performance, just a slightly tired, heavy-legged one, epitomised by Dele Alli’s miss near the end. The England international had a chance to secure three points when Christian Eriksen played him in and Alli read the pass perfectly, yet his first touch showed Simon Mignolet too much of the ball and the opportunity was lost.\n\nLiverpool 1-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League - as it happened Read more\n\n“I am happy with the way we fought back, with the character we showed,” Mauricio Pochettino said. “I am disappointed to drop two points but playing Liverpool at Anfield is never easy. We still have to keep trying to reduce the gap and we must continue to believe, because in football a lot can happen in a short time.”\n\nSpurs began in a hurry, with Hugo Lloris launching quick balls forward from the back to find willing runners up front, succeeded in pinning Liverpool back in the opening exchanges and could have taken the lead after nine minutes when Mignolet made the first save of the game. Neat work on the right by Kyle Walker and Son Heung-min produced a shooting opportunity for Eriksen, who went for a first-time shot rather than taking care over direction and put the ball a little too close to the goalkeeper.\n\nThe contest was as evenly matched as expected, though the visitors were noticeably more confident on the ball and more adventurous in their passing. Philippe Coutinho was booked for a dive midway through the first half in a sign of Liverpool’s frustration, choosing to go to ground when confronted by Toby Alderweireld when he seemed to have the opportunity to simply knock the ball past the him into unguarded space.\n\nTheo Walcott seals Arsenal win over Watford to exact revenge for Cup exit Read more\n\nSpurs had another good chance to open the scoring shortly after that, when the Liverpool defence backed off to allow Kane to advance into the area. He had Eriksen up in support for a cross to the far post but forgivably decided he might as well have a go himself once he got within range. At least it would have been forgivable had he managed to hit the target, instead of scuffing a tame effort the wrong side of Mignolet’s right-hand upright.\n\nNevertheless, Liverpool should have turned round in front, for a couple of chances arrived in quick succession just before the interval and neither Daniel Sturridge nor Adam Lallana was able to beat Lloris when the opportunity presented itself. The first miss was the more glaring. Sturridge had all the time in the world to beat the Spurs goalkeeper after being played clean through by Coutinho, but failed to come up with the decisive finish one would have expected and Lloris stopped an unconvincing shot with his knees. Lloris also kept out a shot on the turn from Lallana on the edge of the area, this time with a full length diving save, though that would have been something out of nothing.\n\nSturridge’s opportunity was much more clear cut, and it was tempting to wonder whether a fully fit player would have stuck it away. That said, Kane too was guilty of similar hesitation in the closing minutes of the first half. With the target clearly in sight and Jürgen Klopp remonstrating furiously with the fourth official because he believed the ball had gone out of play earlier in the move, Tottenham’s leading scorer delayed his shot far too long and practically invited Dejan Lovren to stick a foot in the way.\n\nMartin Olsson snatches breathless victory for Norwich over Newcastle Read more\n\nIt appeared all Spurs had to do in the second half was to produce a little more dynamism to expose Liverpool’s suspect defending, but Alli was not quite the livewire we have come to expect, and when Kane picked him out in front of goal soon after the restart his header was more of a clearance than a threat. That suggestion of carelessness was punished almost immediately when Liverpool took the lead on their next attack with a goal of the highest quality. Coutinhobegan and ended the move, supplying Sturridge just inside the area then moving forward to accept a perfectly weighted return pass, before finding Lloris’s bottom corner with the neatest of right foot finishes.\n\nSpurs almost found an even better-looking response when Eric Dier’s elegant, chipped pass into the area was read by Son and taken on the volley, unfortunately for the visiting support in the Anfield Road end the shot flashed narrowly wide. Liverpool’s lead only lasted a few minutes longer, however, when Eriksen did well not only to keep the ball in play on the left but to find Kane with a flick into the area, the striker did what he had failed to do in the first hour and came up with a shot swift and accurate enough to surprise Lovren and beat the goalkeeper. “We switched off, we thought the ball was out,” Klopp said. “But I must say Harry Kane is a really nice striker.”\n\nThe Liverpool manager even embraced Kane like one of his own players after the final whistle. Spurs managed to raise their tempo after scoring, though getting back on level terms was as good as their evening got. A draw was all they deserved, particularly as the excellent Coutinho twice went close to putting Liverpool in front again. On one occasion, as the ball flashed across the goalline without going in, the Brazilian kicked out at an advertising board in frustration. It was a frustrating day for both sides, but after two draws this season the truth might simply be that they are evenly matched.\n\n“It was a tough game,” said Kane, whose 22 goals this season are a Spurs record in the Premier League era. “It would have been nice to go on and win it, but we did all we could. We can’t do anything else now except watch Leicester.”"}, {"date": "20/03/2016", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52311, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup":

Hopefully we can keep the momentum going.”\n\nWith Newcastle second bottom, Benítez readily acknowledged that avoiding relegation will be “difficult” and, for once, Allardyce proved similarly minded. “We’re our own worst enemy,” said the Sunderland manager after seeing his 18th placed side – who are one place and one point ahead of their neighbours – fail to hold a lead established by Jermain Defoe.\n\n“Draws aren’t enough now,” said Allardyce. “We need to win four of our last eight games. I’m frustrated. We were fully in control in the first half. We could and should have scored more goals. One is not enough for us because we will concede – it’s a nasty habit we’ve got. To sit back like we did in the second half was a real crime. We tried to protect what we’d got and couldn’t do it.”\n\nSunderland had spent the first half looking petrified whenever Andros Townsend ran at them from deep but relatively comfortably otherwise. Although Moussa Sissoko, operating uneasily on the left, had his moments, Jan Kirchhoff, the 6ft 5in quasi-sweeper Allardyce deploys between defence and midfield, generally maintained formidably impressive control while, further forward, Wahbi Khazri persistently ruffled the home defence.\n\nAppropriately Khazri’s pass prefaced the shot from Fabio Borini which led to Defoe’s goal. Although Rob Elliot, impressive throughout, performed wonders to parry that effort, Benítez’s defence could merely half-clear it and the ball fell for Defoe to score with a fabulous left-foot volley.\n\nIf McClaren was watching from his holiday base in Barbados, Newcastle’s former manager would have fully empathised with the look of deep concern spreading across Benítez’s face. And by half-time the moment when Mitrovic connected with Townsend’s cross only to clip a very presentable chance over the bar must have felt ominously costly.\n\nWith Colback needing to watch his step after collecting a 10th yellow card of the season, Newcastle had real problems at both ends. Benítez later admitted the concession of a second goal could have been disastrous for his side’s fragile psyche, so the sole glimmer of home hope revolved around Defoe’s uncharacteristic failure to turn Khazri’s swerving shot past Elliot.\n\nSure enough that miss offered Newcastle the stage for a fresh start in a second half which began with Yann M’Vila clearing Ayoze Pérez’s shot off the line. Admittedly Elliot did brilliantly to divert Patrick van Aanholt’s viciously bending shot but Allardyce served as a human barometer of the game’s general drift. His ever more manic gum chewing, increasing expletive use and despairing body language reflected Sunderland’s struggles to escape their own half.\n\nHe knew his players were retreating much too far and probably half-expected the consequences of the cross chipped in by Georginio Wijnaldum, which Mitrovic – previously kept fully in his place by Lamine Koné – delighted in heading beyond Vito Mannone before whipping off his shirt and celebrating with a pitch-invading supporter.\n\nSpurred on by a decibel-splitting wall of noise, Mitrovic challenged for another header, collided with Koné, collapsed and briefly lost consciousness before being forcibly prevented from rejoining the play by a concerned Benítez.\n\n“I don’t need red wine,” said Allardyce. “I need brandy.”\n\nMan of the

Liverpool were going to prolong their recent resurgence but by the end Jürgen Klopp could only congratulate the hosts for a thrilling comeback and lament his team’s relapse into unreliability. The visitors were two goals up at the break but so slapdash and inferior in the second period that Klopp admitted: “Southampton deserved it for sure.”\n\nRonald Koeman’s side merit praise for their transformation and the fact that they never relented, not even after Sadio Mané had a penalty saved by Simon Mignolet in the 50th minute. Mané had been introduced as one of two substitutions made by Koeman during the interval and the Senegalese shrugged off the miss to play a key part, along with Victor Wanyama, in his team’s recovery, scoring twice and generally harassing Liverpool’s defence.\n\nThat defence never looked comfortable and will need to be strengthened if this team are to achieve sustainable progress. Dejan Lovren’s improved performances had been one of the features of Liverpool’s strong form going into this match but on his return to the club where he began his Premier League career the Croat fell back into the haplessness of his early Liverpool days.\n\nHe was fortunate to avoid giving away a penalty in the eighth minute after misjudging the flight of the ball and then making contact with Shane Long, who fell in the box. Southampton demanded a penalty but the referee, Roger East, disagreed. Long continued harassing Lovren for the remainder of the half, the Croat eventually earning a yellow card for chopping down his tormentor.\n\nAt least Liverpool were enjoying themselves at the other end. They took the lead in the 17th minute with a wonderful 25-yard curler by Philippe Coutinho. Divock Origi set up a second goal five minutes later, loping 40 yards forward and passing to Daniel Sturridge, who used Cuco Martina as a shield as he fired a low shot beyond Forster.\n\nJoe Allen was guilty of allowing Forster to make a good save after a superb Liverpool move in the 26th minute, and the Welshman was then unlucky to have a goal disallowed on the grounds that the offside Mamadou Sakho had obscured Forster’s view. Koeman had spoken beforehand of his determination to avenge December’s 6-1 defeat here in the Capital One Cup but was beginning to fear a repeat. “But Liverpool left us alive after 45 minutes and we punished them for that,” he said.\n\nHalf-time changes by the managers had a major bearing on the result. While the Dutchman introduced Wanyama and Mané, Klopp replaced Lovren with Martin Skrtel because he feared that Lovren, barracked by the home fans, was in danger of giving the hosts a route back into the game, especially as, in the German’s words, “it looked like the referee was not completely free any more of the emotion in the stadium”.\n\nSkrtel had not played for three months following hamstring injury and it soon became clear that he was not going to help Liverpool navigate their way serenely to victory. Within five minutes he conceding a penalty for tugging Graziano Pellè’s shirt. Mignolet reprieved the defender by saving Mané’s spot-kick.\n\nBut Southampton were encouraged, nonetheless, and Liverpool’s defence remained rickety, Skrtel’s woes raising the question as to why Kolo Touré was not deployed in his stead. Mignolet, meanwhile, was exacerbating the problems despite his penalty save, his attempts to clear crosses anything but convincing. “We lost our formation and could not avoid their long balls to Pellè any more,” said Klopp.\n\nIn the 64th minute, after Southampton won possession in midfield, Mané received the ball, skipped past Sakho and planted it into the net from eight yards.\n\nChristian Benteke should have restored the two-goal gap shortly after replacing Sturridge in the 70th minute but dragged badly wide after being put through by Adam Lallana. For Liverpool that attempted finish contrasted painfully with the one produced by Pellè seven minutes from full-time, the Italian lashing the ball in from 20 yards.\n\nLiverpool could not even hold on for a point. Three minutes after conceding the equaliser, Mignolet triggered renewed panic with a weak kick. Skrtel and Allen completed the farce by colliding with each other as they attempted to tidy up, and Mané made the most of the mess by firing in the winning goal. “Tomorrow is my birthday and this is the best present I could get,” said Koeman. “This was a must-win game for European qualification. Now it is good to be fighting for something until the end of the season.”\n\nKlopp insisted that Liverpool could still make the top four if they win all nine of their remaining matches, but the fact that his post-match diagnosis was barely audible spoke volumes.\n\nMan of match Sadio Mané (Southampton)"}, {"date": "20/03/2016", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54557, "home_team": {"name":

disappointments, the lost points and fervent debate about Louis van Gaal’s suitability for the job, they chose a good moment to remember some of their qualities from the days when these kind of joys were the norm rather than the exception.\n\nPerhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid – and, admittedly, it is a backhanded one – is that they played as though affronted by the suspicion that Van Gaal has put together the most undistinguished team to emanate from Old Trafford for almost 30 years. They have unearthed another gem in Marcus Rashford, scorer of the game’s decisive goal, and on this evidence, it is perfectly plausible to think they can overhaul a fading Manchester City side to take the fourth Champions League place.\n\nManchester City v Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFor City, that represents a considerable embarrassment given the various ordeals that Van Gaal has encountered this season and the deception of Manuel Pellegrini’s team starting the season with five straight wins. Their deterioration since then is bordering on a full-on slump, with 36 points out of a possible 75, and the latest ordeal was so harrowing for Martín Demichelis it would be no surprise if this was his last appearance in City’s colours.\n\nDemichelis suffered such a torrid time he was substituted seven minutes into the second half with Pellegrini later explaining a defender of vast experience “felt nervous” in the company of Rashford and Anthony Martial.\n\nThose butterflies made Demichelis a danger to his own team. He was badly at fault for the goal, fortunate not to give away a penalty and partly responsible for Joe Hart injuring himself when he underhit a backpass to City’s goalkeeper with his first touch of the second half. It was a tragicomedy that could usher Demichelis into retirement though, in fairness, he was not the only player to suffer. City look like a team in need of reinvention and their crowd must be longing for Pep Guardiola’s restorative powers.\n\nUnited, in stark contrast, can be greatly encouraged and Rashford’s contribution certainly justified Van Gaal’s decision to keep him in the team after a few peripheral performances. Rashford has provided some of United’s more illuminating moments since the turn of the year and his latest one was his most outstanding piece of centre-forward play to date.\n\nYet his performance was best summed up by the little cameo in stoppage time, with United desperately needing a break, when the 18-year-old spun away from Eliaquim Mangala, surged away, performed a couple of step-overs and won a corner. “He had cramp,” Van Gaal said, almost disbelievingly, “and yet still he could run, even with cramp … I have never seen that.”\n\nThe goal was a beauty, too – starting with the soft-touch control to lure Demichelis into the challenge, then the speed at which the teenager spun away and the absence of nerves in front of England’s goalkeeper. It all happened in a blur and Rashford took the chance expertly, adjusting his body shape to improve his angle and placing his shot past Hart. “Rashford is very quick and Demichelis looks like the years are catching up with him,” Van Gaal said unsympathetically of his former player. “He was a very good defender, my centre-back at Bayern [Munich] but that is the life of football.”\n\nVan Gaal was certainly entitled to be aggrieved that the referee, Michael Oliver, did not award his team a penalty late in the first half when Demichelis, again, was behind play, arriving late and turning his side into Rashford to knock the teenager over. It was a clear penalty despite some amateur dramatics from the guilty party, trying to create the illusion that Rashford had manufactured his own fall.\n\nCity’s supporters like to sing how their team “fight to the end” and the goal came early enough, on 16 minutes, to leave plenty of time to recover. For the rest of the first half, however, it was a fitful display. The home side lost Raheem Sterling, who injured a groin in a challenge with Juan Mata, and even when they pinned back their opponents for periods of the second half it was a lot of huff and puff without too much guile. Sergio Agüero worked hard and headed one chance against a post but David Silva, City’s most creative force, is off form and, for the most part, David de Gea was well protected.\n\nThe defeat means City have lost 17 out of the last 18 occasions they have trailed at half-time in a league match. They have gone 22 games without recording back-to-back wins and, even more startlingly, managed only two victories in 14 matches against top-half teams. City’s total of 51 points is down from 61, 67, 62 and 70 at the corresponding stage of the previous four seasons and, keeping the seat warm for another man, there was nothing but a fit of pique from Pellegrini when he was asked to explain the decline.\n\nFor United, the team looked much more rounded without Marouane Fellaini cluttering up the place. Jesse Lingard might not be a natural No 10 but the tactic worked much better here than it had done against Liverpool last Thursday. Mata was prominently involved and Martial always looked dangerous, panicking Demichelis into the pass that led to Hart’s calf injury.\n\nAs for Rashford, it seemed distinctly unjust that the man-of-the-match champagne went to Chris Smalling, who could conceivably have been sent off for a foul on Agüero after already being booked for tripping the same player. Rashford was the only Mancunian on the pitch – a boy from a Wythenshawe estate – and perhaps they were not entirely sure he was old enough to drink.\n\nMan of the match Marcus Rashford (Manchester

Mauricio Pochettino’s side vaulted a tricky hurdle here with plenty to spare, their dismissal of Bournemouth again reducing the gap with the top team to five points and ensuring the squabble for the remaining two Champions League places is still a distant murmur at their backs. The sense persists that, if the leaders stumble, Spurs will pounce. The problem is that remains a considerable “if”.\n\nThis was an impressive victory, coming after the anticlimax of the leaders’ latest victory on Saturday and, no doubt, the lingering regret at seeing Kasper Schmeichel’s crossbar clipped by Damien Delaney in stoppage time at Selhurst Park. Those in pursuit need a break because the relentless nature of Leicester’s charge must choke the optimism at times, for all that Spurs can do no more than this. A comfortable win was secured early here with Eddie Howe’s team, rightly lauded for their own achievements this season and previously unbeaten away this calendar year, made to look uncharacteristically timid, even lethargic at times, as Spurs swarmed all over them.\n\nDanny Rose and Kyle Walker pinned the visitors back on the flanks while Dele Alli’s effervescence and a combative, classy midfield held sway in the centre. This is the kind of football Howe usually ekes from his own, but here the visitors’ energy went suffocated until the contest had all but been surrendered.\n\n“They work so hard and have such quality with the ball, making the pitch very big, constantly stretching you,” said the Bournemouth manager through gritted teeth. “Both these teams want to have the ball, but Spurs make it very hard for you to get it, particularly with their tactical play deep in their own half. With Harry Kane, they can also hurt you. We aspire to be like them one day. There’s a lot we can take from them.”\n\nFor now, all they have to show for brushes with Spurs is a pair of sound thrashings, and eight goals shipped en route, and it has been Kane who has revelled in the fixture most of all. The England striker personified the home team’s aggressive intent, his double adding to the hat-trick at the Vitality Stadium in October, though it was the sight of his last-ditch tackle inside his own six-yard box to snuff out Josh King’s attempt which arguably epitomised his display.\n\nHis Premier League tally for the season already matches last year’s haul of 21, but there is so much more to his game than goals. Simon Francis, a journeyman Football League right-back turned efficient top-flight centre-half, was targeted from the outset, exposed early on and eclipsed long before the end. The lack of protection offered the visitors’ backline by an overworked midfield made the result inevitable.\n\nTherein lay Howe’s greatest frustration – Harry Arter was hauled off at the interval having endured an ear-bashing from the sidelines throughout the first half – though there is no disgrace in being outmanoeuvred by opponents this slick. Spurs had conceded after 49 seconds on the south coast in the autumn before rallying to a 5-1 success but outdid that themselves here, easing ahead inside 44 seconds.\n\n“That made us calmer, with the patience to move the ball and dominate,” said Pochettino. “The team’s energy was fantastic. To have that, having come through a very busy period playing a lot of games, can make us feel proud, but we also played with maturity.”\n\nThere simply was no quelling them. Hugo Lloris’s quick distribution to Walker near the halfway line had set the breathless tempo, the right-back allowed to progress unchallenged down the flank before conjuring a delicious centre which Bournemouth could not repel. Kane edged ahead of Francis to score. The build-up was more considered for his second, a patient period of passing inside their own half culminating in Kevin Wimmer’s forward slide-rule pass and Dele Alli’s burst and pass beyond Francis. Kane dispatched that first time past Artur Boruc and the game was won. There were not yet 17 minutes on the clock. Both goals were made to look utterly simple. Each had been precisely and perfectly constructed.\n\nThe only vague criticism that could be levelled at the home side was one of profligacy when a cricket score might have beckoned, with Erik Lamela, Walker, Alli twice and Eriksen all close to adding a third before Boruc spilled Kane’s drive and presented the Danish playmaker with a tap-in. They could afford to fluff their lines with Bournemouth’s own glimpses of goal sporadic, and invariably limited to chaotic ricochets in the penalty area, but those are the chances that may need to be taken in the matches against Liverpool, Manchester United and Stoke City after the international break.\n\nBut, for all that Spurs will continue to play their games after Leicester City, their weeks appear less cluttered from now on in. The double sessions will continue – Pochettino does not relent on that front – yet this team can focus on one task alone. Their supporters had taken to bellowing “Leicester City, we’re coming for you” long before the end and while Claudio Ranieri will not be quaking in his boots just yet, this pursuit is still fuelled by optimism. The quality and conviction in Spurs’ ranks are proof enough of that.\n\nMan of the match Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur)\n\nMarcus Rashford pounces to give Manchester United derby win over City Read

had more parts than Trigger’s broom, provided the half-time entertainment at Goodison Park. Stand By Me was on the set-list and Arsène Wenger had every reason to sing along as Arsenal rediscovered their verve, belief and quality to ease to victory over sorry Everton.\n\nArsenal’s Arsène Wenger believes title chances are still alive Read more\n\nA week that had produced a shock FA Cup defeat, a predictable Champions League exit plus further criticism of the Arsenal manager and his team’s recurring faults ended with a performance that underlined why they were once regarded as Premier League title favourites. Danny Welbeck gave Arsenal an early lead to lift the gloom and the impressive teenager Alex Iwobi sealed his side’s first league victory since St Valentine’s Day with a debut goal for the club.\n\nIn central midfield, Mohamed Elneny and Francis Coquelin provided a platform for the visitors to dominate throughout. The only protests emanating from the Arsenal support this weekend was a banner calling for change and repeated chants for the majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, to “get out of our club”.\n\nHaving arrived at Goodison on the back of a damaging run of one win in eight matches, the transformation was a source of frustration as well as pride to Wenger. “We have a game based on movement, technical level and attacking football,” the Arsenal manager said. “You have to get the balance right. Sometimes it is not right. In England it is very difficult to give a fair assessment of the performances. When you lose you are disastrous but we have lost some games when we have not been as bad as some people said. But I agree you win or you lose in our sport so let’s push on until the end of the season and show we are ready for a fight.”\n\nFor Roberto Martínez, however, this was another alarming Goodison afternoon just when he had dared to believe victory in the FA Cup quarter-final over Chelsea had marked a sea-change in a woeful league campaign. Everton simply could not cope with Arsenal’s devastating pace or movement in the first half and succumbed meekly to their eighth home league defeat of the season.\n\nThat appalling statistic is draining support for the Everton manager and his prospects of convincing such leading players as Romelu Lukaku to stick around.\n\nEverton 0-2 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\n“It is so frustrating to see such a contrast between the Chelsea performance and this one,” admitted Martínez. “Seven days ago we had an intensity, we were joyful. Today every touch was a doubt, we were pedestrian. I don’t think we had one period in the game when we looked like ourselves. It looked like a fearful performance. I haven’t seen us play that badly this season.”\n\nThe contest was wide open at the start. Within two minutes both teams had struck a post, Séamus Coleman steering Tom Cleverley’s corner against the woodwork and Welbeck likewise. Within four minutes both teams had another sight of goal, through Ross Barkley and Welbeck again, and within seven minutes Arsenal were ahead. The pace of Welbeck and the precision of Alexis Sánchez combined to shred the Everton defence.\n\nCutting inside from the right, Sanchez exchanged passes with Mesut Özil before releasing Welbeck behind a static defence with a perfectly weighted ball. The striker gave another demonstration of what Wenger has missed too often through injury this season by rounding Robles and converting into an empty net. The buildup to the breakthrough, and Arsenal’s continued authority outside the Everton penalty area, was also reminder of the suspended Gareth Barry’s worth to Martínez’s team.\n\nEverton may have had a free week since their last outing but it was Arsenal, 65 hours on from defeat in Barcelona, who were sharper in control, quicker in possession and in thought. Goodison aired its regular grumbles at Everton’s performance but the visitors’ superiority was the true cause of their concern. After the free-flowing start Arsenal stifled their opponents’ creative talents and closed off their space. Everton did not, and were handed a lesson.\n\nIwobi should have doubled the visitors’ lead moments after Welbeck’s opener after Everton were again exposed in defence. But the 19-year-old Nigerian, making only his sixth Premier League appearance, shot tamely at Robles. His reward for an industrious, dangerous display arrived before the break.\n\nLeicester City eight points clear after Riyad Mahrez sees off Crystal Palace Read more\n\nArsenal’s second encapsulated their work-rate, speed and threat. Iwobi challenged Ramiro Funes Mori deep inside the visitors’ half as Everton searched for a way through. Ball won, he set off, and after Welbeck beat Muhamed Besic to the second ball Héctor Bellerin dissected the Everton defence with a raking pass over the top. There was Iwobi, who continued his run, held off Funes Mori and claimed his first Arsenal goal with a convincing finish beneath Robles.\n\nHis team continually overrun, Martínez reverted to a three-man defence including John Stones for the second half. The change had its intended effect as Everton finally contained Arsenal on the break while pressing them back in the final third, albeit without seriously troubling David Ospina.\n\nPhil Jagielka headed narrowly over from Cleverley’s corner and the midfielder had a goal-bound drive blocked by Gabriel. At the other end the substitute Olivier Giroud had a header disallowed after a shove on the Everton captain.\n\nAmid all the scrutiny of Wenger and criticism of Arsenal’s weaknesses, here was a timely

startling transformation into contenders for Champions League qualification, perhaps nothing illustrates it better than a draw here feeling more like a defeat than a decent result after a moment of high controversy in the dying minutes denied Slaven Bilic’s side their first win in this part of the capital since 2002.\n\nBefore Robert Madley awarded Chelsea a penalty with one minute of normal time left, despite Michail Antonio’s foul on Ruben Loftus-Cheek appearing to take place just outside the area, it had seemed more likely that West Ham were going to score a decisive third goal to add to the strike from Andy Carroll that made it 2-1 in the 61st minute.\n\nCarroll had seen a header cleared off the line, Thibaut Courtois was required to make a fine save and West Ham were looking comfortable, knocking the ball around with tremendous assurance, until Antonio was penalised for bringing Loftus-Cheek down after Willian had led a sudden Chelsea break, allowing Fàbregas to equalise from the spot.\n\nDanny Welbeck and Alex Iwobi put Arsenal back on track at Everton Read more\n\nFor West Ham, the wait for their first double over Chelsea since the 2002-03 season goes on, while they squandered the chance to take Manchester City’s place in the top four for at least 24 hours. They led twice, opening the scoring with a classy effort from the outstanding Manuel Lanzini, but their inability to kill Chelsea off was punished.\n\nWhile Guus Hiddink argued that Madley was right to give Loftus-Cheek, an 84th-minute substitute, the benefit of the doubt, Bilic was furious with the referee. “I don’t like to moan or find excuses because the way the boys played, we have to be really proud,” he said. “But now we have to play a replay against Manchester United because a big decision went against us and then to concede this kind of goal, it was not close to the line. It was simply not a penalty. He wasn’t sliding, so it shouldn’t be difficult for the referee.”\n\nHowever, once their sense of injustice evaporates, West Ham will reflect on a performance that further emphasised that they possess the talent to maintain their challenge for a place in the top four. A sign of their enhanced confidence could be glimpsed when Adrián controlled an awkward, looping backpass from Dimitri Payet on his chest early on, juggled the ball on his thigh and volleyed it clear under pressure, and Bilic’s selection was bold, with Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia able to start together in attack for the first time in almost a year.\n\nWest Ham were bright and positive, breaking with energy, passing inventively and threatening in the wide expanses in front of Chelsea’s back four even before they went ahead thanks to Lanzini’s peach of a goal in the 17th minute.\n\nBilic has tapped into the club’s sense of playing with style and adventure with his positivity and the shot that Lanzini curled past Courtois was a wonderful piece of skill. When Payet was tackled by Mikel John Obi, Lanzini collected possession 25 yards out, assessed his options and floated a shot towards the top-left corner that was in from the moment it left his right foot. The Argentinian hit it with curl and dip, the ball bending away from Courtois, and the away end was transformed into a pit of writhing, jubilant celebration.\n\nChelsea were stunned, almost into submission and when Lanzini, whose impudent touches and ease on the ball made him a delight to watch, carved them open with a delightful backheel, Aaron Cresswell would have made it 2-0 if Branislav Ivanovic had not deflected his effort past the left post.\n\nChelsea 2-2 West Ham, Premier League and more: clockwatch – live! Read more\n\nThere were other near-misses and the home side had absorbed a lot of pressure by the time Fàbregas equalised with a lovely free-kick on the stroke of half-time. Although Loïc Rémy toiled in place of the suspended Diego Costa up front, Chelsea demonstrated their resolve after going behind, despite the disappointment of their exits from the Champions League and the FA Cup last week, and they slowly began to offer their supporters glimpses of the champion spirit of old.\n\nThey raged at not being awarded a penalty when Valencia appeared to control the ball with his right arm, but when Winston Reid was booked for fouling Oscar on the edge of the area, Fàbregas’s execution was perfect, Adrián’s dive futile.\n\nChelsea remained vulnerable to West Ham’s counterattacks, however, and Cresswell had already rammed a shot against the bar shortly before Carroll scored with his first touch a minute after coming on for Sakho. Payet released him, deceiving the defence with a sublime pass, and the striker threaded his shot past Courtois.\n\nWest Ham failed to take their chances and although Chelsea seemed to have run out of ideas, with Alex Pato a glum presence on the bench, the sight of Payet collapsing to the floor near the halfway line when Madley pointed to the spot summed up the frustration for West Ham’s

beat ’em, Claudio. They keep on underestimating you. Leicester went eight points clear at the top of the Premier League with a tight, eagerly fought 1-0 victory set up by Riyad Mahrez’s winning goal and backed by some dogged defending as Crystal Palace attacked in the last half hour.\n\nClaudio Ranieri cautious but says everything is in Leicester City’s hands Read more\n\nPalace pressed hard at times. Leicester were good in spells but rarely at full stretch. And so the procession continues towards what is starting to look a surprisingly routine fairytale title with a fourth 1-0 win in five games. As the away fans sang “We’re going to win the league” throughout the second half – less a giddy prediction now, more a statement of fact – it was tempting to wonder not whether Leicester are going to choke, but whether anyone is actually going to give them a proper game. Or at least tear into them from the start as Palace did only in patches once Alan Pardew had rejigged his team to stem the threat of Mahrez down the right.\n\nThe Algerian was sensationally good in the first half, delicately purposeful in possession and a ghost off the ball as Palace attacked. Pape Souaré’s substitution at half-time was presumably so Palace’s left-back could have his neck iced, so many times did he find himself whirling around in a funk trying to work out exactly where Mahrez had shimmied off to now.\n\nThe finish for his first-half goal was routine but it was made by a fine, pre-emptive run, and by the usual boldness Leicester’s chief creator tends to show away from home. Ten of Mahrez’s last 11 Premier League goals have come away from the King Power. Most have come at vital points. He may be lithe and louche and blessed with a gossamer touch but he is fearless too, not just decorating this team but driving it on too.\n\nCrystal Palace 0-1 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nOn a chilly day both teams lined up in a new-school 4-4-2. Leicester picked the usual team. Palace were unchanged too, with Yannick Bolasie given freedom behind Emmanuel Adebayor to scuttle about, gloved fists pumping, in search of space.\n\nIt turned out to be a shape poorly fitted to the personnel, as Joe Ledley at left midfield struggled to track Mahrez. At half-time time Pardew acted, junking his entire left side, bringing on Martin Kelly and Bakary Sako. By then, though, it was too late.\n\nAll of which made for some unfortunate timing given Pardew’s grudging programme notes, in which he got his praise for the league leaders out of the way and lingered instead on Leicester’s 10 penalty kicks this season and the lack of injuries in their squad, combined with a lament over his own team’s bad luck on similar “fine margins”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leicester City’s Riyad Mahrez celebrates after scoring. Photograph: Ikimages/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt is certainly an argument. Another might be that Leicester win penalties because of their high-speed, counterattacking game that tests retreating defenders and finds the holes in energetically leaky Premier League midfields. Plus opponents still fail to address their best qualities. Here the best attacker in the league was marked by an out-of-position central midfielder. Luck is certainly one word for it.\n\nFor the opening 20 minutes this was a muscular, grudging game of football. Leicester’s great skill is staying patient, sticking to the plan, waiting for their strengths to tell. Palace matched them well enough, only forgetting themselves for the first time on 18 minutes as the midfield pushed up together and a lovely instant pass from Danny Drinkwater put Mahrez through on goal. Wayne Hennessey read the jink inside and got his hand to Mahrez’s low shot.\n\nFor a while Wilfried Zaha and Bolasie pressed on the flanks. With half an hour gone Bolasie took Yohan Cabaye’s pass brilliantly on the run and crossed for Zaha, who could only screw his shot wide.\n\nCesc Fàbregas’s disputed late penalty denies West Ham victory at Chelsea Read more\n\nFour minutes later Leicester gave their own lesson in precision. Vardy pulled out to the left and took Drinkwater’s quick, volleyed pass. Dancing away from Joel Ward, he crossed low for Mahrez, unmarked, to slot the ball low into the corner. It was a well-executed goal with every player on the move and in sync, but Palace’s defending was slack.\n\nTo his credit, Pardew’s tweaks changed the game a little after half-time. Palace’s reconfigured front three of Zaha, Bolasie and Sako gave greater drive but the lack of a real goalscorer among them showed as first Sako and then Kelly whipped low crosses through the six-yard box. Bolasie had a powerful shot well saved. At the death Damien Delaney swivelled and fired a shot on to the top of the bar after a corner.\n\nLeicester hung on, as always seemed likely. Their next four opponents are Southampton, Sunderland, West Ham and Swansea, all but the Sunderland game at home. Tottenham have three tough games coming up. Arsenal are capable of making any game anywhere look tough. Manchester City will have at least some of their attention on Paris. It is not impossible this could all be done by the end of April, Leicester of the unbursting bubble not just champions, but champions at a hard-fought canter."}, {"date": "19/03/2016", "arena":

a 2-1 defeat against Stoke City.\n\nWatford looked a pale shadow of the side who memorably defeated Arsenal the previous weekend to reach the FA Cup semi-finals.\n\nGoals in each half from Jonathan Walters and Mato Joselu gave Stoke a comfortable victory despite Troy Deeney’s late consolation. But the Watford manager Flores insisted that his players were not already thinking about their Wembley date with Crystal Palace next month.\n\n“I don’t know if last weekend had an effect but we are disappointed,” the Spanish manager said.\n\n“When we finally realised we were not in the match it was a little bit late. We created chances in the final third of the game. But in the first half we were not completely focused. We forgot the plan. We don’t play again in the FA Cup for a month.\n\n“I don’t think the players are thinking about the semi-final, and if they are it would be a big mistake.”\n\nWatford are 12 points above the relegation places and their future looks reasonably secure for next season, but they will not want their campaign to peter out ahead of their FA Cup date at Wembley.\n\nWatford created the first opening when Odion Ighalo, a goalscorer at the Emirates Stadium the previous weekend, hit an angled drive which the Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland kept out low to his right.\n\nIt was all Stoke after that, however, although Walters chose the wrong option when, rather than shooting from the corner of the six-yard box, he pulled the ball back to no one.\n\nHowever, he was in the right place in the 18th minute, when overlapping full‑back Phil Bardsley swept a low ball into the area. The Watford defender Miguel Britos missed the ball, allowing Walters to pounce at the far post for his fifth Premier League goal of the season.\n\nStoke had the ball in the back of the net again shortly afterwards but unfortunately for them Marko Arnautovic was on the wrong end of one of the tightest of offside decisions when he tucked in another cross from Bardsley.\n\nCesc Fàbregas’s disputed late penalty denies West Ham victory at Chelsea Read more\n\nJosé Manuel Jurado could have hauled Watford level after he was teed up by Ighalo but the Spaniard lifted his shot too high.\n\nTempers briefly flared just before the interval when Allan Nyom’s challenge shoved Arnautovic into the advertising boards, earning the Stoke forward a sore ankle and the Watford defender a yellow card. And six minutes after half-time Stoke grabbed their second goal of the match thanks to an error from Heurelho Gomes and a canny piece of invention from Walters.\n\nGomes HeurelhoGomes scuffed his free-kick straight to Walters, who instinctively volleyed the ball into the path of Joselu leaving the Spaniard clean through to score with a deft lob and give the visitors a two-goal lead.\n\nSome more sloppy play, this time from Étienne Capoue, almost let Ibrahim Afellay in for a third but Gomes kept out his shot from 15 yards.\n\nWatford pulled a goal back when Deeney headed in a cross from the substitute Ikechi Anya, but they could not prevent Stoke moving to within a point of Manchester United in sixth place and in the race for a Europa League spot.\n\nThis was also the first time Stoke had won at Vicarage Road in a Premier League fixture. It was also the first time Stoke had won at Vicarage Road in the top flight.\n\nWalters was the star of the show, despite having only been recalled due to injuries after a spell out of the side.\n\n“I spoke to Jonathan earlier in the week and told him he was playing,” Hughes said. “You could tell from the start that he was focused and ready to make an impact. He’s not been playing for the last few weeks but he came in to good effect.\n\n“We dominated the first half and could have taken the game away from Watford by half-time. But we came out and got the second.\n\n“Then they threw some balls into our box and we had to deal with that. Both sides of the game we did well and that shows our quality.” PA"}, {"date": "19/03/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 25039, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup":

important for his club as Norwich City climbed out of the Premier League relegation zone with their first win in 11 games.\n\nWith Newcastle United and Sunderland, bed-fellows in the bottom three thanks to this result, playing each other on Sunday, and against Norwich after the international break, Alex Neil’s side have given themselves a fighting chance of staying up.\n\nStoke City aiming for Europe after Walters and Joselu sink Watford Read more\n\nFor the first time since December, West Bromwich Albion lost at home and Norwich won away. Brady was the hero, scoring five minutes after the break with an opportunist goal, as Norwich kept a clean sheet away from home for the first time this season. It was Brady’s finish in the 1-1 draw in Zenica in November that set Ireland up to qualify for this summer’s European Championship finals in France; if he goes there still a Premier League player, Norwich may well look back to this as a pivotal moment.\n\nBrady failed to finish the game, as he went off with blurred vision after jarring his neck following an accidental collision with Craig Dawson, and could be a doubt for Ireland’s friendly games with Switzerland and Slovakia in the next 10 days. “He landed on his neck [but] he’ll be fine,” Neil said. “He’ll join up initially [Ireland have an awards dinner for which Brady is nominated for their player of the year]. He might wake up with a stiff neck and find it difficult to move in which case it’s unlikely he’ll be available for those games.”\n\nAfter gaining 10 points from their previous four games to climb to the verge of safety, West Brom completed a miserable week for Tony Pulis after a Premier League tribunal had announced on Thursday their head coach must repay Crystal Palace the £2m bonus he earned for helping them avoid relegation two seasons ago.\n\n“It was a really poor game,” Pulis said. “You have to grind it out sometimes and the one thing you have to do is keep a clean sheet. We’ve played so well in the last month but we’ve just had two weeks off [because Arsenal were in FA Cup action last weekend] and now we’ve got another two weeks off for the international break.”\n\nNorwich were brave, starting Patrick Bamford off Dieumerci Mbokani, as well as Matt Jarvis and Brady on the flanks. It was a move that paid off and, with Newcastle, Palace and Sunderland their next three opponents, Norwich have kept their destiny in their own hands.\n\nWest Brom had started confidently enough, Claudio Yacob dispatching a shot from outside the penalty area that fizzed past the top corner of the Norwich goal. Four minutes before the interval, Gary O’Neil, sporting a head bandage for an injury sustained in last week’s confidence-boosting draw with Manchester City, gave the ball straight to Stéphane Sessègnon who set off for goal pronto but pulled his shot just wide.\n\nNorwich’s self-belief tangibly increased after they made their breakthrough. It was a fine move that led to a scruffy goal. Bamford laid a pass back neatly into midfield where the ball was played to Mbokani, who played an intelligent square pass for Jarvis to come inside Jonny Evans. Even though he bungled his shot, the ball broke for Brady to slot home from close range.\n\nWithout an away win since they triumphed at Manchester United the week before Christmas, Norwich started playing with more pizzazz, delivering some excellent centres that cried out for a dominant centre-forward to attack.\n\nWest Brom managed to turn the flow of play, when Pulis withdrew one of his four central defenders,Jonas Olsson and introduced a winger at left-back, in James McClean, with Evans reverting to his more customary position alongside Gareth McAuley.\n\nStill Norwich defended resolutely, however, the home side unable to make a clear chance to speak of, and Jonny Howson could have scored again when dashing into the penalty area in stoppage time only for the ball to bounce away from him.

are all that matter for Swansea City right now and this slender victory should be enough to preserve the club’s Premier League status.\n\nThe goal was as scrappy as the game, as Federico Fernández capitalised on a mistake from Brad Guzan, the Aston Villa goalkeeper, to turn the ball over the line with his shoulder eight minutes into the second half. It was the Argentinian’s first goal since joining the club at the start of last season and could not have been better timed. With seven games remaining, Swansea are now 11 points clear of Sunderland in 18th place and surely safe from the threat of relegation.\n\nYet Guidolin, who was back in the dugout after recovering from a severe chest infection, needed no telling that there was little pleasure to take from the way that his team played.\n\nLeon Britton’s introduction for Ki Sung-yueng at half-time made a difference but this was still a thoroughly underwhelming Swansea display, riddled with errors and devoid of imagination. On another night Swansea would have been punished but Aston Villa are anchored to the bottom of the Premier League table for good reason.\n\nRémi Garde’s side had their opportunities and were the better team in the opening 45 minutes, which in itself is a damning indictment of just how woeful Swansea were during a half that ended with them being booed off the pitch. Yet Villa, as has been the case so often this season, never looked like they really believed they could score.\n\nThis was a sixth successive defeat, their 21st in the league this season, and with Norwich City winning at West Bromwich Albion earlier in the day, Villa now find themselves 12 points adrift with only seven matches remaining. Their relegation is a formality, even if Garde continues to preach that his team will “not give up” until it is mathematically impossible.\n\nGuidolin insisted that Swansea were still not quite safe but it would need an extraordinary run of results for the Welsh club to be sucked back into the scrap at the bottom. They have picked up 17 points from 10 games since losing at home against Sunderland in January to haul themselves clear, yet this was arguably one of their worst displays of the season.\n\n“The performance was not very good, I know,” the head coach said. “But this is the match I was waiting for, because I know the situation and I saw my players played a nervous game.\n\n“We were better in the second half, not very good but better with Leon Britton in the middle. But what I liked this evening from my guys is the attitude. This was our most important win of the season.”\n\nSwansea gave the ball away so cheaply time and again in the opening 45 minutes, and the sight of Gylfi Sigurdsson, who has been so impressive since the turn of the year, starting wide on the left summed up how disjointed they looked.\n\nVilla could, and should, have capitalised on Swansea’s shortcomings but Ciaran Clark headed inches over and Rudy Gestede saw one effort cleared and another comfortably saved by Lukasz Fabianski.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch Guzan had been a virtual spectator but the American, who has endured a difficult season and was only recently recalled to the starting XI, made a terrible hash of trying to deal with Sigurdsson’s whipped free-kick. The Villa keeper seemed to have one eye on Fernández as he dashed off his line to try to clear and ended up caught in no man’s land, punching thin air. Fernández, totally unmarked, bundled home.\n\n“Brad will go away for the next international break and have the time to digest that and to come back stronger,” Garde said, choosing his words carefully about his goalkeeper.\n\nJoleon Lescott headed tamely at Fabianski later in the second half and there were some anxious moments for Swansea in the final minutes, when they were unable to retain the ball and invited Villa pressure, yet Guidolin’s team did just enough to hold on."}, {"date": "14/03/2016", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31824, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester

the Premier League without suffering a debilitating bout of vertigo. This might not rank among the more distinguished performances of an almost implausible season but every team who win the championship stack up a few stodgy 1-0 victories and the upshot is that Claudio Ranieri’s side have re-established a five-point lead with eight games to go.\n\nClaudio Ranieri admits it is all about points, not Leicester performances Read more\n\nLeicester have certainly passed the ball with more authority and penetration this season and for large parts of the second half a nervous crowd was longing for the final whistle. Yet even when the Premier League leaders were struggling for their usual fluency, with their star players becoming increasingly peripheral and an anxious Ranieri waving his arms to demand more from his team, there were signs of the stubbornness that will be essential if they are to maintain this position.\n\nIn their past seven home games they have now kept six clean sheets. Newcastle United’s players looked eager to impress Rafael Benítez in his first match as manager but Leicester’s defence, superbly marshalled by Robert Huth and Wes Morgan, formed an impenetrable barrier in front of Kasper Schmeichel. The goal came from their only shot on target – a wonderful piece of improvisation from Shinji Okazaki – and this was their third 1-0 win in their past four games. Nervous as Leicester appeared at times, they still had enough to grind out an unspectacular yet crucial win.\n\nIn the process they made it a losing start for Benítez on a night that demonstrated why his team have found goals so elusive this season. Benítez has inherited a side who have managed only eight in their past 21 away games, failing to score in 14 of them, and, though there were half-chances for Aleksandar Mitrovic, Jack Colback and Moussa Sissoko, they were unable to conjure up a really presentable opportunity all night. If Newcastle are to avoid dropping into the Championship it is clear the first area of improvement has to be their attack.\n\nRafael Benítez did his Newcastle homework but could not outfox Claudio Ranieri Read more\n\nBenítez’s arrival certainly seemed to have sharpened a few minds judging by the way a team entrenched in relegation danger matched Leicester for long spells, no matter the 39-point difference that now exists between the two sides. Newcastle’s fans never sang Steve McClaren’s name but Benítez was loudly serenaded by the away end and his team showed a new-found confidence until the game ticked into the 25th minute and Okazaki decided it was time to add some stardust to the occasion.\n\nOkazaki, a bustling, eager player with a licence to roam, may not always catch the eye in the same way as Jamie Vardy or Riyad Mahrez but the Japan international has also shown his own capacity for unsettling defences and this was a perfectly executed overhead kick. Newcastle had failed to clear a free-kick and when Marc Albrighton clipped another cross into the penalty area Steven Taylor, stretching to head the ball, could only knock it to the far post. Vardy was there to head it across and Okazaki, showing great anticipation and technique, launched himself into the air to score with an acrobatic finish.\n\nVardy had been marginally offside as he outjumped Colback but every successful team needs a slice of good fortune and for the rest of the first half Leicester looked more like their usual selves, attacking in numbers and causing problems with their speed and directness. Albrighton came close to adding a second barely three minutes after Okazaki’s goal and perhaps they would have been able to relax if his curling shot had not drifted beyond the far post. Vardy and Okazaki were difficult, elusive opponents in the first half and, every so often, there was a reminder of Mahrez’s soft-touch refinement.\n\nNewcastle, however, did not crumple in the way that had become the hallmark of McClaren’s teams and as the game wore on their opponents started to retreat. The problem for Newcastle was their attacks had a tendency to break down on the edge of the penalty area. Mitrovic often found himself up against both Huth and Morgan and there were not enough times when the visiting midfielders took a risk and tried to run behind the home defence. It was rare to see a team have so much of the ball yet create so little.\n\nLeicester City v Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nFor Leicester the second half was about keeping their structure, not panicking and getting through. Danny Drinkwater has been outstanding this season but this was not one of his better nights and it was unusual to see Leicester’s more penetrative players have so little effect after the break. Vardy and Mahrez seldom threatened and Albrighton and Okazaki were taken off. Ranieri was clearly alarmed judging by the way he started gesturing to his team, then signalling to the crowd he wanted more noise.\n\nNewcastle might have had a late penalty when Morgan jutted out an elbow to block Sissoko’s shot but, equally, Leicester though they could have had one of their own in the first half when Vardy went down under Daryl Janmaat’s challenge. In Newcastle’s position, second from bottom of the league, a late onslaught might have been anticipated. It never happened and, at the final whistle, there was a burst of relief from the home crowd. “We’re going to win the league,” they sang."}, {"date": "13/03/2016", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance":

Hotspur manager could seize on this restorative victory as vindication of sorts as two goals from Harry Kane, either side of half-time, brought a first top-flight title in 55 years back into view.\n\nKane has 22 for the season in all competitions, including 18 in his last 21 league games, and it will not escape Roy Hodgson’s attention that the gifted Dele Alli set up both goals for the England striker, the first with a quickly taken free-kick and the second courtesy of an inviting low cross that was going to end in only one place.\n\nIt could hardly have been more comfortable for Spurs against the Premier League’s bottom club, so much so that it was tempting to wonder whether Pochettino could have rested players for this fixture, not the Europa League tie in Dortmund. All that can be said for sure is that Spurs at full-strength – Pochettino made seven changes from the Dortmund game – had far too much class for Villa and from the moment that Kane scored his first the outcome seemed inevitable.\n\nVictory was imperative for Spurs and closes the gap at the top on Leicester to two points. Spurs have played a game more than Claudio Ranieri’s side but Pochettino and his players are entitled to feel that this win, which was only their third in eight games, turns up the pressure on Leicester, who host Newcastle United at home on Monday .\n\nAgainst a team as short of confidence as Villa it was all so easy for Spurs, who were able to stroll through the second half. Kane, who also hit the crossbar, is playing with supreme confidence. Alli was an elusive presence throughout and with Mousa Dembélé controlling midfield alongside Eric Dier, and Toby Alderweireld so impressive at the back, Tottenham never looked like slipping up.\n\nAs for Villa, their disastrous season cannot end quickly enough. This was a fifth successive defeat, their 20th of the season in the league, and the mood among the supporters is mutinous.\n\nThe biggest cheer of the day was reserved for a “Lerner Out” banner which reappeared in the North Stand in the 81st minute after it had previously been confiscated by stewards.\n\nIn a show of solidarity Spurs fans started chanting “We want Lerner out” which not surprisingly was met with applause by the home supporters, who promptly joined in on an afternoon when Brian Little, who has been appointed as an adviser to the Villa board, and David Bernstein, who has joined the board, were looking on from the directors’ box. A penny for their thoughts as Villa’s owner and Tom Fox, the club’s chief executive officer, came under fire.\n\nOn the pitch Villa huffed and puffed their way through the game, yet Rémi Garde’s side look so toothless going forward. If anything summed up their dismal season it was the moment six minutes from time when Jordan Ayew’s shot clipped the upright and dropped for Rudy Gestede, who was inside the six-yard box and had the goal at his mercy but somehow contrived to hit the crossbar.\n\nGarde was unhappy his side “conceded two goals in the worst period you can imagine” yet the Villa manager admitted the real damage was done with Kane’s first, not the second.\n\nFrom the moment Villa’s resistance is broken the players’ body language changes, heads drop and a second goal feels like only a matter of time, as was the case at Manchester City last Saturday. “We know currently that when we concede we become fragile,” Garde said.\n\nThe Alli and Kane double act had prised Villa open as early as the fourth minute when the striker ran on to a threaded pass and lobbed Brad Guzan, only to see his shot bounce off the top of the bar. Erik Lamela hit the post later in the first half and Kane also had a first-time shot saved by Guzan before Spurs took the lead.\n\nAlli caught Villa sleeping with a free-kick that picked out Kane, who had drifted out to the left flank.

lost by them in the title race. Rather than increase the pressure on the leaders, Manuel Pellegrini’s side performed like men who should worry about being overtaken by West Ham or Manchester United in the top four. The would-be champions have not won back-to-back league games for five months and have a difficult run-in on top of a Champions League campaign that they aim to extend by seeing off Dynamo Kyiv in midweek.\n\nNorwich, meanwhile, can take heart from a point won with a spirited performance and their first clean sheet in more than two months. It could prove a springboard to survival.\n\nManchester City have grown accustomed to beating Norwich heavily in recent seasons, including a 3-0 win here in the FA Cup in January, but this time, when only victory would have fuelled belief that they can topple the league leaders, they lacked creativity and sharpness. Norwich initially seemed there for the taking but emerged as deserving recipients of a point.\n\nThe hosts’ jitters, caused by a 10-match winless streak, served as an invitation to the visitors to make themselves at home again. Pellegrini’s team hogged the ball but did not have the ingenuity to do much with it and were at times expensively sluggish.\n\nNorwich v Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWhen Russell Martin headed an attempted clearance on to Sergio Agüero in the fifth minute, the Argentina striker gave him enough time to recover and block the ensuing shot. And when Fernandinho produced a rare incisive pass in the 21st minute to put Gaël Clichy clean through, the left-back miscontrolled and let the ball run out of play. By that stage, all that the home goalkeeper, John Ruddy, had done was awkwardly push a 20-yard free-kick by Agüero over the bar. Not until the 29th minute did Ruddy have to excel, plunging quickly to his right to tip away a low drive from Agüero with one hand. City could not make him perform such a feat again.\n\nThat shot came against the run of play because Norwich, encouraged by the visitors’ impotence, had started to apply pressure at the other end. With Martin Olsson supplying regular crosses from the left, the Carrow Road crowd began to belt out hopeful chants. Patrick Bamford nearly brought ecstatic roars in the 39th minute when he outwitted Nicolás Otamendi and hit a half-volley over Joe Hart from 30 yards. There were exasperated yelps all round when the ball cannoned out off the crossbar.\n\nBy first-half stoppage time, when Matt Jarvis shot just wide from 16 yards, the title-chasers were a slovenly bunch. David Silva flitted about purposefully but lacked zest and too few of his team-mates were on his wavelength in the first half. Wilfried Bony, again picked ahead of Kelechi Iheanacho, exerted no influence before being replaced by Raheem Sterling in the 58th minute. In the middle, there was a Yaya Touré-shaped hole. The Ivorian has his flaws but boasts a creative menace that none of his team-mates provided in his absence.\n\nManchester City started the second half with renewed urgency. That made Norwich defend with renewed nervousness, but no less commitment. Gary O’Neil and Jonny Howson were tirelessly vigilant in front of the back four.\n\nThe visitors failed to penetrate. Just after the hour Silva, playing more centrally following Sterling’s introduction, spotted a run by Fernandinho and rewarded it with a beautiful pass. But the Brazilian eschewed a straightforward shot and offloaded to Agüero, who bumbled before his shot was blocked. Agüero sought to make amends moments later with a jagged run towards the box. Timm Klose took him down just outside, and the free-kick yielded nothing.\n\n“We had a very good attitude and very good possession but we couldn’t create the space that we needed in the last third,” said Pellegrini, who insisted his team could still be champions. “If you mathematically have a chance to do it, you must always think you can do it.”\n\nNeil remains convinced that Norwich will get out of trouble. “The amount of effort the players are putting in to stay in the league can’t be questioned and our game management and our decision making was better than in recent weeks,” said the Scot, whose team will soon host the two sides closest to them in the table, Sunderland and a Newcastle United side whose illustrious new manager holds no fear for Neil. “Rafael Benítez isn’t going to win the game for them, it’s all about the players,” said the Scotsman."}, {"date": "12/03/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11179, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup":

for another season. Even Howe, so level-headed, meticulous and measured in his approach, knows the significance of such a result despite naturally playing down its importance after the match, posing the unpredictability of the division as one final hurdle for his side to overcome. The home supporters left Dean Court singing “We are staying up”‚ after this breathless performance which leaves them 13 points clear of the relegation zone, while off the pitch plans are already being made to increase the capacity at the stadium.\n\nBournemouth’s players clearly ignored pre-match talk that they were already safe, judging by the urgency displayed here. Max Gradel’s energy caused Àngel Rangel no end of problems. On the other flank, Matt Ritchie gave Neil Taylor a difficult afternoon. The Swansea head coach, Francesco Guidolin, who will return to the dugout against Aston Villa next weekend, will have been disappointed with his side’s first-half showing here. Three minutes in, Gradel, who returned to action last month at Watford after an anterior cruciate knee injury, cut inside from the left to deliver a high ball for Joshua King to sound the alarm bells with a header just over Lukasz Fabianski’s goal. Bournemouth have scored more goals than any other Premier League team in the first 15 minutes and they only looked like enhancing that statistic here. Fabianski then made two fine saves from set pieces, first denying Andrew Surman and then Ritchie’s inswinging free-kick. Swansea ran out of ideas of how to contain Bournemouth’s swarming attacks and the hosts finally found a way past Fabianski when Adam Smith’s teasing cross lured the Swansea goalkeeper away from his goal, pushing the ball into the path of Gradel, who tucked home his first Premier League goal. It was the least Bournemouth deserved. Gradel then rushed straight over to celebrate with his manager Howe, who he phoned every day during his rehabilitation from injury in the Ivory Coast.\n\n“I thought he might be running behind me to somebody else so I didn’t want to commit to him too early,” said Howe. “It was a nice moment and he did not have to do that, although it was much appreciated. He is such a popular boy here and it was a touching moment.”\n\nBut Bournemouth’s opener finally sprung lifeless Swansea into action. Swansea’s Gambian winger, Modou Barrow, darted inside from the right flank, before breezing past static Bournemouth defenders Charlie Daniels and Simon Francis and striking his first top-flight goal into the corner of Artur Boruc’s goal. Barrow, who was later withdrawn with a hamstring injury, flourished on his first start since January and you would not argue with Swansea’s first-team coach Alan Curtis’s claim that he was the best player on the pitch. “He gave us a real threat going forward and to score two goals away from home is one of the few positives to take out of it,” said Curtis, before billing their match against Aston Villa as “must must-win”.\n\nNorwich City stand firm to leave Manchester City off the title pace Read more\n\nSwansea’s wastefulness in possession at times was typified by Bournemouth’s second goal. Leroy Fer, preferred to partner Jack Cork over Leon Britton in holding midfield, surrendered the ball too easily before Gradel picked it up. He found King, who blasted a shot inside Fabianski’s near post from an acute angle. Swansea, still beaming with confidence from their unlikely win at Arsenal, are not short of confidence and soon pulled level. Barrow cut the ball back from the touchline for Gylfi Sigurdsson, who controlled it neatly with his first touch before striking it past Boruc with his second. Barrow’s confidence was infectious and Swansea’s heads suddenly held high.\n\nTheir jubilation was soon fractured, though, when Bournemouth dug deep to salvage a priceless winning goal. Ritchie delivered a devious cross from the left, which the Bournemouth defender Steve Cook nodded home past Fabianski, his second goal in three matches. The Bournemouth substitute, Lewis Grabban, almost found a fourth with a cheeky lob but by then Bournemouth’s mission was already accomplished."}, {"date": "12/03/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium",

Pellè had not scored for more than four months but in the showdown of the Europa League wannabes – if such clubs exist – it was Southampton who prevailed thanks to the Italian’s early brace.\n\nPelle had not scored since 1 November, drawing 13 blanks in a barren personal spell of 855 minutes all told, before two neat finishes inside the opening half hour gave Southampton the winning platform that leaves them three points behind Manchester United in the chase for sixth place.\n\nBournemouth close in on safety after Steve Cook’s header sinks Swansea Read more\n\nMarko Arnautovic put the fire back in Stoke’s belly with a goal early in the second half but Southampton, even with Ryan Bertrand at centre-back in the absence of suspended captain José Fonte, held firm despite Sadio Mané’s late red card. Pellè was aided by the energetic return of his strike partner Shane Long and by untypically slothful defending from Stoke, who had gained 10 points from their previous four games.\n\nRonald Koeman was relieved to see his leading marksman return to his penetrative best. “It was a great response from Graziano today,” the Southampton manager said. “He was strong and kept the ball and scored two goals. I understand you can’t score two goals every week but as a striker you need to be important. He knows he’s a big personality and he had a great game today.”\n\nJack Butland had tipped over Pellè’s initial header before the Italy striker rose to glance home Steven Davis’s subsequent corner to score Southampton’s 12th headed goal of the campaign, the most in the division.\n\nNorwich City stand firm to leave Manchester City off the title pace Read more\n\nEven with Ryan Shawcross, their captain and defensive stalwart, back after eight weeks out with a back injury, Stoke looked second best for the rest of the first half. When Cuco Martina’s cross from the right went over everyone, Pellè retrieved the ball, bustled inside Shawcross and played a one-two with Dusan Tadic to which Geoff Cameron seemed oblivious. To add insult to immobility, Pellè’s curling shot was at a height that Butland would normally save.\n\nWith Xherdan Shaqiri forced to withdraw with a thigh injury, Stoke’s day was getting worse and they should have been 3-0 down by half-time. Long played Tadic in, two on one, but the Serbian took an age to cut inside Shawcross and allowed Cameron to make a tackle.\n\nStoke came out charged up for the second half, got the crowd behind them and were back in the contest when Arnautovic scored with an audacious flick of his right boot from Ibrahim Afellay’s low cross towards the near post.\n\nBut despite a spell of spirited pressure and several decent chances, Stoke could not complete their recovery.

Crystal Palace had been in a position to exorcise dismal form here, leading against depleted opponents with an opportunity theirs for the taking to move well clear of the condemned. That they still departed distraught, undermined first by a goalkeeping error and then the award of a penalty deep into stoppage time that had the locals apoplectic, has further darkened the gloom. At present, they are the team whose nosedive is offering hope of a reprieve to those in the bottom four.\n\nThe sense of despair was palpable at the final whistle. Palace could rage in the belief Christian Benteke had been on the tumble well before his left foot made slight contact with a sliding Damien Delaney’s right knee. The centre-half, having initially and unwisely slid in as the striker eased around him, had been checking his left-foot challenge when Benteke flicked out to find contact with the Irishman’s follow-through. The linesman in front of the visiting supporters flagged for the spot kick immediately, even if the referee Andre Marriner needed some persuasion to confirm the award. The conversion itself, six minutes into stoppage time, was the last action of the match.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend's best Premier League photos Read more\n\nYet if that was a brutal finale, the home side really only had themselves to blame for failing to settle the contest well before a streetwise substitute could snatch such belated reward. Palace had been the dominant force up to the moment Joe Ledley thumped them ahead early in the second half, and should have been in total command as soon as James Milner was sent off for a second bookable offence just after the hour mark. Thereafter, however, they wilted horribly, betraying all the fragility of a team who have now staggered through 12 matches and 11 weeks in the Premier League without a win.\n\nTheir composure was shattered from the moment Alex McCarthy gifted the visitors an equaliser, all authority wrested away in the blink of an eye and Liverpool, suddenly focused where previously they had been limp and ineffective, the more persuasive threat in what time that remained.\n\nThe colour had rather drained from Alan Pardew as he confronted this latest setback post match. His exasperation with the penalty award was made clear, but it was the wastefulness of the display which had properly floored a manager who can normally pluck positives from the most emphatic of defeats.\n\n“Alex’s error affected us and made us nervous,” he said. “We haven’t won for a while but when you’re struggling, you have to try and react well. One or two of my players didn’t, if I’m honest.\n\n“That’s human nature to a certain extent, but also something I need to eradicate. The way the game unfolded was not good for us. It was all really disappointing after we scored. Up to that point it was as good as we’ve been, so I’m frustrated with the result, frustrated with the referee, frustrated with the way we didn’t push on once ahead, frustrated with my substitutes who should have done better, frustrated with myself. We never pushed on in that last 15 minutes, and that was the biggest down side of the game. I don’t feel like there were many positives to be had”\n\nHe took leave of his media briefing at that point, his mood having deteriorated. Ledley, down in the mouth of the tunnel, was busy telling the world the result was “devastating”, which summed things up a bit more succinctly.\n\nNot so for Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp, whose first Premier League loss had been suffered to these opponents back in November, can point to this win as evidence of proper progress given how Palace have haunted those from Merseyside in recent times. They have snuffed out title challenges and even gatecrashed Steven Gerrard’s final hurrah, and the last three top-flight games had gone the way of the club from south London. Yet the manner in which the visitors responded to losing Milner, penalised for fouls on Yohan Cabaye and Wilfried Zaha, was admirable. Klopp spoke of passion taking over. It eclipsed anything Palace could offer.\n\nDivock Origi had missed an open goal but Liverpool’s urgency started to peg Palace back. Ledley’s back pass 19 minutes from time was routine, but McCarthy slipped as he attempted to clear and presented the ball to Roberto Firmino. The Brazilian collected and converted a seventh goal in eight Premier League games and the complexion of the occasion changed. McCarthy had been making his first appearance since September. He would depart at the end inconsolable with tears stinging his eyes.\n\nThe visitors, now only six points off fourth place, struck a post through Alberto Moreno and Benteke twice went close in that baffling period when Palace would normally have expected to prevail. All their earlier authority, when Yannick Bolasie and Zaha had wounded Liverpool down the flanks and Emmanuel Adebayor nodded against the bar, felt an age away.\n\nLedley’s crisp finish from the edge of the area as the visitors failed to clear a corner should have put them on the road to redemption. As it is, they continue to hover unnervingly above the scrap at the foot. This whole occasion had been reduced to a microcosm of their season.\n\nMan of the match Mile Jedinak (Crystal Palace)."}, {"date": "06/03/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24878,

take long for Manchester United to work out how that run came to an end. The postmortem will focus on the poor marking that allowed Salomón Rondón the time to control and shoot home from 12 yards out but, more than anything, the two yellow cards that Juan Mata picked up in the space of 158 seconds in the first half.\n\nIt was difficult to know what was going through Mata’s mind when he brought down Darren Fletcher little more than two minutes after picking up a yellow card for preventing the same player from taking a quick free-kick. The fact that Fletcher was inside his own half on both occasions, not remotely close to threatening the United goal, added to the sense of bemusement about how careless and naive Mata could be.\n\nThe Dozen: the weekend's best Premier League photos Read more\n\nSeveral United players protested but Mike Dean, the referee, had no option but to brandish a red card and Louis van Gaal’s side were forced to play with 10 men for 64 minutes against a team who are difficult to break down at the best of times. In that sense the outcome was fairly predictable as United, who had never really looked like turning possession into goals with Mata on the pitch, struggled to create much and to compound their frustration, they were undone by one swing of Rondón’s left boot.\n\nIt was the Venezuelan’s fourth goal in six league games and it all but secures Albion’s Premier League status for another season – they are now on 39 points and up to 11th – while delivering a serious blow to United’s hopes of finishing in the top four. Van Gaal’s side are now sixth, three points behind fourth-placed Manchester City having played a game more, and once again it looks as though winning the Europa League represents their only realistic chance of playing in the Champions League next season.\n\nVan Gaal was probably right when he said that Mata’s sending off was the turning point in a game of few chances. He described the first caution, when Mata could easily have retreated but chose to stick out a leg to block Fletcher’s free-kick, as “stupid”, but the Dutchman seemed to believe that the referee should have taken into account the sort of player that the United midfielder is before showing a second yellow card. Referees, of course, do not have that discretion and it would be a dangerous path to go down if they did.\n\nWith so much of the match still to play, Van Gaal decided that United would be more effective with Anthony Martial up front, rather than Marcus Rashford, who had started in that role. Rashford shifted out to the right and Jesse Lingard swapped flanks to take up a position wide on the left, where Martial had struggled to make much impression in the early stages. Those changes, however, did nothing to improve United’s threat as an attacking force.\n\nAlbion were not exactly on the offensive in the wake of Mata’s dismissal and for long periods it was difficult to see where a goal was going to come from. Rondón was full of running up front alongside Saido Berahino while Fletcher, up against his former club, impressed in midfield but David de Gea had very little to do prior to the breakthrough.\n\nThe goal owed much to Sébastien Pocognoli and the substitute’s reaction afterwards – a slow walk back to his own half – provided a measure of the frustration the left-back has felt over the last 15 months or so. Remarkably, this was Pocognoli’s first league appearance since Boxing Day 2014, a few days before Pulis replaced Alan Irvine.\n\nPulis has a fondness for playing centre-backs right across his back four – “We’ve got a full-back on the pitch” – chanted the Albion supporters during their FA Cup replay at Bristol City in January after Pocognoli was brought on as a substitute – and it was only an injury to Craig Dawson that broke up that unusual defensive set-up against United.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion 1-0 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nReceiving the ball from Fletcher wide on the left, Pocognoli highlighted the benefit of having a naturally left-footed player in that position when he looked up before delivering a fine centre that picked out Rondón. With Daley Blind in no man’s land and several other United players marking space, Rondón took a touch and swivelled before dispatching a low left-footed shot into the corner of the net.\n\nVan Gaal’s side started the second half brightly, when Rashford saw his low shot deflected wide and Lingard, cutting in from the left, thrashed a 25-yard drive that skimmed the roof of the net, but the visitors were unable to conjure up anything in response to Rondón’s goal.\n\nPulis described Fletcher’s claim that Albion should now be setting their sights on getting to 50 points as “nonsense”, but he was full of praise for his captain. “He’s got that drive and fire in his belly that has maybe been dampened out of his generation,” he said.\n\nPulis was also delighted with the contribution of his strike pairing. “At the start of the season, before the nonsense with Saido, I was looking forward to them playing together. Since Saido has come back in the two of them have looked really lively and we look a threat. I thought Rondón took his goal with aplomb.”"}, {"date": "05/03/2016", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35762, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [29], "reds": [55], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [39], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [76], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Welbeck", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Macey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It was a wild, oscillating contest, in keeping with the story of an eccentric title race, and when the players left the pitch at the end to try to make sense of everything there must have been regret for both teams.

Derided for lacking competitive courage, facing allegations of collective cowardice and the possibility of losing four successive games for the first time since October 2002, Arsène Wenger’s players did at least show it was not completely true they have less heart than the Tinman in Wizard of Oz.\n\nTheir resilience to come back with ten men, salvaging a point courtesy of Alexis Sánchez’s first league goal since October, does not make it feel any less preposterous that they lost so meekly against Swansea City and Manchester United in their previous two league fixtures. Yet Arsenal did at least show they understood the importance of this fixture and refused to wilt when they were losing with a man down. They might still have imperfections, with only two wins from their last nine away league games, but it was an improvement.\n\nWenger’s men had taken the lead after 38 minutes courtesy of Aaron Ramsey’s clever improvisational flick to divert Héctor Bellerín’s cross-shot past Hugo Lloris in goal. At that stage Coquelin’s new midfield partnership with Mohamed Elneny looked compact. Danny Welbeck was making the most of some sparse service and, though Spurs had most of the early play, Mauricio Pochettino’s team were clearly rocked to be behind.\n\nUnfortunately for Arsenal, the complexion of the game completely changed nine minutes into the second half when Coquelin dived into a challenge on Kane by the left touchline, missed the ball and eventually got back to his feet to the inevitable yellow card. Coquelin had already been booked in the first half for handling the ball, though there was an argument he had been fouled in the build-up to the earlier incident and Wenger was incensed later in the match when Eric Dier pulled back the substitute Olivier Giroud, having been shown a yellow card a few minutes earlier. The referee, Michael Oliver, decided against brandishing another red card and Wenger was entitled to complain about it afterwards.\n\nOnly winners of the much-anticipated north London derby were Leicester | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nWenger did not dispute, however, that it was silly from Coquelin, especially having warned the midfielder to be careful at half-time, and that mistake had costly repercussions. With an extra man, Spurs suddenly had new belief and were level on the hour, Christian Eriksen swinging over a corner and Toby Alderweireld sweeping in the loose ball after it had popped out between Erik Lamela and Gabriel.\n\nSpurs were invigorated and when Kane curled in a beauty two minutes later, taking aim from a position where most players would not even have thought a shot was on, the ground was in a state of near-euphoria. Dele Alli had beaten Per Mertesacker for pace to reach the ball close to the corner flag and his back-heeled pass left Kane with the chance to turn inside. Running in from the left, Kane took his shot early, starting it outside the post but with the right amount of bend and pace to curl over David Ospina into the top corner.\n\nPochettino made the point afterwards that Ospina, deputising for the injured Petr Cech, was one of the game’s outstanding performers, especially with his first-half save to keep out Lamela’s effort and later in the match when Eriksen took aim from outside the penalty area.\n\nKane’s goal means he has now scored 14 times in 18 top-division London derbies but the England striker will also think back to another chance, within a couple of minutes of Coquelin’s dismissal, when his shot initially appeared to have gone past Ospina only for the goalline technology to deny him by roughly the width of a cigarette paper.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harry Kane curls the ball past David Ospina and in off the post.

Welbeck justified his selection, chosen in attack ahead of Giroud and Theo Walcott, and the most encouraging part for Wenger must have been Sánchez’s improved performance. His equaliser came from a scuffed shot and, like Ramsey’s goal, a vital contribution from Bellerín. Lloris might reflect he could have saved it but Sánchez had his best game for some time and if Arsenal have any chance of returning to the top they will cling to the hope that, to quote Wenger, they will now start to see more of “the real Alexis.”\n\nOverall, however, it was not a result either team could find entirely satisfactory.\n\n• This article was corrected on 5 March 2016 to reflect the

The hosts dropped two points against opponents who for the majority of this contest showed greater intent and quality and will reflect that it was only their lack of a killer instinct that prevented them departing from this venue with a victory. Paris Saint-Germain, one feels, will not be so wasteful when they perform here on Wednesday with a place in the Champions League quarter-finals up for grabs.\n\nSunderland suffer with Virgil van Dijk grabbing Southampton a point Read more\n\nPSG bring with them a 2-1 lead earned when they faced Chelsea in the first leg of their last-16 tie in Paris last month and if Laurent Blanc’s men managed to watch back this match after their Ligue 1 contest with Montpellier on Saturday evening their confidence in getting the job done will only have grown. Guus Hiddink’s men were jittery at the back while in attack their play was sluggish and lacking in penetration. That can partly be put down to the absence of key players through injury, most notably John Terry and Diego Costa, the latter absent here because of a minor tendon strain, but all in all this was a display that served as a reminder that despite the recovery Chelsea have made, post-José Mourinho this is a club still struggling to recapture former glories.\n\nSaying that, Stoke deserve huge credit for how they put Chelsea under pressure from the outset and, when in possession, looked to dominate play with their desire to earn what would have been a fourth win in succession not blunted even after Bertrand Traoré had given Chelsea the lead against the run of play on 39 minutes. The visitors’ attacking trio of Marko Arnautovic, Ibrahim Afellay and Xherdan Shaqiri caused constant panic among the defenders in blue and it was the man positioned ahead of them, Mame Biram Diouf, who got the goal Stoke’s display deserved, a close-range header on 85 minutes after Thibaut Courtois had punched Shaqiri’s right-wing cross directly at the striker.\n\nDiouf’s reaction was one of relief more than anything given the numerous chances he in particular had missed, most notably on 21 minutes when the 28-year-old turned Afellay’s cross over the bar when it appeared easier to put the ball underneath it, but ultimately he was Stoke’s hero, securing their first point at Stamford Bridge since 1984 and keeping them in seventh.\n\n“We were arguably hard done by” said Mark Hughes. “We had good opportunities in the first half and got done with a sucker punch. You can be deflated by that but everyone was encouraged by what we had done and it was a case of more of the same in the second half. The goal was somewhat fortunate as I was going to take Diouf off just before he scored but all in all we showed real belief.”\n\nHiddink was aggrieved with referee Mark Clattenburg’s decision not to award Chelsea a penalty on 72 minutes after Marc Muniesa appeared to push Oscar to the turf inside the Stoke area – “It was a clear penalty,” protested the Dutchman – but he also admitted that a draw was a “fair result” and that Chelsea’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League via their league position have all but vanished. The Londoners remain 10th in the table and are 10 points behind Manchester City in fourth, having played a game more than Manuel Pellegrini’s men.\n\nSwansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson seals win as Norwich City slump goes on Read more\n\n“That [making the top four] is almost impossible,” said Hiddink, who at least has become the first manager to start a Premier League spell in charge with a 12-match unbeaten run. “Today’s result of West Ham for instance is very respectful that they’re knocking on that door as well.”\n\nThe manager’s assessment makes beating PSG particularly important and Chelsea supporters can take heart from his belief that Costa will have recovered in time to face the French champions. In his place here, Traoré delivered a breathtaking strike on what was only his second start for the club. Having collected Nemanja Matic’s pass and turned into space, the 20-year-old lashed a drive from outside the area into the far corner of Jack Butland’s net. The Stoke goalkeeper had no chance.\n\nOthers in blue were not so eye-catching. Their effort could not be criticised but in defence and attack the lack of cohesion and class was glaring.

Those at the Olympic Stadium may come with the carrot of Champions League football. Everton announced on Friday that they are reducing prices for next season. West Ham United are raising expectations for it. An extraordinary comeback, featuring three goals in 12 minutes, turned defeat into victory and maintained their hopes of a top-four finish. Credibility was stretched as the points were pilfered.\n\nSergio Agüero hits double as Manchester City thrash sorry Aston Villa Read more\n\n“Unbelievable,” said Slaven Bilic. “Nobody can deny we deserved it. We showed our quality, we showed our stubbornness and we got a great win.” They are a team transformed. They used to approach trips to Merseyside with trepidation, but won at Anfield for the first time in 52 years in August. A 16-game winless run against Everton in the top flight came to an abrupt end, courtesy of Michail Antonio, Diafra Sakho and Dimitri Payet. West Ham’s signing of the season provided the dramatic denouement. Andy Carroll headed Aaron Cresswell’s diagonal ball down, Sakho improvised a backheel flick and Payet nipped in to score the winner. A catalytic signing contributed a crucial goal to determine a cracking game.\n\nYet another Hammer exerted an equal influence and made the fightback feasible. West Ham were two goals adrift and being run ragged by Romelu Lukaku when twin pieces of acrobatics by Adrián proved to be turning points.\n\nThe Spaniard saved twice from Everton’s top scorer, once from a strangely hesitant penalty and once when he burst clear on goal. He had already made stunning stops to deny James McCarthy and Ross Barkley, who each eyed spectacular long-range strikes, in a one-man rearguard action. It brought a belated reward when his attacking colleagues conjured three goals. “If they had scored that penalty they would have won the game maybe 3-0 or 4-0,” Bilic admitted.\n\nEverton could rue Adrián’s excellence and Lukaku’s misses. Yet, profligate as he was, he has also proved prolific. In any case, there were other reasons for Everton’s seventh home league defeat of the season. They display a costly carelessness, and have squandered a two-goal advantage four times already. A poor, porous defence has been a regular source of complaint and Ramiro Funes Mori stood flat-footed for two of the West Ham goals.\n\nRoberto Martínez’s initial gambit of matching Bilic’s 3-4-3 formation had paid off and his half-time introduction of Muhamed Besic brought a benefit when the Bosnian won the penalty that Lukaku spurned. Yet the removal of two in-form goalscorers who were tormenting West Ham – first Aaron Lennon and then Lukaku – afforded the visitors the initiative.\n\nAnd the culpable Belgian really was Kevin Mirallas, not Lukaku. The winger had been booked for diving before he upended Cresswell. His arm was immediately raised in apology but it was not enough to spare him a second yellow card, or Everton an hour with 10 men. The Goodison faithful afforded the departing winger a generous ovation and blamed the referee, Anthony Taylor. So did Martínez, who identified a scapegoat for a setback.\n\n“The second booking is a decision the referee has to make,” he admitted. “The first one is a ridiculous decision. Why should we book a player because we feel it is not a free-kick? I don’t feel he is a referee who understands the game in a way that we want it played.”\n\nEverton’s understanding was apparent in a slickly worked opener, Bryan Oviedo finding Lukaku, who accelerated away to score in an eighth successive game against West Ham. “The performance for spells was outstanding,” said Martínez. So was Lukaku’s. Bilic admitted: “When they had the ball, he makes that one-player loss less visible. He creates mayhem.” He also fashioned Lennon’s fifth goal in seven games, the winger accepting Lukaku’s return pass to score.\n\nSteve McClaren’s position weakened further as Bournemouth beat Newcastle Read more\n\nThen Adrián intervened. “The penalty was a big blow psychologically,” said Martínez. “Romelu Lukaku is such a reliable footballer that we were all a little bit shocked.” West Ham were galvanised. Bilic had gambled, bringing on Carroll and Sakho. Substitutes starred after a starter scored. Antonio’s third goal in three games was headed in from Mark Noble’s cross. Another delivery from the visitors’ left flank yielded an equaliser. Payet was the supplier, Sakho heading in.\n\nPayet’s winner left even Bilic bemused. “I didn’t know what to do, so I ran down the tunnel and I came back straightaway,” he said, though a celebration was the product of a half-time conversation. “I said that ‘we are one down but we are going to do it’,” he revealed. “We had to be less sexy and more lethal.”\n\nEverton could do with displaying a similar hard-nosed pragmatism. “I thought our performance, defensively, was outstanding for 78 minutes and very poor from then on,” said Martínez. But whether discounting tickets or gifting goals, their generosity knows no bounds."}, {"date": "05/03/2016", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53892, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City",

heading their way, but, after three straight league defeats, City needed to stop the rot and begin consolidating their position in the top four.\n\nLeicester City’s Riyad Mahrez sinks Watford to boost title charge Read more\n\nTheir supporters will forgive Pellegrini for dreaming of a second title as long as City win enough matches to stay ahead of West Ham and Manchester United, whose form has raised the embarrassing possibility of welcoming Pep Guardiola to the club with Europa League football.\n\nNot that the home side looked like a Champions League one for all of this game. Granted, it is unusual to face opponents of such limited ambition and content to play almost all of the game in their own half, but all City had to do was find a way past Rémi Garde’s flat back five and, for 45 frustrating minutes, they could not manage it. The first half was like a training ground exercise, and about as much fun to watch, although City were quite inventive in finding a number of different ways to threaten. Once Brad Guzan set the tone in the 11th minute, by keeping out a Sergio Agüero shot after the striker had shown magnificent control in bringing down Fernandinho’s pass, the crowd became gradually more restless and attempts on goal became progressively more rushed.\n\nWilfried Bony was guilty of a bad miss after Gaël Clichy’s cross picked him out in a perfect position on the six yard line, shooting first time but putting the ball wide from right in front of goal. Agüero saw a shot on the turn palmed away by Guzan, then put his next effort just past the post after an interchange with Bony, who ended the first half with a tame header from the edge of the area that summed up City’s lack of actual penetration.\n\nWatching from his technical area, Garde seemed satisfied enough with the way the game was going, though on one of their rare forays upfield Villa missed a wonderful chance to take an interval lead. While Joe Hart did well to get down to Jordan Ayew’s shot after almost half an hour of inaction, with half the City defence having stopped in anticipation of a free-kick that never came it was a better opportunity than the striker perhaps realised.\n\nVilla were left to rue their inability to spring a surprise when City opened the second half with the sort of goal that made you wonder why they had taken so long. For once their three most effective attackers combined in unanswerable fashion, Agüero driving to the goal line before turning the ball back for David Silva, who moved the ball across for Yaya Touré to stroke languidly home from near the penalty spot. Against Villa that was probably always going to be enough but, as if to emphasise the gulf between the sides, City went two up within two minutes. There was a touch of good fortune about their second, with Micah Richards’ attempted clearance bouncing back off Agüero’s shin and into an empty net, though no question that Villa had been opened up again through Silva and Bony, the latter making up for his lacklustre finishing with a measured through ball.\n\nWest Ham stun 10-man Everton as Dimitri Payet seals fightback win Read more\n\nWhen Agüero added a third after a trademark surge into the area from Silva’s return pass the contest was clearly over, so much so that Pellegrini introduced Raheem Sterling for the last half hour. There has been some debate of late over whether the substitute’s up-and-down season has represented a reasonable return on an outlay of £49m, and this was another indifferent display, though a goal with one of his first touches will have done the player’s confidence no harm. In truth he could hardly have missed, and watching the almost comical ineptitude Joleon Lescott and Alan Hutton demonstrated in failing to cut out a Jesús Navas cross to leave Sterling with a tap-in, the withdrawn Bony must have been highly unamused.\n\nThe rout could have been worse but Agüero struck a post with a penalty after Ciaran Clark had brought down Kelechi Iheanacho. It will not do the goalkeeper or his side a tiny bit of good but Guzan deserved a break.\n\n“Our only plan was not to concede,” Garde admitted. “It worked in the first half but not in the second. We can play in a different way, and maybe the fans would like us to, but when you are bottom of the table you have to be realistic at a club that could still win the Champions League. Being too open and optimistic would be like suicide.”"}, {"date": "05/03/2016", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 52107, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [28], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [31]}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [31], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henri Saivet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seydou Doumbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Max Gradel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Benik Afobe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Tommy Elphick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Grabban", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eunan O'Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Newcastle United’s squad may have issued a pre-match statement pledging loyalty to Steve McClaren but actions tend to speak louder than words. Long before the end the squad’s lunchtime missive to Sky Sports appeared an empty gesture.\n\nWith talented but underachieving home players including, most notably, the woefully disappointing Gini Wijnaldum once again failing to make the desired impact, it was left to the outstanding Matt Ritchie and his Bournemouth team-mates to leave McClaren’s immediate future shrouded in considerable uncertainty.\n\nSteve McClaren insists he can save Newcastle after Bournemouth defeat Read more\n\nWhile Eddie Howe’s refreshing side are all but safe from relegation, Newcastle remain deep in trouble with Mike Ashley, their owner, now surely debating whether to sack the former England coach and hope someone else can somehow keep the club out of the Championship.\n\nThere was a definite sense of endgame as, at the final whistle, McClaren stood on the edge of the dug out, his gaze wandering to all four corners of the ground. The chants of “sacked in the morning” and “Steve McClaren he’s taking us down” must still have been ringing in his ears. Since March last year he has won only nine of 43 games with Newcastle and Derby.\n\nThings had started deceptively brightly for the former England coach. Almost straight from kick-off Moussa Sissoko – ultimately another key under-achiever and a dismal shadow of the marauding midfielder he could be – whipped in a wonderful cross which Emmanuel Rivière – preferred to Aleksandar Mitrovic at centre forward – could not quite connect with.\n\nAs, a couple of minutes later, Jonjo Shelvey – home captain in Fabricio Coloccini’s absence – swiftly directed a shot marginally wide Bournemouth looked set for a sustained rearguard action.\n\nIt was to prove a distinctly false impression. Once they had gathered their breath, Howe’s players began passing in a manner almost as attractive as their bright pink shirts and socks.\n\nCollecting the fallout from a corner, Max Gradel unleashed a shot which might well have beaten Rob Elliot had it not deflected wide off Andrew Surman. Then Adam Smith advanced from right-back and crossed menacingly towards the hovering Benik Afobe. While Afobe did well to chest it down his ensuing volley flashed over the bar.\n\nThe chemistry between the impressive Smith and the excellent Ritchie was to prove a key factor in the afternoon and perhaps explains Wijnaldum’s utter ineffectiveness down Newcastle’s left.\n\nAcross on the right things were a bit better for McClaren. Indeed, when Daryl Janmaat crossed incisively to Rivière, it took a quite brilliant block by Simon Francis to prevent the centre-forward from opening the scoring by shooting beyond Artur Boruc.\n\nYet if Newcastle’s right-back could claim he had very nearly created a goal, Janmaat would soon fail to help prevent Bournemouth registering one. When Josh King drifted out wide to the left and collected a characteristically intelligent ball from the influential Gradel, the forward was allowed to dispatch a cross which the stretching Steven Taylor inadvertently diverted beyond his wrong-footed goalkeeper.\n\nAs Taylor cursed, McClaren embarked on a tactical rejig. Off went Paul Dummett and on came the midfielder Vurnon Anita in a switch which saw Jack Colback relocated to Dummett’s old left-back station. Across in the adjacent technical area, Howe must have sensed his team had their hosts on the ropes. The visiting manager duly looked almost as disappointed as Taylor after Afobe’s rather am-dram tumble in the area under Colback’s challenge but, despite slight contact, the referee failed to buy the resultant penalty appeals.\n\nBournemouth had still done enough to ensure Newcastle were booed off – loudly – at the interval. The second half began with Mitrovic on for Rivière but, before the Serbia striker, could make his presence felt Elliot turned Smith’s low shot around a post.\n\nMame Biram Diouf strikes late to earn Stoke deserved draw at Chelsea Read more\n\nWith Ritchie continuing to smooth the supply lines to Afobe and King, Newcastle struggled to escape their own half. The exhortations to “Attack, attack, attack,” from the Gallowgate End seemed almost sarcastic.\n\nInstead home fans watched another visiting penalty appeal waved away as Gradel went down under Ayoze Pérez’s challenge before, eventually, Mitrovic escaped to curl a shot wide.\n\nBy now Shelvey had become so thoroughly frustrated he berated the disappointing Pérez. It got worse for McClaren when Ritchie cleverly played King in and the forward swivelled smartly before lashing his shot high beyond Elliot and on into the roof of the net.\n\nBy now St James’ was emptying but Shelvey and Pérez finally connected as the former’s fine through ball enabled the Spanish forward to beat Boruc courtesy of a subtly curved shot. With Charlie Daniels tricking Janmaat to shoot a stoppage-time third, left-footed, for Bournemouth, that Pérez-Shelvey cameo was to prove an academic footnote.

After 22 minutes Fabio Borini, in at the expense of Defoe, escaped down the right only for his low, angled drive to be blocked by an excellent covering tackle from Van Djik. Soon after, Southampton ought to have gone ahead, only to be foiled by an excellent Vito Mannone save after Dusan Tadic had reacted quickly to power a Graziano Pellè knockdown goalwards.\n\nJust after the half hour, Mannone’s opposite number was called into something resembling urgent action.

In splendid isolation out on the wing, Khazri clasped his head with both hands in sheer frustration.\n\nThe cold of the first half was augmented by torrential rain early in the second, although the deluge failed to dampen the enthusiasm of a vocal visiting support.

But we’ve given ourselves some breathing space and the most important thing is that we stay up. We worked awfully hard for this Premier League status and we don’t want to give it up.”\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson’s 61st-minute strike – his sixth goal in 10 games – settled a scrappy Liberty Stadium contest that failed to spark into life until the Iceland international finished from substitute Leroy Fer’s pass.\n\n“It was a poor game and both teams were caught up in the tension of the enormity of the game,” said Curtis. “They needed points like ourselves and it affected the play of both teams. We controlled the second half for long periods and got a goal from one of the best moves of the game. We were hanging on a bit at the end, not necessarily due to good play by Norwich, but because we got tense.\n\n“They could have equalised at the end but we deserved it over the second 45 minutes.

We’ve got nine games left and the crumb of comfort is that the teams by us have only picked up one point today – and we’ve still got those two teams at home.”\n\nNorwich had late chances to level when Nathan Redmond fired wide and Patrick Bamford’s near-post attempt was saved by the Swansea goalkeeper, Lukasz Fabianski.\n\n“It was a cagey affair,” said Neil. “Both teams were resolute and looked defensively solid, but they scored the goal when they had the chance.”"}, {"date": "05/03/2016", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20884, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name":

contest is sure to feature. It will also deserve a prominent place in any film commemorating Leicester City’s first top-flight title, a production that moved closer to being commissioned thanks to a victory that sent Claudio Ranieri’s team five points clear at the top of the table with nine matches to go. For Leicester, sporting immortality is tantalisingly close.\n\nOr, as Ranieri prefers to put it, sporting immortality is still miles away. “Five points are nothing,” insisted the Italian. “We know there will be another nine battles – but not just for us, for everybody. Nobody can say who will win the title.” He repeated, however, that no one can say Leicester are obliged to win it. “We aren’t nervous, our job is done,” he said. “The others spent a lot of money to win the title, we just have to enjoy an amazing season.”\n\nOnly winners of the much-anticipated north London derby were Leicester | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nRanieri knows that his attempts to play down title talk are becoming increasingly dubious – after claiming that he was not even aware of the result from the north London derby before kick-off at Watford he made a gesture to signify that his nose was lengthening – but what is palpably true is that his players betrayed no sign of jitters here. This difficult mission to Vicarage Road was accomplished with the tenacity, skill and nous of a side that senses it has the stuff of champions. This is a side emboldened by the opportunity before them.\n\nWatford did not make it easy for them. The hosts zipped forward from the start, tricky interplay between Troy Deeney and José Holebas culminating in a stinging shot from the Greek defender. Wes Morgan made a determined block.\n\nWithin a minute Leicester demonstrated their own attacking credentials. In a move about which every defence has now been forewarned but against which few can forearm themselves, Jamie Vardy whizzed on to a long pass from Christian Fuchs, outstripping defenders and skipping past the advancing goalkeeper at the edge of the area. Heurelho Gomes did at least force the striker wide and that allowed Nathan Aké, who was playing at centre-back rather than left-back because of a hamstring injury to Miguel Britos, to turn away Vardy’s shot.\n\nTwo minutes later Aké again saved Watford, this time beating Shinji Okazaki to a rebound after Gomes palmed away a crisp, low 20-yard drive by Fuchs. Aké remained central to the goalmouth action. In the 10th minute he popped up in the visiting box, leaping high to meet a free-kick by Ben Watson. His looping header bounced out off the crossbar.\n\nWatford were giving as good as they got in an engagingly open contest. But Vardy should have tilted it the way of the table-toppers midway through the first period. After outmuscling Sebastian Prödl in a fight for a breaking ball, the striker fed Mahrez and dashed goalward.\n\nMahrez unselfishly played the ball back to him as Gomes came out to narrow the angle but Vardy, under pressure from the retreating Prödl, poked wide of the near post from close range.\n\nThat miss prompted the home crowd to make unflattering comparisons between Vardy and Troy Deeney – presumably for the attention of the watching England manager, Roy Hodgson. Three minutes later Deeney had an opportunity to make the point in more elegant fashion, but his shot from 14 yards took a nick off Danny Simpson, presenting Kasper Schmeichel with a comfortable save.\n\nRanieri will never fail through inertia. He made two substitutions at half-time in an effort to give his team more control in midfield, introducing Jeff Schlupp and Andy King in place of Okazaki and Marc Albrighton.\n\nThe moves worked and N’Golo Kanté who, on his return from a hamstring injury, had been uncharacteristically bypassed in the first half, was much more influential in the second. But it still took a deadly flourish from Mahrez to make the breakthrough in the 56th minute.\n\nWatford 0-1 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nDefensive tutors will point to a weak clearing header by Holebas from a cross from Fuchs but everyone else will just enjoy a delicious finish by the Algerian, who took one touch near the 18-yard line before curling a left-footed shot into the top corner. There was nothing for Gomes to do other than admire the sheer class of it. It was Mahrez’s 15th goal of the season.\n\nMahrez’s blast was like rocket fuel to Leicester. In the following minutes they threatened to soar way beyond Watford. Gomes saved well from a header by Robert Huth before Leicester sent a series of passes across the face of goal, each one fractionally beyond a visiting player. Mahrez nearly reprised his opening goal in the 68th minute, from the other side and slightly farther out this time. Gomes made a good stop.\n\nOdion Ighalo could have strained Leicester’s nerves – assuming they have any – in the closing minutes but headed feebly at Schmeichel from six yards. Mahrez trudged off before the end, suffering from slight cramp. “He wanted to stay on but his work was done,” said Ranieri.

But the storm that has the Arsenal manager and his team in its grip shows no sign of abating.\n\nArsenal suffer ‘confidence issue’ as Petr Cech injured in Swansea defeat Read more\n\nAfter the abject 3-2 defeat at Manchester United on Sunday, which provoked an outpouring from the club’s supporters, this was an occasion when victory was a prerequisite. They were even up against a weakened Swansea City team.\n\nBut after a bright start it was shocking how they lost their way. Wayne Routledge, a former Tottenham winger, cancelled out Joel Campbell’s opening goal on 32 minutes and thereafter Arsenal looked like a team whose confidence was in tatters.\n\nThe home crowd vented their frustration, with howls following each lapse as the minutes ticked down, and Wenger’s players could not cope. They shrunk and it was no great surprise when Ashley Williams plundered the winner from a free-kick whipped in by the substitute, Gylfi Sigurdsson, another former Spurs player.\n\nThere were the usual accoutrements to an Arsenal defeat, with injuries providing a damaging footnote. Laurent Koscielny was unavailable because of a calf problem while Petr Cech, the goalkeeper, appeared to injure a groin as he ran back after coming up for a last-gasp corner. Both of them will now miss Saturday’s derby at Spurs.\n\nThe tension simmered among the Arsenal fans and there were eruptions as Olivier Giroud struggled in front of goal at the outset and Wenger made the decision on 64 minutes to substitute Campbell, who had been one of the team’s better performers. The full-time whistle brought a chorus of boos.\n\nWenger argued the toss about misfortune. Arsenal hit the woodwork three times while Swansea had two attempts on target and scored from each of them. But this was no hard-luck story, merely a continuation of the Groundhog Day plot-line that has clung to the club and driven their support to distraction.\n\nSwansea’s Francesco Guidolin admitted to hospital and misses Arsenal game Read more\n\nThe gap to the leaders, Leicester City, is not onerous – it stands at six points with 10 matches to play – but it might as well be a chasm. Wenger’s team must pull themselves together and away from a return of only nine points from the last available 21, but they are on their knees at the moment. It is easy to paint the derby at White Hart Lane as a terrifying prospect for them.\n\nSwansea were without their head coach, Francesco Guidolin, who had been admitted to hospital in London having failed to shake off the lung infection that has afflicted him since last week. He and his squad had stayed in the capital since Sunday’s defeat at Tottenham and Alan Curtis, the coach, said that Guidolin would not be discharged until Friday.\n\nGuidolin had picked the team and it was one with an eye on the games that the club have coming up against more immediate rivals. Swansea play Norwich at home on Saturday, then face Bournemouth away and Aston Villa at home.\n\nThere were seven changes from the Spurs match, with a Premier League debut for a 21-year-old Scottish left-back, Stephen Kingsley. According to Curtis, Kingsley finished with his “calves and hamstrings cramping and his back going”. But he could savour a significant tonic in Swansea’s fight for survival.\n\nArsenal controlled the opening 25 minutes. They hit a post through Alexis Sánchez and they went ahead when Campbell slid for Sánchez’s chipped ball into the area, snaked out his left leg and hooked an expert finish into the far corner.\n\nGiroud endured some nervous moments. In for Theo Walcott, the Arsenal scapegoat of the moment, he misplaced a backheel and finished weakly in the early running. He had also snatched at the very first chance of the match and on 41 minutes he smashed a volley against the crossbar from 10 yards after Per Mertesacker’s cushioned header back.\n\nCurtis tweaked his tactics, moving the dangerous Andre Ayew to the right and Routledge to the left, but the equaliser, shortly after Leroy Fer had fizzed a shot over, was marked by simplicity.\n\nArsenal v Swansea City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nJack Cork sent Routledge clean through after Jordi Amat had contested a Cech clearance with Mesut Özil. Amat was all over Özil and the ball broke off the Arsenal playmaker. Wenger argued that Bafétimbi Gomis ought to have been flagged for offside on Cork’s through-ball but he was not interfering with the play. Routledge’s finish was ice cool for his first goal since January 2015.\n\nArsenal became more and more ragged while Swansea grew. Sánchez had a couple of flickers before the home crowd saw red when Fer went down on 62 minutes and Arsenal chose to stop the play; they are too nice to play on.\n\nSigurdsson made the difference. He almost scored after a burst on to Ayew’s pass, going round Cech but failing to finish, but after Sánchez had seen a free-kick deflect and come back off the crossbar, the Icelander helped Swansea into the lead. Following his delivery the Arsenal defence froze, Cech flapped and Williams bundled home.

"Warm weather training in Spain is possibly not the ideal preparation for sub-Arctic conditions in Stoke but Newcastle United were coping with the chill factor until Xherdan Shaqiri struck 10 minutes from time to turn up the heat on Steve McClaren.\n\nAn unerring swing of Shaqiri’s left boot lifted Stoke above Chelsea and Southampton in the table and left Newcastle stuck in the bottom three, looking on with envy as their relegation rivals Swansea won at Arsenal to move six points above the drop zone. A draw would not have been an injustice on a night when driving, icy winds made football difficult, as it was not one of Stoke’s more impressive performances and the travelling supporters must have left wondering when conditions will favour a Newcastle recovery if a fortnight off could not do the trick.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri, Stoke’s Power Cube with the Kung Fu Panda touches | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nBournemouth at home on Saturday presents an obvious opportunity but anything less than a win will spell trouble. “It’s still in our hands, Saturday becomes huge for us now,” said McClaren. “We have talked about becoming harder to beat and we started that process tonight.” More controversially the Newcastle manager said he thought he detected improvement in his side, though it turned out he was basing that assessment on the abject performance in the last game at Chelsea.\n\nThis was such a scrappy, squally game it was obvious the first goal or moment of skill might settle it and so it proved, even though the breakthrough took 80 minutes to arrive. Shaqiri turned up in the middle instead of marauding down the right and beat a statuesque Rob Elliot from a good couple of yards outside the area with a crisp shot the goalkeeper evidently did not see coming.\n\nThe first half had been a largely featureless affair, notable only for the two shirtless cheerleaders among Newcastle’s support giving in to the cold and getting dressed after 15 minutes, and the quality of Shaqiri’s crosses into Newcastle’s penalty area. Had there been anyone of similar quality on the end of them the game might not have gone so long without a goal but they all eluded Jon Walters and no other Stoke players ever got near enough.\n\nNewcastle were even less ambitious, content mostly to admire Stoke’s neat build-ups and keep them at bay on the edge of their area. Jonjo Shelvey brought a save from Jack Butland as early as the fifth minute, though the shot was tame in the extreme and neither Newcastle nor their captain managed much else on target in the first 45 minutes.\n\nNot that Stoke’s shot count was much more impressive. For all the cultured touches shown by Ibrahim Afellay and Marko Arnautovic, the main threat was always Shaqiri, who forced a save from Elliot when he grew tired of crossing and cut inside for a shot.\n\nNewcastle’s hesitant approach was neatly summed up when Georginio Wijnaldum played Moussa Sissoko through on goal on the stroke of the interval. A more confident striker might have made more of the opportunity or at least managed a shot. Sissoko did not react sharply enough and allowed the American Geoff Cameron to check back and dispossess him.\n\nAfter Cameron wasted an overlap opportunity with a feeble cross into Elliot’s arms, Mark Hughes made an overdue substitution and sent on Peter Crouch. If ever there was a night for a direct approach this was it, though it was Shaqiri who went straight for goal, cutting out the new target man.\n\nNewcastle might have pulled a goal back in the closing minutes but for a superb reaction save from Butland to keep out Seydou Doumbia’s shot, before Arnautovic ended the match by hitting Elliot’s bar. “Butland is becoming a bit of a curse for us, he made four magnificent saves at St James Park and now he has cost us a deserved point,” McClaren said afterwards.\n\nHughes did not quite see it that way. “Over the course of a season an outstanding keeper earns you points,” the Stoke manager said. “Jack is doing exactly that and it is the sign of a great keeper still to be able to react after not having much to do for most of the game.”"}, {"date":

It was not that Tottenham Hotspur were thrashed or even outclassed, in the East End. There were periods during a frantic second half when they had threatened to claw back the deficit suffered early on and had they pilfered an equaliser, they would have departed buoyed as if in victory. West Ham United, after all, are a resurgent force and now a team who have the scent of the Champions League places.\n\nTottenham have no excuses for West Ham defeat, admits Pochettino Read more\n\nYet, for all that there is no disgrace in succumbing to these opponents, Spurs’ uncharacteristic hesitancy was troubling. The pangs of anxiety had gripped through a one-sided first half, rendering their approach tentative and ineffective. Mauricio Pochettino denied it but the suspicion was that this was the first evidence of nerves undermining the club’s pursuit of a first league championship in 55 years. This team, the youngest in the Premier League, were supposed to be fearless, blissfully unaware of everything that could yet be achieved this season. And yet here they had initially been diminished in the face of their hosts’ aggression and eclipsed by their energy. Those traits were supposed to be their own.\n\nEven when they roused themselves after the interval, forcing West Ham back largely through Christian Eriksen’s tireless running and clever probing, anxiety still unnerved their approach. Harry Kane, the team’s only attacking focal point but a lone striker starved of service for long periods, summed that up by snatching at two close-range opportunities.\n\nThe England forward had been unable to contort his body to convert in the six-yard box, under pressure from Cheikhou Kouyaté, after Adrián had done wonderfully well to push away Toby Alderweireld’s swerving attempt from distance.\n\nWhen Christain Eriksen sent over a delicious centre moments later Kane mistimed his stretch and could only dribble the attempt wide from just beyond the back post. There has been only one goal from open play in eight matches and, at some stage, there may have to be an acknowledgment that the weight of this team’s schedule – this was a ninth game in 32 days – could be having a blunting effect.\n\nAdrián in the home goal was not tested at all in the first half and only rather sporadically when Tottenham held greater sway. Certainly the post-match shuffle towards the away support to demonstrate their appreciation, and the gloom in the dressing room long after the final whistle, suggested this was an opportunity missed.\n\nThe visit of Arsenal on Saturday has suddenly been transformed into a test of character. Spurs can still top the division, for a few hours at least, by winning the north London derby. Given the idiosyncratic nature of the title race – Leicester’s point on Tuesday had looked wasteful but actually represented the sole reward for any of the top four in midweek – this need not prove an arithmetically damaging loss. But, psychologically, it seems far more significant.\n\nThe top flight’s stingiest defence had been bullied, with Alderweireld and Kevin Wimmer tormented by Emmanuel Emenike’s channel-running, hassling and harrying. The centre-halves were both booked and it would not have been a surprise had Wimmer been dismissed before the end.\n\nTottenham hobbled by anxiety for first time in title run at West Ham | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nWest Ham merited their success, their prolonged send-off from the Boleyn Ground having still not contained a defeat since August. This result mirrored Saturday’s success over Sunderland, a win achieved courtesy of a sole Michail Antonio goal scored relatively early, and was illuminated by flashes of brilliance from Dimitri Payet and leggy industry up and down the lineup. Their pressing disoriented the visitors, who are used to imposing their own upbeat rhythm. They forced early errors, confusion between Ben Davies and Nacer Chadli needlessly presenting the hosts with an early corner which Payet whipped in to the near post. There it was met emphatically by Antonio, the right wing-back having dizzied Chadli too easily with his movement to earn a yard of space from the befuddled winger. The ball flew in via Hugo Lloris’ left hand.\n\nIt was the fourth successive home match in which the summer signing from Nottingham Forest had scored, and it should have been followed by further first-half reward. Lloris, jittery particularly from back-passes throughout on a treacherous surface, did well to push away Mark Noble’s attempt from distance but only a series of desperate blocks prevented West Ham going further ahead.\n\n“Even to match a team that has conceded the fewest goals in the Premier League, scored the most, [are] all about running and pressing and whose confidence is sky high, you have to play very well,” said Slaven Bilic. “It’s not about being lucky. You have to deserve it. I might be biased but they should have been more happy with the result than us. It could have been more. We were simply magnificent.”\n\nThe same, for once, cannot be said of Spurs. They go into the north London derby with another point to prove."}, {"date": "02/03/2016", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 43597, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Flanagan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [41], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [57], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "What might have been was the question on everyone’s lips at Anfield. For Liverpool it was the thought of what could have transpired in the Capital One Cup final as Jürgen Klopp’s side exacted swift revenge on Manchester City with a commanding Premier League display. For City it stemmed from the relief that Manuel Pellegrini’s departure was not announced earlier.\n\nLiverpool 3-0 Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nA team with designs on the title were beaten comprehensively. Adam Lallana inspired Liverpool to a Premier League double over their Wembley conquerors and, somewhere in Leicester, Claudio Ranieri had another reason to toast his point against West Bromwich Albion 24 hours earlier. It is one win and three consecutive defeats in the league for City since Pep Guardiola was confirmed as Pellegrini’s replacement on 1 February. Their endeavour has declined markedly and they were second best in every department as Liverpool won with something to spare courtesy of goals from the man of the match Lallana, James Milner and Roberto Firmino. Forget the title, Guardiola will not inherit a team in the Champions League on this form – unless City win the competition this season.\n\nPellegrini, who made three changes to Sunday’s starting lineup compared with Klopp’s five, said: “I am not thinking about the title and not thinking about qualifying for the Champions League. The most important thing is to recover our performance in the next Premier League game because we have lost the last three. Of course we cannot play in the way we did today. We conceded three goals and did not shoot once at the Liverpool goal.\n\n“But it was because we were not fresh. From the beginning I could see we were not fresh. Liverpool had more energy and played at a higher pace. They could make more changes. We didn’t have any midfielders to change without Yaya Touré. We had just defenders or one striker to make the change.”\n\nThat argument did not sit comfortably with Klopp, whose team also played 120 minutes on Sunday and had a European game last midweek. “Being tired at this moment of the season is absolutely nothing to talk about because everybody could be,” he said. Liverpool’s reaction to defeat in the Capital One Cup final, however, left their manager enthralled. “I am too old to say: ‘Yes, we will play like this all the time’ – but you saw what is possible. Everyone who loves Liverpool could watch this game and forget for 93 minutes that we lost on Sunday.”\n\nThe excellent Jon Flanagan, making his first league start since May 2014, set the tone for a fast, aggressive display from Liverpool inside the first minute when he sent his former team-mate Raheem Sterling flying with a challenge from the hard but fair manual. Sterling was made aware of Flanagan’s presence when barged over in front of the Kop 10 minutes later. The £49m winger wilted and was withdrawn at half-time with Anfield revelling in the ignominy.\n\nFollowing an incident-free opening Liverpool took the lead with a goal that was greeted with a second’s silence as the crowd, and Klopp, computed what had unfolded. Milner released Lallana into space inside the City half and, with no defender closing him down, the midfielder accepted the invitation to shoot from distance. Lallana’s effort lacked pace but it had accuracy. It also found in Joe Hart a goalkeeper struggling to move his feet and the ball had nestled inside the near post before Anfield erupted. “My only surprise was that he shot,” Klopp said.\n\nXherdan Shaqiri strikes for Stoke City as Newcastle United feel the chill Read more\n\nThe second was immediately acclaimed for the fine team goal it was. Lallana was again involved, back-heeling Flanagan’s pass down the right inside to Firmino who opened the City defence with a first-time pass. The former City midfielder Milner was first to the ball and, before Pablo Zabaleta could intervene, Hart’s goal had been pierced in the same place for a second time.\n\nPellegrini introduced the strikers Wilfried Bony and Kelechi Iheanacho but City’s threat remained non-existent. Liverpool worked tirelessly to protect Simon Mignolet on his 100th league appearance for the club while working in packs to unnerve City’s defence. Milner, Lallana and Firmino provided constant support to the industrious Divock Origi and City were shredded for a third time before the hour.\n\nLallana was instrumental again but Nicolás Otamendi’s role could not be ignored.

When Juan Mata belted home a sweet 20-yard free-kick that proved the winner there were seven minutes remaining and the way he wheeled away in celebration spoke of how the Spaniard had transformed the match.\n\nMichail Antonio strikes early to hand West Ham victory over Tottenham Read more\n\nUnited had been heading for a goalless draw and the gaining of only one point on Manchester City, who lost at Liverpool, and with West Ham United beating Tottenham, Louis van Gaal’s side would have dropped a place to sixth. Instead, with 10 matches left, United have the same 47 points as City and are fifth only on goal difference.\n\nAll of this was achieved despite 11 players being out injured. “We have four wins in a row, fantastic, but we have a very small selection at the moment,” Van Gaal said. “We are still in the possibility of being in the top four and I don’t think that’s bad. We’re in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and the last 16 of the Europa League. But it also means it’s a full programme.”\n\nVan Gaal had come close to taking off Mata before the playmaker scored. “He was limping,” the manager said. “I am very happy I let him stay.”\n\nMarcus Rashford made his third consecutive start and on the 25th anniversary of Ryan Giggs’s first game for United there was a full debut for Tim Fosu-Mensah. The 18-year-old lined up next to Daley Blind because Michael Carrick was rested. The two Dutchmen were asked to marshal the muscular strike duo of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo and Van Gaal was particularly pleased how they coped.\n\n“Timothy has saved us several times because of his speed, so I was pleased he was on the pitch. He wanted to go off but I wanted him to stay on,” Van Gaal said. “He had to play against Ighalo, a handful for a centre-half, and he did it fantastically.”\n\nFosu-Mensah engaged in a 50-50 tackle with Deeney that the Watford captain certainly felt and there was further impressive play when the youngster dispossessed Ighalo in the area when timing was the essence.\n\nAnthony Martial returned to the team for a match Van Gaal hoped to win to record United’s first consecutive league victories since defeating Watford in November. The 20-year-old had their opening chance when Ander Herrera picked him out but his header was easily gathered by Heurelho Gomes.\n\nLiverpool revenge is swift and sweet against all-at-sea Manchester City Read more\n\nAfter Morgan Schneiderlin had brought gasps from the crowd with a long-range volley, Watford carved United apart. Étienne Capoue was enjoying himself along the left and from there he fashioned a cross that was flicked on by Deeney to Ighalo whose shot served as a warning.\n\nAs the 30-minute mark passed Rashford had barely touched the ball but he was about to come to life. His swivel and toe-poke made a mug of Sebastian Prödl and drew a foul from the Watford defender.\n\nMemphis Depay took the free-kick but his delivery went straight to Gomes. The forward had misfired throughout the first half, which was largely the story of United’s stuttering play. Watford could have been two ahead, Ighalo twice being denied by the reflexes of David de Gea.\n\nThe hope was that the second half would be an improvement. Capoue had been the brightest player and he gave United a scare with a fierce 30-yard shot that sailed only a little high.\n\nThere was further concern when Watford went close from a corner they won after a terrible Blind miskick. Ben Watson swung in the ball and Prödl’s header was beaten out at the near post by the excellent De Gea.\n\nMata was captain for the match and his rescue act began with two shots before engineering a move in which Rashford crossed when he might have tried to finish.

The sight of Romelu Lukaku scoring Everton’s third, on the hour mark, had prompted many to make for the exits even earlier than planned on another chastening evening for the club.\n\nIt was not exactly a mass exodus later in the game, when a couple of thousand left their seats as part of the Out the Door on 74 campaign, but there was no escaping the hostility in the air, with the mood close to mutinous at times as the supporters made their feelings known.\n\nEverton’s new majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri likely to increase stake Read more\n\nTom Fox, the chief executive, was subjected to some abusive chants as he looked on from the directors’ box and moments later “We want Lerner out” reverberated around the stadium. Randy Lerner, of course, is nowhere to be seen, with the Villa owner more detached than ever from a club that remain eight points adrift of safety with only 10 games remaining. It is a case of when, not if, Villa will be relegated.\n\nRudy Gestede, a substitute for the anonymous Gabriel Agbonlahor, pulled a goal back but by that stage Everton were coasting to a routine victory in a match when Lukaku wrote his name into their record books and the visiting supporters basked in anticipation of their club’s expected new wealth.\n\nRamiro Funes Mori set them on their way and later claimed an assist, Aaron Lennon added the second following a fine counterattack and Rémi Garde’s side were in damage-limitation mode by the time Lukaku scored his 17th league goal of the season – the best return for an Everton player in the Premier League era.\n\nThe result lifts Roberto Martínez’s team to 10th in the table and completes a highly satisfactory few days for Everton, coming on the back of the news that Farhad Moshiri, a British-Iranian billionaire, is to become their major shareholder and, in sharp contrast to the dismal state of affairs at Aston Villa, herald what promises to be a bright new era at Goodison Park.\n\nWhich Premier League club will emerge from the pack and avoid relegation? Read more\n\n“It’s been a significant week,” Martínez said. “I know we’ve been talking about it a lot but it is important. I think you could see that sense of excitement throughout the fans, throughout everyone at [the training ground] Finch Farm and it’s great to welcome our new partner at the football club with a win and a positive feeling, and I’m sure he’ll be delighted with the performance.”\n\nAs for Lukaku, Martínez expects the club’s record signing to push on now. “I thought his overall contribution was very important and I’m delighted for him to reach that level,” he said. “But I know from now until the end of the season he’s got an incredible focus to increase that figure as much as he can. He’s a man that, at 22, clearly has the world at his feet.”\n\nEverton could not have wished for a better start as Villa’s woeful defending at set pieces was again exposed. Micah Richards had the straightforward task of marking Funes Mori but lost his man to the point the Everton defender had a free header from Kevin Mirallas’s corner. There were only five minutes on the clock and a familiar story was already unfolding.\n\nAlthough Joel Robles made a decent save to tip Ashley Westwood’s raking drive around a post, Everton were comfortable and it was no surprise when they added a second. Ross Barkley picked up possession from Phil Jagielka inside his own half and carried the ball 30 yards before releasing Mirallas in the inside-left channel. The Belgian looked up and squared perfectly into the path of Lennon, who slotted the ball through the legs of both Joleon Lescott and the goalkeeper Brad Guzan.\n\nLescott later cleared a Bryan Oviedo shot off the line and Guzan produced a point-blank stop to keep out a header from Lukaku, but the inevitable third goal soon arrived. Funes Mori, in so much space on the Everton right after a corner was only half-cleared, crossed for Lukaku to turn the ball home with a thigh. By the time Gestede headed home Jordan Veretout’s centre, in the 79th minute, Villa Park had started to empty.\n\n“I’m not been here for a long time enough to assess the behaviour of everybody,” said Garde, when asked about the Villa supporters’ protest. “I respect the fans because they are totally part of the club but I have to respect as well my position and the people who put me in this position.\n\n“I concentrate my energy on what I am asked to do, which is to try to win games with this squad of players.”\n\nA thankless task if ever there was one."}, {"date": "01/03/2016", "arena":

Step forward then, Benik Afobe. Bournemouth’s record signing illuminated an unexceptional performance by nodding home his first goal in four matches to earn the Cherries their first league victory against Southampton for 58 years.\n\nHis strike partner, Joshua King, had looked brighter even though his partner had given birth to their baby son Noah on the morning of the match. King was economical with the truth when describing the experience to his manager, Eddie Howe. “I’ve not really slept much,” King said. “The gaffer phoned me and I lied and said I got a couple of hours in. This means a lot to our fans, beating our rivals.”\n\nDiego Costa’s offside winner for Chelsea puts Norwich deeper in the mire Read more\n\nKing showed plenty of spark here, and played a part in the first goal by beating José Fonte to the ball on the right flank before being fouled. Matt Ritchie fizzed in the resulting free-kick, which was pushed away from goal by Fraser Forster’s giant right hand before the Bournemouth defender Steve Cook hooked the ball into the net. Bournemouth’s players duly surrounded King to celebrate his new-born and his role in the opener.\n\nCook’s second goal of the season gave Bournemouth a deserved lead, after a bright start. Ritchie was instrumental from the off and forced Forster into action inside the first 60 seconds with a stinging low drive after good work from King, who partnered Afobe in a newly adopted 4-4-2 formation. Meanwhile Max Gradel, making his first start since returning from an anterior cruciate ligament injury, made sure Cédric Soares endured a difficult evening.\n\nThe Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, was evidently far from happy with his side’s sluggish start. “If you asked every player of Southampton if they won or lost more battles, all of the 10 on the pitch will recognise that they lost more,” he added, giving a frank summary of his side’s lacklustre showing.\n\nThe Dutchman had made three changes to the side that started Saturday’s defeat by Chelsea, preferring Maya Yoshida to Matt Targett in defence while Steven Davis and Jordy Clasie also dropped to the bench, but after just 35 minutes he changed his side once again, replacing Yoshida with Davis.\n\nMoments before half-time the stadium fell eerily silent as both technical areas frantically gestured for the match to be halted. The fourth official, Kevin Friend, had fainted after hitting his head on the Southampton dugout. Friend was conscious as he was taken to hospital after receiving treatment in the tunnel, and Dean Treleaven replaced him for the second period, which started five minutes later than scheduled.\n\nSouthampton’s Charlie Austin endured a difficult return to the club where he spent six weeks on trial in 2009, when they had been unable to sign him because of a transfer embargo. He missed a gilt‑edged chance early on for the visitors, before being forced off with a hamstring injury after an hour.\n\nKoeman confirmed after the match that Austin, making just his second Southampton start, would be sidelined for several weeks. His replacement, Graziano Pellè, whose ineffective display as a second-half substitute against Chelsea saw him jeered when in possession, was ordered on to bruise an otherwise comfortable Bournemouth backline. Shane Long, who had been doubtful for this match after suffering from cramp on Saturday, was forced off minutes later.\n\nAfobe rounded off a frustrating evening for Southampton in the 79th minute, heading in from another marvellous Ritchie delivery, this time from a right-wing free-kick. Bournemouth are now eight points above the relegation zone and it is looking increasingly likely that this fixture will be repeated next season. “It feels like a really big night for the club and our supporters,” Howe said. “For our survival hopes it is a massive result as well.”\n\nThis was a chastising defeat for Koeman, who admitted his players lacked the motivation to match Bournemouth’s work rate. Southampton rarely tested their former goalkeeper, Artur Boruc, and Charlie Daniels shackled Sadio Mané superbly, prompting Koeman to praise Daniels’ display in his post-match press conference. “Normally I try to defend the players but not today because I think [Bournemouth] were more hungry than we were on the pitch,” he said. “They were hungry and winning challenges that we did not from the first second. That’s not tactics, that’s belief, character, mentality and spirit.

They had given everything and, on this evidence, no one can question their nerve or spirit of togetherness but, ultimately, it has to rank as a disappointing result for the team chasing the most implausible title of the Premier League years.\n\nThe bare facts are Ranieri’s men have taken only four points from their last three games and will be knocked off the summit for the first time in almost six weeks if Spurs win at West Ham on Wednesday night. Leicester had to come from behind after Salomón Rondón’s early goal and, having turned the game upside down before half-time, they will be desperately frustrated not to record the victory that would have moved them five points clear.\n\nLeicester’s Claudio Ranieri still confident over title chances despite West Brom draw Read more\n\nAt the same time, it was some effort Leicester put in during that late onslaught of the West Brom goal and, by the end, they had at least answered some of the questions that invariably come up at this time of the season about the strength of personality of the title challengers.\n\nWes Morgan, their centre-half, spent part of that period operating as an auxiliary striker, almost winning the game in a breathless finale featuring a string of splendid saves from Ben Foster. Ranieri’s substitutions were bold and adventurous and, barring their inability to find a winning goal, there was not an awful lot wrong with the home team. “I look at the performance,” Ranieri said, “and the performance was fantastic.”\n\nThese are the moments when potential champions have to show they can cope when the heat of the battle is dangerously close to intolerable and Leicester’s response to the early setback, hitting back with Danny Drinkwater’s deflected effort and a goal for Andy King in first-half stoppage-time, was the perfect riposte to anyone thinking they may not be strong enough mentally.\n\nYet they were playing a side who pride themselves on being obdurate opponents. Tony Pulis had packed his defence with four six-footers. His team were lined up in an old-fashioned 4-4-2 system with the central midfielders, Darren Fletcher and Claudio Yakob, rarely straying too far forward, and when they took an 11th-minute lead it was clear this was going to be a match when Leicester needed to show all their competitive courage.\n\nFletcher’s through ball was weighted beautifully but Rondón still had to beat Robert Huth for pace and, even more impressively, body strength. There are not many strikers who get past Huth that way but Rondón is built like a nightclub bouncer and showed great determination to win the battle. Huth was knocked aside by the Venezuelan and, as Kasper Schmeichel charged to the edge of his penalty area, Rondón turned the ball through the goalkeeper’s legs.\n\nThat was the first goal Leicester have conceded at home since Loïc Rémy scored for Chelsea on 14 December, a run lasting seven hours and 54 minutes in match time. Would Leicester wilt? Could they deal with the pressure? The answer was emphatic. Ranieri’s men quickly shook their heads clear and, for all their skill and commitment, they also had the kind of good fortune that all sides in their position need, with Jonas Olsson inadvertently sending Drinkwater’s long-range attempt looping over his own goalkeeper for the equaliser.\n\nSuddenly the game had entirely changed complexion. Within six minutes, Jamie Vardy’s header had come back off the crossbar from Drinkwater’s left-wing delivery and then there was a glorious moment for a player who epitomises the story that has been unfolding in this part of the East Midlands. Nine years ago this week, King was part of the Leicester side facing Stockport County and Cheltenham Town in League One. King was starting for only the seventh time this season and calmly swept his shot past Foster after Marc Albrighton’s cross had been turned back with an exquisite touch from Riyad Mahrez.\n\nThe atmosphere was euphoric going into the interval but it was only five minutes after the restart that West Brom punctured the mood for a second time. This time Mahrez was penalised for handball and, 25 yards out, Gardner’s free-kick was struck expertly, combining just the right amount of pace and curve to find the top corner and leave Schmeichel rooted to the spot.\n\nOnce again, Leicester faced a test of nerve and responded straight away with another wave of attacking. Shinji Okazaki headed Albrighton’s cross against the bar and there was a regular threat from Vardy and, in particular, the elusive Mahrez. Leicester had to make do without N’Golo Kanté, their energetic midfielder, but King filled in seamlessly alongside Drinkwater.\n\nEqually, this was not a match when Pulis could be accused of ultra-defensive tactics. Rondón’s physical presence created plenty of problems and he will probably feel he should have scored again with a close-range effort midway through the second half. West Brom were trying to win three league fixtures in a row for the first time since November 2012 and Gardner had other chances from long distance. Yet they lived dangerously during the last 10 minutes, a story of several near-misses, some outstanding goalkeeping and almost incessant pressure. “We defended heroically,” Pulis said. “And we had to.”"}, {"date": "01/03/2016", "arena": "Carrow Road", "attendance": 27091, "home_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ivo Pinto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timm Klose", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [68], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexander Tettey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [36]}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [13], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Hoolahan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [36], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [1], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bertrand Traoré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [44], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baba Rahman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexandre Pato", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Norwich City must wince at how cruel life in the Premier League can be at times. This was a brutal defeat, a match lost to a Chelsea goal that should have been ruled out for offside and despite a second-half revival that constantly threatened but failed to produce an equaliser. And with Sunderland’s draw against Crystal Palace sending Norwich into the bottom three, it may take some time for them to recover from this.\n\nThey had retained hope right up until the final exchanges against the revived champions, stoppage time at the end producing a frantic Norwich onslaught with the home supporters wailing in dismay as efforts flew against the advertising hoardings and into the side-netting.\n\nBenik Afobe rises to the occasion as Bournemouth beat Southampton Read more\n\nThe sight of Gary O’Neil wild-eyed beneath a bloodied bandage after a collision of heads with his team-mate Robbie Brady, who was left spitting out two teeth and the tip of another, not to mention Alex Tettey going to hospital for a precautionary X-ray on a leg, rather summed up Norwich’s evening. For all their spirited endeavour, they must feel battered and bruised inside.\n\nGary Cahill described that furious finale as “horrible” to endure even if the Norwich manager, Alex Neil, is growing sick of the sob stories. “We had the better opportunities at Leicester but lost, were 2-0 up to West Ham and drew, and were 3-1 up against Liverpool and lost,” he said. “When that’s a continuous thing, it doesn’t boil down to luck. Quality shows. We missed opportunities today that we should have taken. Their second goal is offside but when you’re at the bottom …”\n\nHe seemed too deflated even to direct much ire at the assistant referee, Mike McDonough, for failing to raise his flag at the end of the first half when Bertrand Traoré, on his first start for Chelsea, guided a pass through for Diego Costa to collect. The Spain forward had been standing alone and clearly ahead of the Norwich backline when the ball was played, his finish clipped expertly over John Ruddy for his 10th goal in 14 games under Guus Hiddink.\n\n“I made them aware that he’d got it wrong at half-time and you’d expect him to get that right,” Neil said, “but I’m not going to sit here saying: ‘Poor us, luck’s not on our side.’”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Diego Costa celebrates scoring at Norwich. Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt least it did not floor Norwich. They deserved credit for the second-half revival during which the playmaker Wes Hoolahan slipped a pass between Kenedy and Branislav Ivanovic for the eager Nathan Redmond to thump first time beyond Thibaut Courtois.\n\nBut despite that finish from the winger, who was a nuisance throughout, Neil acknowledged profligacy had played a key part in this team’s defeat. Cameron Jerome twice looped headers wide, though it was his close-range volley from Russell Martin’s nod back that should have provided him with his second goal since Halloween. Courtois was helpless, as were Oscar and Ivanovic on the line, but Jerome’s attempt clipped the bar.\n\nChelsea breathed again. They are now eighth, back in the top half of the table for the first time since the summer transfer window was ticking towards deadline, and only five points off Manchester United in fifth place.\n\nThere was promise in the displays of Traoré and Eden Hazard, and Kenedy’s bright opening from left-back. Norwich’s three-man defensive barrier had been breached in the opening 39 seconds, the Brazilian collecting from Hazard to scurry at Ivo Pinto, swerve away from a tentative Tettey, and find room against the hesitant Ryan Bennett before firing across the diving Ruddy for the quickest Premier League goal of the season.\n\nHiddink was left to bemoan his side’s inability to kill off the contest in the exchanges before Costa’s controversial second goal, though, by the end, the targets for Chelsea had switched.\n\n“Are United catchable? Well, first of all, it’s not Chelsea standard to be happy just to be well away of the relegation zone and then to sit back and relax a bit, so we set new targets now in the direction of Europe,” Chelsea’s interim manager said. “If we keep everyone available, we’d like to go as high as possible towards the European spots.”"}, {"date": "01/03/2016", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance":

The centre-forward’s undoubted promise may have been largely unfulfilled during his time on Wearside but his two expertly taken second-half goals ensured Sam Allardyce’s side were left to seek consolation from Fabio Borini’s extraordinary 90th-minute equaliser struck from what seemed an impossibly tight angle.\n\nIf a point is better than nothing, it did not really satisfy either Allardyce, who had described victory as imperative, or Alan Pardew, whose once highly flying team have now gone 11 Premier League games without a win.\n\nAston Villa fans in walkout protest as Everton stroll increases dissent Read more\n\nAt least Sunderland climbed out of the bottom three – on goal difference from Norwich – for the first time since November. “There’s relief, frustration and panic,” Allardyce said. “I think my heart-rate monitor was doing about 140. We can’t keep a clean sheet and we lost control but Fabio Borini’s wonder goal got us a point. It was the best goal of the season across the Premier League.”\n\nPardew was left in glass-half-full mode and acknowledged that the draw leaves his side unlikely to be sucked into the relegation skirmish. “It was a game we perhaps should have won but when we wake up in the morning we’ll probably think a draw wasn’t a bad result,” he said. “It was very important not to lose.”\n\nIt is no coincidence Palace’s tumble down the table has coincided with Yannick Bolasie’s injury-induced absence but Bolasie was back wide on the left in a 4-2-3-1 starting formation. Despite not seeming entirely match fit, he swiftly made his presence felt while seeming to spark a suddenly dribbling, dummying, Wilfried Zaha into life.\n\nYet if Bolasie’s crossing ability and disconcerting change of pace dictated that Sunderland – and DeAndre Yedlin especially – could never really relax, an increasingly frustrated Palace – and Yohan Cabaye in particular – were still not quite clicking.\n\nOdd cameos from Wahbi Khazri apart, Sunderland proved similarly short of creativity and incision where it mattered. When Wayne Hennessey was forced into a rare save from Jack Rodwell it seemed thoroughly emblematic that the midfielder – preferred to the benched Lee Cattermole – shot straight at the visiting goalkeeper’s throat.\n\nPalace sensed opportunity and when Scott Dann met Cabaye’s corner it took a fabulous fingertip save from Vito Mannone to defy the usual laws of physics and somehow divert the defender’s header from six yards to safety. Moments later Dann looked inconsolable after Dame N’Doye drifted inside from the right, met Jermain Defoe’s pass and, from around 25 yards, dispatched an apparently benign shot that took a hefty deflection off the centre-half’s boot before looping beyond the wrong-footed Hennessey.\n\nBuoyed by scoring for the first time since arriving on loan from Trabzonspor in January, N’Doye could not stop smiling. With three of his six Premier League goals having come against Palace – the others were for Hull – the forward clearly likes playing Pardew’s men.\n\nDann must harbour contrasting emotions about Sunderland; it had been his extraordinary, uncharacteristic slip which had gifted Defoe the Wearsiders’ winner in a 1-0 victory at Selhurst Park last November.\n\nBack then all the talk was of Palace gate-crashing football’s European party and Pardew quite possibly managing England. Four months on the Championship rather than the Champions League might have been preying on their minds had Younès Kaboul not headed wastefully over the bar from close range.\n\nThe moment had arrived for Wickham to change everything by jogging his former public’s memory with two swift goals. The striker – less than prolific in these parts – has been little lamented since his £9m move to Palace last summer but here Wickham startingly sprang to life, demonstrating precisely why he cost so much. After Zaha and Bolasie had combined cleverly to cue him up he produced a quite brilliant shot which, aided by the slightest deflection off Yedlin, flew beyond Mannone.\n\nThe silenced home crowd had merely witnessed the warm-up act. With Sunderland suddenly falling apart, Wickham’s next party trick saw him extend his left foot and volley past the keeper after Cabaye’s contested corner – Allardyce felt Yann M’Vila had been fouled in the preamble – and Dann’s headed flick sent the ball bouncing into his path.\n\nSurrender swirled in the air but no one had told Borini. Only on after Cattermole, who had replaced Jan Kirchhoff, had sustained a nasty cut eye, the Italian forward was introduced and he soon brought with him pace and energy. Virtually out of nothing he unleashed an apparently unfeasible 90th-minute shot from the most awkward of angles that flew unerringly past Hennessey. It may be faint but, not for the first time, hope had sprung from the unlikeliest of sources."}, {"date": "28/02/2016", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75329, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester

floor to the fourth official, and Manchester United recording a victory that is a serious blow to Arsenal’s title hopes.\n\nIf the 10-1 odds offered during the game on Rashford making England’s Euro 2016 squad seem hasty these may be viewed generous if he continues the Hollywood start to his United career.\n\nHow Marcus Rashford is following in familiar footsteps at Manchester United Read more\n\nJust as his twin strikes secured United’s passage against Midtjylland into the Europa League last 16, so his Premier League debut ended after 80 minutes with him having created Ander Herrera’s winner to complement his two goals.\n\nThe Spaniard’s strike came before the Van Gaal pantomime but tempers were already fraying when the manager decided to do what he rarely ever does: leave his seat. This received a raucous reception from the crowd. When Van Gaal yelled at Mike Dean, the fourth official, and dived to the turf to mimic how he believed Alexis Sánchez was trying to claim a foul, the place went through the roof.\n\nIt had the fans singing “Louis van Gaal’s army” for the first time in a long time and could yet revive the love affair between them and the Dutchman. Playing the reception down, Van Gaal said: “Great but the fans are not always wise.”\n\nAfter his two-goal debut last Thursday Rashford was asked to do it all again versus opponents more than a couple of classes better than the Danish champions. It did not take long for him to suggest he could. From hugging the left touchline Rashford ran on a diagonal at Petr Cech’s goal, displaying a slipperiness that confounded Héctor Bellerín and Gabriel and forced the latter to foul. The shout went up for a penalty but the referee, Craig Pawson, adjudged it outside the area and Memphis Depay zipped a low hard free-kick under which Herrera ducked and Cech watched carefully.\n\nThere was only sloppiness in the way Theo Walcott ceded possession to presage the sequence that led to Rashford’s opener. Herrera took possession and sprayed it right to Guillermo Varela. The Uruguayan’s cross missed Juan Mata, Gabriel hashed his clearance, and Rashford was in dreamland once more with a neat finish.\n\nThis was on 29 minutes. Only three more were required for Rashford to repeat the feat and send the home crowd into near ecstasy. Again the play was along the United right and again Varela was a key player. This time he fashioned a slick back header to keep the ball alive. It found Jesse Lingard and when he floated in the delivery Rashford rose like a seasoned centre-forward to head beyond Cech.\n\nThe party atmosphere lasted only eight minutes as Arsenal scored and it was too simple. Mesut Özil swung in a free-kick, Marcos Rojo and Morgan Schneiderlin were slumbering, and up went Danny Welbeck to finish.\n\nAt the start of the second half Arsenal were five points behind Leicester City and embarking on 45 minutes that might make or break their championship aspirations. Sánchez signalled he understood the stakes by making a run at the defence but the threat fizzled out.\n\nUnited – and Rojo’s – injury curse was about to strike again. The defender and Welbeck contested a fierce 50-50 and moments later off he went, to be replaced by the 18-year-old Tim Fosu-Mensah. It took the count to five United debutants in a week as the Dutchman was later joined by James Weir, to follow Rashford and Regan Poole against Midtjylland, and Joe Riley, in last Monday’s FA Cup victory at Shrewsbury Town.\n\nAs the hour mark came Arsenal were becalmed and Wenger made a move, taking off the disappointing Walcott for Olivier Giroud. But it was Rashford, again, who refused to be left out.\n\nMarcus Rashford the latest in charge by Manchester United’s young guns Read more\n\nWhen Mata fashioned a smooth reverse pass it was into Rashford’s clever run. He moved into the area, dawdled and measured a pass to Herrera whose side-foot finish deflected off Laurent Koscielny for what turned out to be the winner.\n\nArsenal responded as a topsy-turvy affair took its next turn. David de Gea, who was returning from a leg injury, made a save from Welbeck but Özil volleyed into the turf and the top right-hand corner. From here the temperature rose. Herrera dropped Aaron Ramsey and the Arsenal man raised his hands to the Spaniard. Down went Herrera, up went the United fans’ ire, and after a melee of players calmed down, Pawson booked Ramsey.\n\nNow came Van Gaal’s moment. Incensed by Sánchez, he went to remonstrate with Dean. The delirium that accompanied Van Gaal lying supine was matched when Pawson blew for full-time and United had a third consecutive win for the first time since November.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester United’s manager Louis van Gaal has words with the fourth official Mike Dean on the touchline before falling over.

There was the firecracker against Arsenal back in 2010 and important goals in further derbies against Chelsea and West Ham United. But he may just have topped the lot.\n\nTottenham desperately needed victory to remain on the coat-tails of the leaders, Leicester City, and it would not have been difficult to imagine the reaction to any dropped points, particularly with Arsenal losing at Manchester United.\n\nMarcus Rashford’s double for Manchester United deflates Arsenal hopes Read more\n\nIt might have been one of those hard luck stories, the sort with which White Hart Lane regulars have become very familiar. They battered Swansea City in terms of territory, possession and chances, and, at the end, the statistics showed that they had attempted 34 shots, with 14 of them on target.\n\nSwansea came to find that they could not escape their half. “It wasn’t our intention to play like this,” Alan Curtis, the Swansea coach, said. “They just had wave upon wave of attack.”\n\nYet Tottenham had trailed to Alberto Paloschi’s first goal for Swansea since his £8m transfer from Chievo at the end of January and, for so long, they just could not find a way past Lukasz Fabianski. The former Arsenal goalkeeper made save after save and there were plenty of jaw-droppers among them. As Curtis acknowledged, Fabianski’s was a “world-class” performance.\n\nAfter the substitute Nacer Chadli had produced the equaliser, however, Rose took the Tottenham support to dreamland with his sixth Premier League goal in their colours. Christian Eriksen’s corner was headed out but only as far as Rose, who took an assured touch before threading a low shot through the crowded area and underneath Fabianski.\n\nMauricio Pochettino said afterwards he had made it a priority to keep Rose at the club when he took over in the summer of 2014 and there had been the strong suggestion the left-back would look to leave. “The first meeting I had with any Tottenham player was with him,” Pochettino said. His powers of persuasion have yielded a rich dividend.\n\nFor Swansea, it was a bitter pill, given the stoicism of their resistance and their precarious position just above the relegation places – but they would only have nicked a result, and Curtis knew it. “I thought that Tottenham could win the title before the game but, having seen them, I think it even more now,” he said. “They were probably just too good for us.”\n\nCurtis said, with a smile, that Tottenham staff had wished them well for Wednesday night, when Swansea visit Arsenal and there was little doubt that Pochettino’s team will be buoyed before their midweek trip to West Ham. After that, Spurs face Arsenal at home in the derby on Saturday.\n\nTottenham have now recovered a league-high 17 points from losing positions and this win was a triumph of patience and belief. Lesser teams – and previous editions from this parish – might have concluded that it was simply going to be one of those days; when an inspired opposing goalkeeper was just too good. Instead, they bent the contest to their will.\n\nFabianski’s saves in the first half alone would have made him the outstanding player of the afternoon. There were five eye-catching interventions, with the pick of them coming in the 45th minute, when he denied Eric Dier at point-blank range; Harry Kane put the rebound into the side netting.\n\nIn the early running, Fabianski had tipped over from Erik Lamela, although a corner was not awarded, and denied Kane at the near post, while after Paloschi’s goal, he beat away Eriksen’s free-kick and stood tall to block Son Heung-min. There was more after the interval when he saved brilliantly from another Eriksen free-kick, clawed away a potshot from Kane and tipped over a 35-yard rocket from Rose.\n\nSwansea had fired an early warning, when Paloschi cut the ball back for Gylfi Sigurdsson and the former Spurs player, seemingly, had to score from eight yards. His shot, though, was too close to Hugo Lloris, who made an excellent reflex save.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 19th minute and it was undercut by a slice of fortune. Swansea worked a short corner routine and Àngel Rangel unloaded a shot, which hit Jack Cork and broke for Paloschi. He made the chance look easy, lifting it high into the roof of the net.\n\nIt was the prompt for a siege. Although Swansea broke out in the 39th minute through Paloschi, who saw a goalbound shot blocked by Toby Alderweireld – a big moment – it was practically all Tottenham after that.\n\nChadli had been on the field for only seven minutes but his contribution was vital – here was another example of how Pochettino has coaxed productivity from non-first-choice selections. Kyle Walker hammered in a cross-cum-shot after Fabianski had punched weakly following a corner – a rare aberration – and Chadli reacted to angle a deft sidefoot finish into the corner of the net.\n\nTottenham needed more – and they got more. After Fabianski had once again denied Eriksen, Rose made the difference. There was even time for Lloris to make another fine save from Paloschi in the 79th minute.

The midfielder last scored in the league a year ago but it was he, found 10 yards out by DeAndre Yedlin’s accurate cutback, who placed his shot too close to Adrian’s legs and who, shortly afterwards, saw Sam Byram get enough of a block in to atone for his own mistake when a goal seemed certain. Jermain Defoe also missed a presentable chance shortly after a turgid opening period, volleying wide after James Collins had misjudged a Lee Cattermole punt, and his manager was visibly frustrated afterwards.\n\n“It’s a huge disappointment not to have picked up any points,” Allardyce said. “We came off after creating chances [and losing 1-0] against Man City at home and we’re kicking ourselves again today. It’s worrying me a great deal, because somewhere along the line you won’t play as well as that. I thought we did enough to win it, let alone draw it.”\n\nThat was a generous assessment, but Allardyce presumably knew he had caught West Ham on an off day. His delayed arrival on the touchline, whether staged or otherwise, had been met with utter indifference and the match had begun in a similarly inert vein, lit finally by Vito Mannone’s reflexes in tipping a 20-yard Mark Noble drive on to the crossbar. An angled Wahbi Khazri free-kick that flicked the opposite frame was Sunderland’s riposte but the winning goal, scored on the half-hour, owed plenty to the inattention behind what is now a 13-game run without a clean sheet.\n\nPatrick van Aanholt, a left-back who tends to look far more comfortable on the front foot, should have cleared a straightforward ball out of sight but instead presented it straight to Antonio. The winger’s finish, curled left-footed past a possibly unsighted Mannone, was clinical but he was aided by the lack of resistance offered by either Van Aanholt or the covering Dame N’Doye.\n\nWest Ham were content to play on the counter thereafter although Antonio was thwarted by Mannone before half-time and the substitute Andy Carroll became the third player to hit the bar between Rodwell’s two sights of goal. “We’re West Ham United, we play on the floor”, had been the home crowd’s only real attempt at riling Allardyce but this became an afternoon for getting the job done by more artisanal means.\n\nWest Ham’s manager Slaven Bilic said: “In the hotel and dressing room before the game we were all up for it, but at half time I told the guys we were not flat, but not in the red zone. The crowd also were a little bit sleepy, maybe because it was an early kick-off. We knew it was going to be hard, but we weren’t in that zone and it makes this win even bigger for us.”\n\nIt was one of Dimitri Payet’s quieter days, other than a half-chance struck over in the second period. There was, though, encouragement in a productive first start since 2 January for Manuel Lanzini and Bilic rejected the idea his side had been forced to ride their luck.\n\n“We created more chances, scored the goal and hit the post twice,” he said. “There’s always the danger that you are going to concede. They created some chances in the second half but if you are trying to tell me they deserved to win the game, no way. Every team that plays today and goes 1-0 down will get chances to equalise.”\n\nAnother of Sunderland’s openings had fallen to the mercurial Khazri, who got to the byline in the 87th minute only to fall on his backside attempting an unnecessary rabona. “I can’t comment on that because I might say something I regret,” Allardyce said. No hero’s welcome; no heroics on the pitch. It had been that kind of afternoon for him."}, {"date": "27/02/2016", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32114, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Amartey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ivo Pinto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timm Klose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexander Tettey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [48], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Bamford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Leicester wobble everyone has been waiting for lasted 89 minutes but crucially not the whole match. Alex Neil’s admirable Norwich were cruelly undone right at the end of a game where they were worth a draw and conceivably could have won. Until the substitute Leonardo Ulloa popped up at the far post to convert Marc Albrighton’s cross Leicester had rarely looked like scoring and with a little more attacking conviction Norwich might have done better with chances of their own.\n\nFor most of a long afternoon it appeared Leicester would follow defeat at Arsenal with points squandered at home, but if the sign of champions is picking up points without playing well then Claudio Ranieri’s side are still on course. The manager had predicted this game would be a tougher proposition than it looked and he was right.\n\nNorwich are playing for their lives and making a good job of it, though for the first time in months Leicester failed to manage anything extraordinary. The home side did not look like league leaders, neither did the game resemble a top v bottom contest. The uncomfortable truth for a home crowd now primed to expect the impossible every week was that the game was pretty much what one would have imagined of these two sides at the start of the season.\n\nBut only for 89 minutes. Once Ulloa secured the win to stretch the lead at the top of the Premier League to five points, Leicester were in dreamland again, the King Power a much happier place. And full credit to Ranieri, sending on Ulloa for the full-back Daniel Amartey for the final 12 minutes was an attacking substitution that worked.\n\n“I tried to make some changes to spread out the front line,” the Italian said. “We cannot always play well, but it was important to restart after the defeat at Arsenal. We lost that game in the final seconds and won this one in the last minute. That’s football, but I want to say well done to Norwich, they gave us the battle we were expecting.”\n\nNeil was philosophical. “We had the better chances and we kept Mahrez and Vardy quiet,” the Norwich manager said. “We just lost Mahrez right at the end when we could have dealt with him, because by the time the cross comes in it’s too late. The boys are gutted, but they put in a good day’s work.”\n\nBy recent Leicester standards the first half was flat, uneventful, scrappy even. Norwich had come with containment in mind, their three central defenders staying back to deny Jamie Vardy space to run into, and the problem from the home side’s point of view was that Riyad Mahrez was not getting into the game either. One delightful dribble into the Norwich area midway through the first half showed exactly what Mahrez could do, when a single switch of direction took out Timm Klose and Alex Tettey, but the final pass eluded Shinji Okazaki and the chance was gone.\n\nThere was a shot from distance from Albrighton and a free-kick that flew narrowly wide, then a half-chance in front of goal for Okazaki, but none of the quick, incisive counters we have come to associate with Leicester. That was mainly because Norwich were smart enough not to throw too many players into attack and play into their opponents’ hands. Even so, the visitors came closest to a goal before the interval. Cameron Jerome missed the target with a free header from a corner when he really should have done better, then Nathan Redmond ended the half by bringing a save from Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nMahrez saw more of the ball in the second half and a couple of runs were only stopped at the expense of free-kicks, from one of which the ball was tapped to Vardy for a low drive that John Ruddy got down low to save.\n\nBy the hour stage Norwich were beginning to be pinned back in their own half, though Leicester were not exactly peppering Ruddy’s goal.\n\nMahrez was the only player who seemed to have any attacking ideas and when Albrighton brought a routine save from the goalkeeper in the 66th minute it registered as only the home side’s second shot on target.\n\nRedmond, Matt Jarvis and Patrick Bamford had chances before the end, with Norwich clearly torn between sticking to their conservative gameplan and going for broke. They would have been happy with a point and the knowledge that few teams have stifled Leicester this season, but ended up broke anyway.\n\nMahrez sniffed out Albrighton in space on the right, a low cross eluded Vardy but found Ulloa in exactly the right place ahead of a tired Ivo Pinto challenge to sweep the ball past Ruddy.

The victory secured late was a throwback to this team’s resilience of a year ago, and a reminder of the stubborn qualities they still hope can force passage beyond Paris Saint-Germain in a Champions League knockout tie which, if taken at face value, might otherwise appear already lost. They were far from fluent and rather error-prone at times but they still found a way to prevail against a side who had forgotten what it feels like to concede a goal, let alone ship a result. That is the happy knack the Dutch stand-in has restored.\n\nIt was Branislav Ivanovic, clad in the armband in the absence of the injured John Terry, who forced the win that hoisted Chelsea to within seven points of fifth place, albeit from a vantage point still in the bottom half of the table. This tight contest was drifting towards its final minute when the Serb leapt above Virgil van Dijk to meet Willian’s corner, his header thumped in off Fraser Forster’s outstretched right hand. Perhaps the goalkeeper had still been digesting a first concession in 708 minutes, stretching back to last March when he had been beaten by Diego Costa at Stamford Bridge, as the winner flew through his grasp.\n\nHe departed the turf crestfallen, with his team-mates almost numbed in their own state of shock. “It’s a nice record, because it’s all about the defensive work and organisation of the team, and he can be proud of that, as can the team,” said Ronald Koeman, whose side had gone more than 10-and-a-half hours before Cesc Fàbregas’s equaliser here punctured them for the first time since early January.\n\n“But we are disappointed with the final result. The first goal can happen, but that’s the first time in 18 months we’ve conceded straight from a corner. So this is not the time for us to be celebrating a record.”\n\nFor all that he offered up plaudits for Chelsea’s underlying talents, Southampton had simply not seen this coming.\n\nThey had actually been undone by the visitors’ second-half urgency, energy that drove Southampton further and further back from the moment their appeals for a penalty after Gary Cahill’s challenge on Charlie Austin had been dismissed. By then the contest had become fractious, Diego Costa and Van Dijk embroiled in a running spat with the Spain forward riled and, inevitably, increasingly threatening. It was his dart down the channel that reclaimed possession while home players were distracted by a linesman’s flag, the referee having played an advantage after an incident further upfield, with the pull-back duly collected by Fàbregas.\n\nHe curled in a cross, aimed vaguely towards Eden Hazard amid the clutter in the penalty area, which arced towards goal and bounced in the six-yard box. Forster, suddenly gripped by unfamiliar indecision, prodded out tentatively with his left boot in a desperate attempt to force the ball away on the half-volley, but could not prevent it bouncing beyond and in.\n\n“I don’t know what is meant by us showing the ‘old Chelsea’, but the Chelsea we want to see is one that reacts when there is a setback,” said Hiddink. “We like to be proactive and show the desire is huge to turn a result from negative to positive. The players responded.”\n\nAs had the manager, ruthlessly, at the interval. The Dutchman, already handicapped by Pedro’s departure with a hamstring complaint that will rule him out for the foreseeable future, had watched Baba Rahman gift the hosts a deserved advantage just before the break with a blind nod infield towards Ivanovic that was intercepted by Shane Long. The Irishman’s finish, clipped wonderfully over the advancing Thibaut Courtois, was sublime, though the Ghanaian, burying his head in his shirt, recognised his culpability. Rahman, who could end up costing Chelsea in excess of £20m, did not return for the second half. “I could say he was injured but he was just taken off because of that [mistake],” said Hiddink. “I don’t like to personalise it but you have to take decisions sometimes that can appear very harsh.”\n\nAt the time he had needed a reaction, Southampton having appeared supremely comfortable up to then and apparently destined for fifth place. In the end it was Koeman who was left gnashing in frustration as Courtois denied Sadio Mané from close range to end that recent revival. Chelsea’s recovery, in contrast, now stands at 14 domestic games with Antonio Conte, the anticipated permanent managerial appointment for the summer, presumably impressed from afar.\n\nHiddink is offering the Italian a fine platform upon which to attack next season. “I’m not thinking ‘I’m doing all the hard work for the next one to sit on his chair with a massive cigar,’” he said. “I’m enjoying it.

Villa remain destined for relegation from the Premier League after this defeat at Stoke.\n\nGarde publicly questioned the commitment of some of his players in light of the performance against Liverpool last time out, with the 6-0 defeat the club’s worst home loss in 81 years.\n\nPerhaps stung by those words Garde’s side, with just one change – Alan Hutton in for Micah Richards – looked much better, especially during the first half at the Britannia Stadium.\n\nHowever, their soft underbelly returned at the start of the second half and it cost them as Marko Arnautovic hit two goals, the first from the penalty spot, putting Stoke comfortably in front with 56 minutes on the clock.\n\nIt would have been easy for Villa to crumble, and if a Philipp Wollscheid header just after the hour had gone in they might have, but they dug in and showed some rare fight and pulled a goal back through Leandro Bacuna with 11 minutes remaining.\n\nGarde, visibly weary, tried to remain upbeat and called for everyone at Aston Villa to stick together for the remaining 11 matches of what has been an arduous Premier League campaign. “We saw a team that had the right spirit, which was not the case in the previous game,” said the Villa manager.\n\n“We failed so deeply in that game that I was expecting something different and the team had a better shape.\n\n“We know we are a team that finds it difficult to score goals, we are not scoring many. If we can stop the opposition for as long as we can then this is a chance for us. The plan was to defend very well and maybe create one or two opportunities. The first 45 minutes we did this well, but we started poorly in the second half. We showed fragility suddenly and then we have been finished. When you concede two goals like that away from home it is difficult to get back in the game, but we did it.\n\n“The spirit of the team was better. It was more a question of quality, rather than putting in more effort. It is a very difficult season for the players, the fans, of course, and for me. But we have to stay as solid as we can and have as much solidarity as we can have. There is 11 games to play – 33 points available. It is still possible that we can win enough games to be safe. While it is mathematically possible, we believe we can still do it.”\n\nMark Hughes, the Stoke manager, felt his team made hard work of it at times but he was grateful for the three points. He said: “I thought we took time to get going but in the first half I was pleased with what we produced, although we perhaps needed more intensity and a bit more dynamism.\n\n“I thought that’s what we got in the second half. We started with some good intent after the break and scored two quick-fire goals and took the game away from them.\n\n“They had a spell late on, although their goal shouldn’t have stood – it was clearly handball earlier on in the move. They threw some long balls into our box and we had to defend that.\n\n“We could have taken the game away from them sooner and made it more comfortable for ourselves but we have another home game now on Wednesday and we will be looking for three points from that as well.”"}, {"date": "27/02/2016", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20831, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name":

good news for Bournemouth was that Max Gradel returned after six months out through injury. There would have been even better news if Heurelho Gomes had not made two late saves to spoil the Ivorian’s attempts to celebrate his comeback with a winning goal. As it was, a largely dreary game ended in a draw and Bournemouth will not know for sure until the end of the season whether that constitutes good or bad news.\n\n“We’re happy with a point but it could have been more,” said the visiting manager, Eddie Howe, whose team remain above the relegation zone but precariously placed.” But after two [league] defeats in a row it was a step in the right direction.”\n\nBournemouth wore pink and made a pretty bright start. But bold intent did not lead to clear openings for them in a first half in which Gomes was largely redundant.\n\nArtur Boruc was only a little more busy. The visiting goalkeeper made an important stop from Odion Ighalo in the second minute, the Nigerian striker shooting from 12 yards after haring past Harry Arter and Steve Cook on the right.\n\nIghalo eluded his opponents again in the ninth minute to collect a cross from Juan Carlos Paredes. He spun sharply but slashed wide from seven yards.\n\nThat was the extent of the goalmouth action in a half in which both sides worked diligently but neither showed the wit to infiltrate. There was, at least, something to smile about in the 21st minute, as Gradel returned to action for the first time since tearing knee ligaments in August. Unfortunately, hamstring trouble for Junior Stanislas was the reason for Gradel’s introduction from the bench but it was heartening, nonetheless, to see the Ivorian back. He was the first of a trio of key Bournemouth players to damage knee ligaments this season.\n\nBournemouth began to bear fangs in the second half. They cut the home defence open wickedly in the 55th minute, as Gradel and Andrew Surman pinged passes back and forth on the edge of the area, but Miguel Britos recovered sufficiently to deflect Gradel’s shot wide.\n\nFive minutes later, after more high-paced probing by the visitors, Arter tried to curl a shot beyond Gomes from 20 yards. But the Brazilian tipped the ball behind the post with one hand.\n\nThe visitors’ impudence provoked a reaction from Watford. Nordin Amrabat scorched past Charlie Daniels in the 67th minute before presenting Ighalo with a marvellous chance to open the scoring, but the striker mistimed his header from six yards.\n\nHowe withdrew the ineffective Benik Afobe for the last 15 minutes and cast on Dan Gosling instead. Gosling quickly picked up the pattern of the game, fluffing a chance within a minute of his introduction. Given the poverty of the finishing, Gomes would have been forgiven for being taken by surprise in the 80th minute when Gradel produced a powerful downward header from a cross by Ritchie. But the goalkeeper made a splendid save to deny him. He then made sure there was no romantic ending for the men in pink by turning away another shot by Gradel in the dying minutes. “It would have ben a great return for him,” said Howe. “I thought he did really well. He was a key part in our performance. He makes things happen around him. Just having him in and around our squad has given us a lift.”\n\nGomes, meanwhile, has made a habit of deflating Bournemouth, having saved a penalty against them in the 1-1 draw on the south coast in October. “He’s been excellent against us in the two games this season and last season, too. He’s been superb,” said Howe."}, {"date": "27/02/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24806, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [17], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [20], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [44]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [12], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [31], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [44], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Adebayor", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48, 80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "West Bromwich Albion have found their shooting boots at the right time, even if uncharacteristically abject defending almost saw them throw away a three-goal advantage in a surprisingly pulsating game. Having not scored more than twice all season, they struck three in 19 first-half minutes to defeat Crystal Palace despite enduring a nervy conclusion.\n\nAlan Pardew’s team did make a fight of it in the second half thanks to Connor Wickham’s double, his first goals from open play this season, but efforts from Craig Gardner, Craig Dawson and an outstanding volley from Saido Berahino gave the home side a sufficient buffer.\n\nWhile the closing stages offered some hope, Palace will enter the third month of 2016 still without a league win, taking only three points from their past 10 fixtures. That last league victory, at Stoke on 19 December, bumped them into fifth place. They are 14th now and peering nervously over their shoulder. “It shows we never give in but the bottom line is we need to start games,” Pardew said, reflecting on their fightback. “But the priority for us now is to get the results we need to stay in the division.”\n\nIt said much for how little pre-match excitement there was about a game between 13th and 14th that most of the pre-match discussion surrounded Chris Brunt and the unsavoury incident at Reading last Saturday, when he was struck by a coin thrown from one of West Brom’s own supporters. Brunt, greeted here with warm applause, started at left-back but was carried off a minute before half-time having slipped after a challenge with Wilfried Zaha, twisting his knee in the process. He will have a scan on Monday but the initial diagnosis is not promising.\n\nYet Tony Pulis’s side were intent on giving their fans something positive to shout about and as Brunt departed the division’s second most goal-shy team before kick-off were three clear.\n\nThe first arrived 12 minutes in when Berahino guided a nicely weighted through ball to Salomón Rondón. The Venezuelan’s shot was saved by Wayne Hennessey but Gardner was the first to the rebound, tapping in from close range.\n\nGardner then provided the assist for the second, a teasing outswinging delivery from a free-kick on the right that was met by Dawson, who powered a clinical header past Hennessey.\n\nBy the time Berahino scored, teed up by an exquisite Stéphane Sessègnon pass, chants of “easy, easy” were emanating from the home end. “I keep saying to Saido, God has given him a gift and he should squeeze everything out of it,” Pulis said.\n\nFurther damage could have been done by the interval, with Gardner striking the left post from a free-kick. Palace, on the other hand, had not registered an attempt on target at the interval. They were void of craft in midfield, listless at the back and anonymous up front.\n\nThe introduction of Yannick Bolasie, making his first league appearance since December, for Emmanuel Adebayor changed things and Pardew’s side were back in the game within three minutes. Jonas Olsson made a mess of what should have been a simple clearance to allow Wickham through, and the striker hooked the ball into the air before slotting past Ben Foster.\n\nPalace committed bodies forward in the hope of rescuing something and it allowed Albion to counter dangerously. Berahino almost restored the three-goal cushion in the 52nd minute only for his curling attempt to come back off the bar.\n\nPalace then had two penalty claims waved away: first when Scott Dann was barged by Gareth McAuley, then Bolasie was irate when his claim after a challenge from Darren Fletcher was dismissed.\n\nWickham struck again 10 minutes from the end when thunderously sending a left-footed volley into the top right corner but Mile Jedinak was denied an equaliser by a Gardner clearance off the line and West Brom did just enough to hold on."}, {"date": "14/02/2016", "arena":

Just when Leicester City thought they had escaped intact from a muscular, occasionally desperate rearguard second half at the Emirates, Arsenal pulled them back in. Claudio Ranieri’s team produced a spiky, tenacious display of deep-lying defence having been reduced to 10 men by Danny Simpson’s slightly soft sending off on 54 minutes. Ultimately they were reeled in by a thrilling final burst as Arsenal turned a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 win with goals from the substitutes Theo Walcott and, most cinematically of all, the returning Danny Welbeck in the final seconds.\n\nArsenal 2-1 Leicester City: five talking points from the Emirates | Sachin Nakrani Read more\n\nNiggly, awkward, comfortable for long periods behind their 1-0 lead, for Leicester a point here against Arsenal would have felt like a victory by the end. As it is, three Premier League games many suggested would decide – or derail – their title push have still brought six points from nine. Nobody won a title without a few bumps in the road and Leicester will take heart from their spirit here. As will Arsenal, who struggled against well-drilled, physically powerful opponents, but kept pushing and probably just about deserved victory in a game that was sadly dominated by some debatable refereeing calls from Martin Atkinson.\n\nOn a bright, chilly afternoon Arsenal kicked off in an unusually febrile atmosphere at the Emirates. Per Mertesacker replaced the injured Gabriel in the starting lineup, muddling Wenger’s planning for this fixture and pitting Arsenal’s most immobile centre-half against a team with extreme pace on the counterattack. The return of Francis Coquelin offered the promise of a little extra protection, and there was cheer also in the presence of Welbeck on the bench for the first time since April.\n\nLeicester simply came out like Leicester, the same team that had won so brilliantly at the Etihad Stadium the weekend before, with a defence that came here having conceded two goals in five matches.\n\nArsenal started brightly, Mesut Özil feeding Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who crossed to the far post when he might have tested Kasper Schmeichel’s early resolve. From the corner the improbable figure of Alexis Sánchez rose like an Action Man hurled from an upstairs window and headed just wide.\n\nOtherwise Leicester settled into their familiar black-shirted double-bolt, with N’Golo Kanté snapping into tackles and Danny Drinkwater, understated general of this team, putting his foot in. Leicester, fairytale kings, are no strangers to the dark arts of rotational fouling when necessary and here shirts were grappled and runs blocked. Ranieri has insisted on his own hands-off tactical role. But there can have been few more Italianesque Premier League table-toppers than this canny Leicester team with their deep-lying Wes-enaccio defence and their one-to-11 tactical discipline.\n\nLeicester simply looked the better team for much of the first half, with Kanté running the game in midfield, using his acceleration to snap and bite into loose balls and curling in one beautiful dipping shot that Petr Cech tipped over. What a player he has turned out to be. At times this season Kanté must have been tempted to scratch his head and look a little baffled. Premier League? Really? Is that all you have got?\n\nLeicester’s goal before half-time came from where Leicester’s goals tend to come: breaking down the right, Kanté snapping into a collision with Laurent Koscielny. The ball broke to Jamie Vardy. His jink into the box ended in a tumble over Nacho Monreal’s leg. It was a poor attempt at a tackle, half turning away, offering the chance to fall over the leg that was left. Vardy got up and spanked the ball low past Cech.\n\nArsenal emerged with greater purpose after half-time, Aaron Ramsey shooting just wide of the right-hand post and Olivier Giroud putting himself about a little more in front of the Leicester defence. Ten minutes into the half the landscape changed when Simpson was shown a soft second yellow card for a tug on Giroud’s arm. It was perhaps a broader response to Leicester’s frequent niggly fouls, although in isolation it seemed harsh. A little later Drinkwater got away with a flying lunge into the back of Ramsey. Riyad Mahrez dived in search of a penalty but was not booked. Not the greatest day for a referee who was barracked relentlessly by the home fans.\n\nThe onslaught came vaguely at first. Sánchez began to figure more on the left. Walcott found space on the other wing, and it was from that side that the equaliser came with 20 minutes to go. Héctor Bellerín whipped a cross on to Giroud’s head. His lovely cushioned nod found Walcott in space and the finish was assured.\n\nAfter that Arsenal pressed hard. Mertesacker somehow failed to head home from eight yards, picked out by Özil’s flighted pass. Moments later, Giroud turned and shot inside the box only for Schmeichel to produce a wonderful save.\n\nEnter Welbeck. With seconds left Arsenal’s sub, so horribly plagued by injury, leapt highest to flick a header past Schmeichel from Özil’s pass. Welbeck celebrated wildly in the crowd and will now hope to add his own muscle and drive to Arsenal’s run-in.\n\nFor Leicester the sense of injustice at the sending-off will add a sting to a defeat that looked unlikely at the halfway point. The players have a week off now and will seek some healing winter sun. They remain two points clear at the top. Only one thing seems clear. Like both teams here, this one is going to run right to the end.\n\nMan of the match N’Golo Kanté (Leicester City)"}, {"date": "14/02/2016", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 35798, "home_team":

that sparked the exodus this time but the sheer ineptitude of Aston Villa. No easy games in the Premier League? Nonsense. This was a surrender and Liverpool inflicted a St Valentine’s Day massacre from which the division’s bottom club may not recover.\n\nDanny Welbeck’s last-gasp effort gives Arsenal win over 10-man Leicester Read more\n\nA team supposedly fighting for its life rolled over and died at Villa Park. To add insult to injury, the Villa defender and fan Joleon Lescott tweeted a photo of a top-of-the-range Mercedes S63 shortly after the final whistle, later claiming he had done so by accident as “it happened whilst driving and my phone was in my pocket”. The sense it left, however, is that he is detached and uninterested, just like Villa’s defending.\n\nThose fans not sent to the exits in despair turned their ire on the owner Randy Lerner in the directors’ box rather than Rémi Garde in the dugout. The French coach looked on helplessly as the nightmare of Villa’s heaviest home defeat since Ted Drake scored all seven of Arsenal’s goals in a 7-1 win here in 1935 unfolded. On the flip side, Liverpool equalled their biggest winning margin away from home in the top flight but Jürgen Klopp had too much respect for his opponents’ suffering to revel in the rout. He could take greater satisfaction from Liverpool demonstrating that, with Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho available, they do have armoury to punish weak defending.\n\nSturridge opened the scoring on his first Premier League start under Klopp, James Milner, Emre Can, Divock Origi, Nathaniel Clyne and Kolo Touré all followed. Six different goalscorers and a multitude of faults for Garde to correct. No spine, no spirit and no quality. There is no way back for Villa on this evidence. Garde admitted: “As a manager that is probably the worst performance I have had. It is a very bad afternoon, a very bad defeat but we don’t have time to complain and moan. We have to be professional until the end. I will find 11 players for the next game who want to fight.” He was hard pressed to find one .\n\nThe defensive flaws that are ushering a grand club towards the Championship were quickly exposed, and under minimal pressure, as Liverpool established a comfortable lead without truly exerting themselves. The lack of leadership after Sturridge and Milner scored must have worried Garde as much as the feeble resistance that met two punishing crosses from the Liverpool left.\n\nSturridge started the humiliation with a finish made simple by his intelligent movement. Liverpool worked the ball out to Coutinho on the left and when his in-swinging centre dropped between the static Lescott and Aly Cissokho the unmarked striker steered a header inside Mark Bunn’s near post. Lescott berated Cissokho for losing the run of Sturridge. Abdicating responsibility was a feature of the Villa performance.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Divock Origi is mobbed by Liverpool fans after scoring his team’s fourth goal at Villa Park. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images\n\nThe visitors’ second came gift-wrapped nine minutes later. The cumbersome Jores Okore dispossessed Coutinho before conceding a needless free-kick with a slight push on the Brazilian. Milner swept in the set piece from a similar position to Coutinho’s cross for the opener, Lescott, Okore and Mamadou Sakho leapt to meet it, all three missed and the ball sailed beyond Bunn into the far corner. Villa’s play deteriorated rapidly thereafter with a procession of half-hearted challenges and basic errors enraging the home support. Garde’s team were abysmal. Once Gabriel Agbonlahor departed early in the second half, taking any semblance of attacking intent with him, they threw shambolic into the mix for good measure. Garde claimed Agbonlahor was suffering from vertigo. “Don’t you have to be high up to have that?” came a biting retort in the press conference.\n\nFour Liverpool goals in 13 minutes provided an accurate gauge of the calamity that unfolded. Number three arrived courtesy of the pedestrian Micah Richards. The Villa captain was easily dispossessed by Can, who continued his run as the impressive Roberto Firmino drove towards the defence before squaring for the German midfielder who found the bottom corner from 20 yards.\n\nNumber four arrived from Origi’s first touch after replacing Sturridge. Once again Villa lost possession, this time to Firmino deep inside the Liverpool half. Coutinho swept a glorious pass around Okore where the Belgium international raced forwards before beating Bunn.\n\nTwo minutes later came number five, Clyne breaking clear of Jordan Veretout inside the area and converting his first league goal for Liverpool at the second attempt. Number six was appalling from a Villa perspective and a moment of sheer joy for Touré. The Liverpool central defender was stood still and unmarked as Jordan Henderson swept a corner over from the right. Touré did not have to move to convert his first goal in five years.\n\nKlopp said: “Having six goalscorers – I can’t remember them all now – is perfect for the boys because it is important that they all really feel it is important to work in this way, but it is not a day to sing songs for us.\n\n“You have to show respect for Aston Villa, a great club in a difficult situation. We came here and won the game, that’s important for us, but if someone wins 6-0 someone loses 6-0 and that is not nice. It is a good day for us but a hard day for Aston Villa.”\n\nMan of the match Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "14/02/2016", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54551, "home_team":

home jubilant and put a further dent in Manchester City’s championship hopes.\n\nThe Ivorian ran into traffic and trouble near halfway and from there City unravelled. Erik Lamela had just come on as a substitute but a cool head allowed the Argentinian to carry the ball forward before passing to Eriksen, whose finish beyond Joe Hart may prove priceless when the Premier League trophy is handed out in May.\n\nCity had fought back impressively during a second half in which they appeared the more likely to claim the points, especially after Kelechi Iheanacho’s equaliser. Yet by the end, after Nicolás Otamendi had failed to beat Hugo Lloris to a header that might have grabbed the draw, Tottenham had moved to within two points of the leaders, Leicester City.\n\nWith only 12 games remaining Manuel Pellegrini’s side suffered a second consecutive loss but look at the same six-point gap to the top with which they began the day. The normally cool-headed Pellegrini stopped to “congratulate” Mike Dean, the fourth official, before walking off at full-time.\n\nPellegrini was particularly unhappy at the 53rd-minute penalty awarded by Mark Clattenburg after the referee decided Raheem Sterling had handled Danny Rose’s cross.\n\nYet the truth is this result means City’s best showing against their three title rivals remains a goalless draw at Leicester in late December and they have still not beaten a side in the top six. This is not the kind of form to offer convincing evidence Pellegrini could yet guide City to a second title in three years. Since Pep Guardiola was announced as his summer successor they have lost twice and won only once.\n\nThe start was the opposite of the free-for-all that had been the Arsenal-Leicester game earlier in the day. It featured the kind of cautious exchanges that often occur in a title race’s defining phase.\n\nCity, however, posed the greater threat. David Silva was in chief-conductor mode, Sterling was finding space and Sergio Agüero was given two chances to open the scoring.\n\nEach of these came from City corners. A Silva-Fernandinho-Silva-Sterling-Silva move along the Spurs right ended with the Spaniard’s shot being deflected out. Silva took the kick from the left but Agüero’s header was looping and weak, and simple for Lloris to collect. The second chance again saw Silva swing his cross in from the left, but Agüero’s attempt with his left foot was high.\n\nPellegrini positioned Touré as the No10 behind Agüero and in flashes the Ivorian posed the visitors problems – either by running with the ball or without it, as a late arrival into the area.\n\nThe way to trouble this Pellegrini team is to hound and cut off their thinking time. This is how Leicester departed with a 3-1 win just over a week ago, but during the first half Spurs failed to do the necessary.\n\nAny questions they asked were more prosaic. Eriksen, the No10 in Mauricio Pochettino’s 4-2-3-1, drifted across the turf and let fly a 25-yard shot that forced the under-worked Hart to save. Later, Rose hit a volley that was on course to trouble Hart before Pablo Zabaleta’s head intervened.\n\nVincent Kompany had been confirmed in the City starting XI for the first time since 8 November and given their defensive maladies the hope was he could immediately reach match-day speed.\n\nAs the interval arrived the home rear-defence had indeed been more composed, though Kompany’s rustiness caused two errors. There was an awry header that conceded possession and a clearance that allowed Tottenham to rove straight back at City. But like the rest of the opening half, this came to nothing.\n\nOnly eight minutes of the second half were needed to change the picture as the referee awarded a penalty after Sterling was ruled to have committed the handling misdemeanour from Rose’s attempted ball into the area. It was actually more of an elbow after the No7 turned his back.\n\nKane made no mistake, smacking the spot kick past Hart. The atmosphere had become raucous and City nearly enjoyed an instant response when Touré addressed a 25-yard free-kick after Kevin Wimmer’s foul, for which the central defender was booked. Touré stuttered his run-up and was unlucky to see his fine attempt crash back off the bar.\n\nAfter 74 minutes Pellegrini made his first move, taking off Fernando for Iheanacho. Having to look to a 19-year-old for help to turn round such a crucial match is illustrative of the injuries that blight a City squad whose most important miss is Kevin De Bruyne, a long-term absentee.\n\nIheanacho did not make the best start when a regulation touch was clumsy and the ball ran away for a goal kick. The next time he was found the youngster made serious amends. Gaël Clichy fashioned a slick one-two with Silva and when the City left-back pinged the ball over the substitute produced an instant finish that left Lloris no chance.\n\nCity had grabbed the momentum and were flying at Tottenham. Touré galloped forward and aimed a shot a Lloris that warmed the Frenchman’s fingers but at the final whistle all the positive energy and feelings belonged to the visitors.\n\nMan of the match

Louis van Gaal trudged down the tunnel, colour draining from his face with every step, Wahbi Khazri offered Sunderland supporters a succession of thumbs-up signs. The Tunisia playmaker – a £9m acquisition last month from Bordeaux – had done more than anyone to not only subject Manchester United and their manager to another awful afternoon but offer Sam Allardyce genuine hope relegation can be averted after all.\n\nKhazri prides himself on applying plenty of whip to his dead-ball delivery and this art enabled him to score Sunderland’s opener before creating a second, claimed by Lamine Koné but which officialdom subsequently labelled a David de Gea own goal. In between, Anthony Martial contributed a fine equaliser but United were never really in control and, like it or not, Van Gaal is going to have to accept that all the talk about José Mourinho being Old Trafford-bound is not going to go away.\n\nThe Dutchman’s players were on the back foot from the early moment when Matteo Darmian fouled Patrick van Aanholt and Khazri, excellent throughout, stepped up to take the left-sided free-kick.\n\nHe struck it low and, momentarily, the trajectory looked unpromising. Then Jermain Defoe, apparently attempting to flick it on, stepped over the ball and, with both United’s defence and De Gea wrong-footed, Khazri’s delivery drifted on unimpeded into the bottom corner.\n\nIf the pride of Tunisian football seemed Sunderland’s brightest spark, Juan Mata initially displayed similar promise for United from his position tucked into the hole just behind Wayne Rooney.\n\nEven so, Mata and company were lucky not to fall behind when Lee Cattermole squeezed a pass into Defoe’s path. The former England striker – who required a late fitness test before starting – had sneaked in behind Chris Smalling but his connection was poor and, under pressure from De Gea, he miscued from around seven yards .\n\nDefoe looked furious with himself for missing that one and his manager simply downcast as he chewed his gum with increasingly manic intensity. Allardyce, though, had a bigger worry. Jan Kirchhoff, the 6ft 5in former Bayern Munich defender deployed in an anchoring role between midfield and defence, appeared to have pulled a hamstring and was replaced by Jack Rodwell.\n\nWith Mata the catalyst, United’s passing was starting to click into a convincing groove but Khazri thought he should have had a penalty when his shot struck Morgan Schneiderlin on an arm. Detecting a total absence of intent, Andre Marriner refused to buy it and the visiting momentum continued to build.\n\nIt was barely disrupted when Darmian – who had at times looked a weak link after loitering in possession – dislocated a shoulder after challenging for a 50-50 ball with Khazri and was replaced by Donald Love, a Scotland Under-21 international. Shortly afterwards, United equalised.\n\nVito Mannone did well to repel Mata’s curling shot from the edge of the area only to see Martial pounce on the rebound. Having steadied himself the Frenchman directed a delicate little close-range dink over the goalkeeper from the tightest of angles. To call it an accomplished finish would almost be an understatement.\n\nRooney began the second half in less than similarly polished mode. After collecting a yellow card for needlessly raking his studs down Cattermole’s calf, Van Gaal’s lone striker then seemed hugely relieved not to have conceded a penalty. As Khazri whipped in yet another of those speciality free-kicks Rooney attempted to out-leap the impressive John O’Shea and the ball deflected off the United captain’s raised hand.\n\nEvidently fearing not just the concession of a spot-kick but another yellow card, he looked sheepish in the extreme but Marriner waved Sunderland’s appeals away, presumably having decided the forward was merely trying to protect his face.\n\nSunderland 2-1 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIf that was a little lucky no one could deny that Van Gaal’s inexperienced, young full-backs Love and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson were struggling to cope with the pressure Sunderland were piling down the flanks. If Khazri and Dame N’Doye were rampant out wide Yann M’Vila proved an increasingly influential central midfield figure, ensuring Mata faded.\n\nBy now De Gea was by far the busier goalkeeper but even the Spaniard had no answer when Khazri issued another reminder that he dispatches a mean dead ball. It was a good corner but Koné, up from centre-half where he had been outstanding alongside O’Shea, did even better to swivel free from Smalling before making a strong aerial connection.\n\nThe former Lorient defender’s downward header proved simply too strong for De Gea who got a hand to the ball but could not prevent it squirming off his body and on to Memphis Depay next to him. It then rebounded back off De Gea and over the goalline.\n\nIcy hailstones hammered on to the pitch but Van Gaal was probably more concerned by the heat of Mourinho’s breath on the back of his neck."}, {"date": "13/02/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 10863, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [],

in fact, but Stoke finally ended their goal drought in scintillating style. Mark Hughes’s side, inspired by Xherdan Shaqiri and the club’s new £18.3m record signing, Giannelli Imbula, never looked bereft of confidence here, despite being without their captain, Ryan Shawcross, or a goal from their previous four league matches.\n\nPedro’s pair fuel Chelsea’s 5-1 rout of wretched Newcastle Read more\n\nStoke, in a pristine all-white strip, rolled up their sleeves to dig in and make things uncomfortable for Bournemouth. Hughes’s team defended like giants, from Mame Biram Diouf to Marc Muniesa, who barely gave Benik Afobe a sniff. Hughes and his staff evidently did their homework on the Cherries.\n\nBournemouth were a shadow of their usual selves and any rhythm was disrupted by the industrious Stoke midfield pairing of Glenn Whelan and Imbula, while the visiting goalkeeper, Jack Butland, slowed proceedings down at every given opportunity.\n\nIt took less than 10 minutes for Stoke to go ahead, Shaqiri saw his ambitious effort only partially cleared by Simon Francis, with the ball dropping kindly for Imbula. The Frenchman, who arrived from Porto last month, was invited to let fly and sent his first-time volley arrowing across goal and into the corner past Artur Boruc. Stoke supporters – some topless even in freezing conditions on the south coast – were already singing Imbula’s name just 99 minutes into his career in English football.\n\n“It was a great opening goal and I thought all game he [Imbula] showed a real calmness and understanding of what was required,” said Hughes, whose post-match duties were abruptly curtailed after a fire alarm forced the press room to be evacuated. Hughes walked outside, where fans joked that one of Imbula, Shaqiri or Ibrahim Afellay were still on fire. “The sure sign of a good player is when you look at them and they always have time and space to find the right pass, that’s indicative of a top-quality player and we feel we have one in the building now,” added Hughes.\n\nBournemouth struggled to contain Stoke’s attacking trio behind the workhorse striker Jon Walters. Charlie Daniels ran the length of the pitch to inject some urgency into a tepid Bournemouth display but his ball could not find Afobe.\n\nFor the first seven minutes of the second half Howe will have been largely please, though. His half-time substitutes, Matt Ritchie and Joshua King, had made an instant impact. Stoke were camped inside their own half and Bournemouth began to flood forward. Butland was forced into a smart stop, spreading himself superbly to deny King the simplest of finishes.\n\nBut then Stoke counterattacked in devastating style. Walters bamboozled Steve Cook, after he found a pocket of space on the right flank behind the Bournemouth defender, before picking out Afellay with a sideways pass. The Dutchman did the rest, sweeping home an unstoppable strike.\n\nStoke were comfortable again and the substitute Joselu was next to capitalise on another open invitation from the home defence. Shaqiri was the orchestrator on this occasion, crossing for the unmarked Spanish striker, who headed home with ease.\n\nSunderland boost survival hopes with late win over Manchester United Read more\n\nTwo minutes later the Bournemouth winger Ritchie, having seen Imbula and Afellay’s forays into goal of the month territory, filed his very own contender. Daniels went forward down the left before crossing for Ritchie, who lashed his first-time volley past Butland. King later flashed the ball across goal but Junior Stanislas failed to convert, much to the exasperation of Howe.\n\nStoke executed their game plan to perfection, were ruthless and performed like a team enjoying their eighth successive season in the top flight. Bournemouth have lessons to learn, and fast.\n\nHowe, though, will hope this defeat can prove just as galvanising as the reverse fixture, when they lost 2-1 at the Britannia Stadium in September. The striker Callum Wilson was carried off that day amid a string of long-term injuries that were supposed to dash any hopes of Bournemouth surviving.

He admitted their first-half display was as poor as he had seen from his side since returning to south London at the start of last year and although things improved after the break following Adebayor’s powerful headed goal, they clearly have major problems. “It was bit worrying to be honest,” said Pardew. “We couldn’t get going in the first half – it just wasn’t happening for us.\n\nWasteful Everton frustrated as Salomón Rondón steals win for West Brom Read more\n\n“Then we score out of the blue, which probably we didn’t deserve and in the second half we were a lot better. In the end we were perhaps unlucky to lose this game. There’s no doubt we’ve had some terrible injuries and they’ve really hurt us. The only good news coming out is that Bolasie looks like he is working well and should be involved next week and [Bakary] Sako should as well. They will be major factors in us turning this around because the pressure is on us now.” A trip to face Tottenham in the FA Cup will at least provide some distraction, but Pardew will know preserving their Premier League future is much more important.\n\nNow five ahead of Palace on 36 points, Watford will have no such worries even if Flores is taking nothing for granted just yet. “It means that we are very close to our target – to stay in the Premier League this season,” he said in what appeared to be his best Claudio Ranieri impression. “To come here and get a result is very difficult so it’s been a perfect day for us,” he said.\n\nFlores was more forthcoming when it was suggested Deeney, who has 70 league goals in four seasons, could be an outside contender for a place in England squad this summer. “Each week I say that [Harry] Kane, [Jamie] Vardy – these kind of players you can compare him with. But I want to stop a little bit about that because I am not the manager of the national team,” he said."}, {"date": "13/02/2016", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38103, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bryan Oviedo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Pienaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [14], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A very Tony Pulis type of victory also made for a sadly symptomatic defeat for Roberto Martínez. Purism 0 Pragmatism 1, perhaps. Salomón Rondón’s goal secured West Bromwich Albion’s first win in six league games and halted Everton’s revival after a hat-trick of 3-0 victories and it came in a fashion that highlighted trends at both clubs.\n\nSunderland boost survival hopes with late win over Manchester United Read more\n\nThere are few more attractive or attacking sides than Everton, but few who are breached in such avoidable fashion so often and none who concede as many goals on their own turf. No Premier League team has seen as little of the ball as Albion this season yet they barely required it here. Their exercise in efficiency coincided with a display of wastefulness from an Everton outfit who have not realised their considerable potential.\n\nThey had 74% of possession, 34 shots and 14 corners but failed to score. “Sometimes a dominant performance doesn’t give you a good result,” said Martínez. An utterly unapologetic Pulis countered: “The Premier League is not a level playing field. There are clubs with budgets and facilities better than yours and you have to find a way of winning. They have got a top-five squad. We defended for our lives.”\n\nAlbion earned their clean sheet. They were epitomised by Jonas Olsson, who set the tone by blocking Seamus Coleman’s second-minute shot, flung his body in the way of everything that came remotely near him and set up Albion’s goal.\n\nIt came in eminently predictable fashion. Albion excel at set-pieces while Everton struggle to defend them. Olsson met Stéphane Sessègnon’s corner with an emphatic header and was denied a goal purely by the predatory Rondón, who applied the finishing touch.\n\nA further 48 minutes elapsed before Albion’s next notable effort and that, from Chris Brunt, went wide. Yet the teamsheet had brought the implication that they would be more progressive. While Saido Berahino was recalled, his first league start since October came in central midfield. He swiftly became an auxiliary anchorman as Everton’s response to trailing amounted to a sustained assault. Ramiro Funes Mori had a header cleared off the line, Aaron Lennon’s bouncing shot was tipped over the bar by the backpedalling Ben Foster and Ross Barkley’s shot hit the post with the goalkeeper a motionless spectator. The woodwork was struck for the second time when Tom Cleverley fooled Foster with an overhit cross.\n\nSouthampton rise continues as Shane Long sinks Swansea City Read more\n\nThe range of those who came close is an indication of the commitment to attack. Funes Mori and Phil Jagielka in effect constituted a back two as everyone else swarmed forward. Their notional lone striker, Romelu Lukaku, was surrounded by colleagues. His Albion counterpart, Rondón, came off with an acute case of loneliness.\n\nHis team-mates were obdurate opponents in every respect. Their collective resilience was allied to a determination to delay goal kicks and free-kicks. “They were going to take 30 seconds over every dead ball,” said Martínez. “For the good of football, you don’t want to see the ball out of play so often.”\n\nThough the referee, Michael Oliver, booked Foster and Darren Fletcher for timewasting, Martínez blamed the officials, rather than Albion, insisting that “referees should be stronger”.\n\nAlbion displayed their mental strength. Victory leaves them on 32 points, eight away from realising the target of a manager who has never been relegated. “I have done this a long time,” said Pulis. “We need 40 points.”"}, {"date":

was changing his blueprint in the run-up to this match, concentrating more on his own team’s attacking qualities and worrying less about the opposition.\n\nPedro’s pair fuel Chelsea’s 5-1 rout of wretched Newcastle Read more\n\nJust over an hour into the game, that approach was paying off in spectacular style, as a fine strike from Robbie Brady and neat finish from Wes Hoolahan looked certain to have ended a horrible run of six defeats in all competitions.\n\nIt proved to be the case, but only because they clung on for a draw after conceding two goals in three minutes to a West Ham team transformed by the introduction of Victor Moses. The last few minutes were torture for the home crowd, who three weeks ago saw Liverpool come back to win after being two goals behind.\n\nEven so, Neil took a measure of encouragement from a performance that he insisted was a considerable improvement on their recent efforts. “We were back to being on the front foot more, we tried to attack the game, and we were good value for our two-goal lead,” he said.\n\n“The disappointing thing is we let the lead slip. We have to see the game out better. If anything it should be easier to defend when you have the lead.\n\n“But if we can keep getting ourselves into a position when we’re two up against good teams, we’ll keep giving ourselves opportunities to pick up points.”\n\nNorwich’s start was lively enough, right-back Russell Martin flashing a drive over Adrián’s bar in the first minute as Norwich looked to improve their record of being the team with the fewest touches of the ball in the opposition’s penalty area this season, but it was not long before the Hammers began to take control in midfield.\n\nOnly after Brady, playing desperately out of position at left-back, curled a free-kick over the bar did the home team respond. Jonny Howson’s thumping drive a foot too high was as close as Norwich came to a goal though and they lived dangerously at the back, where their high defensive line won some perilously close offside decisions.\n\nThe second half was an altogether more exciting affair. Cameron Jerome’s curler a foot wide was an indication Norwich had retained their dominance and the same player’s intelligent cross soon afterwards just eluded Steven Naismith at the far post.\n\nWasteful Everton frustrated as Salomón Rondón steals win for West Brom Read more\n\nIt was all Norwich and Jerome would have surely scored had Hoolahan not failed to pick him out. No matter. Michail Antonio dwelt on the ball 30 yards from goal and was caught in possession by Brady. The former Hull City player advanced 10 yards and with his weaker right foot curled the ball unerringly beyond Adrián.\n\nThe West Ham manager, Slaven Bilic, responded by sending on Andy Carroll and Moses, but neither had had a chance to make an impact when Norwich doubled their lead. Naismith’s shot was half-blocked, but the ball bounced up nicely for Hoolahan, running ahead of Naismith, to clip past Adrián.\n\nThat should have been that, but not here this season. Moses broke down the left and fired a shot that the diving John Ruddy could only push out as far as Dimitri Payet, who turned the ball home.\n\nNorwich’s nervousness was painful to witness. Three minutes later Carroll played in Payet on the left and the French midfielder cut the ball back for Mark Noble, steaming in on the edge of the box, to fire joyously beyond Ruddy.\n\nBoth sides could have won the game: Emmanuel Emenike missed West Ham’s best chance and deep in injury-time Redmond’s side-footed effort deflected just wide.\n\n“The guys off the bench made a huge impact,” said Bilic. “We’re never happy with a point and we should have won the game at the end, but we showed character and resilience.”"}, {"date": "13/02/2016", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance":

the top six thanks to Shane Long’s second-half goal.\n\nStoke new boy Giannelli Imbula inspires convincing win at Bournemouth Read more\n\nThe win at Swansea means Southampton have won five and drawn one of their past six games and moved within a point of fifth-placed Manchester United and seven of Manchester City in fourth. Koeman said his side’s ambitions have broadened in the last few weeks, with a top-four spot to qualify for the Champions League in their sights.\n\n“If Leicester can win the title, then we can finish fourth or fifth,” the Dutchman said. “We are only one point below Manchester United and my team is looking very comfortable. We had a difficult start to the season and a difficult period in December, but we are back fighting and looking to finish as high as possible in the table.”\n\nSouthampton’s rise has been based on an impregnable defence that has not conceded a goal in six games. It has coincided with the return of Fraser Forster after the England goalkeeper missed 10 months with a serious knee injury.\n\nLong found space inbetween defenders with 20 minutes remaining and was granted the freedom of the penalty area to convert James Ward-Prowse’s cross. Even then, Lukasz Fabianski might have kept the ball out of his net but he fumbled it over the line.\n\nSouthampton might have had a case for already being ahead as Graziano Pellè’s 57th-minute effort was disallowed for José Fonte dislodging the ball from Fabianski’s grasp.\n\n“We didn’t play so well in the first half but we played better football in the second half,” Koeman said. “We scored a great goal and we showed a great attitude. It was a good cross and good positioning in the penalty area for the goal. Shane had a free header, but he had still had to score.”\n\nTroy Deeney sends Watford eighth with double to beat Crystal Palace Read more\n\nSwansea remain three points above the relegation zone following their first defeat under Francesco Guidolin. Long’s ninth goal of the season ended Swansea’s four-game unbeaten run and the Italian head coach expressed his disappointment over the performance. “For the first time in my five matches here I saw my team play not very well,” he said. “I don’t know why we did not play well. This is my first month and it is difficult to understand anything.\n\n“We can do better, but Southampton are a good team and are difficult in some situations. They are playing well in this period with five victories and six clean sheets and score against a lot of teams, not just us.”\n\nSwansea created little to trouble Forster and company, but they had a strong penalty shout waved away in the final minute.

Newcastle United looked a depressingly dysfunctional side here, a team devoid of defensive steel as they crumpled obligingly to present Guus Hiddink with a first league win at home in his second spell as Chelsea’s interim manager. Subsiding in these parts might not normally be cause for huge alarm, but the champions have not been permitted to purr like this all season.\n\nChelsea 5-1 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nNewcastle were feeble, their first half performance in particular the kind that invites demotion. If Chelsea lost interest at times, a 12th match without defeat assured and thoughts drifting to Paris and the Champions League, they could still rouse themselves at will. The combination between Bertrand Traoré and César Azpilicueta seven minutes from the end proved as much, the pair scything through for the youngster to register a first Premier League goal. Chelsea have not been as high as 12th for four months though, in truth, this was as easy a thrashing as they could hope to inflict. A gentle warm-up for a testing tie ahead.\n\nSteve McClaren has his own challenges to confront. His team depart for a training camp in La Manga scarred by a sixth successive away defeat in all competitions, restored to the bottom three and with Sunderland, local rivals on an upward curve, breathing down their necks.\n\nThis was shambolic, a disgusting display lacking poise, leadership, discipline or fight. The same criticisms were levelled at the majority of these players after they succumbed to the same scoreline at Crystal Palace back in November. They were sunk from the opening exchanges, their performance summed up by Cheick Tioté’s dawdling in midfield, or the sight of their centre-halves seemingly ploughing through a quagmire as home players gleefully skipped across the surface at pace.\n\nIt actually felt dangerous to pass judgement on Chelsea given how obliging these opponents had proved to be. Certainly Paris Saint-Germain – aside from being encouraged by the twinge to the right thigh suffered by John Terry which forced him prematurely from the fray and will require a scan on Sunday – will have learned little other than that the Premier League champions can still be expansive when permitted to revel. They could run riot here without breaking into a sweat as Newcastle’s resistance extended no further than taking the kick-off.\n\nThey had been punctured by Chelsea’s first attack of any significance, Willian gliding away from his marker just inside the Newcastle half and then sliding a pass inside the hapless Fabricio Coloccini to infiltrate a ragged back-line. Diego Costa, the latest home player to sport a Zorro-style protective facial mask, held off Steven Taylor and clipped a first-time shot back across the on-rushing Rob Elliot that dribbled agonisingly into the corner of the net. The goal was Costa’s seventh in eight Premier League games.\n\nNewcastle were split with every forward pass, as Willian, Eden Hazard and Pedro left them dizzied. The locals sensed panic in visiting ranks. Rolando Aarons, a winger filling in unconvincingly at left-back, was culpable for the second after an attacking free-kick had been hooked back to the halfway line. The 20-year-old misplaced his pass towards Daryl Janmaat, Pedro collecting and scurrying away while the Dutch international slumped to the turf in disbelief. By the time he had picked himself up Pedro had converted crisply from just outside the penalty area.\n\nThe ease with which Costa outpaced Coloccini, then cut back inside to slide a pass across the area for Willian to score the third, was disturbing. Tioté had allowed the Brazilian the freedom of Stamford Bridge to glide up-field and convert and, for all that the visiting players held impromptu arm-flapping inquests at each break of play, their deficiencies remained. Pedro and Branislav Ivanovic should have added to the lead, though no team this slack at the back can hope to resist for long.\n\nAll it took was Cesc Fàbregas’s lofted pass, arcing over Taylor, to open them up again. Pedro darted in behind the centre-half, collected on his chest and dispatched a fourth beyond Elliot. Traoré had added a fifth before Andros Townsend dispatched a consolation from distance, though that meant little. Newcastle departed the turf battered and bruised, and even the prospect of a friendly against Lillestrom in Spain will not be appealing.

After scoring in and orchestrating Arsenal’s 2-0 victory over them at the Emirates Stadium on 28 December, the languid superstar repeated the trick here as his team found a measure of stability after a difficult period.\n\nBournemouth’s Eddie Howe says Mathieu Flamini should have seen red Read more\n\nÖzil’s first-half goal was his sixth of the season and his performance was the outstanding feature of a fairly routine win, which nonetheless was vital. Leicester City’s victory at Manchester City on Saturday had removed any of Arsenal’s margin for error but they did not wobble and the focus can now turn to next Sunday, when Leicester are the visitors to the Emirates.\n\n“In one week, Leicester has beaten Liverpool and Man City, so that means suddenly they become the favourite in the league,” Arsène Wenger said. “That makes our game on Sunday a very big one.”\n\nArsenal will start it five points behind, having also hauled themselves level with Tottenham Hotspur in second place. It was a timely tune-up after a run of four league matches without a win and three without a goal. Aaron Ramsey was also prominent during a first half in which Arsenal took a two-goal lead that they never looked like relinquishing.\n\nIt might have been different had Mathieu Flamini seen red, rather than yellow, for a two-footed tackle on Dan Gosling in the eighth minute. The Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, was among those who insisted that the Arsenal midfielder should have been dismissed but his first contact was with the ball and that saved him.\n\nHowe was left to lament a slow start from the home side, when they gave Arsenal too much room, and by the time they had cleared their heads they had too much to do.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored the second goal, hard on the heels of Özil’s opener, and although Bournemouth – in-form after five league wins from the previous 10 – fought hard and were decent enough they lacked cutting edge. The script had been written for the former Arsenal trainee, Benik Afobe, to be decisive up front but Özil and the visitors simply wrote their own.\n\nIt is Özil’s little touches, the pieces of stone-dead control that are sometimes inconsequential, that elevate the tone of a game and there was a wonderful moment early on when he tricked away from Adam Smith, surged up the flank and then jinked back inside the Bournemouth right-back after he had recovered. Smith appeared to catch Özil but there was no foul.\n\nNo matter. Özil was in the groove and the breakthrough came when Ramsey lofted a ball over the top towards Olivier Giroud, who nodded down and back for Özil. He did the rest. Simon Francis and Steve Cook flung themselves in front of him but his first-time right-footed shot fizzed into the roof of the net. “If Mesut starts to score with his right foot, that can be very interesting for us,” Wenger said.\n\nArsenal immediately turned the screw. Özil was involved in the buildup to the second goal, seeking out Alexis Sánchez with a typically urgent pass and, when it broke to Cook, his clearance found only Ramsey, who shifted it wide to Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n\nThe England winger had been a surprise inclusion in the lineup, having been preferred to Joel Campbell and Theo Walcott, and it was no exaggeration to say that it was a big game for him. He took his chance with nerveless precision, sending a low right-footed drive in off the far post. It was a sweet feeling for the former Southampton player, who cupped his ear at the Bournemouth fans who were jeering him.\n\nBournemouth played their football, with the full-backs, Smith and Charlie Daniels, catching the eye with their forward thrusts. They are symbols of Howe’s open and attacking style. Harry Arter worked Petr Cech on 27 minutes, after beating two men and having a crack, while Marc Pugh and Matt Ritchie had their moments in the first half. Pugh was denied by a piece of jet-heeled covering by Héctor Bellerín.\n\nArsenal, though, were in charge at the interval and they could reflect upon Özil’s fourth-minute burst, which was halted by Cook’s stretching challenge; Sánchez shooting over after the first of Ramsey’s probing through-balls and a shout for a penalty from Nacho Monreal, which was not given. Monreal thought Ritchie had fouled him.\n\nThere was plenty to like about Bournemouth’s performance, chiefly the pace and positivity, but there was not enough quality from them in the final third. Smith swelled the side-netting in the 52nd minute but with Afobe shackled by Laurent Koscielny and Gabriel Paulista, there was always the sense that Arsenal would see the game out.\n\nSánchez, Giroud and Ramsey had sightings of goal in the second half and Bournemouth’s flicker, when the substitute Josh King went close and Cech made a double save to deny Cook and Arter, was too little, too late.\n\nMan of the Match Mesut Özil (Arsenal)"}, {"date": "07/02/2016", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41434, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois",

"report": "This should have been the afternoon Manchester United breathed new life into their pursuit of the top four. Stamford Bridge may not be as impregnable as it once was, but victory would have edged the visitors within four points of the bottleneck beneath Leicester City, offering Louis van Gaal some respite amid all that familiar discord and doubt. He would not admit it, but to inflict defeat on a team who had started the campaign under José Mourinho, a friend who apparently now covets his job, might have provided added satisfaction.\n\nManchester United’s width gives impetus in improved display at Chelsea | Michael Cox Read more\n\nInstead, as the Dutchman berated the fourth official in the mouth of the tunnel at the end, then echoed his complaints through his post-match quotes at the referee’s eagerness to blow his whistle and choke a United counterattack at the end of each half, it was hard to escape an underlying sense of deflation.\n\nAs bright as United had been at times, at the start of the second period in particular, when a goal of real pedigree had eventually forced them ahead, they were also damagingly wasteful. Aside from profligacy, the concession to Diego Costa in added time was born of the substitute Memphis Depay’s weak surrender of possession at the other end of the pitch. Just as at Newcastle United last month, points had been frittered away. “To have conceded so late makes it feel like a defeat,” said Jesse Lingard.\n\nThis game should have been theirs, for all that Chelsea summoned a response in the final quarter in pursuit of an equaliser. David de Gea had done well to deny Branislav Ivanovic on the volley, then turn aside Cesc Fàbregas’s crunched shot towards the near post. When Costa rose to nod over as the fourth official’s board was raised, it felt as if the hosts’ opportunities had been and gone.\n\nInstead, Depay carelessly handed the home side another opportunity to spring upfield, the forward perhaps undecided whether to make for the corner and waste time or set up his fellow substitute Morgan Schneiderlin with a potential sight of goal. Chelsea regained the ball and, within seconds, Fàbregas was clipping a pass through the clutter of bodies on the edge of the United penalty area with panic having set in.\n\nThe visitors had been unnerved by John Terry’s presence as a makeshift forward, Daley Blind unsure just who he should be picking up only to slip as he belatedly broke forward, thereby clearing a pathway through which Fàbregas’s delivery duly squeezed. Cameron Borthwick-Jackson had played Costa onside and slid in desperately to try and intercept, only for his tackle to take the ball away from an on-rushing De Gea and neatly into the striker’s path.\n\nCosta collected and converted a seventh goal in nine appearances and the champions had extended their unbeaten run to 11 matches. They are also now on 30 points, 10 away from the traditional marker to avoid relegation. Their own frustration was born of De Gea’s fine save to thwart Costa in what time still remained and, more worryingly, a potentially serious knee injury sustained by Kurt Zouma that will be scanned on Monday.\n\nYet it was United who felt damaged. This had been one of their better displays, a performance to maintain the promise of those wins over Derby County and Stoke City even as all the uncertainty swirls over the manager’s long-term future at the club.\n\nThibaut Courtois had denied Anthony Martial, thrillingly, and Wayne Rooney, then Lingard at full stretch just as the visitors’ ascendancy was growing before the hour-mark.\n\nUnperturbed, Michael Carrick, Martial and the excellent Juan Mata pinged their passes once again to liberate Borthwick-Jackson from left-back. His centre was touched on by Rooney with the ball falling to Lingard, 12 yards out and with the 23-year-old’s back to goal. There was a touch, a spin and a fine rising shot on the turn which careered into the top corner before César Azpilicueta could summon a block.\n\nChelsea v Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nChelsea have found themselves in arrears too often on home territory, and a fifth defeat here loomed large. Their own attacking play had been generated in fits and starts, a flurry midway through the opening period when Costa and Oscar had found their range, and a wild penalty appeal in first-half stoppage time as John Terry’s shot struck Blind on the left elbow as he sprung out to intercept.\n\nZouma’s absence had disrupted their approach, the Frenchman having leapt to hack a loose ball upfield only for his right leg to buckle grotesquely on landing. He was taken off on a stretcher, distraught and clearly in agony. “It’s very bad when you land with a hyper-extension of your leg, very bad,” said Guus Hiddink before drumming his finger on the wooden desk. “Touch wood [it will not be the end of Zouma’s season] but, tomorrow, we’ll know more.”\n\nThey had still been reorganising when Lingard forced the visitors ahead, with Terry then pushed forward to bolster the attack with the game creeping away from Chelsea’s reach. Costa’s finish earned them a point, though those already faint hopes of making Europe through their league position are fading with each drawn match.\n\n“We are unbeaten [since Mourinho’s departure in December] but, if you want to get into fourth place, you have to make victories,” added Hiddink. “We have had too many draws to get to fourth place. So it’s difficult.”\n\nThat sounded like an understatement given United are six points off fourth place and still feel like outsiders in the pursuit of Champions League qualification.\n\nMan of the match David de Gea (Manchester United)"}, {"date": "06/02/2016", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54693, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [52]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [87], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bersant Celina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [52], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleix García Serrano", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [46], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [36], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3, 60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [48], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Demarai Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leonardo Ulloa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcin Wasilewski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Benjamin Chilwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Match of the season? Not quite. It takes two sides to make a real contest and Manchester City were so unimpressive in this early title showdown it made a mockery of the games’s first v second billing. Result of the decade? Quite possibly. Leicester still have to keep going – they have the small matter of a trip to the Emirates next Sunday – but they did not just squeeze past their closest rivals, they beat them handsomely.\n\nThe scoreline does not lie, except that Sergio Agüero’s late contribution rather flattered the home side. Manchester City could not have complained had they lost 4-0, such was the imbalance between opportunities created. “Scoring so early gave us confidence,” Leicester’s manager, Claudio Ranieri, said. “That allowed us to close down all the space.”\n\nIt had been suggested beforehand that Leicester’s pace and precision might find reward against Manchester’s City’s somewhat ponderous central defence, though it was envisaged Jamie Vardy or Riyad Mahrez might do the damage. Instead it was the unlikely figure of Robert Huth who turned out to be the two-goal hero as Ranieri’s team passed their greatest test to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League.\n\nThe big defender nipped in ahead of Martín Demichelis to give the visitors a third-minute lead as Manchester City failed to defend the first set piece of the game. Mahrez had set up the opportunity, drawing a foul from Aleksandar Kolarov with a run down the right and taking the free-kick himself. The home side might have been expecting a high cross but got a low one and Huth simply reacted quickest to get a foot to the ball on the six-yard line, even if a ricochet off the defender was the final touch.\n\nGoal of the season contender it was not, but it was a dream start for Leicester and one that helped them stick to the gameplan that has proved so effective this season. There is nothing complicated about what Leicester do, they stay compact and deep in defence and try to hit Vardy upfield on the counter.\n\nOnce City were obliged to chase an equaliser and leave gaps at the back it played into Leicester’s hands, at times excessively so, for on a few occasions in the first half the visitors were turning over a reckless amount of possession.\n\nConstantly inviting such dangerous players as David Silva and Raheem Sterling to carry the ball into the final third does not seem the most sensible of strategies, but Manchester City were short of ideas and invention and Leicester got away with it. The best chance Manchester City managed to create came right at the end of the first half when Agüero rolled a cross right across the face of an unprotected goal with no one available to tap it in.\n\nThe game was still in the balance while there was only a single goal in it and it seemed likely that if Leicester persisted in trying to soak up whatever their opponents could throw at them Manchester City would at some point get back on terms in the second half. So Leicester just repeated what they had done in the first half and scored another early goal, two minutes after the restart, and this time there was nothing scrappy about it.\n\nUsing Vardy in the centre as a decoy, Mahrez ran at the home defence and ended up outstripping almost the entire back four before beating Joe Hart with a confident finish. Pablo Zabaleta lost possession high up the field on Leicester’s left, Nicolás Otamendi sold himself too easily by going to ground without managing to dispossess the ball carrier, an elegant feint took Demichelis out of the equation and by the time Kolarov came across from the right to attempt a challenge it was too late to prevent the shot.\n\nIt might not have been as jaw-dropping as Vardy’s effort against Liverpool last week, but it was a goal elegant enough to light up any game and it prevented any accusations that Leicester had merely ridden their luck after taking an early lead.\n\nManuel Pellegrini made a double substitution in response, withdrawing the ineffective Yaya Touré and the labouring Fabian Delph. While Fernando did manage to bring a smart save from Kasper Schmeichel with a close-range header, Leicester went another goal in front before any tactical adjustment could take effect.\n\nIt was another from Huth at another set piece, this time a simple matter of rising higher than anyone else and nodding Christian Fuchs’s deep corner back over the head of a powerless Hart, though that bald description does scant justice to the part Vardy played in winning the corner.\n\nFlicking the ball beyond the home defence and accelerating into the penalty area to reach it, Vardy proved capable of terrorising Manchester City with his pace after all. He was unlucky not to score in the second half, on one occasion being foiled by Hart’s prompt action in coming off his line to block, then putting a header just wide from a corner and finally finding the side-netting with a shot from a tight angle.\n\nIf it had been all Manchester City in the first half, it was all Leicester City in the second. If the final score was a surprise, there was nothing inexplicable about it. Manchester City had struggled to create chances when they had a mountain of possession, largely through the hard work of the indefatigable Danny Drinkwater and N’Golo Kanté in closing them down. Agüero did grab a headed goal back right at the end, but you would be hard-pressed to work out how that afforded Manchester City any sort of consolation.\n\nThey had been outplayed and outthought by opponents who do the important things in football. Defend when necessary, score when possible. “My team defended bad and attacked bad,” was Pellegrini’s pithy summary. “But Leicester played very well. If they can continue like that they have a great chance of the title.”"}, {"date": "06/02/2016", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 32472, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Mark Bunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Micah Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Jores Okore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aly Cissokho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carles Gil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Veretout", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [51], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Lyden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Keinan Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Timm Klose", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [45], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastien Bassong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [12], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Wes Hoolahan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Bamford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ivo Pinto", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The Aston Villa manager, Rémi Garde, said Gabby Agbonlahor has eased his pain after the striker ended an 11-month drought.

Liverpool removed by a mass protest against rising ticket prices at Anfield. Pity the poor soul who woke the Liverpool manager to tell him this result.\n\nLiverpool fan walkout: around 10,000 leave in 77th minute in ticket price protest Read more\n\nAn estimated 10,000 supporters heeded the call for a 77th-minute walkout against Sunderland, singing “You greedy bastards, enough is enough” as they went in the hope that someone at Fenway Sports Group was listening. Anger and appendicitis were not Klopp’s only problems, however, as Liverpool blew a two-goal lead with eight minutes remaining against Sam Allardyce’s relegation-threatened team. Roberto Firmino and Adam Lallana established a comfortable advantage for the home side, only for Adam Johnson’s free-kick, and Simon Mignolet’s weak attempt to stop it, plus Defoe’s clinical late strike to extend Liverpool’s miserable run to five points out of 18 in 2016.\n\nThe exodus came with Liverpool cruising and Sunderland having offered little as a cohesive attacking threat, but attributing the comeback to empty seats in the stadium would be foolish in the extreme. Five Liverpool players failing to make a challenge as Sunderland worked the ball across the pitch before Defoe’s equaliser had a greater impact on the result than any dissenting voice in the crowd.\n\nPepijn Lijnders, Liverpool’s first team development coach, said in Klopp’s absence: “We have one of the best supporters’ groups in the world and if they want to make a statement they have the right to make a statement. Of course it didn’t change the game. It changed the atmosphere in the stadium but it didn’t change the team’s mentality.”\n\nAn argument presented by Liverpool’s chief executive, Ian Ayre, when defending controversial ticket prices was that supporters at Anfield are watching “the best team in the best atmosphere”. It didn’t require a pedestrian passing display from Liverpool against a Sunderland side intent on crowding their own penalty area to demonstrate the ludicrousness of that statement, although it was timely.\n\nA low-quality spectacle was played against the backdrop of an edgy, impatient atmosphere that resulted in even the usually mild-mannered Lucas Leiva arguing with a fan behind the Liverpool dugout in the second half.\n\nBlack flags lined the front of the Kop before kick-off as part of the ticket protest while banners proclaiming £nough is £nough and Football without fans is nothing – that one held aloft next to the directors’ box – appeared around the stadium. The cause is one that affects all football supporters, not only those at Anfield, and has momentum. The former Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton, who presided over the sale of the club to FSG, must have thought he was back in 2010 as he watched from the directors’ box.\n\nLiverpool enjoyed 82% possession in the first half yet their movement was predictable and threat minimal, as in the midweek defeat at league leaders Leicester City. Zeljko Buvac, Klopp’s Serbian assistant, attempted to cajole improvement from the touchline but that was not a straightforward ask against deep, unambitious opponents.\n\nInjuries to Dejan Lovren and Joe Allen disrupted the rhythm too, the defender departing as a precaution against a previous hamstring injury and the midfielder with a similar problem that will require a scan.\n\nSunderland’s willingness to invite pressure throughout seemed a risky strategy even after Alberto Moreno had wasted two good openings for Liverpool before the interval. So it proved when Firmino took control and looked to have steered Liverpool towards victory.\n\nWhy I walked: Liverpool fan explains protest during Sunderland draw Read more\n\nThe Brazilian went close with a 25-yard drive after nutmegging Jan Kirchhoff. He then opened the scoring in fine style when James Milner swept over a cross from the left-hand touchline and Firmino, having peeled off his marker, sent a header back across Vito Mannone and inside the far post.\n\nThree points seemed assured when Firmino charged down a Billy Jones clearance, sprinted into the Sunderland area and played a perfect pass behind the sprawling John O’Shea for Lallana to score into an empty net. Then came the walkout and the stirring recovery.\n\nJohnson, on for Kirchhoff, began the fightback with a low free-kick that curled around the Liverpool wall and beat Mignolet’s weak grasp at his near post. In the final minute, with Liverpool dropping off dangerously, Wahbi Khazri found Defoe inside the penalty area and the predator turned Mamadou Sakho far too easily before sending an unstoppable finish beyond the keeper. “We deserved more against Manchester City in midweek and didn’t get it,” said Allardyce, whose team are four points from safety.\n\n“We may not have deserved this result but great credit to the players for their never-say-die attitude. With Jermain Defoe in the team you always have a chance.”"}, {"date": "06/02/2016", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 50152, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Cheick Tiote", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henri Saivet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seydou Doumbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Barlaser", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Ben Foster", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [83], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sandro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}], "subs": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sébastien Pocognoli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "At the final whistle Steve McClaren shook every Newcastle United player – as well as West Brom’s Saido Berahino – by the hand. His team were out of the bottom three, his job was considerably more secure than at 3pm and, for once, there seemed cause for cautious optimism on Tyneside.\n\nComplemented by Andros Townsend’s promising home debut, Steven Taylor’s assured return to central defence and Cheick Tioté’s no-nonsense dictation of midfield, Aleksandar Mitrovic’s first-half winner proved sufficient to undo Tony Pulis deeply underwhelming, if injury-hit, side.\n\n“That’s the most disappointing game we’ve played since I’ve been at the club,” said West Brom’s manager, who admitted his players have yet to banish their own, albeit outside, relegation fears. “We shadow boxed for 90 minutes. Newcastle were better than us all over the pitch; we couldn’t get near them. Nobody in the bottom half of the table will think they’re safe and we’re no different, but my players are human beings and human beings have days like this.”\n\nIf Pulis could have done with the absent Jonny Evans, Chris Brunt and James Morrison, Newcastle, too, were somewhat patched up with Taylor back in defence after five months on the sidelines following hamstring surgery, Tioté restored to midfield after the collapse of a mooted move to China and Rolando Aarons, a winger filling in admirably at left back.\n\n“The heroes today were Steven Taylor, Cheick Tioté and Rolando Aarons,” said McClaren who was relieved to begin erasing the memory of last Wednesday’s abject 3-0 defeat at Everton. “This was a big game and these are three enormous points.”\n\nBut for Ben Foster the margin of victory would surely have been greater. West Brom’s goalkeeper swiftly showed some reassuringly sharp reflexes and did well to repel Andros Townsend’s 20-yard shot before denying Mitrovic from two yards.\n\nScruffy, scrappy and with Darren Fletcher fighting a forlorn battle to bring some cohesion to their play while Sandro struggled to second guess Gini Wijnaldum, Pulis’s players seemed barely capable of escaping their own half. Apparently unable to string a couple of passes together, they retreated ever deeper with Townsend’s two footed ability clearly fazing James Chester.\n\nTioté – who had seemed destined to be in Shanghai by now – thought he had scored a fabulous goal from 25 yards only to see it disallowed as Mitrovic was blocking Foster’s sight-line while occupying an offside position. No matter; home fans were soon celebrating after Jonjo Shelvey’s smart through ball prefaced Mitrovic sliding an accomplished low shot beyond the advancing Foster.\n\nWhen Craig Gardner subsequently dodged Aarons and directed the ball low across goal McClaren swore profusely but, as James McClean shaped to shoot, Daryl Janmaat’s last-ditch interception rescued the situation.\n\nNewcastle’s manager probably cursed some more when Pulis brought Berahino – the subject of a failed £21m bid from St James’ Park last week – on for the second half. Sure enough, Berahino’s lovely touch created a shooting chance blasted wildly over by Alex Pritchard. “We’ve had a shot, we’ve had a shot,” sang West Brom’s increasingly sarcastic travelling support.\n\nBerahino – by now not having to merely cope with Taylor’s intelligent marking but further close attention from Tioté – later had a shot blocked, Wijnaldum headed just over the bar and Townsend struck a post.\n\n“We had so many chances we should have won by more than 1-0 but we thoroughly deserved it,” said McClaren who received a big hug from Tioté at the end. “We were hugely disappointed and angry after Everton, but we got the perfect reaction.”"}, {"date": "06/02/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27733, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup":

December was seen as further evidence that Roberto Martínez’s side are unable to take one step forward without subsequently shooting themselves in the foot. Inspired by the magnificent Ross Barkley, however, there was no late capitulation from Everton this time and they took Stoke’s place in the top half of the table after winning consecutive league games for the first time this season.\n\nYet that statistic alone sums up why Everton have been struggling rather than challenging for Champions League qualification and this comprehensive victory over Stoke, who have badly lost their way since the turn of the year, must be the moment when they finally rid themselves of their debilitating inconsistency. When Everton are this convincing, it emphasises why it will be an awful shame if they fall short of their potential.\n\n“The School of Science, it’s on the way back” was the constant soundtrack from the away end at the Britannia Stadium and after 3-0 wins over Carlisle United in the FA Cup last Sunday and Newcastle United in the league on Wednesday, breaching the Stoke defence three times inside the opening 42 minutes means that only Leicester City and Manchester City have bettered Everton’s total of 46 goals in 25 league matches.\n\nAnother clean sheet was equally satisfactory, although it must be pointed out that Stoke have scored one goal in their past six matches in all competitions. They have run into a brick wall after an intense run of fixtures, exiting both cups in the past month and failing to win in the league since 13 January. “Disappointing result, disappointing performance,” Mark Hughes said.\n\nEverton have turned losing leads into an art form under Martínez and their ability to defend an advantage was under the spotlight after Romelu Lukaku sent Jack Butland the wrong way from the spot in the 11th minute. The move that led to the penalty was Everton at their most incisive and, watching from the stands, Roy Hodgson must have purred at the sight of Barkley, seemingly pinned to the touchline, instigating the attack with the brilliantly instinctive backheel that sliced Stoke open on the left.\n\nIt was a glittering reminder of Barkley’s potential, the 22-year-old England midfielder creating danger out of nothing with an instant flick into space, and Bryan Oviedo cantered forward before releasing the impressive Tom Cleverley, who invited contact from Butland. Playing through the pain barrier after taking a blow to the knee against Newcastle, Lukaku coolly matched his tally of 20 goals last season.\n\nStoke fell to pieces after Lukaku’s goal. They were 3-0 down by the time they tested Joel Robles for the first time and while there was an appreciative roar when Giannelli Imbula snapped into a robust early challenge a minute into his debut, Stoke’s record signing could later be seen shivering in the wet and the wind.\n\nIt was a rough introduction to the Premier League for the French midfielder after his £18.5m move from Porto on deadline day, while Stoke badly missed Ryan Shawcross in central defence. Séamus Coleman was unmarked when he glanced Cleverley’s corner past Butland in the 28th minute and worse was to come.\n\nStoke were regarded as one of the most exciting sides in the league when they were inspired by Marko Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri in that wild win at Goodison on 28 December. Yet Arnautovic was shackled by Coleman, Shaqiri’s end product was minimal and Bojan Krkic stayed on the bench for the entire 90 minutes. Mame Biram Diouf was peripheral in Krkic’s place and Stoke’s lack of focus was encapsulated by Philipp Wollscheid’s dreadful pass inside to Aaron Lennon, whose finish was clinical.\n\nMartínez praised his side’s maturity. “Early on in the season we showed that we can score goals against anyone and then we’ve been throwing leads away too cheaply,” he said.\n\nStoke’s performance was littered with countless errors and Everton wasted chances to inflict further humiliation on them in the second half, but this was an afternoon when they had no need for the cushion of a fourth goal."}, {"date":

run to four matches but that was small consolation on an afternoon when Francesco Guidolin’s team paid a high price for their first-half profligacy and were once again left to rue their inability to defend set pieces.\n\nFor the third successive game, Swansea conceded from a corner and it was no surprise that Scott Dann was the latest man to punish them. “He’s a goal machine,” sang the Crystal Palace supporters after Dann scored for the fifth time this season to end a run of five straight league defeats and, in the process, put a smile back on the face of Alan Pardew, who had cut a miserable and frustrated figure in the first half.\n\nAhead through a trademark Gylfi Sigurdsson free-kick, Swansea controlled the opening 45 minutes and could have put the game beyond Palace during that period. Instead, they were left to lament the chances that were spurned and the equaliser from Dann, three minutes after the interval, that resulted in two points slipping through their fingers in their battle for survival. The Welsh club are in 16th place in the Premier League, only four points above the bottom three.\n\n“I think this was the best we have played since I came here,” said Guidolin. “It wasn’t easy because the weather wasn’t good for a side who try to play on the floor. But my team did play well for 90 minutes and I thought we deserved to win. We just let things slip a bit at the start of the second half.”\n\nPardew acknowledged how disappointed he had been with Palace’s first-half performance when he said that his players looked apprehensive and inhibited, almost as if they were thinking too much and playing the game “like it was a chess board”.\n\nHe withdrew Lee Chung-yong at half-time, replaced him with Marouane Chamakh, set Palace up in a much more orthodox 4-4-2 and got an instant reward when Dann swept home.\n\nPalace still had to weather the storm at times in the second half, as Swansea desperately pushed for a winner. “I suppose if I was Swansea I might think: ‘We should have won it,’” admitted Pardew. “But, for us, this was everything today – we really had to sit ourselves down at half-time. The start of the second half was our best period. But make no mistake, it was Crystal Palace DNA that saw us home – real character, getting blocks in at the end.”\n\nEmmanuel Adebayor was given his first league start in 15 months but made little impression and was guilty of giving away the free-kick that led to Sigurdsson putting Swansea ahead with a perfectly placed curling shot that crept inside Wayne Hennessey’s near post. Then came those missed opportunities as André Ayew twice came close to scoring and Wayne Routledge curled a shot narrowly wide.\n\nDann was not so generous when he got away from Federico Fernández to convert from close range after Damien Delaney had flicked on Yohan Cabaye’s corner. Remarkably, Dann is now Crystal Palace’s joint top scorer on five, along with Cabaye.\n\n“Scott keeps coming up with goals,” Pardew said. “You have only got to stand next to us in the tunnel – we’re a huge side, so set plays are very important to us. He smashed it home and he’s a natural finisher actually, for a centre-half.”\n\nWilliams twice found himself in a similar position to Dann, but the Swansea captain was unable to force the ball home. Sandwiched between those opportunities, Modou Barrow drilled a ferocious shot over the crossbar and Hiram Boateng, who was making his first Premier League appearance, dragged the ball narrowly wide for Palace."}, {"date": "06/02/2016", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35997, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [54]}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mario Suarez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Almen Abdi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Manuel Jurado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [54], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Valon Behrami", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nordin Amrabat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "If Leicester City are the sensation of the season so far, Tottenham are emerging as surprise No2. Their sixth win in succession was far more emphatic than the scoreline suggests and added to the quietly spoken suspicion that the team who now stand second in the table could yet finish on top. Kieran Trippier’s goal may have been the only difference between the teams on the scoresheet here but the Watford manager, Quique Sánchez Flores, admitted his side had been utterly overwhelmed. He, for one, has no doubt that Spurs can be champions.\n\n“They deserve to fight for the league,” said Flores. “They play very well. They have a very clear plan. They have good technical and individual players. They defend well. They have everything needed to try to win the championship. The problem with playing against Tottenham is they have a lot variation. It’s very difficult to stop them. They have high quality, high velocity, very technical level and high power. They create space in an amazing way and it was very difficult for us to solve every problem in defence.”\n\nWatford did their utmost to subdue their hosts. For the first time since the opening day of the season, Flores broke up the strike partnership of Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney, with the latter starting on the bench because of a slight knock. The change allowed the visitors to deploy five across midfield in an attempt to stifle Spurs’ creativity, which promised to be bountiful, even though Dele Alli began in the dugout after his midweek illness. The plot worked only insofar as Watford made it to the interval without conceding, although Spurs’ erratic finishing played a part in that.\n\nThe home team virtually monopolised possession from kick-off and forged several chances, mainly thanks to raids by the full-backs, Trippier and Ben Davies, but also through astute passes from deep by Eric Dier. He teed up the first opening in the eighth minute with a delightful long pass to Harry Kane, who took one touch before trying to lob the advancing Heurelho Gomes, who managed to save comfortably.\n\nThe Brazilian goalkeeper made important blocks later in the half to foil Davies and Erik Lamela. But he should have been beaten in the 33rd minute when Nacer Chadli darted on to a free-kick delivered by Lamela, only to head over the bar from close range. Kane perpetrated a similar miss just before the break, volleying over after another fine pass by Dier.\n\nThe shot count read 12-1 to Spurs at half-time but no one needed telling that the blank scoresheet meant Watford’s hopes of sneaking a win on the counterattack remained intact, especially as their lone effort in the first half had almost dropped into the goal, Almen Abdi looping a shot from 25 yards out on to the roof of the net after Hugo Lloris had been caught in no man’s land.\n\nAbdi was replaced by Deeney for the second period. Most of the play continued in the direction of the Watford goal, however, and Miguel Britos had to make a courageous block to deny Chadli in the 47th minute.\n\nThree minutes later, Watford were grateful to the referee, Roger East, for waving away frenzied appeals for a penalty after Gomes appeared to send Kane tumbling.\n\nJust before the hour, Trippier swung in a cross from the right that Chadli could not turn into the net. It was impossible to dodge the thought that Alli would have converted one of the chances spurned by the Belgian. Pochettino made the obvious substitution on the hour. It only took three minutes for it to pay off.\n\nIn a sweeping Spurs move, Mousa Dembélé played a lovely reverse pass to Alli on the left and Alli swished the ball across the face of goal with the outside of his boot. Trippier raced in at the back post to turn it into the net. It was the former Burnley player’s first goal since his £3.5m summer transfer to Tottenham, and the celebrations were laced with relief all around the ground.\n\nSpurs, all too aware of the number of frustrating draws that they have endured this season, were hellbent on ensuring that Watford did not mount a comeback. The hosts continued attacking until the end and must have been frustrated not to increase their goal haul. That was the only negative aspect to another heartening performance. “We are in a very good position, but we need to keep working and don’t think too much about the future,” said Pochettino, still loth to deviate from his one-game-at-a-time mantra. “It is better to do than to speak.”"}, {"date": "06/02/2016", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 29161, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton",

Victor Wanyama’s avoidable sending-off in the 54th minute meant they had to withstand a barrage of West Ham United pressure but the resurgence of Ronald Koeman’s team since the turn of the year shows no sign of abating thanks to Maya Yoshida’s early goal.\n\nThis victory made it 13 points from the last 15 and suddenly a top-six place is in Southampton’s sights. They have still not conceded since Fraser Forster made his return from injury against Watford five games ago and for all the talk about Jack Butland competing with Joe Hart for England’s No1 shirt, the Saints keeper has surely wrestled his way back into the reckoning.\n\nSouthampton 1-0 West Ham United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nKoeman said of Forster: “The goalkeeper deserves a lot of credit but the team showed spirit and an example of how to defend with 11 against 10. They had a lot of crosses, shots outside the box but I was comfortable with how we defended today.”\n\nSlaven Bilic was disappointed by his team’s inability to threaten Forster sufficiently and another slow start that ultimately defined the contest. The West Ham manager said: “We were the better team for three-quarters of the game. But they were better in the first 10 to 15 minutes and we helped them a lot. We have to give them credit as well, they defended well. I am really disappointed – it was a great opportunity for us and we shouldn’t have wasted it like that.”\n\nJermain Defoe strikes in 89th minute for Sunderland to draw with Liverpool Read more\n\nSouthampton started like a team on a mission, capitalising on West Ham’s sluggish beginning and deservedly taking the lead after nine minutes. They could have broken the deadlock a minute earlier when Adrián denied Cédric Soares’s header after the wing-back ghosted in unnoticed.\n\nThe goal, though, was worth waiting for. Jordy Clasie overhit a corner on the left and the ball was retrieved by Wanyama on the opposite flank. A passing triangle with José Fonte and Sadio Mané developed before Wanyama fed a low ball towards the six-yard box. It took a slight deflection but Yoshida was on hand to tuck it home from close range.\n\nIt took almost half an hour for West Ham to get a sight of goal, only for Forster to produce an outstanding reaction save to deny Winston Reid from five yards. That was the closest they came. Reid glanced a Dimitri Payet corner wide approaching half-time and Enner Valencia was denied by Forster six minutes into the second half but when Wanyama stupidly scissored through Payet minutes later, receiving a straight red card, the initiative was very much handed to the visitors.\n\nThe Kenyan had been doing a superb job in keeping West Ham’s star player quiet but after losing control of the ball he also lost his head and swung in needlessly from behind. There was no malice but it was certainly careless and Payet was lucky to escape without serious injury.\n\n“I don’t mind sliding,” Bilic said. “When I played it was a big part of my game – I like it when it’s clear and honest and fair on the ball. But for me as soon as the second leg comes into the challenge it gives the referee a really good reason. There is no point for the second leg and it was reckless.”\n\nKoeman believed it was harsh but would not criticise Mark Clattenburg, who is “one of the best referees”. Koeman will still sit down with Wanyama and discuss his third dismissal of the campaign. “That’s not good because you have to learn from mistakes. I will speak with Victor. I didn’t after game because everybody was so happy about the result.”\n\nTen minutes after Southampton were reduced to 10 men, Shane Long could have made life a lot easier for them when capitalising on James Collins’s misjudgment of a long ball but skied his shot.\n\nFrom that juncture West Ham’s pressure was relentless, yet Southampton’s blockade remained impenetrable. Alex Song swung tamely wide twice, Emmanuel Emenike, making his debut from the bench, headed off target and Valencia had an effort blocked by Carroll.\n\nSouthampton were still a potent force on the counterattack and Charlie Austin should have wrapped things up three minutes from time when fed by Oriol Romeu. Koeman said: “Even down to 10 men we had the best chances to score.”"}, {"date": "03/02/2016", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 36061, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bryan Oviedo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [88, 90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Pienaar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jindrich Stanek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chancel Mbemba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [44]}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Henri Saivet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andros Townsend", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Seydou Doumbia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [88], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [44], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The questions about investment at Newcastle United can be legitimately asked by their owner, Mike Ashley, not of him. St James’ Park has received almost £80m worth of new players since last summer and Steve McClaren has nothing but a relegation fight to show for it. A porous defence and meek attack were the gifts Everton craved to record their first home league win since November.\n\nSteve McClaren slams ‘unacceptable’ Newcastle display in Everton defeat Read more\n\nDriven throughout by Ross Barkley, Roberto Martínez’s side were comfortable victors even though the scoreline that reflected their superiority arrived via two late penalties from the best player on the pitch. Barkley completed his 100th league appearance for his boyhood club with a Panenka penalty, chipped down the middle of Rob Elliot’s goal in stoppage time. The midfielder’s second, Everton’s third, encapsulated the performance of both teams. Whereas the 22-year-old exuded confidence, the Newcastle substitute Jamaal Lascelles lost possession to Barkley before bundling him over inside the area to concede the spot-kick and collect a red card. It was control versus carelessness throughout Martínez’s 100th league game as Everton manager.\n\nLascelles will be suspended for West Bromwich Albion’s visit to St James’ on Saturday and McClaren lost two other defenders here, Chancel Mbemba and Paul Dummett, to injury. Of the £80m outlay only £8.4m was spent on reinforcing a woeful back line. The flaws in that strategy were exposed at Goodison and present a serious threat to Newcastle’s survival prospects.\n\nBut, like many managers in a fix, McClaren’s problems are not confined to one department. The visitors posed minimal threat to an Everton defence without the injured John Stones and Tim Howard. Trailing to Aaron Lennon’s first-half finish, Newcastle had one chance to punish Everton’s failure to make the contest safe before the hour mark – as they should have done – when unmarked substitute Aleksandar Mitrovic volleyed Moussa Sissoko’s cross wide from eight yards out. The mass of Newcastle heads in hands told of an opportunity lost, and more mistakes at the back proved them right.\n\nEverton were the more assured, committed side from the start with Tom Cleverley forcing a good early save from Elliot. Romelu Lukaku’s movement was restricted from the moment he took a kick in the lower back from Mbemba, and was replaced at the interval, while Barkley often dropped deep to instigate play as the home side initially struggled to pick a hole in the visiting rearguard. But that was the extent of Everton’s problems. Newcastle’s threat was non-existent with the exception of Mitrovic’s miss in the 66th minute.\n\nThe Dozen: midweek's best Premier League photos Read more\n\nBryan Oviedo, deputising for Leighton Baines at left-back, was allowed far too much time and space to release Cleverley between Daryl Janmaat and Mbemba. Cleverley, who delivered Everton’s last league win with a stoppage-time header at St James’ Park on Boxing Day, squared for Lennon and his shot on the turn rolled through Georginio Wijnaldum’s legs to leave Elliot rooted to the spot. Lennon almost scored his third goal in two games from a similar spot but his goalbound effort from Seamus Coleman’s cut-back was blocked by Mbemba, who exited moments later with an ankle problem.\n\nRobles was forced into his first save in the 50th minute when Jonjo Shelvey sent a tame effort into his arms. Everton, by contrast, could have been out of sight by the hour. Lennon and Arouna Koné, Lukaku’s replacement, both squandered clear openings after Barkley sent the winger clear through the centre of the visiting defence. Lennon shot straight at Elliot before Koné dawdled over the rebound before slicing wide. The home side then struck the woodwork three times in six minutes.\n\nBarkley’s attempt to find the top corner was tipped superbly on to the bar by the Newcastle goalkeeper, who found the same spot when Shelvey almost headed Cleverley’s free-kick into his own net. The third came from another Cleverley free-kick that struck Elliot’s near post.\n\nThe longer Everton went without making the game safe the more apprehensive Goodison became. For a short while at least. Newcastle’s support – who have witnessed the fewest goals by a team away from home this season – implored their players to “attack, attack, attack” but the message went unheeded. Any hope of a recovery disappeared in the closing stages when Lennon won a decisive penalty in this fixture for the second season in succession, breaking clear of substitute Rolando Aarons inside the area who reacted with a needless foul. Barkley sent Elliot the wrong way from the spot, Everton could at last breathe easily on home soil, and the Panenka finale capped the midfielder’s – and Martínez’s – century in style."}, {"date":

into the Watford half and towards those upstanding in one corner of the Vicarage Road stand to applaud the chanting of his name and thump the badge on his chest. The centre-half believes he will be denied the “fairytale ending” of retiring as a Chelsea player and, unless both parties can find reconciliation, every game between now and the summer will feel like a farewell. On this evidence, the sense of anti-climax will end up shared by club and captain.\n\nThis was a 10th match in all competitions without defeat for the champions since José Mourinho was sacked in December but, confronted by a Watford side who simply would not wilt, it still ended up feeling wasteful.\n\nThe Dozen: midweek's best Premier League photos Read more\n\nThe visitors were disjointed, playing in fits and starts and offering only flashes of the fluency which had dismantled MK Dons in the FA Cup on Sunday. Those Championship opponents were naively obliging. Watford, newly risen from the second tier, are anything but these days and Quique Sánchez Flores’ more streetwise team discomforted their visitors throughout the first period. They are the side who now loiter in the top half of the table while Chelsea peer up at them from below.\n\nOnly in the latter stages did Guus Hiddink’s team really threaten a third away win in succession, when Heurelho Gomes shrugged himself awake to block from Branislav Ivanovic and, brilliantly, claw away Diego Costa’s header in the last few minutes. Hiddink had worked with the Brazilian at PSV Eindhoven and bemoaned the goalkeeper’s heroics in opposition. He was less complimentary about Juan Carlos Paredes’ theatrics in first-half stoppage time, Watford’s Ecuadorian right-back rolling around clutching his face after brushing with the occasion’s predictable pantomime villain, Costa, in front of the dugouts.\n\n“We were very close, it was 10 yards from our bench, and Paredes punched Diego in his back and then they stumbled,” said Hiddink. “Then Paredes brought his hand to his head, and Diego had been nowhere near his head. They stumbled. It was provocation to get someone off the pitch. Happily the referee and the assistant saw it and didn’t fall for it because there was no way Diego was close to his face. This is a man’s game.”\n\nBoth players were booked, though Paredes can also expect a dressing down from his club captain back at the training ground in London Colney on Thursday. “He didn’t help himself,” said Troy Deeney. “It was ‘soft’, that’s the best word to describe it. Where I grew up, and the way I grew up playing football, people would get kicked for rolling around like that. It was all a bit pathetic. But it’s new-age football. There’s a little touch and everyone’s rolling around. It’s just handbags. In Sunday League that wouldn’t happen because you’d be laughed at. I don’t like to see it, to be honest, and we’ll have a word with Paredes on our side.”\n\nIt was that kind of game, a spluttering stalemate crying out for a flash of inspiration from Eden Hazard or Odion Ighalo, Oscar or José Manuel Jurado. They all offered tasters of their quality but too much of it was lost amid the stodge of midfield.\n\nAaron Lennon and Ross Barkley strike for Everton to beat Newcastle Read more\n\nThe hosts could consider two draws with the reigning champions this term as reason for satisfaction, Flores describing most aspects of their performance as “amazing” in the aftermath while admitting taking Costa to one side at the end “to tell him I love him”. He had coached the young Brazilian, since turned Spain international, when they were at Atlético Madrid. The majority in the crowd preferred to heckle Costa, riled by the aggression which he has made his trademark but thankful he had seen his first-half effort deflected wide by Craig Cathcart.\n\nWatford were not afraid to muscle their way into opponents as well, with Deeney driving Chelsea’s full-backs into their shells and Ighalo denied from close range by César Azpilicueta’s block from José Holebas’ fine centre. Thibaut Courtois thwarted Sebastian Prödl and Étienne Capoue, yet they were stretched in the latter stages and relieved by the final whistle.\n\n“You have to compare us to how the team were when we came in,” added Hiddink. “It had been a difficult half-year but, step by step, we’re getting back to how we like to play.”\n\nThat is proving a slow process, despite the unbeaten sequence, and the top six remain a distant 10 points away.

A goalless draw with Southampton on a fretful night at the Emirates leaves Arsène Wenger’s team without a goal in their past three league games and with a title challenge that looks increasingly snarled in the midwinter gloom.\n\nArsène Wenger blames Arsenal’s poor finishing in Southampton stalemate Read more\n\nFraser Forster was brilliant, a goalkeeper who combines prodigious size and brawn with a balletic agility producing a full range of saves from the athletic to the instinctive. But Arsenal were also lacklustre for the first hour and hesitant in their finishing even as the chances began to flow, with an attack that looked more than ever like one elite German playmaker plus a group of mid-ranking hopefuls. Despite a blizzard of chances in the final 20 minutes Southampton were largely undisturbed, with Forster a thrillingly resolute yellow wall. “He was magic,” Ronald Koeman purred.\n\nFour points clear of Manchester City on Christmas Day, Arsenal now find themselves in fourth place having won two of their past seven league games, a run that began with the 4-0 Boxing Day defeat by Southampton. Wenger’s excuses this week for that flaccid performance – “it was Christmas” – seemed a little odd, but they came with the promise Arsenal would look to start with purpose here.\n\nOr not, as it turned out. There are times where the more potent atmosphere of a smaller, less commercially accessible stadium might be a genuine asset to this team. Instead, in almost total silence from London’s largest home crowd, it was Southampton who began with more composure, James Ward-Prowse drawing an early save from Petr Cech with a driven free-kick.\n\nArsenal made seven changes from the FA Cup victory against Burnley, the most notable the return of Mesut Özil to start alongside Alexis Sánchez for the first time since November. It was Özil who had Arsenal’s first chance with 12 minutes gone, running on to Sánchez’s floated pass and taking the most beautiful stone-dead touch only for Forster to save well with his legs as he shot.\n\nSouthampton came to the Emirates having not conceded a goal in 200 minutes of league football, and they looked intent on keeping it that way with Oriol Romeu and Victor Wanyama a muscular double bolt in midfield. Arsenal went wide, Héctor Bellerín skating outside Cédric Soares and producing a fine cross that Olivier Giroud headed back across goal. Özil flicked towards an apparently gaping net from five yards out only to see Forster, spreading his arms, produce a genuinely stunning save. With half-time approaching Özil was again crowded out inside the six-yard box after good work from Joel Campbell. But it was Southampton, composed in defence and intermittently energetic in support of Shane Long, who looked the happier team at the break.\n\nArsenal returned energised – these things are relative – and almost scored straight away, Forster again outstanding. This time it was after a fine driving run by Ramsey, Forster leaping high, superhero-style, to palm away Giroud’s hooked shot. Still, though, Romeu, Wanyama and Ward-Prowse kept a grip on central midfield, while Sadio Mané flickered at the other end. Giroud looked cumbersome linking the play, Campbell energetic but vague. With Sánchez still finding his gears and Ramsey filling a hole in central midfield, Wenger’s starting team here looked alarmingly dependent on Özil for creativity.\n\nTottenham’s Dele Alli and Harry Kane make light work of Norwich Read more\n\nTheo Walcott came on just past the hour mark, a man for a crisis perhaps, but a man also with one Premier League goal since September. Walcott drew a double save from Forster, the first a weak low shot with time to think, the second a thrash at chest height. Moments later Laurent Koscielny headed Özil’s fizzed cross over the bar from three yards out.\n\nSuddenly the chances were coming. Romeu kicked off the line after Sánchez’s neat turn and poked shot. Özil and Sánchez combined only for Forster, again, to claw the ball away. Chasing a goal at the last Wenger sent on Francis Coquelin who was immediately booked for an angry tackle on Long. Six minutes of added time brought a strangled roar of hope from the home fans but Southampton remained spiky and resilient to the end.\n\nArsenal will feel they should have won this match, but there has been a sense of declining momentum about them since Christmas. Missing Santi Cazorla’s guile – and to a lesser degree the urgency of Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck – it seems increasingly odd even the famously parsimonious Wenger could look at this squad over two transfer windows and decide against going all-out for a first-team-ready outfield player. With new arrivals, new eras, fresh rounds of likely acquisitions announced elsewhere in the Premier League this week, it was a particularly galling night to come up short again."}, {"date":

Yet they also produced some moments of genuine class, including a wonderful passage of one-touch football prior to Vardy’s second goal that would not have looked out of place at Camp Nou and ended with Shinji Okazaki going down in the area and appealing in vain for a penalty.\n\nIt was certainly some start to a trio of matches that many believe will define Leicester’s season and determine whether they really can go on and do the unthinkable – win the league. After their trip to the Etihad Stadium, Leicester travel to Arsenal the following Sunday and if they can come through those two fixtures still enjoying the view from the top, Leicester supporters can really start to dream.\n\nJamie Vardy set to sign new Leicester contract tying him to club until 2019 Read more\n\nThis turned into a chastening experience for Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp prides himself on creating teams that press aggressively and cover every blade of grass, but the Liverpool manager was beaten at his own game here as Leicester worked tirelessly to close down their opponents, pinch possession and break with alacrity. “We didn’t give the Liverpool players time to think,” Ranieri said.\n\nFast and furious, the game was played at a breathless pace at times, in particular in the opening half hour, and the only surprise was that it took so long for the first goal to arrive. Mignolet had something to do with that, the Liverpool goalkeeper producing two outstanding first-half saves, pushing Okazaki’s point-blank header on to the bar, from Vardy’s exquisite cross, and then tipping Riyad Mahrez’s sumptuous curling shot over later in the first half.\n\nLiverpool had their moments in the opening 45 minutes and got into some promising positions but lacked conviction when it mattered most. Mamadou Sakho and Roberto Firmino were playing a game of head-tennis in the Leicester area at one stage when either man could have gone for goal and Alberto Moreno should have done better with a wild left-footed shot shortly before half-time. Early in the second half Emre Can had a low 10-yard effort deflected wide after one of Liverpool’s best moves of the game.\n\nKlopp’s team were beginning to take control at the start of the second half and Leicester, for the first time, looked a little ragged, but Vardy’s bolt from the blue changed everything. Mahrez, who is looking more and more like his old self after a dip in form over the festive period, deserves more than a passing mention for the vision and technique he showed to pick out Vardy’s run with a lofted pass from deep in the Leicester half.\n\nArsenal draw a blank against Southampton to fall further off the pace Read more\n\nIt was the sort of ball that Vardy relishes yet this was no ordinary sprint into the channel. Sakho seemed to be pointing to Dejan Lovren to try and get across and put some pressure on Vardy as he stretched his legs but the England striker had his mind on only one thing and after letting the ball bounce thumped an audacious volley that flew into the near top corner.\n\nLiverpool never recovered from that blow and conceded a second 11 minutes later. The industrious Okazaki tried his luck with a shot that deflected into the path of Vardy and the 29-year-old finished clinically, lifting a left-footed shot beyond Mignolet and into the far corner.

Not here, at any rate. This was a suave demonstration of Spurs’ intention to sustain their challenge at the top of the Premier League. Even before Dele Alli shot them into the lead in the second minute the visitors looked a class above Norwich, two goals from Harry Kane garnishing a victory that enabled Mauricio Pochettino’s men to leapfrog Arsenal into third place in the table and left Norwich grasping for security at the other end.\n\nArsenal draw a blank against Southampton to fall further off the pace Read more\n\nA place in next season’s Champions League would be a fine achievement for Spurs but performances like this suggest an even greater feat is within their reach, as do the bare facts: they are five points behind the league leaders, Leicester City, have not lost away since the opening day of the season and the margin of their win here gave them the best goal difference in the league. Spurs’ fans can dream, especially as their manager can be counted on to ensure the players’ minds do not wander.\n\n“We are very calm,” said Pochettino. “We showed maturity and consistency here but this has been the key since the beginning of the season. We cannot get distracted by the table. It’s important to arrive in the last few games with the possibility of fighting but we have a long way ahead.”\n\nNorwich may not be the most fearsome opponents but this was set up to be a serious test for Spurs, being their first league match since the loss of Vertonghen to a knee ligament injury. For the first time in the campaign, then, Vertonghen could not partner Toby Alderweireld in central defence.\n\nKevin Wimmer was given his first league start instead and produced a display that suggested the break-up of the Belgian partnership need not be ruinous.\n\nNorwich’s defence, on the other hand, remains in tatters despite the fact that they, too, started with a new centre-back here, Timm Klose, bought last month from Wolfsburg, making his debut. It took Spurs 100 seconds to expose the problems that remain in the home defence. A shot by Alderweireld was cleared only as far as Christian Eriksen, whose curling effort from 20 yards was spilled by Declan Rudd. Alli reacted faster than Sébastien Bassong to stab the ball into the net from close range. “We worked all week on the back four and then we concede in a minute and a half,” said an annoyed Alex Neil.\n\nSpurs went on to lord it over their hosts. They looked stronger, slicker and more imaginative, and created several chances to prove that on the scoreboard. Alderweireld went close with a free header before Son Heung-min flicked a cross from Kane into the side-netting. Pochettino craved another goal to confirm his team’s dominance and it arrived on the half hour, albeit after a contested penalty decision. Alli went down in the box after beating Bassong to a rebound off Rudd from a shot by Kane, who rammed the penalty into the net.\n\nMichael Antonio helps seal West Ham win as Aston Villa pay for Ayew stupidity Read more\n\nFour minutes later Kane almost scored again but his ferocious shot from the left cannoned back out off a post. Alli should have made it 3-0 before the break after dashing into the box undetected by any Norwich defender, but the 19-year-old headed Danny Rose’s cross wide from eight yards. Norwich’s hope of staging a comeback looked faint, even more so when they were denied a penalty after Steven Naismith went down under a challenge from Wimmer.\n\nAlli was replaced by Nacer Chadli at half-time. “He felt unwell, but now he’s OK,” Pochettino explained later. “We will assess him on Wednesday but the signs are good.”\n\nThe signs are not so encouraging for Norwich, who, despite a second-half improvement, ended up convincing losers. Kane scored on the break in the last minute, moments after hitting the post from a similar move. That was the 17th goal that Norwich have conceded in their last four matches, proving that despite personnel changes the team has yet to plug big gaps at the back. Neil’s exasperation is clear. “If we as a squad don’t realise quickly that we need to get our fingers out, then its going to be tough” he said.\n\nThe Scot was also miffed at the response he got from the referee, Kevin Friend, after complaining about several decisions made during the game. “Kevin’s response was ‘Yeah, it’s my fault’,sarcastically,” said Neil, who did not claim that the decisions were the reason for Spurs’ victory. Nor did the manager blame the official for the yellow card shown two minutes from full-time to Alex Tettey, who will miss this weekend’s trip to Aston Villa, a match in which Norwich can ill-afford to drop points. “That was crazy,” said Neil of his midfielder’s foul."}, {"date": "02/02/2016", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 38852, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name":

"report": "Manuel Pellegrini’s extended farewell to Manchester City began on a winning note but he will surely enjoy easier evenings before making way for Pep Guardiola in the summer.\n\nArsenal draw a blank against Southampton to fall further off the pace Read more\n\nThanks to Sergio Agüero’s first-half winner City’s title challenge remains very much alive, but if Sunderland can keep playing with this sort of sheer bloody-minded determination, a team which merited at least a draw here will not deserve to be relegated.\n\nThe verve and vibrancy of a quite formidable second-half attacking performance from Sam Allardyce’s players stretched Pellegrini’s side to the limit. With the home debutant Wahbi Khazri frequently fazing the Chilean’s defence, Jan Kirchhoff increasingly imperious in central midfield and Joe Hart performing heroics in the visiting goal, it was small wonder the home manager pronounced himself “gutted”.\n\nPellegrini simply looked relieved. “It was very important to win here,” said a coach whose name was chorused by the visiting fans. “It was a very tough game and a very good result.” Inevitably he was asked about his impending departure. “I’m not thinking about that,” came the reply. “I’m just thinking about having a good season. We’re not thinking about the future; we’re living in the present.”\n\nConsidering Sunderland are still second bottom Allardyce has reason to fear for the future. “I feel gutted,” he said. “It’s the most disappointed I’ve been since coming here. A point was the least we deserved. We created more chances than Manchester City but Joe Hart showed why he’s the England goalkeeper. Manchester City had one chance and Agüero scored. But I don’t know anybody who has played as well as Jan Kirchhoff in central midfield for anybody this season.”\n\nHis revamped XI showcased a new look 4-1-4-1 formation featuring Kirchhoff, their new £750,000 central defensive signing from Bayern Munich – who had endured a shambolic debut at Tottenham last month – in the anchoring role behind midfield. It was a job he would become almost astonishingly good at.\n\nWith Lamine Koné, making an impressive bow at centre half following a £5m move from Lorient, quickly endearing himself to his new public by unleashing a teasing cross from the right which Martin Demichelis was forced to hack clear, Sunderland began reasonably brightly.\n\nEven so, local optimism took quite a dent when Yaya Touré and Jesús Navas combined to create Agüero’s 12th goal in his last 10 Premier League appearances. If Agüero appeared every inch the expert marksman as he toe-poked Navas’s deflected left-wing cross into the roof of the net from close range, Billy Jones looked a thoroughly wrong-footed right back. Attempting to make amends, Jones launched into a challenge as the striker shot, his studs raking Agüero down the back of a leg and, following prolonged treatment, leaving him with a badly torn, blood stained, sock.\n\nUndeterred, he might have scored a second had his curling shot not taken a deflection off Yann M’Vila. Significantly that opening was conjured by 19-year-old Kelechi Iheanacho who showed precisely why he had been preferred to Raheem Sterling by holding off John O’Shea quite brilliantly before supplying Agüero.\n\nDavid Silva was starting to control the tempo of the game but Sunderland had their moments and, as Kirchhoff was proving, were far from incapable of disrupting the visitors’ rhythm.\n\nBenik Afobe header seals Bournemouth victory at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nKoné should have equalised but made an absolute hash of an unmarked close range header following Jeremain Lens’s excellent free kick. Bar accidentally catching Demichelis in the mouth with a stray elbow Jermain Defoe had been fairly quiet, but all that changed when he turned his marker before dispatching a shot which was destined for the bottom corner until Hart dived low to divert the danger. Recovering rapidly, his positioning then prevented Jones from scoring on the rebound.\n\nAware that, for all City’s elegant menace, Vito Mannone had had precious little to do, Allardyce perhaps sensed it might not take all that much to change the narrative. He duly introduced Khazri, his £9m signing from Bordeaux, at half time, the Tunisian replacing the injured Lens.\n\nWith Pellegrini suspecting that, despite some dazzling footwork, Iheanacho might not be defensively streetwise enough to protect his side’s lead, he sent Fernando on in his stead to bolster central midfield. Sure enough Sunderland were suddenly rampant and Patrick van Aanholt was unfortunate to see an excellent left-wing cross fractionally evade Defoe.\n\nIf the geometry of City’s short passing exuded class, key performers were tiring fast as the game became slightly spiky. Defoe and Nicolás Otamendi squared up in the wake of an aerial challenge, before a wince-inducing heavyweight collision involving Touré and Koné. Sunderland though retained sufficient focus for Jones to prompt another fantastic save from Hart.\n\nThe keeper subsequently did extremely well to twice deny Khazri while Otamendi would clear Kirchhoff’s late header off the line, ensuring City continue to cling to Leicester’s coat-tails."}, {"date": "02/02/2016", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34914, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham

supporters with the idea that they are capable of pulling off one of the greatest escapes in Premier League history, only to ruin rare spells of encouragement by pressing the self-destruct button.\n\nSalomon Rondón’s last-gasp strike earns West Brom point against Swansea Read more\n\nEver so briefly, ever so tantalisingly, Rémi Garde’s side had West Ham United on the ropes, and Jordan Ayew will struggle to explain what was going through his head when he jabbed his arm into Aaron Cresswell’s face and forced his team-mates to play for the next 73 minutes a man down.\n\nIf only Villa had found a more productive way to channel that aggression, their position might not be so perilous. Instead they are bottom, 10 points behind Norwich in 17th place with 14 games to play, and afterwards Garde repeatedly turned down the chance to confirm that he will still be in charge at the end of the season following reports that he is considering his future after a month of inactivity in the transfer market.\n\nWhen the transfer window shut on Monday night, it appeared to be the cue for them to lift the white flag above Villa Park after the failure to make a single signing in January, creating the impression that the people who make the decisions at Villa have already given up, and only three minutes had passed before self-deprecating chants about relegation could be heard from the away end. Villa’s supporters later turned their ire on the club’s unpopular owner, Randy Lerner, and there was further dissent against the board after Cheikhou Kouyaté made it 2-0 in the 85th minute.\n\nWhile Slaven Bilic called Ayew’s red card the turning point, Garde refused to reveal what he said to the Ghanaian in the dressing room. “I am only speaking about the game at the moment,” Garde said. “It is not the time to answer this question.”\n\nHowever, this was less a game of two halves, more two wildly differing contests stuffed into a single 90 minutes. For the first 17 minutes, before Ayew was sent off, Villa outplayed West Ham and they should have had a penalty when Michail Antonio handled Gabriel Agbonlahor’s cross. But once Ayew made his sorry contribution, it was simply a question of waiting for West Ham to score and Bilic praised his side’s professionalism. Victory kept West Ham sixth, a point behind Manchester United.\n\n“Like the two previous games we have been denied a penalty, at West Brom and the home game against Leicester,” Garde said, before questioning whether Antonio’s opener in the 58th minute should have been disallowed for offside.\n\nAll of which only served to heighten the frustration that accompanied Ayew’s moment of inexplicable folly. One second Villa had a throw-in deep on the right, the next Jon Moss was walking over to brandish his red card after Ayew lost his cool during an innocuous tussle with Cresswell, reacting to a shove from the West Ham left-back by flooring him with a forearm smash to his face.\n\nIt was an act of pure selfishness from Ayew, a remarkably stupid way for Villa to relinquish their dominance. “Until the red card, they were there, confident,” Bilic said.\n\nRémi Garde hints he may consider Aston Villa position after transfer blow Read more\n\nHaving started slowly, it took West Ham a while to adjust. Yet it was defence against attack after the break, West Ham increasing the tempo, Villa barely daring to cross the halfway line, Agbonlahor foraging fruitlessly on his own up front.\n\nIneffective in the first half, Dimitri Payet’s influence grew and for all their resistance, it was only a matter of time before Villa cracked. Antonio, Mark Noble and Payet all went close before a curious piece of goalkeeping from Mark Bunn led to West Ham’s breakthrough.\n\nAlthough it was an excellent searching pass from Noble that caught out Aly Cissokho, who was out of position as the ball sailed over his head, Antonio still had a lot to do from a tight angle on the right of the Villa area.\n\nYet even though it was a cleverly improvised header from Antonio, Bunn seemed to think that it was going wide and hardly reacted at all, almost watching the ball spin into the far corner.\n\nBunn’s error was Villa’s season in a nutshell and just when they were pushing for a late equaliser, West Ham broke and Kouyaté finished calmly after fine work from Enner Valencia."}, {"date": "02/02/2016", "arena": "Selhurst Park",

it was another attacking signing from the January transfer window who made the difference to earn Bournemouth a precious victory.\n\nTottenham’s Dele Alli and Harry Kane make light work of Norwich Read more\n\nBournemouth spent £10m to take Benik Afobe, the former Arsenal trainee, from Wolverhampton Wanderers and although these are very early days, he has already provided a return on the investment.\n\nHe was largely quiet here and he was also guilty of missing a gilt-edged chance in the 25th minute, following which Palace went up to the other end to open the scoring through Scott Dann. But Afobe still found the way to manufacture a third goal in four matches for his new club and it proved to be the winner.\n\nMarc Pugh had scored a lovely equaliser, marked by trickery and a rasping low finish and the happiness was etched all over the features of Bournemouth’s manager, Eddie Howe, afterwards. This was his team’s fifth win in 10 Premier League games and the slivers of daylight to the bottom three places are getting wider.\n\nFor Palace, there was only bitter frustration and it was summed up by Alan Pardew’s reaction. It was frenetic and frequently bad-tempered and the Palace manager was furious that the Bournemouth right-back, Adam Smith, had only been booked, rather than sent off, for an 84th minute trip on Jordon Mutch, as the Palace substitute burst through. Bournemouth did appear to have a covering defender.\n\nPardew had been incensed that Stoke City’s Stephen Ireland had escaped censure from the referee, Mark Clattenburg, in Saturday’s FA Cup tie here for a heavy challenge on Yohan Cabaye, which has put the key Palace midfielder out for a few weeks with an ankle injury.\n\n“I spoke to Mike Riley [the referees’ chief] about Clattenburg because the guy on Saturday should get sent off,” Pardew said. “No one gets sent off against us, no one. You’ve got to really commit murder to get sent off against Crystal Palace. No one gets sent off here. We had a one-on-one tonight. I don’t know how far the covering player was. The one on Saturday was a definite sending-off, which Mike Riley agreed with me on.”\n\nPalace missed Cabaye’s composure and their injury problems are mounting up. Pardew lost James McArthur at half-time and, having made all three of his substitutions, he saw Jason Puncheon pull his hamstring, the player having to soldier on.\n\n“It was just one of those nights,” Pardew said, as he also bemoaned profligacy in front of goal from his players. At least one of them scored – for the first time in a league match for 567 minutes; the team’s only other reward during the past seven games in the competition had been an own goal by Tottenham Hotspur’s Jan Vertonghen. Palace have taken just two points from the last available 21.\n\nMichael Antonio helps seal West Ham win as Aston Villa pay for Ayew stupidity Read more\n\nPardew, however, would be misguided to think that the referee, Mike Jones, was the root cause of his team’s problems. There was plenty of directness and bluster from them but not enough cohesion. His players were often as edgy as the home crowd, and it was a waste of their energy to scapegoat Jones, however much they felt that he ignored the close attention Bournemouth paid to Wilfried Zaha.\n\nThe Palace winger showed off some of his wonderful tricks in tight spaces and he went down on several occasions – to the fury of the Palace support. But, having been booked for dissent in the first-half, there was a moment during the second-half when Zaha looked to have lost his head entirely.\n\nAdebayor, who joined Palace as a free agent and came on in the 58th minute for only his sixth professional appearance since November 2014, flickered and he almost fashioned a dramatic injury-time equaliser. His shot, however, after a left-wing cross had broken for him, flashed into the side netting. Moments earlier, another Palace, substitute, Marouane Chamakh, had a close-range effort well saved by Artur Boruc.\n\nDann’s goal came when he turned home Zaha’s driven cross, after a wonderful back-heeled set-up by Lee Chung-yong but Bournemouth, who did not deserve to be behind, hit back through Pugh. He tricked Dann one way and then the other before placing a low shot into the far corner. It was Afobe who was decisive. Matt Ritchie’s shot was beaten away by Wayne Hennessey but the Bournemouth man of the moment craned his neck to loop a header into the corner of the net."}, {"date": "02/02/2016", "arena": "Old

impending arrival across town can galvanise Manchester United then the rest of the season for Louis van Gaal and his men may be fruitful after all.\n\nAnthony Martial lights fire for Manchester United to burn past Stoke Read more\n\nThere is no certainty the Spaniard’s decision to join Manchester City had anything to do with this scintillating United display, of course. But it is fair to say that just when the embattled Van Gaal would want his players to return their finest display of the campaign they did.\n\nThat this was against a Stoke City side who first put the Dutchman’s job in grave doubt by handing United a 2-0 loss on Boxing Day in the reverse fixture was all the sweeter for him, and the manner in which United took the contest to the visitors and showed a ruthless edge is a welcome boost before Sunday’s trip to Chelsea.\n\nIt left Van Gaal understandably content. “The players have made a great performance, not only defensively but now also attackingly because we have created a lot of chances. We have made fantastic finishing of team goals, building up from the back. That is what I like to see,” he said.\n\nVan Gaal could even joke about Guardiola’s appointment. “You have to ask [City’s sporting director, Txiki] Begiristain, not me,” the 64-year-old said.\n\n“He [Guardiola] is my former captain so I am very pleased to see him and I can speak Spanish, so it’s convenient for him.”\n\nAs at Derby, Mata was selected at No10 by Van Gaal. After he impressed there and scored United enjoyed another dividend here as he helped create the opener.\n\nThe 27-year-old was heading infield but turned back to the left and switched play to Cameron Borthwick-Jackson. The left-back swung in a cross that cut out the visiting defence and Jesse Lingard headed past Jack Butland.\n\nThis was the first opening-half strike here in 12 games, going back to a Mata penalty on 30 September in a 2-1 victory over Wolfsburg in the Champions League. Of Mata’s chances of continuing in the hole, Van Gaal said: “He was participating in all three goals so when he is playing how he is playing now the chance is big, but every player has to prove it every week.\n\n“Even my captain [Wayne Rooney] has to do that because everybody has forgotten he was a substitute against Stoke City away.\n\n“It is for everybody always the same with me. You have to prove it every game, every training session and then you play. When Mata plays like this, I cannot say to him: ‘Go to the bench.’”\n\nLingard’s third United goal came on 14 minutes and moments later Anthony Martial should have doubled the advantage. By making a mug of Glen Johnson he allowed himself a clear sight of Butland but the No9’s aim was awry.\n\nMartial was to make the best amends by scoring United’s second, a peach of a team goal. The move started near the home goal and was pinged forward and beyond Butland in a matter of seconds. At speed the ball travelled from Michael Carrick to Lingard to Carrick to Rooney to Matteo Darmian to Mata to Rooney to Martial, and past the visiting goalkeeper. It was 2-0 and United were flying.\n\nJamie Vardy’s double keeps title dream alive for Leicester against Liverpool Read more\n\nSo far, Stoke had been allowed close-to-zero scope to inflict the damage they had done to United on 26 December. The second half began in the same manner. Rooney barged into Johnson, raced at Butland and finished convincingly only for Roger East to disallow his effort for a foul on the right-back the referee failed to give initially.\n\nThis had Rooney arguing with East but his frustration was to vanish within seconds.\n\nWhen United create as they did for the striker’s 244th goal for the club – and did for Martial’s earlier finish – it seems a mystery why they have struggled this season. Daley Blind had been the instigator of the Frenchman’s goal and he was again for United’s third.\n\nThe centre-back launched a pass to Mata, who turned the ball on to Martial. The 20-year-old rolled it on to Rooney and he had the easiest of tap-ins.\n\nIt confirmed this Van Gaal team can perform. Asked if such a display can be replicated on each and every match day, the manager said: “They are able to already for a long time, I think, because this season was only Arsenal and Crystal Palace better and the rest of the teams were no better.”\n\nMark Hughes summed up a disappointing evening: “The worst thing that can happen at Old Trafford is to concede early.”"}, {"date": "02/02/2016",

in stoppage time to earn West Bromwich Albion what could turn out to be a crucial point, keeping Swansea City among the seven teams beneath them in the challenge to stay in the Premier League. But it was not enough to prevent boos smattering around The Hawthorns at the final whistle.\n\nAnthony Martial lights fire for Manchester United to burn past Stoke Read more\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson’s fourth goal in five games midway through the second half looked to have earned Swansea a third successive victory as Francesco Guidolin, their new head coach, continues to make a good first impression in English football, before Rondón turned the ball over the line after Kyle Naughton appeared to handle Darren Fletcher’s shot.\n\nWest Brom could eke out sufficient draws to keep their heads above water but their fans are not sure whether their glass is half-full or half-empty. When Tony Pulis was asked whether a run of one win in seven games concerned him, the Albion head coach responded it was also only one defeat in nine.\n\nRetaining Premier League status for a sixth successive season will be a creditable achievement but Albion fans are restless for more aesthetic appeal. Their team created more chances than of late, with Darren Fletcher having three clear heading opportunities in front of goal. But with Saido Berahino again restricted to a substitute’s appearance in the wake of Newcastle United’s rejected £21m bid, Rondón’s scrappy late equaliser saved West Brom from louder disapproval. The natives also made clear their dissatisfaction at Stéphane Sessègnon being withdrawn when Berahino was brought on.\n\n“You’re always going to get some boos,” Pulis said. “The crowd have been brilliant here. They have people they like and people they don’t, you have to accept that. I’m too long in the tooth not to accept a couple of jeers when you make a substitution.”\n\nSigurdsson scored midway through the second half when West Brom, held at home by Peterborough United in Saturday’s FA Cup fourth round, were still readjusting their defensive personnel.\n\nThe home fans had been chanting Berahino’s name intermittently throughout and there was a loud cheer when he stripped ready for duty. Unfortunately for those wanting a more attacking change it was Sessègnon who was withdrawn, to loud boos.\n\nThis disenchantment intensified when Swansea took the lead within two minutes. The loss to a hamstring injury of Jonny Evans, a centre-back playing at left-back, had already disrupted Albion as Craig Dawson, a right-footed centre-back starting at right-back, switched to the other side of defence. So when Sigurdsson timed his run perfectly as the ball spun off Gareth McAuley’s tackle on Alberto Paloschi, the Icelandic playmaker had time to drill his shot into the far bottom corner.\n\nJamie Vardy’s double keeps title dream alive for Leicester against Liverpool Read more\n\nPaloschi, Swansea’s £8m signing, made his debut when coming on for Ki Sung-yeung, who suffered a minor concussion when clashing heads with Sessègnon, at the end of the first half. The Italian hit a post from Naughton’s cross just before Rondón converted at the death.\n\nPaloschi almost scored with his first touch, running on to Wayne Routledge’s clever ball, but Ben Foster, on his 200th league appearance, saved superbly.\n\nUnchanged from the victory at Everton 10 days ago and refreshed from their absence from the FA Cup, Swansea’s approach play was in the club’s finest traditions. The diminutive winger Routledge starting as a lone striker countered West Brom’s deployment of four centre-halves. Sigurdsson almost scored with a 35-yard volley that Foster had to back-pedal to push wide.\n\nFletcher played at the front of West Brom’s midfield triangle and almost scored in the opening minute from Craig Dawson’s cross, only for Lukasz Fabianski to tip over. Fletcher later headed across goal towards Rondón, rather than going for goal himself, while Dawson should have done better than head wide when Sessègnon’s free-kick allowed him to dive in unmarked.\n\nGuidolin appreciates his side are making progress as relegation fears appear to ease. “I’m disappointed now but I’m optimistic because I watched my team play very well,” Swansea’s new head coach said. “We have lost two points but West Brom are a strong team. It’s difficult to win in this stadium. But I’m positive because my team has played well for 93 minutes.”\n\nTalks are planned between Berahino and Jeremy Peace after the West Brom chairman rejected approaches from Newcastle and Stoke

start his new career at Swansea and the Italian head coach was as good as his word. He did not have Swansea playing in any weird formations, nor did he discover the centre-forward they have been looking for all season, though he was able to take advantage of some sloppy Everton defending. If Guidolin imagines points in England are easy to come by after this composed but hardly exceptional Swansea display, he will soon discover most opponents will not be as accommodating.\n\n“I always dreamed of working in England but I never thought I would get a win at the first attempt,” Swansea’s 60-year-old new recruit said. “We played very well for the first 60 minutes though we suffered at the end. I am pleased with what I have seen though, six points from two games is important for us and I like the way the team plays football on the floor.”\n\nRoberto Martínez was not quite as happy with what he saw but did not take the easy route of blaming injuries to Muhamed Besic and Kevin Mirallas or two clearly questionable refereeing decisions. “We were not lucky at all,” the Everton manager said. “I don’t just mean the two calls for handball, there was the chance for Seamus Coleman right at the end that could have changed the result. We were far too pedestrian in the first half and at the moment we are not enjoying playing at home. Our away performances have been much more impressive.”\n\nEverton began confidently enough. Besic struck a post after three minutes after breaking forward and trying his luck from just outside the area, then an audacious piece of close control by Ross Barkley on the right touchline confounded Ki Sung-yueng and earned a ripple of applause from the home fans. Besic only lasted five more minutes before pulling a hamstring and in his absence the Everton tempo dropped and Swansea began to come into the game.\n\nEverton 1-2 Swansea City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nEven so it was a surprise when they took an early lead through some unforgivably dozy home defending. Concentration possibly affected by the sheer number of leading clubs apparently queuing up for his services, John Stones slightly undersold Tim Howard with a backpass along the goalline and the goalkeeper was fractionally slow in coming out to meet the ball. None of which might have mattered had André Ayew not spotted the danger quicker than the Everton pair and inserted himself between them, so that when Howard finally swung his boot to clear he connected with the Swansea player instead. Everton could have no complaints about the penalty, calmly put away by Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\nNow struggling to get the ball forward and occasionally hearing groans from their own fans for passing it backwards, Everton needed a set piece to get back into the game. A nondescript Gerard Deulofeu corner just before the half-hour was transformed by an improvised, volleyed flick from Gareth Barry. The Everton captain could not have had much idea where the ball would end up but fortunately for him neither did any of the Swansea defenders. Jack Cork got the last touch as the ball crossed the goal at an angle and then crossed the line after hitting the foot of Lukasz Fabianski’s right-hand post.\n\nIf Goodison imagined Everton would now take charge of the game it was in for a disappointment. Ayew continued to be the most mobile and threatening player on the pitch, and he was rewarded with a goal before the interval. Everton were too busy appealing for a handball by Ashley Williams to prevent Neil Taylor breaking down the left, allowing their concentration to be disrupted by waiting for a decision that never came. It did appear Williams had a case to answer but the home side’s second schoolboy error of the match was not playing to the whistle. Ayew pointed to where he wanted the ball played, then hit a first-time shot on the turn when it arrived, with Stones completing a below-par first half by arriving just too late to block the effort but diverting it past Howard instead.\n\nKi set up a chance for Wayne Routledge at the start of the second half, only to see him put his shot too close to Howard, then Deulofeu whipped in a cross at the other end that fizzed across goal but was too quick for either Barkley or Steven Pienaar to reach. Sigurdsson shot straight at the goalkeeper when a pass to the supporting Ki might have been a better option, before the home crowd’s suspicions that decisions were not going their way were confirmed when a Coleman cross that clearly struck Taylor’s arm failed to result in a penalty. It would have been harsh, though could have been given.\n\nSwansea were beginning to defend deep and live a little dangerously as the match drew to a close. Deulofeu continued to deliver a series of menacing crosses without managing to pick out Romelu Lukaku. When Barkley did manage to hit that target with a cross from the left four minutes from time, Fabianski reacted well to reach a firm downward header. Lukaku flashed another header over the bar in stoppage time and Coleman somehow missed from a yard out with the last kick of the game and Swansea held on for a win they deserved.\n\nFor a club supposedly in crisis Swansea do not look in bad shape and are only four points behind Everton, which says a lot about how Martínez’s side have underachieved this season.\n\nMan of the match André Ayew

"Arsenal have made a series of statements this season, as Arsène Wenger plods the long distance towards the ultimate vindication, such as beating both of the Manchester clubs at the Emirates Stadium and even getting a point at Stoke City. Some things, however, never seem to change.\n\nArsenal v Chelsea: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nChelsea remain their nemesis, even without José Mourinho as their manager, winding them up and, well, beating them, and it was another character who they have come to loathe that was the match-winner here.\n\nDiego Costa was involved in a red-card flashpoint – as he was in Chelsea’s 2-0 win over Arsenal in September – but this time, there could be no recriminations. The striker was simply too fast for Per Mertesacker in the 18th minute and, when the Arsenal defender slid in and got none of the ball, there was an inevitability about his dismissal for a last-man foul.\n\nCosta promptly showed the clinical side to his game in front of goal, when he pounced to meet Branislav Ivanovic’s cross and steered a shot beyond Petr Cech. He is back in business after his toils during the Mourinho implosion, with a sixth goal in six matches under the interim manager, Guus Hiddink.\n\nIt set Chelsea on their way to a sixth win over Arsenal in nine meetings, excluding the Community Shield – the other three have been drawn – and Hiddink’s only criticism of his players could be that they failed to find the killer second goal. Cesc Fàbregas was outstanding, setting the tempo in midfield and impressing with his poise and vision while Willian was also dangerous.\n\nArsenal’s regrets centred upon the red card and Wenger blustered about the decision from the referee, Mark Clattenburg, as having been “quick and harsh”. Yet he was simply angry that his team had been forced to confront such streetwise opponents with 10 men for so long. It made for what he suggested were exceptional circumstances and deepened the sense of regret.\n\nWenger felt that Chelsea might have been there for the taking had his team retained 11 players but the visitors were comfortable even before Mertesacker’s dismissal, with Oscar and Willian working Cech. Arsenal could point to a miscued volley from Joel Campbell and a half-chance for Mathieu Flamini, which went begging, before Mertesacker stretched into the challenge that would shape the game.\n\nHe never looked like getting to the ball first, following Willian’s probing pass for Costa on the counterattack and, in what felt like the blink of an eye, the Chelsea striker had tumbled into a series of exaggerated rolls and everybody inside the stadium knew what was coming next.\n\nCosta took five minutes to salt the wound. Wenger had made the decision to sacrifice Olivier Giroud for Gabriel Paulista – the replacement defender that he needed – and, if the Emirates crowd did not like the substitution, Giroud was even less happy. The striker gestured with his outstretched arms and initially dragged his heels as he made his way off, until Flamini came across to chivvy him along. Mertesacker and Giroud would be spotted in their club suits behind the Arsenal bench during the second half.\n\nGabriel versus Costa rekindled memories of the clash at Stamford Bridge earlier in the season, in which the former had been sent off for a little dig at the latter; Costa’s reaction that day had sealed the deal.\n\nGabriel was not up to the pace of the game when Ivanovic drove over a cross and how Costa made him pay. Tip-toeing in front of him, Costa touched home at the near post before pointing out the name on the back of his shirt to the Arsenal supporters.\n\nChelsea might have been further in front by the interval only for Cech to save from Costa at the near post and Nacho Monreal to clear off the line from Ivanovic’s header. And yet they could, equally, have been level. Following Aaron Ramsey’s smart dink over the top, Flamini – all alone 10 yards out – flew at the chance like Hong Kong Phooey out of a filing cabinet. To loud groans, he lifted his flying kick over the crossbar.\n\nFàbregas has been referred to as a rat and a snake during what has been a trying season and his every touch was booed by the fans of his former club. But he responded in fine style and he might have had a penalty on 56 minutes when Laurent Koscielny checked him inside the area. Clattenburg was unmoved.\n\nCosta played the pantomime villain to the last. He had gone down in need of treatment for a slight knee injury, to the scorn of the home support, when his number went up and Loïc Rémy prepared to replace him. Costa had the treatment, got up and walked off at low speed. He would raise his hands to applaud the Arsenal crowd before strolling away down the tunnel.\n\nWenger played his trump card with the introduction of Alexis Sánchez on 57 minutes for his first football since 29 November and a hamstring tear, and the forward made a difference. But it was not enough of one. He had Arsenal’s one flicker of a chance in the second half following a scramble only to swing and miss his kick. The full-time whistle brought several Arsenal players to their knees. They know all about losing to Chelsea but this one cut them to the core.\n\nMan of the match Cesc Fàbregas (Chelsea)"}, {"date": "23/01/2016", "arena": "Carrow Road", "attendance": 27108, "home_team":

a shame for Liverpool’s manager to have missed the chaos that preceded Adam Lallana’s winner five minutes into added time. This was, as the German said, “spectacular, wild football” featuring marvellous attacking and slapdash defending.\n\nAnalysts will spend the next few days trying to make sense of it. Others will need time to get their breath back. No one can deny it was entertaining.\n\nNorwich City 4-5 Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe losing manager, Alex Neil, found words hard to come by after seeing his side relinquish the 3-1 lead they took early in the second half. “I don’t know what to say, it’s just really, really frustrating,” said the Scot. Klopp admitted: “A draw would have been deserved for both teams. But a few days ago we lost a game we should not have lost against Manchester United so here we took something back.”\n\nYet for much of the match it looked like Liverpool were intent on giving things away. Luckily for them, Norwich outdid them in that regard.\n\nThe visitors took the lead against the run of play in the 16th minute, through a superbly crafted goal at odds with their sluggishness up to that point. After a zesty move featuring Jordon Ibe, Alberto Moreno and James Milner, the latter nudged the ball through to Roberto Firmino, who shot across the advancing Declan Rudd and in off the far post. Liverpool were transformed, their play infused with new energy. Milner should have increased their lead moments later after being sent clear by Firmino, but the midfielder’s dawdling allowed Robbie Brady to poke the ball away.\n\nLiverpool were made to regret that miss all the more when their difficulty with defending set-pieces re-emerged. Klopp’s men floundered as they tried to clear, and when Brady nodded the ball back into the box, Dieumerci Mbokani collected it with his back to goal, held off Mamadou Sakho and then backheeled the ball through the Frenchman’s legs and into the net from seven yards. Klopp was outraged at his defenders for not exposing the striker as offside. “You have to be offside, it’s not possible, it’s unbelievable,” he said.\n\nLiverpool’s defence seemed on the verge of breaking down several times thereafter, as Norwich attacked with gusto. They took the lead in the 41st minute. A rapid advance down the right culminated with Wes Hoolahan collecting the ball on the edge of the area and slipping a cute pass through to Steven Naismith, who lashed a low shot into the far corner.\n\nIt was the perfect way for the striker to announce himself to his new home crowd following his £8m transfer from Everton. Naismith won a penalty early in the second half, although it would be more accurate to say that Moreno conceded it with a ludicrous foul. The Spanish full-back is prone to rashness but the two-footed lunge from behind on Naismith was senseless even by his standards. Hoolahan was a model of composure as he dinked the penalty down the middle as Mignolet dived left.\n\nThe Carrow Road faithful were still crowing about their two-goal lead when Liverpool cut it in half. Nathaniel Clyne hurtled down the right and delivered a cross that Firmino flicked on to Jordan Henderson, who had darted into the box undetected by any defender. He swept the ball into the net from 12 yards.\n\nLiverpool target Alex Teixeira tells Shakhtar Donetsk he wants January move Read more\n\nKlopp replaced Ibe with Adam Lallana before the hour and the change made a difference, playing a key role in the equaliser. The move was started and finished by Firmino, who followed up excellent recent performances with another here. After flipping the ball to Milner near halfway, the Brazilian spun and dashed towards the box. Thus he was on hand to receive the ensuing cross from the left by Lallana and clip the ball past Rudd.\n\nThere was still more than half an hour to play and more goals looked likely.Neil cursed the way the next one arrived, as Russell Martin inadvertently put Milner through on goal with a reckless back pass. Unlike in the first half, Milner took the chance, slotting past Rudd to trigger jubilation among the away players and fans.\n\nBut it was not time for them to celebrate just yet. Because two minutes into stoppage time Bassong plundered an equaliser with a ferocious low shot from 20 yards. “Well done Norwich, but I couldn’t believe it,” said Klopp.\n\nFortunately for the manager who had complained to the fourth official about five minutes being added for stoppages, Liverpool came out the right end of the final twist. Steven Caulker, introduced up front again by Klopp, made a nuisance of himself in the Norwich box and one of his shots was cleared only as far as Lallana, who battered a bouncing ball first‑time into the net.\n\nNow Liverpool could celebrate in style, and as their players and staff staged a mass pile-on on the sideline Klopp’s glasses were crushed. The manager was not bothered by that but admitted to concern about his team’s tendency to concede at set-pieces. “It’s not always possible to score five; after the game it feels funny but it’s really rubbish what we are doing and we have to solve this.”"}, {"date": "23/01/2016", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24867, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne

"report": "This will be remembered as the defining moment in Dele Alli’s fledgling career. The Tottenham midfielder has already demonstrated his potential and scored at Wembley, yet with the game up for grabs in a frenetic closing period he sent gasps around this old stadium with what will surely be the goal of the season.\n\nJamie Vardy scores to help Leicester beat Stoke and reclaim top spot Read more\n\nAnd all in front of Roy Hodgson. The England coach could not help but smile as Alli struck with six minutes remaining. The Crystal Palace supporters looked stunned as the Spurs teenager expertly controlled a cushioned Christian Eriksen header and touched the ball over Mile Jedinak before volleying in from 20 yards.\n\nJedinak had hit the bar only moments before, the second Palace effort to rebound off the woodwork in quick succession. But he watched in desperation as Alli demonstrated skill, balance and poise to win the match for Spurs and put five points between them and Manchester United in the Premier League table.\n\nSpurs had gone behind to Jan Verthongen’s first-half own goal but equalised through Harry Kane before Alli had everyone gasping in wonderment. There was still time for Nacer Chadli to score a third for Tottenham.\n\nOn any other weekend it would have been the goal of the day as he cut inside before firing a shot into the bottom corner from 25 yards. Gareth Bale tweeted his appreciation of Alli’s skill and the player said: “I didn’t think about it too much, I even shocked myself, I think you could tell by my celebration.”\n\n“It was wonderful, an amazing goal,” said Mauricio Pochettino of Alli’s strike. “He showed tremendous quality, it will be shown around the world on every TV. It was fantastic. I am very pleased because it was a difficult game. They [Palace] had a clear week to prepare the game, we played against Leicester in the FA Cup. I’m pleased because the performance and effort was fantastic from the squad.\n\n“I think Dele shows his quality in every game. He’s capable of that. He has fantastic potential, difficult to price like Harry Kane. They have big potential because they are very young. We need to keep working hard.”\n\nSpurs needed Hugo Lloris on numerous occasions here despite winning by two goals. The goalkeeper and the bar denied Palace with the game level in the second half, and Verthongen was substituted in the 75th minute with knee and ankle injuries sustained following a collision with Connor Wickham, who appeared to elbow the defender in the face.\n\nAlan Pardew, the Crystal Palace manager, did not see that incident but did see Alli collide with Yohan Cabaye near the touchline, something he described as a stamp. “I certainly do know that I was in front when Yohan Cabaye got stamped on by Dele, so you know …. These things happen, I’m not into retribution. It’s just honest challenges, I think, and we move to the next game,” said Pardew.\n\nWatford’s Odion Ighalo sets up repeat win over ailing Newcastle Read more\n\n“It’s something that he [Alli] needs to cut out of his game, I don’t know why he did it. It was something he shouldn’t have done. He is a great player though. I’m not going to moan about spilt milk today. We had so many chances but Lloris today, wow, he made two fabulous saves. If it wasn’t for him I think we come away with something.”\n\nAfter a slow start Jason Puncheon fed the ball right on the edge of the area instead of going left to Pape Souaré in the 30th minute. Following a poor clearance Wilfried Zaha pounced and fired the ball against Verthongen to secure his side’s first goal in the league since 19 December.\n\nIt should have been a platform on which to build but, after Spurs pressure at the start of the second half, Kane equalised. Danny Rose steered the ball inside from the left to the substitute Chadli, who lifted it in for the England forward to power a header past Hennessey after outjumping Damien Delaney.\n\nPalace almost regained the lead immediately but Zaha’s left-footed shot was tipped behind by Lloris, before Scott Dann’s looping header bounced back off the crossbar and Jedinak – having just come on – hit the bar again with a half-volley.\n\nCue the late magic from Alli before Chadli sealed the win in style.\n\nPardew was delighted by his goalkeeper’s recovery after two poor displays: “It was a great goal. I was pleased for Wayne Hennessey, I thought he was terrific today. He had no chance with the two finishes at the end, Spurs have that individual talent to produce a goal out of nothing.”"}, {"date": "23/01/2016", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance":

in March and take a bit of advice from Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nSergio Agüero rides to Manchester City’s rescue twice in West Ham draw Read more\n\nOn this evidence there will be no need for the Italian to get off his saddle, or call Ferguson for that matter, as Leicester, playing like thoroughbreds, returned to the top of the table. Perhaps more significantly, they have opened up a 10-point lead over fifth-placed Manchester United with 15 games remaining.\n\nWithout wishing to put any extra pressure on Ranieri and his players, it is starting to look as though it would take a Devon Loch-style collapse for Leicester to miss out on a place in the top four.\n\nWhile it is true that Leicester have some particularly tricky fixtures coming up, starting with an unpredictable Liverpool side at home on Tuesday week and followed by back-to-back trips to Manchester City and Arsenal, the run-in looks much more benign once those games have been negotiated.\n\nThis turned into a vintage Leicester performance, one of those days when everything went right for them on an afternoon that finished with their supporters singing: “We’re gonna win the league”.\n\nIt was only the second game that Leicester have won since beating Chelsea in the middle of December, the first time that Jamie Vardy has scored in eight matches and Riyad Mahrez also looked much like his old self. Three big boxes were ticked in that respect.\n\nDanny Drinkwater also deserves more than a passing mention. An unsung hero in this Leicester team, the former Manchester United midfielder opened the scoring with his first Premier League goal and also played the through ball that released Vardy for their second.\n\nBy that point Stoke were as good as raising the white flag and when Leonardo Ulloa slid in Leicester’s third, following a lovely piece of skill from Mahrez, their misery was complete.\n\nIt was certainly not much of a way for Mark Hughes to celebrate his 500th game in management and tempting, given how poorly the visitors performed, to think that Stoke’s players had one eye on Tuesday’s Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool. Hughes hopes that Ryan Shawcross, who limped out of this game in the first half with a back problem, could be fit to play at Anfield and also backed his players to bounce back.\n\nRanieri, in contrast, is able to switch off for a few days and has encouraged his players to put their feet up while he goes back to Italy. “It was very important to be top of the Premier League at the end of January because now comes a very tough February, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City to come,” the Leicester manager said.\n\n“It is unbelievable but it is good. We are ready to fight. Now the players will have three days off so they can clear their minds and then they will come back and we start to work hard again. This league for us is very exciting.”\n\nSouthampton’s Charlie Austin strikes late to add to Manchester United pain Read more\n\nSo much about Leicester’s display gave Ranieri pleasure, including Drinkwater’s goal. He has been encouraging the 25-year-old to shoot more often and that advice paid off three minutes before half time. Philipp Wollscheid only half cleared Marc Albrighton’s corner and Drinkwater, loitering on the edge of the area, drilled a 20-yard shot that took a deflection off Marc Wilson, Shawcross’s replacement, before beating Jack Butland.\n\nAlthough Joselu’s free header from a Glen Johnson cross finally forced Kasper Schmeichel into a save in the 61st minute, that was pretty much Stoke’s only attempt on goal. Shortly after that chance Leicester doubled their lead when Vardy, running on to Drinkwater’s lofted pass, skipped around Butland and tapped into an empty net from an acute angle.\n\nWith Mahrez becoming more and more influential, Leicester were starting to enjoy themselves and added a third three minutes from time. Ulloa flicked on Schmeichel’s punt upfield and Vardy, gambling on the Argentinian winning that header, chased the ball into the inside right channel before picking out Mahrez.\n\nAfter a lovely nutmeg of Wollscheid, Mahrez was able to tee up Ulloa and Leicester were rampant.\n\nHughes had long seen enough. “It wasn’t a great day for us. We didn’t produce anything of note, to be honest,” the Stoke manager said. “From our point of view we’re looking to bounce back quickly. We’ve got a huge game on Tuesday and I back my team to respond.”"}, {"date": "23/01/2016", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75408, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name":

fissures in Louis van Gaal’s side.\n\nUntil the header from the 77th-minute substitute and debutant, United appeared to be heading for the seventh goalless draw at their stadium and an eighth in total.\n\nAt this point cheers and boos rang around Old Trafford. The rousing stuff was for a quickened tempo, the negativity for the XI’s instinct still to look for a backward or sideways pass.\n\nLouis van Gaal: Manchester United fans were right to boo at Southampton loss Read more\n\nThis is the way under Van Gaal: the fans remain desperate to offer support but the pickings are leaner than lean. Too many of United’s previous 22 Premier League outings have been the same. They lack charisma in ideas, quality and end-product. At the close of United’s first defeat of the year there were jeers for Van Gaal as he walked off to the tunnel: again, no surprise.\n\nUnited’s aim had been to halt Southampton’s mini-renaissance of two wins on the bounce and continue their own by returning a fourth win of 2016 to make it five games unbeaten.\n\nYet this upturn from the dark days of December (zero wins, four losses, two draws) had not occurred due to any great improvement in form.\n\nRather Van Gaal’s outfit were winning how they were previously being defeated – narrowly and unconvincingly.\n\nThe Dutchman sent out a 3-5-2 that featured Anthony Martial partnering the in-form Wayne Rooney in attack and deployed Jesse Lingard and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson at wing-back, the latter the one change – for Ashley Young – from Sunday’s fortunate 1-0 victory at Liverpool.\n\nRooney has scored five goals in the last four games and it was the captain’s mishit shot that opened festivities. This was after the quarter-hour and the ensuing 10 minutes featured a skied Cédric Soares effort and little else.\n\nAlready, this appeared another classic Van Gaal United display. This has his team (and opposition) becoming becalmed, the quality nosediving.\n\nRyan Bertrand personified this when taking an age to deliver a free-kick and then banging it high into the Stretford End. Next up was Sadio Mané. He is considered a rising young star of the domestic scene and was the target of a failed United bid in the summer. Yet when the ball was pinged at him in the No10 position it pin-balled away. Later, Mané’s touch was again awol when Dusan Tadic scooped in a ball that removed the slumbering United defence but the Senegalese could not control.\n\nAs two minutes of added time was announced Lingard cut inside and let fly: the ball smacked off Ander Herrera to safety and United were heading for an 11th consecutive first half at home without scoring.\n\nThis caused boos as the teams trotted off, a reflection of the ongoing disquiet at Van Gaal and his product, and when the players re-emerged cheers accompanied the replacement of Marouane Fellaini with Juan Mata.\n\nDele Alli pearl earns Tottenham come-from-behind win at Crystal Palace Read more\n\nThe Spaniard is one of the many examples of the manager’s eccentric decision-making. A sweetly talented trequartista, Mata is usually asked to operate as an auxiliary wide-right player. Yet on he came and slotted into the playmaking berth as Herrera dropped back.\n\nThis energised United. Suddenly Mata, Herrera, Martial and Rooney were in the game, running at Southampton and punching holes in the visiting defence. The Van Gaal grumble about this kind of play is that it leaves the team open. So it was that Mané broke along the right and turned over a dangerous ball that needed Matteo Darmian’s intervention as Shane Long hovered.\n\nIn doing so the defender suffered a suspected injured rib and was left spitting blood before being taken to hospital for treatment. The Italian was replaced by Paddy McNair and from the ensuing corner Victor Wanyama’s header failed to trouble David de Gea.\n\nAt one stage McNair roved forward on a mazy run that lifted the crowd but normal service resumed when Lingard blasted a regulation cross out for a Saints kick.\n\nNow came Austin’s dream start to his Southampton career and the nightmare ending for United and their manager.\n\nThis could – and should – restart the questions about Van Gaal’s ability to lift United back into the rarefied air their rich tradition demands. The Dutchman continues to grasp for the X-factor that delivered success at his four previous clubs.\n\nHe may be running out of time to find it."}, {"date": "23/01/2016", "arena": "Stadium of Light",

his marksmanship skills, they remain trapped in the relegation zone.\n\nAll the pre-match talk had been of Defoe’s extraordinary scoring feats during a loan stint at Bournemouth back in 2000-01, when Eddie Howe was an admiring team-mate. Now the Dorset club’s manager, Howe, had clearly warned his defence about the threat posed by the former England striker and they contained him admirably as Sunderland registered their first draw in 16 games on Allardyce’s watch.\n\nWith Defoe further hampered by the persistent inadequacy of the final balls delivered by his team-mates, and Patrick van Aanholt’s equaliser having come very much against the run of play, Howe was left a little downcast.\n\nJordan Ayew denied penalty for Aston Villa in dull draw with West Brom Read more\n\n“Pretty disappointing, he said, aware safety is still far from assured. “We feel it’s two points lost – especially after our first-half performance. We were in total control. It was very important not to get beaten but we should have won. The second half was more open but we still had the best chances.”\n\nAllardyce seemed slightly happier in the wake of yet another shaky start from a team which habitually struggles to get out of the blocks and concedes more early goals than anyone else in the Premier League. “We began hesitantly again and we lost our nerve for a while but we recovered it, which is very important,” he acknowledged. “After 25 minutes I would have been delighted to scrape a draw but now I’m slightly disappointed. Unfortunately, our final ball to Jermain Defoe didn’t quite work.”\n\nEarlier his glum, gum chewing, technical area countenance had reflected Bournemouth’s increasing early dominance. Such visiting control was emphasised as Howe’s side took the lead courtesy of Harry Arter’s intelligent diagonal pass, Junior Stanislas’s whipped-in cross and Benik Afobe’s diving header.\n\nHaving manoeuvred himself across John O’Shea, Afobe concluded a smart move adroitly to claim his second goal in three games since his club record £10m transfer from Wolves earlier this month. Vito Mannone looked desperately disappointed not to keep the ball out of his net after touching but failing to hold it. Across on the home substitutes’ bench, Jordan Pickford, Allardyce’s talented young second-choice goalkeeper, may have sensed opportunity but there is a case for saying Mannone did well to get to the header and was close to making one of the saves of the season.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Benik Afobe’s header flies past Vito Mannone. Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters\n\nWith Stanislas subsequently missing a good chance the tone was set. Indeed things were so throughly one-sided it came as quite a shock when, as half time beckoned, Sunderland seized an unexpected lifeline. Almost out of nothing, Fabio Borini unleashed a clever, defender bisecting pass, into Van Aanholt’s rapidly accelerating path. Overlapping from left-back, Van Aanholt shot beyond Artur Boruc without breaking stride.\n\nSuitably encouraged, Defoe controlled Lee Cattermole’s long ball before curling an audacious, early second half shot, fractionally wide of an upright. Almost immediately Howe introduced Matt Ritchie, his influential, much admired but recently injured winger.\n\nRitchie could have probably done without his arrival coinciding with a significant improvement on Sunderland’s part. With Adam Johnson and Jeremain Lens having swapped positions to good effect and Duncan Watmore on for Borini they finally attacked with menance as the 41,000 plus crowd found its voice.\n\nBournemouth though spurned a stellar chance to decide things when Lewis Grabban, on for Afobe, shot wide from close range after Stanislas’s defence-splitting pass had left him clean through.\n\nShortly afterwards poor Stanislas was left crumpled, clutching his knee following a hefty, rash, yellow carded, challenge from Billy Jones and had to be carefully helped off. “It’s very sore and it doesn’t look good,” said Howe. “We think it might be medial ligament damage. It would be a huge blow if he’s out for any time; he’s been excellent.”"}, {"date": "23/01/2016", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20611, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Carlos Paredes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [58], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Valon Behrami", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Manuel Jurado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [46], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nordin Amrabat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Almen Abdi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [71], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Chancel Mbemba", "yellows": [51], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Henri Saivet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Rolando Aarons", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [59]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [59], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Thauvin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emmanuel Riviere", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Marveaux", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It had been 29 years since Watford last did the double over a top-flight team, but against Newcastle they have now done the treble. Much had changed in the two weeks since the teams met here in the FA Cup, including 10 members of the starting line-ups and even the pitch, freshly relaid for this game, but for the away side the outcome was precisely the same – a decent performance but a poor result.\n\nSunderland’s draw with Bournemouth fails to ease relegation worries Read more\n\n“We’re very disappointed because, similar to the Cup game, we came here and played very well,” said Steve McClaren. “You can’t fault the attitude of the players. I thought we did everything today but win the game.”\n\nIt was a predictably positive spin on a display that only ever offered gentle encouragement, against a Watford side that had lost their previous four league games and, in the words of Quique Sánchez Flores, “came from a bad place, in terms of feelings”. In mitigation McClaren had to cope with a string of defensive injuries, with every fit centre-back named in the starting line-up, but though they conceded twice their true problems lay in attack. Newcastle scored with their only genuinely threatening effort on target, a header from a corner by Jamaal Lascelles, a central defender given his first league start of the season essentially only because he was able to walk.\n\nWatford smuggled a significant change to their formation under the guise of a single, like-for-like alteration to the side that had performed so incoherently during the first half of their 1-0 defeat at Swansea last Monday. For the first time since the opening day of the season José Manuel Jurado occupied a central role, just behind the front two, with three vaguely defensive midfielders behind him. Though this had the advantage of allowing the Spaniard to shine in his favoured position it came at the cost of cover in wide areas, and as the home side struggled to come to terms with their tactical alterations the visitors prospered down the flanks, with Moussa Sissoko particularly threatening on the right.\n\nWatford eventually settled, with their new shape also giving Étienne Capoue unusual freedom to attack, an opportunity that he initially seemed determined to translate into unlikely penalty claims. The Frenchman should however have given his side the lead in the 17th minute, when Odion Ighalo set up Troy Deeney, whose weak shot was saved but spilled by Rob Elliot. The ball ran beyond the far post, where Capoue sidefooted back into the goalkeeper’s legs with any number of better options available.\n\nNewcastle ended the first half promisingly, with both Jonjo Shelvey and Daryl Janmaat crossing just beyond or behind Aleksandar Mitrovic in the closing minutes, but started the second half catastrophically. Less than 45 seconds after the restart Watford were ahead, Deeney lifting the ball over the visiting defence and Ighalo racing clear, rounding Elliot and scoring from an acute angle.\n\nJordan Ayew denied penalty for Aston Villa in dull draw with West Brom Read more\n\nThough Newcastle crafted an opportunity to equalise within three minutes, when Mitrovic was played in from a free-kick but sent his cross-shot rolling wide, the goal prefaced Watford’s finest period, as Deeney shot wide from the edge of the area and Valon Behrami, flinging himself to the ground in an effort to bring the referee’s attention to Fabricio Coloccini’s gentle nudge in the back, was booked for simulation. Then in the 58th minute Watford doubled their lead: Miguel Britos sent a half-cleared free-kick back into the area, Deeney headed down, Ighalo controlled on his thigh and Craig Cathcart volleyed in with his left foot.\n\nMcClaren immediately made a double substitution, and both of the new arrivals might have scored with headers within five minutes only for Yoan Gouffran and then Ayoze Pérez to head wide, the latter after a lovely Sissoko centre. They eventually succeeded in pulling a goal back, and though Watford also had further chances – Ighalo shot low and hard from the left of goal and Elliot saved; Capoue shot high and hard from a similar spot and missed entirely – they could have prospered further. Pérez outpaced Behrami but shot over, while Emmanuel Rivière, another substitute, and Lascelles, from another Shelvey cross, both headed wide in stoppage time.\n\n“It’s very difficult to win three

Aston Villa remain nine points from safety and after this dreary draw, the Championship looms even larger on the horizon. An improved performance was heartening but that is not enough to extract them from this perilous position. Clean sheets are well and good, too, but Rémi Garde’s team have reached a juncture where only victories are sufficient.\n\nSergio Agüero rides to Manchester City’s rescue twice in West Ham draw Read more\n\nVilla’s effort could not be questioned and they might have had a penalty but a dearth of quality in the final third was evident throughout. West Bromwich Albion, meanwhile, could still find themselves in a relegation fight. They were defensively resilient but failed to register an attempt on target. Four games without a win, Tony Pulis’s team are only seven points clear of the bottom three.\n\n“It was encouraging but frustrating,” Garde said. “If you look at how we played I am pleased and our collective spirit is much better than a few weeks ago. We had the ball in their half many times, passing the ball well, but in the last third we had too many difficulties scoring.”\n\nWhile the game did open up somewhat in the latter stages, Jordan Ayew had the only attempt of note in an insipid opening half, striking low at Ben Foster, who was making his first league appearance since last March.\n\nAyew, often Villa’s only beacon of hope during this season of despair, was also unlucky not to have a won a penalty in the 24th minute when Jonas Olsson slid in from behind. Instead a corner was given but there was certain contact. “Never a penalty,” the West Brom manager, Tony Pulis said, before bursting into laughter and walking off. His actions spoke loudest. Garde, on the other hand, would not be drawn. “Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t,” he said. “Sometimes you get a penalty, sometimes you don’t, but I respect the referee.”\n\nJamie Vardy scores to help Leicester beat Stoke and reclaim top spot Read more\n\nWhile Villa had almost two-thirds of possession, Albion were predictably tight. The hosts, though, showed even less attacking intent. Stéphane Sessègnon started lively and Salomón Rondón hurried Joleon Lescott and Jores Okore into some early nervy clearances, but it says much for the shortage of entertainment that that was as exciting as things got for them. Sessègnon shot over seven minutes into the second half and Rondón was closer to hitting the roof of the Birmingham Road End than the net when set up by Craig Dawson.\n\nThe Villa substitute Rudy Gestede threatened to make an impact, climbing above Gareth McAuley only to head Ashley Westwood’s cross wide soon after coming on, but just as it looked like they were building up some steam Gestede pulled his right hamstring. Sixteen minutes after being introduced he was replaced by Jordan Veretout, who was about to be swapped with Micah Richards. Yet Villa were so wonderfully close to turning the misfortune around when a minute later Richards headed over a Veretout corner.

Manchester City manager then he might as well enjoy them and, in particular, being paid to watch Sergio Agüero. For sure, he took delight in seeing the Argentina striker show his clinical brilliance here. Agüero scored either side of half-time, with his second goal rescuing a draw for his team that they hardly deserved.\n\nWest Ham United v Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe visitors were sluggish in attack and sloppy in defence and looked to be heading for another away defeat when Enner Valencia scored himself for a second time on 56 minutes. The home supporters were in raucous voice, sensing their side were heading for a victory based on another show of vibrancy and determination at this venue, but with time running out Agüero struck in typically expert fashion, coolly lifting the ball over Adrián to secure his 15th goal of the season as well as a point for City that moves them ahead of Arsenal into second place before the Gunners’ match against Chelsea on Sunday afternoon.\n\nCity deserve credit for their refusal to roll over and die, coming back as they did twice from going behind, with Agüero cancelling out Valencia’s opening goal after just 53 seconds via a ninth-minute penalty. But a team of their quality and ambitions should not be in those positions in the first place and there remains the feeling that while they are in the thick of the title race, City will once again fall short. Without doubt Arsenal and Leicester, who returned to the summit after their 3-0 victory over Stoke, are playing better than Pellegrini’s men.\n\nNot that the Chilean saw it that way after this match, claiming that with 15 matches to go (16 in Arsenal’s case) it is impossible to make any judgments about who will be crowned champions and that this match showed his team have what it takes to ultimately prevail. “It is important when you play away against a very good team like West Ham to try to win the three points, but if you cannot do that it is important not to lose, and that is what we have done” said the City manager. “We have added points and had options in the end to even win it.”\n\nPellegrini went on to insist his side are not overly reliant on Agüero yet there could no denying that without the 27-year-old City would have lost for a fourth time on the road. As has often been the case away from the Etihad Stadium, the visitors lacked zip in and out of possession, with Yaya Touré once again sleepwalking through proceedings, at no point more so then when Cheikhou Kouyaté drove past him with the ease of a man bypassing a piece of litter on the street before delivering the cross from which Valencia swept a close-range shot past Joe Hart to open the scoring.\n\nOthers in dark blue were also off the pace, most notably the wide players, Kevin De Bruyne and Jesús Navas, while at the back there was another reminder of just how clueless City can be without Vincent Kompany. For instance, there is no way the injured captain would have allowed Michail Antonio’s throw-in to sail past him and into the path of the lurking Valencia in the manner Nicolás Otamendi did in the build-up to West Ham’s second goal. “We were not concentrating” Pellegrini said, yet the more telling reaction came from Hart, who immediately after seeing the ball go past him berated Otamendi for being so lacklustre.\n\nThe goal was also West Ham’s reward for taking the game to their opponents. The hosts pressed with intensity, while their passing and movement showed purpose and intelligence. Valencia naturally caught the eye, as once again did Dimitri Payet, who caused City constant problems with his vision and skill and came close to giving West Ham a 2-1 lead at half-time with a curling free-kick on 33 minutes that forced Hart into a high, reflex save.\n\nValencia did nudge West Ham back in front shortly after the break but the individual contribution that stood out most came from Agüero. The Argentinian was constantly on the move, constantly looking to get behind the opposition defence, and having hit the post with a stunning one-touch volley on seven minutes he scored shortly after from a penalty he won himself, albeit Carl Jenkinson appeared to make only minimal contact with the forward as he surged into the area.\n\nAnd then with nine minutes remaining Agüero was on hand to pounce again after Aaron Cresswell inadvertently diverted Kelechi Iheanacho’s driving run into his path. The fact he barely celebrated said it all – this was simply another day at the office for one of Europe’s finest finishers.\n\nWest Ham’s sense of deflation was only compounded by the sight of Kouyaté’s stoppage-time header rattling the bar but they should take a huge amount of encouragement from this match. Slaven Bilic certainly did, describing himself as “proud” of his team’s performance.\n\nFor City, there remains more questions than answers.

Ashley Williams chose a good time to score his first Premier League goal at the Liberty Stadium, the captain’s first-half header being enough to lift Swansea out of the relegation zone and to give Francesco Guidolin, who was watching from the stands, something to build on.\n\nSwansea City v Watford: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nGuidolin, who has been named as the new head coach in the latest bizarre development at Swansea, was looking down from the directors’ box on a night when Alan Curtis took charge of his last game before preparing to take a step backwards.\n\nIt was not exactly comfortable viewing for Guidolin and at one stage near the end, after Neil Taylor’s careless header gave José Manuel Jurado a chance to equalise, the Italian could be seen running a hand over his face in despair.\n\nSwansea, however, held on and the raucous celebrations that greeted the final whistle provided evidence of how significant this victory was regarded for a club that had won only two of its previous 17 league matches and, in terms of results, has been playing relegation football since September.\n\nCurtis had initially been charged with the task of reviving the club and it is hard to escape the feeling that there is something very odd about the way that Swansea have handled things since, even if the Welshman sounded relaxed about the chain of events that has effectively seen him replaced only 11 days after he was told he had the job until the end of the season.\n\nSwansea confirm Francesco Guidolin as new head coach Read more\n\n“I’ve always been quite happy if the club thought it was necessary to bring somebody in,” Curtis said, reflecting on Guidolin’s appointment. “It sounds an obvious thing but I think if we had won more games, then possibly there might not have been a need. I think our performances have been good and we haven’t had the results those performances warranted. You’re bringing in an experienced coach and manager and maybe he can get points out of those good performances. Again, I haven’t really got a problem with that.”\n\nGabriele Ambrosetti has joined the coaching staff and the impression that Curtis gave is that the former Chelsea midfielder will be used as an interpreter as much as a coach. What is clear, however, is that Guidolin, who led Udinese to third place in Serie A and has a colourful CV with a vast amount of coaching experience over several decades, will pick the team and take the lead in the training. “You can’t have a joint managership. It’s got to be one or the other. I’m quite happy for Francesco to have that,” Curtis said.\n\nWith eight points from his seven games in charge since Garry Monk’s sacking last month, Curtis may privately reflect that he was a little unfortunate to be asked to hand over the reins so soon. At least he has the satisfaction of doing so on the back of a win and with Swansea above that dreaded drop zone.\n\nSwansea did enough to pick up three points here but it was not a hugely convincing performance and Watford, who slumped to a fourth straight league defeat, proved to be obliging opponents. Quique Sánchez Flores’s side were particularly flat in the first half, which the Watford manager attributed to a hangover from their disappointing display at Southampton last Wednesday, and, although there was an improvement after the restart, the visitors never did enough to expose Swansea’s weaknesses.\n\nWatford complete signing of Nordin Amrabat from Málaga Read more\n\nMiguel Britos headed Ben Watson’s deep free-kick on to the roof of the net and Jurado, who offered a sporadic threat drifting in from the left, had that late chance but otherwise Watford struggled to create much. “We are not happy with the first half,” said Flores, who will hope that the arrival of Nordin Amrabat from Málaga in a club-record £6.7m deal will give the team a lift. “But we have enough points to be positive.”\n\nWilliams’ goal was something of a collector’s item and provided a rare moment of excitement in a drab first half. Wayne Routledge, one of the smallest players on the pitch, won an important header on the edge of the area and Williams was able to hook the ball on to Ki Sung-yueng. Afforded the time and space to pick out his man, Ki delivered a measured centre from close to the byline that Williams headed emphatically beyond Heurelho Gomes. Swansea looked anxious in the second half although Bafétimbi Gomis did thump the upright late on.\n\n“It was a massive win, takes us out of the bottom three and psychologically that will give us a lift,” Curtis said. “I think over the course of the 90 minutes we deserved it.

chilled Michael Carrick, Phil Jones and the rest of Manchester United’s travelling support at Liverpool but a soul-sapping lack of adventure from the team they had paid to see. One swipe of Wayne Rooney’s right foot altered everything and for 25 minutes after the final whistle they revelled in the truism that only the result matters when the Premier League’s fallen heavyweights collide. The grim, occasionally gleeful, reality of life under Louis van Gaal was laid bare.\n\nFour times Van Gaal has faced Liverpool as United manager and four times he has emerged victorious. Each has had a profound effect on Liverpool’s Champions League aspirations, with wins number two and three damaging Brendan Rodgers’ job prospects in the process, and the latest may prove no exception, with Jürgen Klopp’s team eight points adrift of fourth place. The implications for Van Gaal’s future remain to be seen.\n\nManchester United’s injured trio watch win at Liverpool with visiting fans Read more\n\nKlopp appeared visibly deflated as he discussed another display of promise, missed chances and set-piece vulnerability afterwards. Van Gaal was emboldened as he talked up United’s title prospects on the back of a second league win since 21 November. The intoxicating effects of a United win at Anfield clearly remain, even if the reverberations no longer make an impact on the Premier League summit.\n\nThe United manager also described David de Gea’s influential performance as mere routine and he had a point – the Spanish goalkeeper twice saved impressively from Emre Can but was hardly besieged – yet the approach, and the quality on display, was modest in the extreme. Far from a collision between the best the Premier League has to offer, this underlined why two wealthy clubs began the day sixth and ninth in the table.\n\nRooney settled the contest as he reacted sharply to a header from Marouane Fellaini, his fellow ex-Evertonian, that rebounded off the crossbar. It was Rooney’s first league goal at Anfield in 11 years and a moment for the United captain, his manager and club to savour. They were on the back foot for much of the game, their timidity in the first half was as bad as their touch on the ball, but they were able to punish Liverpool’s weaknesses in defence and in front of goal.\n\n“We need to improve but today was enough to beat Liverpool away,” said Van Gaal. The armoury at the managers’ disposal – the converted Roberto Firmino leading a Liverpool starting XI with only six league goals to their collective credit this season – was also telling.\n\nLiverpool spent the opening 10 minutes encamped inside their own half as United controlled possession but initial impressions proved misleading.\n\nKlopp’s side almost punished United when Jordan Henderson and James Milner combined to dispossess Morgan Schneiderlin, and Adam Lallana was put clean through by Lucas Leiva’s long ball over the top. Lallana opted for a first-time header, saved almost on the 18-yard line by De Gea, and although the rebound broke kindly for Firmino, he was unable to reproduce the accuracy he had against Arsenal and shot tamely wide.\n\nMilner almost profited from a first-time ball down Liverpool’s right channel, too, driving Firmino’s pass wide from a tight angle, and Henderson shot over twice from distance while also missing the best chance of the opening half.\n\nIn contrast to United, the home side’s one-touch football improved considerably as the game wore on and a slick exchange between Lucas, Henderson, Lallana and Firmino released the captain inside the area. Henderson pulled his shot wide of De Gea’s far post. Van Gaal’s side were measured but rarely threatened until Rooney’s late breakthrough.\n\nNot even the chance to pressurise Simon Mignolet from a corner was taken, with Daley Blind swinging a series of awful deliveries away from the Liverpool goalkeeper. Ander Herrera’s sliced shot wide in the 30th minute represented United’s first attempt on goal.\n\nThe decision to play the left-winger Ashley Young at right-back was aborted shortly before the break when he exited injured following an innocuous challenge on Milner.\n\nMercifully, the second half was more open, enterprising and interesting, the latter the least that should be expected when these clubs meet.\n\nGreater adventure from Can twice came close to giving Liverpool the lead. Moments after the restart the German international took Lallana’s pass and burst beyond Chris Smalling inside the area but his low, goal-bound shot was deflected wide by De Gea. The United goalkeeper subsequently produced a superior save from Can’s 25-yard drive, clawing away Firmino’s return for good measure, and was relieved when Henderson side-footed tamely into his arms, despite having a free shot from the edge of the area. The missed chances, while not in the gilt-edged category, proved costly.\n\nAnthony Martial went close with a low shot across the face of Mignolet’s goal but United’s travelling contingent had been given no cause for optimism and jeered Van Gaal’s decision to withdraw Herrera for Memphis Depay, before finding themselves rejoicing in Rooney’s decisive 78th-minute strike.\n\nBlind, no doubt learning from earlier errors, played a short corner to Juan Mata and his inviting cross was headed against the bar by Fellaini, towering above the Liverpool centre-backs Mamadou Sakho and Kolo Touré. The ball bounced back to the unmarked United captain, who lashed an unstoppable shot into the roof of the net from close range.\n\nIt was Rooney’s 176th league goal for United, the most a player has scored for a single club in the Premier League era, and the seventh goal Liverpool have conceded from a corner this season – more than any other side. Most revealingly, it was the visitors’ first shot on target. Smash and grab seems a fair description.\n\nMan of the match David de Gea (Manchester United)"}, {"date": "17/01/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27683, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philipp Wollscheid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Odemwingie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marco van Ginkel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jakob Haugaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mikel Arteta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mohamed Elneny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Trips to Stoke have been the stuff of nightmares for Arsène Wenger in the past but this game will not live long in the memory, never mind keep the Arsenal manager awake. In the end it was neither the big step forward that Wenger had hoped for, nor the couple of paces back that would have left Arsenal open to the same old accusations about their lack of stomach for a fight and whether they have what it takes to sustain a title challenge.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain gives cause for optimism in reshuffled Arsenal midfield | Amy Lawrence Read more\n\nPerhaps in the context of what has happened to Arsenal in recent times at the Britannia Stadium a point should be cherished, especially on an afternoon when the temperature struggled to get above freezing, snow was shoved up against the advertising hoardings and the injured Mesut Özil remained in north London.\n\nGiven what unfolded on the pitch it was tempting to think that the German – who Wenger said was struggling with some swelling on his foot but will be back for next Sunday’s game against Chelsea – had the right idea by staying in the warm. Despite all the pre-match hype about the enmity surrounding this fixture, the game was a slow burner, struggled to fully ignite and ended up being a tale of two goalkeepers, with Jack Butland and Petr Cech the two outstanding players.\n\nCech once again demonstrated what a difference he has made to Arsenal this season, whether coming off his line to bravely punch the ball clear or make crucial saves, most notably the one in the 90th minute when he stuck out his boot to deny Joselu a late winner after Aaron Ramsey had cleared Jonathan Walters’ glancing header off the line.\n\nIn many ways it felt fitting that Ramsey should have near enough the last word. The Stoke supporters mercilessly booed the Welshman’s every touch, presumably for his reluctance to accept Ryan Shawcross’ apology for breaking his leg at the Britannia Stadium six years ago, and there was also some unsavoury and shameful chanting by a section of the home fans, who sang: “Aaron Ramsey, he walks with a limp”.\n\nWenger chose his words carefully when asked for his thoughts. “I don’t listen too much, I focus on the game,” Arsenal’s manager said. “I shut my ears and I think that’s the best way to deal with it. I don’t know what to do about it. I have no influence on it. When people get together sometimes they forget their individual responsibility and maybe when you go home and watch it on television you are less proud.”\n\nWhile disappointed that Arsenal “missed two points” and failed to record their first victory at the Britannia Stadium in six attempts, Wenger praised his players for the way they handled a fixture that been hostile in the past and so often ended up with them being turned over.\n\n“We wanted to win the game but looking at the history we have here it is a positive result,” said Wenger, whose team returned to the top of the table. “Overall it was an old-fashioned Stoke battle because they made the game very physical. The crowd was up for it, the players were up for it, they went for a very direct game, we had to show a physical response – fighting spirit and togetherness – which we did.”\n\nMark Hughes, not surprisingly and quite justifiably, took issue with a few of those comments. There was nothing particularly physical about the game, so much so that Craig Pawson, the referee, never had reason to show a yellow card. “I’m not sure what game Arsène’s been watching but there we go,” the Stoke manager said.\n\nArsenal’s best chances fell to Olivier Giroud but on both occasions Butland produced excellent saves and showed why he is regarded so highly. The first opportunity came to Giroud following a deft pass from Joel Campbell but Butland was quickly off his line and parried the Arsenal striker’s attempt to curl a left-footed shot across him and into the far corner.\n\nAfter tipping over Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s effort later in the first half, Butland made a wonderful save low to his left two minutes after the interval. Giroud had managed to lose his marker and met Ramsey’s corner with a powerful downward header that the young England international did ever so well to keep out.\n\n“It’s early days for Jack. It’s only his first season as a Premier League No1 and he’s started remarkably well,” Hughes said. “He’s had 20-odd games and once again he’s proved what a great goalkeeper he is. All the elite teams have a top-class keeper and we’ve got one as well. He’s not at the standard of Petr Cech yet because he’s not been doing it over a longer period like Petr Cech has, but undoubtedly he’s got the potential to be one of the top keepers.”\n\nCech was certainly busy in the second half, with the Arsenal keeper making a fine double save to deny first Joselu and then Bojan Krkic. Joselu, who must have been fed up with the sight of the Arsenal keeper by the end, saw another low shot turned behind by Cech before that frantic goalmouth skirmish in the closing moments when Wenger’s team were living dangerously.\n\nMan of the match Petr Cech (Arsenal)"}, {"date": "16/01/2016", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35854, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur",

performance by the opposition goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, they demonstrated how to win comfortably when not at their best.\n\nChristian Eriksen scored twice but both goals carried a dollop of good fortune, while Mousa Dembélé and Harry Kane punished Sunderland further after Patrick van Aanholt had put Allardyce’s team in front. Mauricio Pochettino’s side responded well from the midweek defeat to Leicester and they undoubtedly controlled the flow of this game throughout.\n\nFor Sunderland, who remain in the bottom three, this was a tale of two league debuts. Pickford’s, even though he conceded four, was excellent but that cannot be said for the substitute Jan Kirchhoff. The German defender lost his confidence when Eriksen’s 25-yard shot deflected off his leg and looped in over Pickford, before conceding a needless late penalty.\n\nSunderland were left ruing the fact that Lee Cattermole could only bundle the ball into his own net shortly after Van Aanholt’s opener, allowing Eriksen to equalise immediately following a frantic few minutes. If they had held on until half-time with a lead, the afternoon may have been different.\n\n“It was a very important victory, a good reaction,” said Pochettino. “I’m very happy because it was important to take the three points after Leicester. It’s early to start speaking about the title, we need to learn a lot and improve a lot.\n\n“But we have to keep working hard. That [title talk] starts when you have 10, nine, eight games until you finish the league. That’s the realistic moment when you can start talking about it.”\n\nThings did not come to life until Van Aanholt’s opening goal. Until then, Spurs had dominated but created little, having 70% possession in the first half yet frustrated for the most part. Pochettino had made three changes to the side that lost to Leicester, Dembélé returning in central midfield with both full-backs changing.\n\nVan Aanholt’s strike was a goal out of nothing but a fine one nonetheless. No pressure was put on Adam Johnson and the Sunderland player slid a precise pass through the Spurs defence, catching Dele Alli off-guard in the right full-back position, and Van Aanholt ran on to it before finishing past Hugo Lloris at his near post.\n\nSunderland celebrated, but the supporters were not dancing for long as less than two minutes later Spurs hit back through Eriksen, whose goal capped a manic period after much mundanity.\n\nA slick exchange of passes meant Kane was through on goal but his shot was saved well by the onrushing Pickford. However, with the goalkeeper off his line, Eriksen followed up with a shot into the ground that Cattermole appeared likely to cut out. Unfortunately for the Sunderland captain, calmness deserted him and he could only clumsily deflect the ball into the net.\n\nAllardyce, who went to a five-man defence in the second half, said: “When we went behind we opened up far too much. We allowed the opponent to get in the game and play where they wanted to: around and through us instead of being the tight and compact unit we were up until the second goal.”\n\nOn Pickford, he added: “He handled it well. He might not play too many more games this season because Vito Mannone has done a fantastic job. The rest of the team up to 65 minutes were doing the job right, but in the last 20 they failed miserably.”\n\nThe lead was overturned 14 minutes into the second half. Pickford saved well from Kane and, from the resulting corner, the Sunderland goalkeeper palmed away a curling shot from Danny Rose. However, the ball fell to Dembélé on the edge of the penalty area and the Belgian cut inside on to his left foot and drove into the bottom left corner.\n\nThings were all over soon later. After another period of sustained possession Eriksen retrieved the ball in midfield and assessed his options. Not much was doing so, 25 yards out, he let one go and it took a crucial deflection off Kirchhoff, looping over Pickford, glancing off his left-hand post and in.\n\nIn the 79th minute Kirchhoff went in late on Rose and conceded a clear penalty allowing Kane to complete the comeback."}, {"date": "16/01/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11065, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth",

Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe.\n\nThe Cherries secured the biggest victory of their short Premier League tenure and Afobe, who joined Bournemouth for a reported £11m from Wolves this month, was among the scorers after he opened his account with 15 minutes remaining. But Howe claimed the 22-year-old was lucky to still be on the pitch after he was scythed down by Rudd in the first half but was only booked by the referee, Robert Madley .\n\n“For me, it was a definite red card on their goalkeeper,” said Howe. “While you could argue that he may not have denied a clear goalscoring opportunity, the challenge was high and it caught Benik in a dangerous place.\n\n“He is very lucky not to have picked up a serious injury and I don’t see why the goalkeeper should be exempt from red cards for those challenges. It is even more dangerous because of the speed he came out and the speed Benik was attacking him. I think Benik is lucky.”\n\nBournemouth, winless in four league matches heading into the game, took the lead after 10 minutes when Dan Gosling headed home Marc Pugh’s cross.\n\nThe Cherries, who have now scored seven of their 26 Premier League goals inside the opening 15 minutes – more than any other team in the top flight – doubled their advantage shortly after the interval with Charlie Daniels scoring from the penalty spot.\n\nAfobe, who made his debut in the 3-1 defeat against West Ham here on Tuesday, completed a fine afternoon for the home side when he turned home Daniels’s cross.\n\n“When you join a new club it goes without saying that you want to set a good impression and he has done that,” Howe said. “As a striker you want to score – you want to get that monkey off your back – and thankfully he has.\n\n“It is not just doing it, but in the manner that he did it. It was a great finish, a great ball in from Charlie Daniels, who did superbly down the left, and that is a good sign for us. We do create chances and one of our Achilles heels this season has not been taking them.”\n\nThe victory takes Bournemouth one point and one place above Norwich into 15th in the table.\n\n“It was not a good afternoon for us,” said Alex Neil, the Norwich manager. “We did not perform well enough and Bournemouth deserved their win. We certainly did not do ourselves anywhere near justice in comparison to what we have been doing in recent weeks.”\n\nNeil, whose side defeated Bournemouth 3-1 back in September, added: “We had too may players under par. Their players performed better than us on the day, and this is the same team that we beat comfortably at the start of the season. It was roles-reversed today.\n\n“It’s disappointing and I’m quite surprised because that team has been relatively consistent over the last five or six games in terms of selection.

Everton argued vehemently and justifiably they had only been denied a first win here in 22 years by an oversight from an assistant referee almost eight minutes into stoppage time, and Chelsea could point to the character and courage demonstrated by two unlikely if successful pursuits of parity. Their spirit is at least restored.\n\nBut, as entertaining as this all was, it was a chaotic mess of defensive errors and the latest draw in respective crawls from the division’s bottom half. Guus Hiddink has not lost a game in his second spell in interim charge, but more revealing is the reality he has won only once in the league to date. Everton would normally be celebrating the rewards squeezed from trips to Manchester City and Chelsea within a few days, but they have won only once in nine top-flight games. This was, in effect, a glorious frenzy played out in the obscurity of mid-table. These clubs are used to being more relevant.\n\nHiddink could barely disguise his frustration at the four points shed in successive home games, though it was Everton’s protests that screamed out loudest of all at the end. This match was just shy of its 98th minute, the official’s board having suggested a minimum of only seven, when the ball was launched one last time into the penalty area to be headed up and on first by Branislav Ivanovic and then by Oscar. John Terry, whose own goal had opened the scoring, was the wrong side of the visitors’ back-line when he conjured the backheel that flew beyond Tim Howard.\n\nRoberto Martínez’s exasperation briefly centred upon the length of time that had been added on, Chelsea’s bench having appealed to the fourth official Craig Pawson for an extra minute to reflect Everton’s celebrations at edging 3-2 up after the board had been hoisted, but it quickly focused on the real error. “Anger, pure anger,” he offered as his overriding emotion before branding the mistake, by the assistant Peter Kirkup, “unacceptable” and the standard of refereeing “diabolical”.\n\nHis side had arguably benefited from the non-award of a penalty in the final minute at the Etihad in midweek, something the manager acknowledged in passing, but this still felt cruel. Not that it was unexpected: Bournemouth had claimed a similar 3-3 draw at Everton’s expense back in November in the 98th minute, while Stoke’s 4-3 success at Goodison Park a month later came in stoppage time. This is a recurring theme.\n\nPerhaps, for once, it was better to bask in the frenzy into which this contest descended after a sterile opening period. Roman Abramovich, huddled in the corner of his private box up in the West stand, had been left idly fiddling with his mobile phone during that mind-numbing opening, yet the game erupted after the break. It was the visitors who forced the issue, exposing all those familiar frailties in a Chelsea backline who have already shipped more goals this term than they conceded over the entirety of their title-winning campaign. They laboured to deal with Romelu Lukaku’s brawn, and the invention of Ross Barkley, Aaron Lennon and Kevin Mirallas in midfield, with team-mates forever galloping upfield in support.\n\nLeighton Baines supplied their first reward, benefiting from Lukaku’s rampaging run and Barkley’s slipped pass, with the left-back’s centre flicking from Terry’s right boot on to his left to dribble agonisingly beyond Thibaut Courtois. Barkley struck a post moments later though it should not have mattered.\n\nWhen Baines was again allowed to deliver unchecked from the left, Mirallas collected, his first touch bypassing a disorientated Mikel John Obi, to spin and belt a second beyond his compatriot. The Belgian winger was excellent here, even if his failure to beat Courtois when clean through as full-time approached ended up feeling pivotal.\n\nFor a while Chelsea looked forlorn, a fifth home defeat looming large to suggest Hiddink had merely been papering over the cracks. Yet all it took to revive them was Cesc Fàbregas’s hopeful punt over Phil Jagielka, collected by Diego Costa on the sprint as Howard charged out of his goal, with the striker thumping the ball into an empty net. He returned the compliment at his team’s next foray forward, exchanging passes with Fàbregas before the midfielder’s shot flicked off John Stones to wrongfoot Howard.\n\nChelsea’s pursuit of a winner would be blunted by Costa’s departure for hospital with a shin injury that will have the management fretting over the days ahead. Yet their own defensive vulnerability remained. The game had already lurched into added time when Gerard Deulofeu’s corner was nodded back out to the flank by Willian. The delivery second time round arced sumptuously over Courtois and, as Chelsea dithered, Ramiro Funes Mori and Lukaku found themselves unmarked at the far post and eager to convert.\n\nIt was the defender who guided what he thought was the winner into the net, only for that combination of Terry and Kirkup to ruin Martínez’s afternoon.

They were not as terrible here as the result suggests, though City still felt comfortable enough to begin with Yaya Touré and Raheem Sterling on the bench and were not proved wrong.\n\nIt was a strange afternoon in some respects, but the result was never in doubt. After being held goalless by Everton in midweek, City are now back on level points with Arsenal, while a second defeat in five days put Palace’s top-six hopes into perspective, especially as Alan Pardew’s side have now gone five league games without scoring a goal.\n\n“That was not a bad performance from us, but the goals changed the complexion of the game,” the Palace manager said, sounding a little trite but actually making sense. As Manuel Pellegrini said, City scoring relatively early was the key. “As soon as we go in front we know we will get more space,” the City manager said. “And with space we are dangerous.”\n\nIt could so easily have been Palace in front in less than two minutes, for two contrasting examples of goalkeeping defined the opening half-hour. Joe Hart was in action almost as soon as the game got under way, as the City defence did one of its famous Red Sea partings to allow Damien Delaney a free header from the six-yard line from Connor Wickham’s cross. Delaney was still upfield following an early corner and could not have asked for a better opportunity. A striker might have made more of the chance but though the Palace captain kept his effort on target Hart reacted quickly to scoop the ball clear.\n\nChelsea’s John Terry grabs last-gasp equaliser to deny Everton in thriller Read more\n\nTwenty minutes on and Wayne Hennessey did not react quickly enough when Fabian Delph sent in a shot from 25 yards to put City in front. It was a well-struck drive, in all fairness, but it did not seem to take a deflection on the way through and having got down to his left to reach the ball the goalkeeper ought to have got a stronger hand to it.\n\nHennessey had the shot covered but could not keep it out. While the defence might have spotted the danger a little sooner and done more to close down Delph, being beaten at a comfortable height from so far out has to go down as a goalkeeping error.\n\nAt least Hennessey could not be blamed when City extended their lead five minutes before the interval. Already moving across goal to cover Sergio Agüero’s shot, the keeper was left wrongfooted when Scott Dann got a head to the ball to divert it into his top-right corner. Agüero will probably claim the goal given that his initial attempt looked as though it was on target, though Hennessey might have been able to save that. He had no chance once Dann intervened.\n\nAgüero had been the focus of most of City’s attacking play, sending a shot just too high on the stroke of the interval and at one point managing to appeal for a penalty and hook the ball just wide of the Palace goal at the same time.\n\nThe visitors could not keep up their early threat and spent most of the first half on the back foot. The only time Hart was remotely worried was when he rather dozily allowed James McArthur get in the way of an attempted clearance.\n\nCity lost Aleksandar Kolarov to a calf injury at the start of the second half and beefed up their attacking options with Touré a few minutes later.\n\nThere seemed no real need to – the game appeared as good as won – but Touré was involved when City scored their fourth, helping the ball out to Kevin De Bruyne on the right for a cross that left Agüero the simplest of tap-ins from six yards. Agüero and David Silva had begun the move on the left and half a dozen passes later there was too little of the defence left standing to prevent City’s leading scorer claiming his second of the afternoon.\n\nAgüero could have had his hat-trick six minutes from time but unselfishly set up Silva instead. Once again there was nothing left of the defence to beat once De Bruyne had won the ball on halfway to send Agüero on a 40-yard sprint. Joel Ward manfully tried to keep up but so did Silva and once Agüero squared the ball a fourth goal was a formality.\n\n“We weren’t bad but City were clinical.

If helping to create both Newcastle’s goals while also supplying the afternoon’s best passes delighted his new public, the former Swansea midfielder was lucky to escape a sending off as Steve McClaren finally got the better of Slaven Bilic.\n\nNewcastle’s former England manager and West Ham’s ex-Croatia coach are good friends and they embraced warmly at a final whistle which brought McClaren a first win in seven games and a precious three points in the struggle for Premier League survival. It left Bilic clearly disappointed by a setback which dented the visitors’ European ambitions and West Ham only really woke up following Nikica Jelavic’s introduction.\n\nChelsea 3-3 Everton, Newcastle 2-1 West Ham and more: clockwatch – as it happened Read more\n\n“We have to admit Newcastle were better and deserved to beat us,” he conceded. “Our first half was very poor.”\n\nMcClaren has long lacked a midfielder with a passing range as varied as Shelvey’s and the new boy quickened play up appreciably. “The speed of Jonjo’s pass give us an extra two seconds and means defences can’t recover,” said Newcastle’s manager.\n\nShelvey’s fabulous long pass picked out Daryl Janmaat wide on the right in the preamble to the second goal, and the right-back’s whipped cross was met on the volley by Georginio Wijnaldum. As it whizzed past Adrián, McClaren had reason to reflect on just how much more effective Wijnaldum had been since his repositioning in a new role behind Aleksandar Mitrovic.\n\nChristian Eriksen doubles up as Tottenham Hotspur rout Sunderland Read more\n\nAs the impressive Dutchman celebrated his ninth goal of the season Newcastle fans were enjoying the rare sensation of having a two-goal cushion. Taking full advantage of West Ham’s wobbly start, Ayoze Pérez had given his team an early lead, curling a clever shot from the edge of the area just inside a post in the wake of Shelvey’s smart pass and Wijnaldum’s equally adroit lay-off.\n\nIn between those goals Fabricio Coloccini’s splendid interception prevented Michail Antonio scoring following Aaron Cresswell’s cross but, generally, McClaren’s side displayed an almost unprecedented degree of control.\n\nThe Gallowgate End could well have been celebrating a third but Moussa Sissoko saw his shot blocked after a moment of hesitation. Shortly afterwards Shelvey experienced one of those red-mist moments which even his biggest fans accept he can be prone to.\n\nBlocking Enner Valencia’s advance with a hefty off-the-ball upper-arm barge was not a good idea and he was fortunate not to be shown a red card. The sight of Valencia going down clutching his face prompted a mini-melee and the referee Neil Swarbrick called on the captains to help restore order.\n\nWhen the dust settled Shelvey was not even booked. This opens the door to potential retrospective action from the Football Association but that would depend on Swarbrick – who was close at hand – not having seen the incident.\n\nMcClaren saw it as a fuss about nothing. “Handbags, shoulder to shoulder,” he said. “Let’s talk about the game not something which might make stupid little headlines.” Bilic proved diplomatic. “There were some strange decisions,” he said. “But I don’t want to comment on it.”\n\nHis primary concern had been salvaging at least a point and, sent on for the second half, Jelavic very nearly turned the tide. Indeed the substitute striker scored with his second touch.\n\nHaving intercepted Chancel Mbemba’s negligent backpass -– with Valencia’s close attendance perhaps scrambling the centre-half’s mind -– he rounded Rob Elliot before rolling the ball into the empty net and claiming his first Premier League goal for West Ham.\n\nIf Mitrovic’s erratic finishing had not betrayed some stellar hold-up play Newcastle would have won comfortably. Instead West Ham began highlighting Shelvey’s occasional tendency to concede possession in dangerous areas and Elliot denied Cheikou Kouyaté with a knee following Jelavic’s cross.\n\nMcClaren looked to be in agony during seven minutes of stoppage time. “A massive three points,” he acknowledged afterwards. “I’m going to enjoy a glass of red wine.”"}, {"date": "16/01/2016", "arena": " Mary's

side whose fearless zest made them so thrilling to watch last season are back for good – and it was a day for Ronald Koeman to cherish given that Charlie Austin was in the stands at St Mary’s after completing his move from Queens Park Rangers before kick-off.\n\nHaving blown hot and cold on too many occasions during a difficult winter, Southampton simply blew a tired West Bromwich Albion away here, rising into the top half of the Premier League table thanks to a resounding 3-0 victory.\n\nAustin will be a bargain at £4m if he stays fit, and the striker must have appreciated watching his new team-mates play their stylish football.\n\nAlready buoyed by Wednesday’s restorative victory over Watford, Southampton’s mood was further lifted by the news of Austin’s arrival, and they rarely looked like a side that had recently gone on a run of one win in 10 matches. They were determined to secure consecutive victories for the first time since the start of November, after what should have been a shot-in-the-arm thrashing of Arsenal on Boxing Day was followed by the grogginess of two straight league defeats, an early exit from the FA Cup, and misgivings over the attitude of certain players.\n\nCharlie Austin joins Southampton from QPR in £4m transfer Read more\n\nSouthampton began with the urgency of a team that still had a point to prove and the piercing quality of the first of James Ward-Prowse’s two goals, in the fifth minute, was an emphatic sign of their returning belief.\n\nWest Brom could not have anticipated the damage would be so severe when Craig Dawson fouled Sadio Mané on the left. The wide position of the free-kick made shooting a low-percentage option; the big men trotted up from the back in anticipation of a cross and Boaz Myhill stepped to his left, diligently covering the far post, but leaving a large gap at his near post. Ward-Prowse used his corkscrew of a right foot to whip the ball high to Myhill’s right and the West Brom goalkeeper had far too much ground to make up.\n\n“We had total control in the game,” Koeman said. “The second one killed the game a little bit. We had a very good team performance. They didn’t create a lot of chances.”\n\nSouthampton puffed out their chests. They passed the ball crisply, pressed high and pinned West Brom back. The visitors were enterprising in their previous match, a commendable 2-2 draw at Chelsea; here, though, they were decidedly second best.\n\nKoeman’s 5-3-1-1 system gave his wing-backs freedom to attack and Southampton earned the cushion of a two-goal lead when Shane Long slipped a clever pass inside Dawson, who blundered again, tripping Matt Targett.\n\nWard-Prowse sent Myhill the wrong way from the spot and Southampton were denied a third when James McClean blocked Targett’s shot on the line.\n\nCraig Gardner sent a header wide and had a strong claim for a penalty turned down, but West Brom were wretched, and Tony Pulis made two changes at half-time, Chris Brunt coming on for the injured Darren Fletcher, and Salomón Rondón joining the hitherto isolated Victor Anichebe up front after replacing Jonas Olsson.\n\nHowever, Fraser Forster remained untroubled in the Southampton goal and West Brom’s mediocrity was captured by their failure to muster a single shot on target.\n\n“We didn’t have any sparkle at all,” Pulis said. “It would be interesting to see how many teams have played their second game away from home this weekend and how many teams have won.”\n\nSouthampton were always comfortable and wrapped up the points when Dusan Tadic stepped off the bench and whipped a shot past Myhill in the 72nd minute, after fine work from Steven Davis, who reversed the ball into the Serbian’s path.\n\nA fortnight ago, Koeman seethed after Southampton lost 1-0 at Norwich City, benching Mané for turning up late to a team meeting and criticising Victor Wanyama for a foolish red card. But grudges have been forgotten. Mané was a menace behind Long, and Wanyama shielded his back-four unselfishly after returning from his suspension.

But Villa’s never-say-die attitude, which enabled them to fight back against a Leicester team that went to the top of the league with the draw, at least showed the players still believe.\n\nChelsea’s John Terry grabs last-gasp equaliser to deny Everton in thriller Read more\n\nLeicester’s once-preposterous title dream remains alive, too, but Riyad Mahrez could have brought it a touch closer to reality by converting a first-half penalty that would have put the visitors two goals in front, Shinji Okazaki having given them the lead in the 28th minute. Instead the Villa goalkeeper, Mark Bunn, made a smart save to foil Mahrez from the spot and spur the home side into a revival. When Rudy Gestede equalised 15 minutes from time, it was no more than Rémi Garde’s team deserved.\n\nVilla, showing a degree of slickness on top of their admirable mentality, then looked the more likely to snatch a winning goal. But they could not muster one and, owing to results elsewhere, ended the day nine points behind 17th-placed Newcastle, further from safety than they had been in the morning.\n\n“I can see great spirit in the last two games, we have the right attitude to save this club from relegation,” said a defiant Garde. “We have 16 games to go, it’s not too late. It’s going to be very difficult but we are still believing and you saw that here.”\n\nHaving overseen a victory against Crystal Palace in midweek, the first win of his reign, Garde named an unchanged side for this match and Villa made the brisker start. But Leicester were the first to threaten, Jamie Vardy heading wide from a Marc Albrighton free-kick in the 13th minute.\n\nThree minutes later the striker again got to the ball before any Villa player, this time chasing a flick-on before being upended by Bunn. The goalkeeper had charged out of his box expecting to beat the rapid striker to the ball, raising questions as to how closely he has been paying attention to Vardy’s feats this season. Fortunately for Bunn, the referee deemed a yellow card sufficient punishment. Bunn made the most of his reprieve by saving Albrighton’s ensuing free-kick.\n\nThen Leicester enjoyed a let-off. Robert Huth dabbed a back-pass into the path of Libor Kozak, who ran clear on goal but shot weakly from 10 yards. Kasper Schmeichel saved and Kozak attempted to feed the rebound to Jordan Ayew but Wes Morgan intervened with a sliding tackle.\n\nIt was generally a tight game but Villa’s problem, in addition to a lack of balance and poor finishing, is that they can unravel at any moment. They did so here in the 28th minute and were made to pay. Vardy was allowed to run on to a punt from Schmeichel and aimed a delicate lob over Bunn, who backtracked well to claw it off the line. But Okazaki reacted faster than any defender to convert the rebound.\n\nLeicester should have put Villa away four minutes later after Aly Cissokho blocked a shot by Mahrez with his arm. Mahrez tried to dupe the goalkeeper from the spot but Bunn improvised a fine save. “A second goal would have closed the game but the miss gave Villa new energy,” said Claudio Ranieri.\n\nTwo minutes after the penalty miss Ayew headed inches wide from an Ashley Westwood free-kick. Villa pieced together a nice move early in the second half but Schmeichel batted away a powerful shot from Ayew.\n\nSergio Agüero hits double in Manchester City rout of Crystal Palace Read more\n\nLeicester invited pressure, retreating deep to protect their lead while making space for the breaks at which they excel. That plan could have been undone on the hour, when Huth caught Kozak in the face with a swinging arm as he tried to cut out a cross into the box from Westwood. Villa demanded a penalty, the referee saw nothing awry.\n\nVilla kept coming. Ayew dribbled brilliantly to the byline in the 65th minute before pulling the ball back to Leandro Bacuna, who failed to shoot with enough power to beat Schmeichel. Moments later Leicester nearly scored on the break, but Bunn denied Vardy.\n\nGarde introduced Gestede alongside Kozak up front. Villa’s doggedness was soon rewarded when the powerful striker collected the ball at the edge of the area, barged past Huth and benefited from a slice of luck when his shot took a nick off Morgan and continued into the net. Villa deserved their equaliser, and went looking for a winner.

West Bromwich Albion had riled both the crowd and Diego Costa, while James McClean’s late goal ensured they stay three points clear of Hiddink’s side in the bottom half of the table.\n\nChelsea given smaller PSG ticket allocation due to Paris security fear Read more\n\nCosta flew into a challenge at the start of the second half and was furious at the final whistle, following a match where West Brom twice pulled level. The Spain forward appeared to hit out at the tunnel after the final whistle following an attempt to confront the opposition goalkeeper, Boaz Myhill, on the pitch.\n\nChelsea showed glimpses of their old self, producing a fair number of chances with Costa moving well up front, but defensive concerns remain and West Brom deserved a point. César Azpilicueta had given the home side the lead – scoring only his second league goal, both against Albion – but twice they were pulled back. Craig Gardner equalised in the first half before McClean cancelled out Gareth McAuley’s own goal with four minutes remaining.\n\n“At the end I think it’s a fair result although in the first half after 1-0 we had a few chances to go 2-0, which didn’t happen,” said Hiddink. “Then we conceded an unfortunate goal and let them penetrate too easily. It was a very entertaining game, high speed and intensity from both sides.”\n\nOn Costa’s frenetic night, he joked: “We can repair that [the tunnel] easily. He’s an emotional guy and I like that very much.”\n\nIt was the referee, Anthony Taylor, who was the subject of Chelsea supporters’ ire, with Albion taking their time at set pieces and throw-ins throughout the match. Jonas Olsson was one of three changes Tony Pulis made from Albion’s previous league match, the 2-1 win over Stoke City, Salomón Rondón starting up front with McClean in an attacking three behind him, while Pedro replaced the injured Eden Hazard for Chelsea.\n\nCosta did well to control and hold up a direct ball after 20 minutes, laying off to Willian who fed Branislav Ivanovic wide on the right. The full-back’s low cross evaded all the men in red and the masked Azpilicueta came flying in at the far post to muscle in and finish.\n\nThe lead lasted only 13 minutes, however. Gardner, who had been brought on for the injured James Morrison in the seventh minute, received the ball in a central attacking position after Pedro had dawdled in possession on the left, following good hustling from McClean. Gardner took one touch before shooting low into the bottom corner from 25 yards, puncturing the earlier optimism. The half ended with the crowd becoming increasingly frustrated, while Costa berated Taylor after he blew for half-time when Chelsea were poised to launch a counterattack.\n\nThe ill-feeling on the pitch grew as the game wore on, home supporters vexed by West Brom’s time-wasting. Things did not get easier for the referee either. In the 49th minute Costa, so annoyed before half-time, flew in late and at pace on Gardner, but the challenge resulted in only a yellow card.\n\nChelsea’s Baba Rahman: I’ve had enough of sitting in the stands Read more\n\nAs the noise increased and the rain began to fall, Chelsea broke swiftly down the left through the substitute Kenedy, who had been brought on by Hiddink to replace Pedro. As the 19-year-old carried the ball forward, Costa was tripped by Claudio Yacob in a central position. The Albion midfielder was already on a yellow but Taylor judged that it was an unintentional foul.\n\nJust as West Brom were beginning to look dangerous, Chelsea struck again. Cesc Fàbregas threaded a ball through to Willian, whose low cross was intended for the onrushing Kenedy. The Brazilian surged towards the near post and slid in to finish, but the last touch came off McAuley.\n\nHowever, Chelsea’s lead was once more cancelled out. In the 86th minute Gardner swept the ball infield and it fell to McClean 20 yards out. The midfielder zipped a low shot past Thibaut Courtois and into the bottom corner.\n\nPulis said: “We just felt there were certain things to do during the game that might cause them problems. We didn’t want to sit, we wanted to press. I think that’s the fourth time where we’ve come from behind to get something from the game. That’s good character and spirit.”"}, {"date": "13/01/2016", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53796, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [],

frustration for Manchester City summed up in the final seconds when Raheem Sterling was felled by John Stones inside the penalty area only for Roger East, the referee, to fail to point at the spot.\n\nThis had Manuel Pellegrini’s team and supporters in uproar but while an injustice, given the chances spurned, City should have already sealed victory.\n\nThey failed to score at home for the first time in nearly a year, the last occasion being a 2-0 FA Cup defeat to Middlesbrough on 24 January 2015. It meant their domination of Everton ended in the dropping of what may prove crucial points in this wide-open title race.\n\nManchester City 0-0 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nOf the Sterling penalty claim, Pellegrini said: “I don’t think I need to give my thoughts about that action. The whole stadium could see it was a penalty. It was so clear, so near for the referee and both legs of Raheem were taken and it was a clear foul from Stones. But if the referee doesn’t whistle for it, we can’t say anything about that.”\n\nRoberto Martínez offered a bullish take on the incident, seeming to suggest Sterling was hoping to deceive the referee into awarding the kick. “The way I saw it live and I haven’t seen the replay, I saw John Stones go to ground to block the trajectory of the ball, the direction of the ball. All of a sudden, Raheem Sterling is quite happy not to play the ball and he wants to invite some sort of a contact. Not long ago we were on the receiving end of a really poor decision right at the end in the last minute against Stoke.”\n\nThe Everton manager was referring to a Marko Arnautovic penalty in Everton’s 4-3 defeat at Goodison Park. “It was the wrong decision at that time. What you want as a manager is a referee that is 100% when he gives that sort of decision.”\n\nPellegrini had felt unable to start David Silva, who was a substitute, so he asked Sterling to operate at No10, Jesús Navas was on the right and the disappointing Kevin De Bruyne on the left.\n\nThe Sterling-De Bruyne partnership was lively. The England man won the opening corner which was taken by the Belgian, though it came to nothing. Later they combined as De Bruyne sprinted into the area from Sterling’s pass in what was a second warning to the visitors.\n\nEverton arrived with only three away victories but on the half-hour Leon Osman suggested they had no fear of the Etihad. Romelu Lukaku chipped a ball in from the right and Osman let go a sweet left-foot volley that went narrowly wide.\n\nAfter creating this chance Lukaku showed why he is the League’s joint top scorer, with 15 goals. Stones sliced City open with a pass along the right and the centre-forward sprinted into the area but as he shot Nicolás Otamendi did enough to put off the Belgian.\n\nThe best goals of the week: Paul Pogba, Sergio Agüero and Barry Bannan Read more\n\nAlthough neither manager made a substitution at the interval Pellegrini tinkered with his personnel, swapping the positions of De Bruyne and Sterling. If he hoped for a dividend from the latter’s pace down the left he came close to an instant yield. Taking the ball along the corridor Sterling’s speed allowed him to tear towards Tim Howard but the attempt was a disappointment, so off target it came closer to being a throw-in than to giving City the lead.\n\nYaya Touré’s form has enjoyed a recent upturn and a buccaneering run and shot that forced a corner again showed the force he can be for City. De Bruyne, who previously scuffed a delivery from the right, this time aimed better as it came at Sergio Agüero at speed and the No10’s header needed the excellent Howard to be sharp to repel it.\n\nThis was now City’s best passage of play. Sterling again might have taken himself into double figures for City this season but he could not convert. Next up, De Bruyne had a cross-cum-shot that came to nothing.\n\nAfter Martínez brought on Steven Pienaar and Arouna Koné for Osman and Gerard Deulofeu, Pellegrini made his own move. De Bruyne was replaced by Silva, the manager looking for the player he views as City’s X-factor to fashion a third league victory in four outings. But the player nicknamed “Merlin” could not affect the outcome. City probed but could not find the ruthless edge required. They will hope not to look back with regret at this come the end of the season.\n\nPellegrini had to concede this had been a missed opportunity to close the gap with the leaders. “Yes of course. Not because you play at home and you drop points, it’s because we had a lot of merit, especially during the second half, to win this game, in a clear way. But for different reasons we couldn’t score. But we have another 17 games and the important thing is to try to continue in the way we are.\n\n“I am happy about the performance, although I am disappointed with the result.

After a miserable recent run, they returned to winning ways courtesy of a barnstorming performance against an off-colour Watford. Shane Long and Dusan Tadic struck in either half but the scoreline was not a fair reflection of their complete dominance.\n\nIt could easily have been five and Fraser Forster, between the home posts for the first time in 10 months after recovering from a knee injury, enjoyed such an undemanding return it was not until the 85th minute that he had to make a routine save.\n\nHaving won only once in the previous 10 games, the Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, had conceded beforehand that he was peering down the table, concerned about being dragged into an unlikely relegation battle. There was an indubitable sense of relief at full-time but Koeman said he will still be looking over his shoulder. “We can look up but we also have to look under because it is close,” he said.\n\nSouthampton had been the better team in many of those recent games only for profligate finishing and defensive errors to prove costly. While they spurned several opportunities here, allowing tension to creep in before Tadic scored the second 17 minutes from time, their three centre-halves did not allow the Watford strikeforce of Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney a sniff.\n\n“We know sometimes we need to be more clinical but I’m very pleased by the whole team performance,” Koeman said. “It was a high level against a strong opponent. After a lot of defeats maybe the team were a little nervous but we showed our quality from the start.”\n\nAs in previous games Southampton started promisingly but there was a crucial difference: they took the lead with their first clear opportunity. And what a move it was. Matt Targett, making his first league appearance since October at left wing-back, provided an exquisite cross for Long. The Republic of Ireland striker still had plenty of work to do, though, rising in front of Miguel Britos to direct a clinical header into the bottom right corner.\n\nFour minutes later the advantage should have been doubled when Sadio Mané danced down the left, turned Sebastian Prödl inside out and back again before shooting goalwards from the ‘D’. Heurelho Gomes, however, got a firm hand to the shot and turned it round his left post for a corner. From the ensuing delivery the ball was recycled to Targett and his effort was deflected wide.\n\nQuique Sánchez Flores: Watford interested in Andros Townsend Read more\n\nWatford were uncharacteristically slack, leaving the head coach, Quique Sánchez Flores, to admit “we were not competitive”. They should have been punished in the 36th minute when José Manuel Jurado played an astoundingly poor pass across the back towards Prödl. Mané was too quick for the Austria defender, stealing possession only for a low shot to beat the advancing Gomes but not the woodwork.\n\nGomes also had to race off his line to take the ball from Mané’s feet from a tight angle and the away team were quite fortunate not to be dead and buried by the interval, only still in the game thanks to their keeper.\n\n“I am not angry, but disappointed,” said Flores. “We made it easy for Southampton. They were much better than us, and we played in a different way than usual. It was the first time our opponent has been much better than us.”\n\nMané’s duel with Gomes continued into the second half when they collided again while vying for a deflected Targett cross. Gomes came off worse, requiring several minutes’ attention to a head injury before being judged OK to continue. Mané got to the ball first but was denied by Prödl on the line.\n\nSouthampton’s dominance continued but they wasted several good chances to kill the game off. Oriol Romeu shot hard and low only for Gomes to save, a Virgil van Dijk pull-back from a Davis free-kick somehow evaded both a sliding Long and Mané, and the latter also shot wide after being teed up by Long.\n\nNerves were evidently seeping in around the ground but Mané was replaced after that miss and his replacement, Tadic, ensured the points with his first piece of action, composing himself just inside the area and giving Gomes no chance with a precise left-footed finish after Steven Davis’s headed pass."}, {"date": "13/01/2016", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27274,

particularly brainless Norwich dismissal they found three points easier to come by than might have been expected against relegation-threatened opponents.\n\nNorwich managed to come back once after Gary O’Neil’s daft first-half offence, felling Ibrahim Afellay just as the ball was running out of play, but the odds on a second recovery became impossible when Ryan Bennett headed a free-kick beyond his own goalkeeper 12 minutes from time.\n\n“We’ve fluffed our lines a couple of times recently so that could be a key result for us,” Mark Hughes said on seeing his side move up to seventh.\n\n“We are roughly where we want to be in the table, the rest of the season will be about digging in and seeing if we can get any higher.”\n\nStoke could have opened the scoring inside 10 minutes when Joselu and Marko Arnautovic combined to break clear from halfway. The former’s return pass was a perfectly weighted chip that virtually invited Arnautovic to shoot without breaking stride, though the effort lacked conviction and Declan Rudd was able to push the ball round his right-hand post.\n\nAfter Jonny Howson had recorded Norwich’s first effort with an ambitious drive that cleared Jack Butland’s bar Arnautovic was involved again, finding space on the left to send in a cross to the near post that Jon Walters met without managing to hit the target. Joselu came closest to breaking the deadlock before the interval when he stole in to reach a reverse pass from Arnautovic only to put his shot the wrong side of a post.\n\nNorwich looking to spend £8m fee for Lewis Grabban on new players Read more\n\nNorwich had two chances to go in front before unnecessarily handicapping themselves. Butland gifted them the first, finding only Wes Hoolahan with a poor clearance then watching in relief as the midfielder’s shot from distance passed safely clear of an unguarded goal. He atoned with a point-blank save from Bennett following a corner. While a striker might have made more of the chance Butland was equal to the defender’s attempt, and Stoke were left to rue their missed opportunities when O’Neil was sent off moments later.\n\nDespite a furious crowd reaction and Hughes leaping out of his dugout to express his own displeasure the Norwich player’s challenge on Afellay was probably not as bad as it looked. There was absolutely no need for O’Neil to steam in with a scissors-type tackle as Affellay shepherded the ball across the touchline, and though the challenge was more senseless than dangerous there were few grumbles at a straight red. “It was a bad decision, but from Gary,” Alex Neil said. “It was completely out of character, he apologised at the interval, but it cost us.”\n\nStoke failed to make their numerical superiority count before half-time but took the lead four minutes after the restart with a trademark Walters goal. Arnautovic was nearly dispossessed by Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe in the build-up on the left flank, though when the ball rebounded back to him he hit a sumptuous first-time cross met at the far post with practised ease by Walters, recalled to the side because Xherdan Shaqiri faces a fortnight out after straining a hamstring in training.\n\nThe visitors had not ventured out of their own half by that stage of the second half, though when they finally crossed the halfway line they made it count at the first attempt. Throwing caution to the wind and a few bodies up front, Hoolahan’s cross was neatly chested back by Odjidja-Ofoe for Howson to have a crack from the edge of the area, and the midfielder produced an unstoppable drive that Butland had no chance of keeping out.\n\nThat briefly set up a contest, with the Norwich fans chanting: “We’ve only got 10 men,” before Joselu restored the home side’s lead midway through the second half, finding Rudd’s bottom-right corner with a right-foot shot after taking a pass from Afellay on the edge of the area.\n\nThe influential Afellay also supplied the free-kick from which Bennett scored the final goal, as well as the corner that saw Peter Crouch bring a late save from Rudd to prevent Stoke making it four."}, {"date": "13/01/2016", "arena": "The

and that could take a while – the referee will cease to become the main talking point for Swansea City and the threat of relegation will start to bite. Graham Scott, who was asked to take charge of the game at short notice after Andre Marriner pulled out on Monday, looked totally out of his depth at this level, yet the erroneous decisions that impacted on both teams were of little concern to Sunderland come the end.\n\nInspired by the evergreen Jermain Defoe, who completed his hat-trick five minutes from time and took his tally to five in two games in the process, Sunderland picked up the most precious of victories to move within one point of Swansea and give their survival hopes a huge boost.\n\nIt was a crazy, helter-skelter game and one that was overshadowed by some calamitous refereeing from a man who was officiating only his fourth Premier League game. Defoe looked to be offside when he gave Sunderland a third-minute lead and it should not have been a penalty when Wes Brown was penalised for fouling André Ayew later in the first half.\n\nThen came arguably the defining moment in the match when Scott sent off Kyle Naughton in the 37th minute for a challenge on Yann M’Vila that was not worthy of a free-kick never mind a straight red card. The full-back’s studs were high but he clearly got the ball and only M’Vila knows why he was rolling around.\n\nAlthough that harsh decision initially galvanised Swansea, who went 2-1 ahead through a superb Ayew goal shortly before the interval, Sunderland’s numerical advantage eventually told. Patrick van Aanholt, who was excellent on the left flank, hauled Sunderland level with a deflected shot and from that point on it was all about Defoe.\n\nAlan Curtis, Swansea’s interim manager, was bitterly upset and felt Scott’s decision to send off Naughton was the turning point. “I’m disappointed. I think the big talking point is the referee’s decisions,” Curtis said. “I won’t say it has cost us as you don’t know how it will play out but it has had a major bearing on the game. Unfortunately the referee did look out of his depth.\n\n“We were fortuitous with the penalty decision for us. But when he makes a huge decision to send a player off we were forced to play the next hour with 10. You only have to look at the video and Kyle won the ball cleanly. It is something we will try to appeal in the morning.”\n\nAllardyce had some sympathy for Swansea and Naughton on that occasion – he looked across at Curtis and appeared bemused as well as amused when Scott showed a red card – but he also made the point Sunderland were on the wrong end of a bad call with the Ayew penalty incident.\n\n“Scott only stepped in because the referee who was supposed to referee the game was ill,” the Sunderland manager said. “In his defence before the game Scott pointed out: ‘I know how big this game is for both of you and I’ll try and manage it the best way I can.’ But things happen under pressure and when people are under pressure they make mistakes.”\n\nThe referee was not the only one who blundered. Lukasz Fabianski’s terrible goalkick led to Sunderland’s opener when he drilled the ball straight to Adam Johnson, who fed Fabio Borini on the left. Borini’s low shot was parried by Fabianski and Defoe, who had strayed into an offside position, tapped home.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson levelled from the spot after Scott deemed Brown had tripped Ayew when the Ghanaian had actually stubbed his foot into the ground. Three minutes after Naughton’s dismissal Swansea were in front when Ayew, sprinting on to Fabianski’s measured kick, beat Lee Cattermole and struck home a sumptuous left-foot angled drive that flashed into the far corner.\n\nWith an extra man, Allardyce urged his players to press higher up the pitch in the second half and Sunderland quickly got reward when Van Aanholt cut inside and thumped an 18-yard shot that took a wicked deflection off Federico Fernández’s back and went in off the far upright. Defoe, running on to Johnson’s fine pass, then beat Fabianski to grab his second – again the striker appeared offside – before later turning in Van Aanholt’s cut-back for his third.\n\n“Jermain’s a massive player for us and converted most of the chances we created,” Allardyce said. “And irrespective of some of the referee’s decisions we’ve gone and won away in an enormous game for both of us because we’ve gained three points on everybody that is above.”"}, {"date": "13/01/2016", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44109, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon

Arsenal had fought back from going behind on two separate occasions during that blitz of four goals in a pulsating 15-minute period of the first half. Roberto Firmino scored both of them for Liverpool and Wenger’s men had to show all their competitive courage before Olivier Giroud’s second goal gave them the lead for the first time.

Allen’s volley was taken with control, running on to a header from another substitute, Christian Benteke, and firing his shot into the bottom corner to spare Liverpool a home defeat.\n\nIt was a breathless, raucous night and, by the end, it felt like a trick of the mind that Liverpool had gone into this match having never scored fewer goals at the corresponding stage of a league season. Klopp’s men were quick to the ball, moving it with speed and confidence and, finally, Firmino has shown Anfield the qualities that persuaded the club to spend £29m on him last summer.\n\nFirmino had scored only once in his first 24 appearances since joining from Hoffenheim but this was the night when the Brazilian introduced himself properly. His second goal, in particular, was a beauty. Twenty-five yards out, Firmino went for a curler and delivered his shot with just the right amount of bend to put the ball into the top corner of Petr Cech’s net.\n\nLiverpool had taken the lead in the 10th minute when Theo Walcott committed the cardinal sin of trying to dribble the ball out of his own penalty area rather than attempting to clear his lines. Walcott was suddenly surrounded by players in red, lost the ball and Arsenal were immediately vulnerable. Emre Can had the first shot and, though Cech parried it away, Firmino seized on the rebound, turned the ball on to his left foot and scored with a low shot that went through Laurent Koscielny’s legs to wrong-foot Arsenal’s goalkeeper.\n\nKlopp’s team pinned their opponents back throughout the opening exchanges but their problem was in defence where they looked susceptible far too often. Joel Campbell was a difficult opponent for Alberto Moreno. Walcott seemed determined to make amends for his earlier mistake and Mesut Özil was prominently involved without being at his most exhilarating.\n\nManchester City frustrated by Everton and Sterling’s late penalty claim Read more\n\nMore than anyone, Giroud took the game to Liverpool. He needed his head to be stapled after taking a bang from Mamadou Sakho in the first half but it was typical of how he played that, in winning that aerial challenge, he had helped to set up Ramsey’s goal. Giroud made it 2-2 with an improvisational flick to deceive Simon Mignolet from a corner to the near post and his next goal, 10 minutes into the second half, was another mix of high skill and confidence.\n\nThe French striker had his back to goal when he latched on to Campbell’s pass but he spun expertly, despite the close proximity of a couple of defenders, and swept a swivelling left-foot shot into the far corner.\n\nThe disappointment for Liverpool at half-time was the way they had been pegged back so quickly after Firmino’s goals. Campbell’s beautifully weighted pass set up Ramsey four minutes after they had gone behind, and it was another quick response from Wenger’s team when Firmino curled in Liverpool’s second. Wenger cannot have been satisfied with the number of chances Liverpool created but this was a night that told us something about Arsenal’s spirit. Unfortunately for them, they were facing a team forbidden from accepting defeat lightly.\n\nThe rain and sleet was so heavy at the end that leaks started to appear in the roof of the old Main Stand and so much water began to cascade down that various suites had to be closed off afterwards. Liverpool roused themselves on a greasy surface and perhaps Arsenal were guilty of defending too deeply as the home team started to aim long balls into the penalty area and Klopp brought on his new loan signing, Steven Caulker, as an emergency striker. Allen applied the final flourish and Arsenal, so close to a crucial victory, will have to hope that moment does not have lasting ramifications come the end of the season."}, {"date": "13/01/2016",

their wild ride and it goes something like this – Claudio Ranieri’s underdogs will, at some point, fade away. They have to, simply because this sort of thing does not happen. It should not happen. It cannot happen.\n\nBut it is very much happening and matches like this prove Leicester are not only top-four material but they are in with a shout of the biggest prize. Their style is a case study in ruthless simplicity and it achieved the latest beautiful result of their fairytale season when Robert Huth, criminally unmarked inside the area on Christian Fuch’s late corner, directed a firm header back inside the near top corner of Hugo Lloris’s net.\n\nLeicester did what they have done all season: they stayed solid, they went toe-to-toe with supposedly better heeled opposition and, when the moments presented themselves, they struck with venom – quickly and directly.\n\nThey had flickered, most notably through Jamie Vardy, who was back with indecent haste after groin surgery, and the substitute Leonardo Ulloa but it was Huth, with his first goal of the season, who was the unlikely matchwinner. Leicester had drawn blanks in their previous three league games but Huth’s goal was glorious on so many levels, not least in its timing.\n\nTottenham Hotspur were fired up and for what this game meant to them, no one needed to look any further than the figure in the dark coat on the touchline. Mauricio Pochettino tends to exist on an even keel; the club’s manager rarely gets too high or too low. But here, he lived every breath of a frenetic struggle. Passionately.\n\nLiverpool and Arsenal draw thriller after Firmino and Giroud doubles Read more\n\nIt was difficult to remember him being so animated during a game and it seemed to reflect the awareness that here was a golden opportunity for Tottenham to make a statement about their top-four aspirations; to reel in one of their rivals.\n\nPochettino paced his technical area throughout; he bellowed his instructions and his criticisms, and he howled at the heavens when the big chances went begging or, more precisely, Kasper Schmeichel, the Leicester goalkeeper, made a series of inspired interventions.\n\nSchmeichel’s best moment came in the 62nd minute and, in some respects, it was the turning point of the game. Erik Lamela had slipped Harry Kane clean through with a cute pass and the striker’s shot reared up off Schmeichel but ricocheted to safety off the crossbar.\n\nIt was Huth and Leicester who made the statement and the wackiness of it all was summed up by the chants towards the end from the visiting supporters. “We are staying up,” they chorused before, in the next breath, they were rather more bold. “We’re gonna win the league,” they yelled.\n\nThis was Part II of a trilogy, following Sunday’s 2-2 draw here in the FA Cup – the replay is next Wednesday – and it was another absorbing affair, with Tottenham starting with the greater intensity. For 15 minutes or so, Leicester could not live with their pressing.\n\nThe home team’s lively start had featured a low Dele Alli blast that fizzed wide and a downward header from Toby Alderweireld, following a Lamela corner, that bounced up and looked bound for the top of the net. Schmeichel threw out a hand to tip it over. Christian Eriksen would also work the Leicester goalkeeper on the half hour from outside the area.\n\nLeicester enjoyed a purple patch midway through the first half, which was sparked when a mix-up between Kyle Walker and Lloris led to a chance for Shinji Okazaki, who dragged his shot wide. Okazaki almost got in again moments later, following a jet-heeled burst by N’Golo Kanté only for Alderweireld to stick out a boot while Danny Drinkwater drew a fine save out of Lloris with a well-executed volley.\n\nManchester City frustrated by Everton and Sterling’s late penalty claim Read more\n\nIt was relentlessly hectic and, for long spells, as the tackles flew in, the creative talents gasped for room. Vardy sparked in the second half. He reacted inside a congested area to unload at goal and only a block by Kane, of all people, denied him. There was also the moment on the hour when he stole into the area only to be cleaned out by Lloris, who took both ball and man. There were strangled Leicester cries for a penalty.\n\nTottenham had their chances after the interval. From Ben Davies’s cross, Lamela had a big one, on his left foot, only to scuff his shot and watch it squirm past the far post, via a deflection. Kane was denied by Schmeichel on the biggest of them all while Alli, too, was thwarted by the goalkeeper.\n\nBut, after Ulloa had seen an effort blocked by Jan Vertonghen, amid an almighty scramble, the scene was set for Huth.

Wayne Hennessey gave them more than a helping hand on a night when Joleon Lescott went some way to repairing the damage he did to his reputation in those unsavoury scenes at Wycombe Wanderers on Saturday.\n\nInvolved in an ugly altercation with Villa supporters at Adams Park after taking part in a rather bizarre game that involved seeing how far he could spit his chewing gum while sitting on the bench, Lescott went from villain to hero in a little more than 72 hours with a precious goal that gave Rémi Garde his first win since taking over as manager on 3 November.\n\nPaul Dummett strike earns Newcastle draw against Manchester United Read more\n\nThe Villa captain’s header ended up trickling over the line – Lescott could probably have propelled a stick of Wrigley further – and Hennessey will ruefully reflect on how he made the ball look like a bar of soap as it wriggled out of his hands and through his legs before goalline technology confirmed the inevitable. Yet all that mattered to Villa was that the goal was enough for them to pick up a rare three points – against a hugely disappointing Palace side who looked strangely out of sorts and, in the words of Alan Pardew, “never got going”.\n\nTo put this result into context, it is Garde’s first victory as manager at the 11th attempt and the first time that Villa have won in the league at home in eight months, stretching back to a time when Tim Sherwood was in charge, the Midlands club were looking forward to an FA Cup final and there was an air of optimism about the place.\n\nThe mood has turned mutinous of late and the chances are that this victory will count for very little in the grand scheme of things but at least it provided Villa fans with something to cheer. Garde’s side remain eight points adrift of safety with 17 games remaining and still require a minor miracle to avoid relegation but the impression at the end was that a cloud has been lifted.\n\nAsked whether Lescott owed the fans a performance after his part in that odd chewing gum game with Brad Guzan, Garde replied: “Maybe. The best is to ask him the question. I cannot answer for him. To be fair, I didn’t speak with Joleon about this stuff. I am pleased with the way he gave an answer tonight but not an answer regarding this [incident] – an answer regarding the fact he’s an experienced player and he should be very important for the team.”\n\nThe big question for Villa is whether this win can be the platform for something bigger – if not an improbable great escape, then at least an improvement in results – and perhaps represent a turning point in their miserable season. “Hopefully [it can],” Garde said.\n\n“We have to stay very humble because it’s only three points. We’re far away from what we all want. Let’s hope this victory can give us a little bit more confidence. But not only the victory; the way we played tonight I didn’t see a bottom team – the difference between Palace and Aston Villa didn’t reflect the table. I want my players to be more confident and hopefully that’s what will happen.”\n\nThat was a fair assessment on a night when Villa played with spirit throughout and grew in belief as the game went on. Wilfried Zaha’s shot hit the woodwork after only 44 seconds and Scott Dann spurned a decent chance late on but Pardew acknowledged that Villa were the better side, with Jordan Ayew the standout player on the pitch.\n\n“We came across an Aston Villa team tonight that worked very hard and from the videos and games I analysed that was their best performance and we struggled to cope with it,” the Palace manager said. “We’ve been struggling offensively with injuries and I thought going forward tonight that really wasn’t us.”\n\nGarde made some bold calls by leaving Guzan on the bench and giving Mark Bunn his first league game since May 2013. Libor Kozak also came in out of the cold, with the Czech Republic striker granted his first start in more than two years in a move that felt born of desperation more than anything else.\n\nKozak came close to scoring early in the second half, when his low deflected shot was turned round a post by Hennessey in what was a fine save from the Palace keeper, yet the Welshman’s next contribution provided a moment to forget. Lescott towered above Dann and Connor Wickham, who came on at half-time as Pardew tried to give his side more of an attacking threat, and the defender’s header ended up rolling just over the line after Hennessey made a pig’s ear of holding on to the ball.\n\nLescott’s reaction was subdued – perhaps not surprising in the circumstances – but there was nothing muted about Villa’s celebrations at the final whistle. “The goal was disappointing,” Pardew said. “I think Wayne’s first touch puts him in trouble. He’s been brilliant for us. His mistake tonight cost us the goal but we made mistakes in other areas all night and they of course go unnoticed while the goal is a highlight for everyone else.\n\n“I don’t want to take too much away from Villa. They deserved the win and my team didn’t play well. The Premier League would not want to lose a club of this magnitude. I hope they can resolve it.”"}, {"date": "12/01/2016", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11071, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds":

soundtrack of Kanye West’s Power and the scene felt more akin to a Bournemouth nightclub but in the end there was no cause for celebration.\n\nEddie Howe’s squad were boosted by three new signings this month for almost £20m – Benik Afobe, Juan Iturbe and the returning Lewis Grabban. Only four years ago Bournemouth shattered their transfer record on the striker Matt Tubbs, now at Portsmouth, for £800,000.\n\nThis was supposed to be the start of a new era but Dimitri Payet’s magical display stole the show, leading to his manager, Slaven Bilic, labelling the Frenchman a bargain at £10.7m. Payet, making his first start since November due to injury, capped a fine display with an unstoppable free-kick which found its way into Artur Boruc’s goal and sent West Ham on their way to a third straight league victory.\n\nSlaven Bilic likens returning Dimitri Payet to Arsenal’s Mesut Özil Read more\n\n“West Ham fans love a player with a bit of magic and he has more than a bit,” said Bilic. “I do not know why people are so surprised because he came from one of the biggest clubs in Europe [Marseille]. Maybe we are giving him more responsibility but he is enjoying it and we are enjoying him. He is deciding the games, he is doing things that are very hard to do in football and he is bringing the whole team 20 yards up without even kicking a ball.”\n\nWest Ham started the game with intent and played Bournemouth at their own game: hassling, pestering and pressing. Howe’s new £9m record signing Afobe was so keen to hit the ground running, he flew into the opposition half before the referee, Martin Atkinson, had even blown his whistle. Inside the first minute Bournemouth’s captain, Simon Francis, failed to clear Mark Noble’s high ball and his header landed at the feet of Michail Antonio, whose effort was kicked away by the feet of Boruc before the West Ham captain Noble fired the rebound over.\n\nAndy Carroll, in search of his third goal in three league matches, saw his evening end prematurely – the former England striker suffering a pulled hamstring after 15 minutes. “It is a bad situation for us,” said Bilic, without putting a timescale on Carroll’s possible return.\n\nCarroll’s early exit seemed to give Bournemouth the impetus to kick on. Andrew Surman passed the ball inside to Harry Arter, who veered away from Pedro Obiang before sending a low drive – too powerful for the palms of the West Ham keeper Adrián – into the bottom corner. Bournemouth were now in the groove. Matt Ritchie played a short corner with Adam Smith and the full-back crossed for Afobe, who nodded just over. Arter then dummied for Daniels, whose thumping left-foot shot forced a smart stop from the West Ham keeper.\n\nJust after Afobe wasted an opportunity when clean through on goal West Ham forced Boruc, a free transfer in the summer, into another fine save. Payet slid a pass through for Nikica Jelavic, Carroll’s replacement, whose shot from a tight angle deflected off the defender Steve Cook and goalwards only for Boruc’s strong left hand to intervene. Payet then left Boruc’s fingertips stinging after an acrobatic save.\n\nSo much of West Ham’s success this season has stemmed from Payet and the winger began to take centre stage again. Payet was in a destructive mood and scored his sixth goal of the season with a right-foot free-kick after 67 minutes. Eight minutes later he turned provider for Enner Valencia, crossing for the Ecuadorian to lash home from inside the box.\n\n“When he makes a mistake in training that by his standards he should not have done he is crazy and he is angry at himself,” said Bilic. “That is what makes him a leader and a player that says, ‘OK, we are down, I have to step up’ and he came out second half and said it is going to be all about me.”\n\nAfter 84 minutes Valencia sealed West Ham’s fourth straight victory, sending his set piece, from an area not dissimilar to where Payet had previously prevailed, past a hapless Boruc.\n\nBournemouth hope they have found a gem of their own in the on-loan Roma forward Iturbe, although he had a difficult evening. “It is difficult for Juan to come into that environment and I think we have work to do with him to get his fitness up,” said Howe. “I do not think we can expect too much from him too early.”"}, {"date": "12/01/2016", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle",

smug. At other times he seemed deeply frustrated and, occasionally, downright furious but there is one emotion Manchester United’s manager surely did not experience. It is safe to assume he was never bored by his team on Tuesday night.\n\nEven Van Gaal had confessed to finding his latest team a little dull lately but here they provided the perfect antidote. Almost a throwback to the glorious tactical “anarchy” of Alex Ferguson’s early reign this was a gloriously exciting game featuring two goals from Wayne Rooney, an impressive Newcastle United fightback and a host of defensive imperfections.\n\nLouis van Gaal blames Manchester United players for Newcastle draw Read more\n\nWhen everyone finally drew breath Steve McClaren’s side were still third bottom and Manchester United had slipped to sixth but both managers expressed cautious reason to believe they can defy the bookmakers’ odds and keep their jobs.\n\nOnce the £12m Jonjo Shelvey and the £4.5m Henri Saivet – signings from Swansea and Bordeaux respectively, who were paraded on the pitch before kick-off – begin fortifying midfield the Tynesiders should start climbing the table.\n\nWatching from the stands that pair bowed their heads as St James’ held a heartfelt minute of applause in celebration of the life of Pavel Srnicek, Newcastle’s hugely popular former goalkeeper who died of a cardiac arrest last month at the age of 47.\n\nIs it really 20 years since Srnicek was part of Kevin Keegan’s famous Newcastle “Entertainers” who, back in 1996, so memorably challenged Ferguson’s similarly swashbuckling Manchester United for the Premier League title?\n\nTwo decades on both sides’s harbour distinctly downgraded ambitions with McClaren’s hopes of avoiding relegation swiftly receiving the latest in a long line of dents when his team somewhat harshly conceded a penalty.\n\nThe former England coach has not had an awful lot of luck in recent months and here Chancel Mbemba was unfortunate to be judged guilty of handball after Marouane Fellaini rose to meet a corner and headed it straight at his marker’s admittedly extended arm.\n\nWith no room to manoeuvre there was nothing Mbemba could do about it but, nonetheless, Mike Dean – who could perhaps argue the centre-half had no need to stick that limb out in the first place and had quite possibly blocked a goalbound header – pointed to the spot.\n\nRooney stepped forward to send Rob Elliot the wrong way courtesy of a kick directed to the goalkeeper’s left. As it hit the back of the net, McClaren probably felt he had been kicked in the teeth.\n\nEven worse for Newcastle’s manager was the sense that the game was settling into an all too familiar pattern. By the end Manchester United were being bullied off the ball and had lost control of possession but, at this early juncture, they exuded an increasing aura of authority which was starting to depress the Gallowgate End.\n\nIt could have been worse. When Rooney checked and cleverly beat the home offside trap before accelerating on to Jesse Lingard’s neat pass, he probably should have scored but instead shot narrowly wide.\n\nGeorginio Wijnaldum suggested he, too, had misplaced his shooting boots when, having been put through by Ayoze Pérez, he aimed his shot far too close to David de Gea, permitting Van Gaal’s goalkeeper to save smartly with his legs.\n\nMcClaren appeared to have genuine cause for complaint when Lingard looked to have tripped Daryl Janmaat in the area but, inexplicably, Dean refused to award a penalty and then again when Fellaini, already booked and getting away with a litany of niggly fouls, blatantly tugged Jack Colback back.\n\nIt was time for Van Gaal’s players to show their more attractive side and, sure enough, when Ander Herrera collected a loose ball near the halfway line he provided Rooney with an exquisite pass. After holding the ball up intelligently – and holding off Fabricio Coloccini – Rooney slipped in a superb reverse pass which Lingard, making a blindside run, took in his stride before dispatching the ball low, and assuredly, beyond Elliot.\n\nColoccini had seemed completely lost during that little cameo but Newcastle’s captain made amends with a diagonal pass from which Aleksandar Mitrovic beat Fellaini in the air and flicked on for Wijnaldum to volley unerringly past De Gea.\n\nNewcastle United fans unfurl protest banner aimed at Mike Ashley's Sports Direct Read more\n\nIt was a fabulous finish which proved a precursor to a second-half Newcastle rally. Featuring Moussa Sissoko upping the tempo and driving his team forward at every opportunity it ensured unbridled optimism replaced earlier hints that mutiny might be simmering in the stands.\n\nThis newly restored faith was very nearly punctured when Anthony Martial tricked Mbemba and Herrera played an adroit pass from which Lingard should have scored but instead curled his shot high and wide.\n\nIt was a costly miss because when Chris Smalling wrestled Mitrovic to the floor as they jostled at a corner, Dean finally awarded Newcastle a penalty, crisply converted by the Serbia centre-forward.\n\nWijnaldum had what would have been a sublime goal disallowed for offside before Rooney thought he had clinched it. Although Coloccini blocked Depay’s shot the ball rebounded to United’s captain whose wonderful first-time shot from just outside the area whizzed into the top corner.\n\nThen, just as locals were resigning themselves to by now customary disappointment, United failed to clear a cross. Meeting Mitrovic’s chestdown, Paul Dummett, McClaren’s left-back, swiped his left foot at the ball. A hefty deflection off Smalling ensured it evaded De Gea’s grasp and the smile was wiped from Van Gaal’s face."}, {"date": "03/01/2016", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24854, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [80], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [13], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [29], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [16]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baba Rahman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bertrand Traoré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [16], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chelsea supporters would love to think that the second half of 2015 was simply a bad dream. Sadly for them, it was grotesquely real but the new year got under way in cathartic fashion for them and there was even evidence of their old champion swagger and steel.\n\nIt was as if a switch had been flicked on the misery of the preceding months, as the caretaker manager, Guus Hiddink, enjoyed the first victory of his second spell at the club and Willian, the game’s outstanding individual, produced the outstanding moment. His stinging drive from outside the area for Chelsea’s second goal was still rising when it ripped into the roof of the net.\n\nCrystal Palace v Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nChelsea had started the day three points above the relegation zone and with only four teams beneath them, and a case could be made for next Sunday’s FA Cup tie at home to League One Scunthorpe United being the bigger game. The table looked a little better for them after this and, although much of the meaning has been stripped from their Premier League season, the team did feel much more like their old selves.\n\nDiego Costa and Cesc Fàbregas returned from suspension and illness respectively and both were influential, with the former setting up the opening goal for Oscar and scoring the third himself. Fàbregas pulled the strings in midfield, supported by the excellent Mikel John Obi, and it was revealing to hear a post-match comment from Alan Pardew, the Crystal Palace manager.\n\n“Looking at the Chelsea players now and speaking to one or two of them coming off the pitch, they all feel they haven’t played well [over the first-half of the season],” Pardew said. “I said to Fàbregas: ‘You were brilliant today.’ And he said: ‘Well, it’s taken a while’.”\n\nPalace were chasing the league double over their London neighbours, having won at Stamford Bridge in August – the first real surprise result of the José Mourinho implosion – but they were breached here by Chelsea’s slick football and they had no answers of their own.\n\nPalace ran aground after the 29th-minute concession to Oscar while Chelsea went from strength to strength, with the early loss of Eden Hazard to a groin problem reduced to little more than a footnote.\n\nHazard had tried to carry on only to plonk himself down on the turf, moments after losing out tamely to Joel Ward by the corner flag, and indicate that his game was over. He was a snapshot in loneliness as he trudged off towards the tunnel and he will undergo a scan on Monday.\n\nChelsea’s breakthrough goal was marked by high-end quality, which sparkled amid the gloomy weather and sparked happiness inside the travelling enclosure. “We are staying up,” the Chelsea fans chanted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Willian celebrates scoring Chelsea’s second at Crystal Palace, a fine team goal. He was involved in the third goal, too, his parried shot turned in by Diego Costa Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFàbregas, back at the expense of Nemanja Matic rather than Mikel, was the initial creator, sliding a ball through for Costa, after the striker had spun off his marker to run in behind. Costa cut a lovely, disguised cross back for Oscar and the midfielder tapped home from close range.\n\nHazard’s replacement, Pedro, was industrious on the left and Chelsea made inroads up that side. They might have had the second in the 37th minute when Fàbregas, again, cut Palace apart with a ball forward, this time for César Azpilicueta. The left-back’s first touch on his chest was true and, one-on-one with Wayne Hennessey from a tight angle, he was denied by a block from the goalkeeper. Kurt Zouma also missed with a free header from Willian’s free-kick shortly after the interval.\n\nThe tackles flew in. Damien Delaney and Scott Dann were both booked for kicking Costa but he kept his cool, exacting revenge with his football. Palace had drawn blanks in their previous two outings and the continued absence of the injured Yannick Bolasie was compounded by the loss of Yohan Cabaye to a ban after five yellow cards. Both creators were missed as Palace groped for a cutting edge against a Chelsea defence that was well protected by Mikel. He kept everything cool and simple.\n\nFraizer Campbell had gone close with Palace’s only first-half chance in the 26th minute, following Jason Puncheon’s dangerous cross, and they flickered in the 59th minute through Wilfried Zaha. Teed up by Campbell after Chelsea had appealed in vain for a foul on Costa, Zaha’s shot was scuffed somewhat and Thibaut Courtois stretched to save.\n\nMoments later, the game was over. Willian started the move, working the ball to Fàbregas, who found Oscar and, when the ball broke following Dann’s tackle, Willian strode on to it and let fly. Hennessey felt it scorch past him. Chelsea got the third shortly afterwards when Willian teased James McArthur before shooting. Hennessey pushed it out but only as far as Costa and he bundled his effort home off Ward.\n\nMan of the match Willian (Chelsea)"}, {"date": "03/01/2016", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38482,

music but not today because the players are very disappointed and feel we have dropped two points,” said Mauricio Pochettino. “That is a good sign for the future.” One his gifted young group appear capable of addressing.\n\nSpurs produced a dominant first-half display at Everton, a season’s best according to their manager, Dele Alli again demonstrated his precocious talent with a superb goal and Hugo Lloris enjoyed a quiet afternoon until Roberto Martínez’s side rallied in the second half. But they had to settle for a point – one the home side merited for their belated improvement and Aaron Lennon’s impressive strike against his former club – for the ninth time this season.\n\nTottenham’s Dele Alli wins battle against Everton’s Ross Barkley | Michael Cox Read more\n\nA failure to turn control into victories threatens to undermine talk of a Tottenham title challenge – talk that mostly originates from outside White Hart Lane, admittedly – but Pochettino did not shy away from the potential in his squad afterwards. “It is too early to speak about some challenge or achievements at the end of the season,” he said. “But we are very ambitious. Maybe tomorrow we can analyse the game and feel proud, and be happy for the point, but now our feeling is disappointment that we have dropped two points. We are the youngest squad in the Premier League but we show our winning mentality.”\n\nPochettino’s team dominated possession from the first whistle to the moment Lennon put Everton ahead from their first attack. Martínez claimed he was happy for Spurs to do so. “We stopped their main players from getting on the ball and hurting us,” said the Everton manager, somewhat optimistically.\n\nIntense pressing and accuracy in possession left the home side encamped in their own half for the opening 45 minutes and brought simmering frustrations over Everton’s run of one win in six league games to the surface. There were ironic cheers from the Gwladys Street stand when Tim Howard collected a routine cross for the second home match in succession. As in the 4-3 loss to Stoke City on Monday, the USA international reacted to the self-defeating noises from his own supporters. John Stones also exchanged words with Everton fans after over-elaborating inside his area late on.\n\nIt needed a superb intervention from Séamus Coleman to prevent Alli converting Kyle Walker’s low cross from Tottenham’s first meaningful attack. Moments later Pochettino’s side struck Everton’s woodwork for the first time when Harry Kane beat Howard from distance only for his low drive to rebound clear off the inside of a post.\n\nEverton did not have one touch in the final third in the opening 19 minutes yet stunned Spurs by piercing Lloris’s defence with their first attack. In another echo of the Stoke defeat, specifically Romelu Lukaku’s second goal, Tom Cleverley swept a fine cross-field ball into the Belgium international lurking with intent in the box. This time Lukaku cushioned a header down for Lennon, who took one touch before steering his shot beyond Lloris’s right hand.\n\nThe goal was Lennon’s first since joining Everton on a permanent £4.5m deal from Tottenham in the summer and clearly satisfying for a player who ended his White Hart Lane career training with the club’s youngsters. Lennon was afforded a warm reception by the Spurs supporters when replaced by Gerard Deulofeu on the hour, his withdrawal prompting boos from the home crowd.\n\nEverton v Tottenham: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nEverton’s lead did not change the flow of the first half and Ben Davies hit Howard’s crossbar with a thunderous left-foot shot from Christian Eriksen’s corner. Tottenham levelled in stoppage time, the manner of their equaliser more surprising than its arrival. Having failed to capitalise on one of their intricate passing moves around the Everton area the visitors went long with their final attack of an impressive half. Toby Alderweireld dissected Everton’s central defence with a long ball that Alli read perfectly and executed superbly, stealing in ahead of Coleman to control on his chest before sending a first-time volley beyond Howard.\n\nMartínez’s team reacted as they had to in the second half, with far more aggression and adventure on the ball, although Kane was close to a second for Spurs when Alli expertly chested the ball over the Everton defence. Lukaku was millimetres from connecting with Deulofeu’s inviting cross to the far post while another Everton substitute, the impressive Muhamed Besic, drew a finger-tip save from Lloris with a volley from 18 yards.\n\nEverton continued to press for a winner in the closing stages and Lloris, rarely troubled for an hour, was ultimately the busier keeper as the game opened up into an entertaining, end-to-end affair. Ross Barkley forced the France international into a low save with the final touch of the match and Spurs were left to reflect on what might, or should, have been.

His team arrived here looking for a third straight victory but instead lost for a second time in four games, with the pain for those who filled the away end intensified by the identity of the man who delivered the killer blow.\n\nAndy Carroll has waited three years to score against his former club, making no secret of his frustration at not succeeding at Anfield having arrived there for £35m in January 2011, and he finally delivered. It was classic Carroll, a soaring, expertly directed header that had the ball nestling in the far corner of the net. The No9’s revenge followed another fine header from Michail Antonio after 10 minutes, and the win not only moved West Ham ahead of Liverpool into sixth but also completed a league double over the Merseyside club for the first time in 52 years having triumphed at Anfield in August.\n\nWest Ham’s performance was full of energy, endeavour and no little skill, and for Klopp there was no hiding his fury with his side at their failure to build on victories over Leicester City and Sunderland and instead revert to the lacklustre, sloppy outfit who were beaten 3-0 at Watford before Christmas.\n\nThe “soft German” was hard on his players this time. “It was not enough from my team and I’m really angry because we could have got more because everybody could see in the moments we play football what could happen,” Klopp said. “We have to again accept that we didn’t play like we should.”\n\nKlopp went on to say Liverpool “always had the ball”, which while stretching it was not completely barmy given they had 65% of possession. As he intimated, Liverpool showed flashes of their capabilities either side of the interval when they threatened with slick, purposeful play, most notably via Emre Can’s shot in first-half stoppage time that rattled the bar. But all too often, and not for the first time this season, their passing broke down and they lacked penetration.\n\nOperating again as a lone forward Christian Benteke delivered another display that makes Liverpool’s decision to spend £32.5m on the 25-year-old in the summer appear a mistake. The Belgian was too often static and did little or nothing when presented with a chance to strike, most notably early on in the second-half, and with the score 1-0 to West Ham, when he wafted half-heartedly at Alberto Moreno’s cross.\n\nThe comparison with Carroll was stark. The 26-year-old was a constant nuisance to Liverpool’s back four with his aggressive, muscular approach and he put them to the sword on 55 minutes, running on to Mark Noble’s cross and, having got a jump on Nathaniel Clyne, sending the ball past a rooted Simon Mignolet for his third goal of the season. Another header shortly after forced Mignolet into a save and, overall, this was a fine afternoon for a player deemed not good enough for Liverpool having become, and remaining ahead of Benteke, their most expensive signing to remind his former employers of what they let go.\n\nSlaven Bilic praised Carroll’s all-round contribution. “Andy was brilliant, not just because of the goal but for his performance,” said the West Ham manager. “Now he is fit and it is all about him. Is he going to look after himself, work hard, maintain his position or to even make it better?”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Andy Carroll rises highest to head home. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Observer\n\nThere were other standout performers in claret and blue, such as James Collins and Manuel Lanzini, who almost scored with a wickedly swerving shot that hit the post before he was substituted with what appears to be a reoccurrence of a thigh injury and is likely to be out for up to six weeks.\n\nDimitri Payet came on as a second-half substitute having been out of action for two months with an ankle injury. The Frenchman, so brilliant following his arrival from Marseille in the summer, could well end up taking Antonio’s starting place, although the 25-year-old may take some shifting having scored his second goal in successive games.\n\nIt summed up West Ham’s show of desire and ruthlessness that the opener came via a counterattack that started with Antonio winning the ball from Moreno by his own area before sprinting up the pitch to meet Enner Valencia’s cross.\n\n“The situation with Alberto was a foul but we reacted not right. We have to avoid this cross,” said Klopp, who by the end was watching proceedings from underneath his hood on what was a wet and grey afternoon in east London. The weather summed up his mood as well as the bleakness of Liverpool’s top-four hopes."}, {"date": "02/01/2016", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59257, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal",

as this that John Terry had in mind when he suggested the goalkeeper could be worth 12-15 points a season to Arsenal.\n\nArsène Wenger’s team were below par, the radar was off, the fatigue had set in, and they came up against a Newcastle team who made more than enough chances to upset the league leaders. Cech dealt with assurance with Newcastle’s best efforts, which gave Arsenal the platform to eke out a win. Earning the points required resilience and the capacity to dig deep into their energy reserves. It was appropriate, perhaps, that the matchwinner was Laurent Koscielny, restored to the starting lineup after a much-needed breather.\n\nArsenal 1-0 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIt was indicative of how this game went that Wenger confessed he felt for his opponents. “Honestly I am long enough in football to know if you are in Newcastle’s place you feel sorry for them because they played very well,” he said. “I know also when you are capable to win and you haven’t played well it shows a mental aspect of your team that is very important.”\n\nIt left Steve McClaren ruing the outcome when he felt his players had earned the right to take something with them on the journey north. “I’m scratching my head as to how we got nothing from that game,” he said. “Not many teams will come here and do that to Arsenal without getting something.\n\n“We were aggressive, kept control, created chances. I couldn’t fault what we tried to do. It was the complete performance without getting a result. It’s about putting the ball in the back of the net which is why they have the points and we don’t.”\n\nAsked if the answer to his head scratching could take the form of a giant 33-year-old goalkeeper, McClaren did not disagree. “Goalkeepers win you matches and he certainly won that game,” he said.\n\nThere were two particularly influential stops. In the first half Cech was alert to parry away Giorginio Wijnaldum’s firm shot, and tidy up when Jack Colback followed up. At the start of the second half Aaron Ramsey ceded possession and the game opened up once again for the visitors. Ayoze Pérez dinked a perfect pass for Wijnaldum. Cech spread himself to smother superbly.\n\nHis interventions were hugely important on a day when Arsenal struggled to find their fluency. One of the perils of the festive football calendar is the likelihood of busy players looking as if they barely know if they are coming or going. There were leggy performances, lapses of concentration, and off-key passes scattered liberally across the drenched Emirates pitch.\n\nWenger watched on from his dugout, quietly frustrated that his team were not functioning properly. Mesut Özil’s touch and movement were typically deft, but those around him strained to reach his level. The energy levels improved in the second half as the game opened up and both teams became more cavalier and increasingly desperate in their search for a goal.\n\nNewcastle came close as Aleksandar Mitrovic and Chancel Mbemba threatened. Arsenal perked up when Olivier Giroud flashed a header across goal, and then Özil squeezed a brilliant pass towards Ramsey, whose shot was too tame to test Rob Elliot.\n\nIn need of some inspiration, someone to take a risk or try something to force the issue, Koscielny stepped up to deliver in the 72nd minute. Giroud won headers in the box not once but twice after Özil floated in a corner. Koscielny was alive to sneak in at the far post to plant a shot past Elliot.\n\nWenger was more than satisfied with the outcome as an example they may need to draw on as the season wears on. “Not to drop points when you play like we did today is very important. It helps the team – the memory of having done that before and winning the game helps you to hang on sometimes.”\n\nTrying to look at the bigger picture, he was in no mood to read too much into this match in terms of the title challenge. “It’s too early. We have 42 points, let’s be realistic.\n\n“Let’s focus that we are in a strong position. We have given a lot over Christmas. At the end of the day how many points have you made in four games? We knew nine points would be acceptable, 10 ideal.” He made the point that only Manchester City managed 10 points last season. And they did not go on to win the Premier League.\n\nWenger and McClaren were quiet about any potential business to strengthen their squads over January but admitted they are hard at work to bolster their options. The intensity of four festive games over, there is still not much time to pause for a moment, regroup, and go again."}, {"date": "02/01/2016", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32006,

successive match on an afternoon of immense frustration for Claudio Ranieri and his players.\n\nLaurent Koscielny tap-in gives Arsenal win against Newcastle United Read more\n\nJamie Vardy was denied by the woodwork, Wes Morgan filed a contender for miss of the season and Riyad Mahrez picked a bad day for that wonderful left foot to let him down – from the penalty spot of all places.\n\nThe temptation from outside the club will be to say the bubble has burst, yet the margins were so fine it would be unfair to write off Leicester. Vardy looked as annoyed as anyone that he failed to score, with the England international booting the same upright that his toe-poked first-half shot had cannoned off, while only Mahrez knows why he hesitated during the run up to a penalty that was struck at a comfortable height for Artur Boruc to repel.\n\nFor Bournemouth there was a sense that justice was done with that penalty save, given Simon Francis clearly got the ball when he made a last-ditch attempt to stop Vardy in his tracks as the Leicester striker bore down on goal. Andre Marriner had deemed otherwise, the referee pointing to the spot and showing Francis a straight red card that forced Bournemouth to play the final half-hour with 10 men.\n\nLeicester poured forward in that period but Eddie Howe’s team showed spirit and resilience to hold on and it was not until the closing moments that Bournemouth hearts were in mouths. Vardy again went down, this time under a challenge from Dan Gosling, and some players thought Marriner had awarded another penalty. Instead he gave a goal-kick and Leicester’s hopes of snatching a late victory disappeared.\n\nRanieri refused to be too downbeat despite a third successive game without a win, with the Leicester manager promising champagne for his players to celebrate the fact they have reached 40 points and challenging them to try to do even better in the second half of the season. “When you play at a high intensity you can make mistakes, we made a lot of mistakes with the last pass – we were too anxious to score a goal,” said Ranieri, who is close to completing the signing of Demarai Gray from Birmingham.\n\n“But it’s OK, 40 points, clean sheet, champagne for my players. If we did 39 points in the first half of the season we try to make 40 in the second half. We are safe. We are doing a fantastic season, why not believe anything is possible?”\n\nBournemouth started brightly and had two excellent chances in the opening 45 minutes. Josh King wasted the first when he headed wide from inside the six-yard box after Junior Stanislas did well to cut back Francis’ deep cross. The second opportunity fell to Gosling, who scooped over the bar from 12 yards after King had outpaced Robert Huth and rolled the ball perfectly into the midfielder’s path.\n\nNorwich’s Alex Tettey punishes Southampton and Victor Wanyama Read more\n\nIn an open and entertaining game Vardy could have put Leicester ahead in between those two moments. Leonardo Ulloa’s miscued effort rolled into his path and Vardy’s instinctive shot hit the inside of the post and bounced to safety. Vardy, to his credit, kept coming back for more and it was his low curling shot that forced Boruc into the save that led to Morgan, no more than four yards out, volleying a Christian Fuchs corner over.\n\nThen came that contentious penalty decision. Running on to Danny Drinkwater’s measured pass, Vardy looked to be clear but just as he entered the area Francis made the tackle that Marriner penalised so harshly .\n\nHowe, who described this point as a “huge result” for Bournemouth, felt the referee got it wrong. “Simon has got a difficult job there, Vardy is goalside of him, going towards the goal at full pace,” he said. “But Simon has come from the side and got a clear touch on the ball, timed it superbly and it’s not a penalty or a free-kick. It was a difficult one for the ref because he’s the other side of the pitch.”"}, {"date": "02/01/2016", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75415, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bastian Schweinsteiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [47], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Memphis Depay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [70], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Grimes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Modou Barrow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "As the Manchester United supporters headed away into the drizzle, there was at least a collective sense of relief that Louis van Gaal’s team had reminded themselves what it was like to win a football match. It had been a long time coming – 42 days, to be precise – and they had to endure a wretched first half. Yet the eight-match sequence without a victory, their worst run since 1990, was finally over and Wayne Rooney’s improvisational winner had soothing effects for a crowd that is used to better times.\n\nVan Gaal’s side made hard going of it at times and it still feels startling that Old Trafford, a stadium famous for its sense of high drama, has seen the lowest number of goals this season, 15, of all 92 league clubs. Staggeringly, United have not managed a first-half one in nine successive home games stretching back to 30 September and Van Gaal is being generous in the extreme when he says this team is still capable of winning the league.\n\nThere was, however, an improvement during a second half when United took the lead through Anthony Martial’s header before toying with the idea of the game becoming another ordeal courtesy of Gylfi Sigurdsson’s 71st-minute equaliser. Rooney’s goal came six minutes later and should ease his confidence at a time when United’s captain has admitted being off form. In the first half, Rooney was booed when he played the ball backwards.\n\nLouis van Gaal hails Wayne Rooney’s ‘beautiful’ winner against Swansea Read more\n\nRooney has now moved ahead of Denis Law to become the second-highest scorer in United’s history, 11 short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s 249, but his afternoon might still have been spoiled during a late, frenetic spell of pressure from Swansea culminating in Lukasz Fabianski, the visiting keeper, coming forward for a stoppage-time corner, leaping in the manner of a modern-day John Charles and flashing a header just wide of David de Gea’s goal.\n\nThe final whistle shrilled moments later and United survived but it cannot be satisfactory that, 18 months after joining the club, Van Gaal is still experimenting with new formations and still a mile away from everything fully clicking.\n\nHis new system here took some working out, veering from 3-4-2-1 to 3‑1‑3-3 and back again, and it is no wonder sometimes if even his own players look puzzled themselves. The football was leaden in the first half and, once again, there were times when an impatient crowd struggled to contain their frustrations.\n\nIn other parts of the game there was a brooding silence. Old Trafford is not enjoying what it sees and Van Gaal should be grateful the fans are showing more restraint than he would have experienced at some of his previous clubs. At Barcelona, it is easy to imagine how vigorously the panolada would have been fluttering and it was remarkable afterwards to hear him say he was happier with the first half than the second one. That sentence, more than anything, sums up what an awkward fit he is at a club with United’s love of adventure.\n\nIf that sounds slightly harsh after a return to winning ways, then it cannot be overstated how dreary United looked in the opening 45 minutes. At one point, the cameras turned to the seats where United’s directors and staff were struggling to hide their own boredom. Sir Alex Ferguson was playing with his phone. The academy coach, Paul McGuinness, was reading the programme and Nicky Butt also had his phone out. United were ponderous, predictable and prosaic and fortunate, perhaps, the referee, Jon Moss, gave Morgan Schneiderlin the benefit of the doubt after he had hooked an attempted clearance against his own hand.\n\nAnthony Martial and Wayne Rooney prove Manchester United’s ghostbusters | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nMartial’s goal came two minutes into the second half with a downward header from Ashley Young’s right-wing cross and at that stage United’s crowd must have been encouraged by the fact they had conceded only three goals here all season. Yet the game opened up when Swansea’s caretaker manager, Alan Curtis, who had left Jonjo Shelvey out of his squad, brought on Modou Barrow for Leon Britton. Britton had been the outstanding player in the first half but Barrow gave the team width and penetration and it was the Gambian’s cross, having eluded the half-time substitute Matteo Darmian, that led to Sigurdsson looping a header over De Gea for the equaliser.\n\nSwansea could also reflect on André Ayew’s header striking the post at 1-0 and they were aggrieved that Ángel Rangel was booked for an alleged dive when he reached the loose ball with Darmian closing in. They gave everything in the closing stages and, as well as Fabianski’s attempts to give the game an extraordinary last twist, De Gea had to turn away a fiercely struck shot from Ashley Williams.\n\nYet this was a day, ultimately, when Rooney turned down the volume a little on his critics. His goal was a beauty, set up by Martial’s driving run and low centre and turned in by Rooney’s left foot, flicked behind his right, to spare Van Gaal another wave of intense scrutiny."}, {"date":

Victor Wanyama of “lacking focus” and letting the club down as Saints slid further down the table with a fourth consecutive away defeat. The Southampton manager was furious that he had to rearrange his game plan two hours before kick-off at Carrow Road because Mané turned up late for a team meeting, and Wanyama caused further disruption by getting sent off when the score was 0-0. Four minutes later Alex Tettey scored the winning goal for Norwich. Koeman said he will speak to the Southampton board about how to punish Mané and Wanyama.\n\nKoeman was particularly angry with Mané because he had warned the player about his attitude on Thursday, having noticed that the Senegalese forward appeared distracted in training. Koeman claimed he did not know whether the transfer speculation linking Mané with a January move to Manchester United was to blame.\n\n“My message to Sadio was that I think he wasn’t really focused and concentrated,” said Koeman. “He was not doing things in the training session how I like football players to do them.”\n\nThat context, and the fact that Southampton’s chairman, Ralph Krueger, gave the whole squad a speech on New Year’s Day in which he emphasised the values they need to uphold, made Koeman all the more vexed with the player’s late arrival for the matchday meeting.\n\n“Sadio was in [the team] but we have rules and he was doing a big mistake because he came late and that’s impossible,” said Koeman. “I don’t understand players who come late, and everybody knows we have a sanction.”\n\nMané knows it especially well, as he was dropped last February for a similar offence before a home match against Liverpool. “You have to make changes in the teams, in the set pieces, in everything,” said Koeman.\n\nKoeman was also aggrieved by the behaviour of Wanyama, another player linked with a transfer away, with Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal among the Kenyan’s admirers. Wanyama was booked in the first half here for a crunching late tackle on Nathan Redmond and was sent off in the 72nd minute for another ugly tackle, this time on Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe.\n\n“A player with his experience needs to know if you have a yellow already you can’t do that,” said Koeman. “You have a responsibility to the fans, the team-mates, the board, the technical staff – losing is part of the job but sometimes we do it to ourselves. This is very painful. I will talk to the board and the players, I’m angry about what happened.”\n\nIn addition to indiscipline, Southampton were undone here by wayward finishing. Even without Mané and their injured top scorer, Graziano Pellè, they created enough chances to take the lead. Shane Long pestered the home defence but missed several opportunities, most blatantly in the first half when he collected a pass from Cuco Martina before taking too many touches and allowing the Norwich goalkeeper Declan Rudd to smother his shot.\n\nVirgil van Dijk twice headed wide from corners in the first-half and Jordy Clasie brought a good save from Rudd with a curling shot from 25 yards. But Norwich also had chances in the first period after a stuttering start. Jonny Howson hit a bobbling shot wide from 12 yards after dispossessing José Fonte.\n\nThen, in the 21st minute, Van Dijk coughed up the ball to allow Wes Hoolahan to lead a counterattack, which ended with Howson trying to set up a tap-in for Russell Martin at the back post but misdirecting his pass. Howson provided a far better cross just before the break – Dieumerci Mbokani stretched to meet it but poked the ball just wide from eight yards.\n\nThe second half was heading for a stalemate until Alex Neil made a bold change, replacing Redmond with Odjida-Ofoe around the hour. That move soon paid off but not before Dusan Tadic missed another good chance for the visitors. Moments later Odjida-Ofoe was caught late by Wanyama, who walked. The Belgian then teed up Tettey, who put on a free finishing lesson for Southampton by cracking a perfect shot into the top corner from the edge of the area.\n\nKoeman introduced Mané but it was too

"report": "It is a year since Jermain Defoe became Sunderland’s highest paid player after arriving from FC Toronto. Since then Gus Poyet, Dick Advocaat and now Sam Allardyce have all struggled to fit the former England striker into their starting XIs and there has been interminable debate about whether he should be off-loaded.\n\nAlong the way though Defoe has scored a few vital goals and none more so than the pair he registered in the second half here. Accommodated on Allardcye’s team sheet as a lone striker supported by Adam Johnson in a new “in the hole” role, he justified such faith by reviving Sunderland’s survival hopes as they ended a run of five straight defeats.\n\nIn truth Defoe’s contribution helped airbrush the flaws out of a less than convincing overall Sunderland performance on a day when the expression on Rémi Garde’s face confirmed that his side are all but consigned to the Championship.\n\nVilla have still to win since Garde succeeded Tim Sherwood and, afterwards he prompted questions about his future in the Midlands by body-swerving the post-match press conferences. Instead the Frenchman boarded the bus waiting to transport Villa to Newcastle airport. Once there, the temptation to check in to a flight bound for Paris rather Birmingham must have been overwhelming for a manager who declined to shake Allardyce’s hand at the final whistle.\n\nVictory kept Sunderland 19th but they now have 15 points, seven more than a Villa side increasingly stranded at the bottom. “Our situation is still dire,” said Allardyce. “We’re still threatened by relegation. We’re a long way from being safe. But when we needed someone to win this game we had Jermain Defoe.\n\n“There’s been a big thing about Jermain not being able to play up front but maybe he can play as a lone striker after all. If someone like Adam Johnson plays behind him and gets closer to him, maybe it can work.”\n\nGarde had evidently worked out a gameplan targeting Patrick van Aanholt’s defensive weaknesses at left-back. Accordingly Leandro Bacuna ran at him at every opportunity and, at the end of one such advance, Bacuna crossed invitingly to Jordan Veretout at the far post. When Veretout stretched to unleash a low volley, Vito Mannone – once again preferred to Costel Pantilimon in the home goal – did very well to palm it to safety.\n\nAll clever movement and slick little passes while frequently operating behind Rudy Gestede, Jack Grealish was, albeit all too briefly, lending Villa an air of sophistication. Worryingly for Allardyce, Sunderland’s defence seemed to be having trouble decoding his passing radar.\n\nIndeed it was all going rather well for the visitors until Van Aanholt collected Yann M’Vila’s pass, galloped down the flank and dispatched a low, speculative, 25-yard shot which struck Micah Richards and, deflecting off the defender, trickled past a wrong-footed Brad Guzan. In a very Gallic gesture of displeasure Garde wrinkled his nose.\n\nVery much against the run of play, this cruellest of deflections arrived at a moment when Sunderland fans had turned decidedly edgy. Yet for all Villa’s dominance of possession, for all the pleasing little individual cameos from Bacuna their final balls – and particularly those to Gestede – lacked the requisite quality. Gradually Grealish also became a cause for concern, fading fast, he drifted to the game’s margins just when Villa needed him most.\n\nAllardyce’s manic technical area gum‑chewing suggested he was not overly struck with his own side’s performance either. Quite apart from offering minimal attacking threat Sunderland’s inability to keep the ball prompted alarm.\n\nAttempting to deconstruct them, Garde replaced Grealish with Adam Traoré. It was to prove an inspired switch. When Borini conceded possession, Traoré simply hared down Villa’s right, dodged the poorly positioned Van Aanholt and, with Wes Brown also left trailing, delivered a deep cross in Carles Gil’s direction. That dispatch prompted a simply stunning goal. Showing off sublime skill, Gil beat Mannone courtesy of a fabulous volley hooked acrobatically over a shoulder. Wow.\n\nSuddenly Sunderland seemed to have one foot in the second tier. The moment had come for Defoe – initially very big on economy of effort – to use all that cleverly conserved energy to remind everyone of his enduring ability and, latching on to Johnson’s pass, the 33-year-old duly obliged. Benefiting from Joleon Lescott’s exceptionally generous defending, he was able to turn goalwards before expertly squeezing a left-footed, near-post shot beyond Guzan.\n\nWith Villa now looking horribly lightweight, Defoe intensified Garde’s woes after connecting with Ola Toivonen’s cross and sweeping a first-time, 12-yard shot home in stoppage time. A hat-trick beckoned when he subsequently pounced on a mistake from Guzan but the resultant effort was controversially deemed offside.\n\nAt the whistle, Garde could not wait to beat a hasty retreat."}, {"date": "02/01/2016", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 23218, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

"Mark Hughes accused Claudio Yacob of getting Geoff Cameron sent off after his side slipped to defeat. Jonny Evans’s injury-time winner capped the late drama following Cameron’s dismissal minutes after Jonathan Walters had levelled for Stoke and looked to have earned them a point.\n\nCameron walked with nine minutes remaining after he pushed Yacob in the back of the neck following the Argentinian’s challenge.\n\nBut the Stoke manager felt the midfielder overreacted to leave the visitors with 10 men and he will consider an appeal. “We weren’t too happy with the reaction of the lad Yacob to be perfectly honest,” he said. “I thought he has gone down with the intention of maybe getting Geoff sent off and unfortunately for us that’s what he’s able to do.\n\n“We’ll have a look at it on Sunday and make a decision on whether or not we appeal against the decision. My initial thought is we probably will appeal.\n\n“It was unfortunate. Geoff has reacted to a late challenge on a leg he injured in the first half. It is understandable to a certain extent.”\n\nHughes also felt that the late red card played a huge part in the winning goal. “At set-plays you are one man down and they are throwing everyone forward,” he said. “At some point there is someone free.\n\n“We could have done better to clear the chance, it’s bobbled across and ended up at the far post for the tap-in. We certainly didn’t play anywhere near like we’re capable of.”\n\nThe defeat ended Stoke’s winning run and they struggled to create clear openings with Boaz Myhill saving from Glen Johnson and Marko Arnautovic before Walters finally struck.\n\nHowever, it had been a dull game before Stéphane Sessègnon’s first goal since October 2014 opened the scoring and set Albion up for successive wins.\n\nIt was Tony Pulis’s third consecutive victory over his former club and the home side are now nine points clear of the Premier League relegation zone.\n\nPulis said: “Irrespective of whether it’s against Stoke or anyone, the most important thing is three points and back-to-back victories. It’s a busy period and we have gone into the game without four players.\n\n“To put in a performance we have done without four major players is fantastic. Luckily for us it drops to Jonny at the end. He has been a great signing for us. He’s not just a good defender but his quality on the ball is first-class. He just oozes class.”\n\nSessègnon looked to be out of Pulis’s plans this season but he has fought his way back into the side. It was just his seventh goal in two-and-a-half years at Albion and Pulis wants the 31-year-old to score more. “I pulled him [aside] this week.

reminder of the devastating qualities that make him the most potent striker in the Premier League when his troublesome hamstrings are not playing up. Agüero’s first goal since 21 November was a wonderful late header that capped a stirring City fightback, earning Manuel Pellegrini’s side their first away win in almost four months and keeping them within touching distance of Arsenal.\n\nManuel Pellegrini says risk brought Manchester City reward at Watford Read more\n\nAs long as Agüero is able to string an extended run of matches together, having been disrupted by a number of niggling injuries this season, then City will be entitled to feel that the title is theirs to lose. However that belief was heavily tested by Watford, who were left to reflect on not capitalising on a breathless spell when they had City on the ropes early on and the moment when Étienne Capoue wasted the chance to make it 2-0 shortly before Yaya Touré crashed in the equaliser with eight minutes left.\n\nThe winner arrived two minutes later, Heurelho Gomes rooted to his line as Agüero’s header looped into the top-left corner, and Quique Sánchez Flores knew that Watford had squandered a glorious opportunity. Watford’s manager could not stop apologising afterwards and while the manner of the turnaround demonstrated that City are capable of scrapping in testing circumstances, their overall performance left much to be desired. “It’s very hard, because twice in one week we have the same feeling,” said the Watford manager, referencing his side’s late defeat to Tottenham Hotspur last Monday.\n\nOne of the most impressive features of Watford’s season has been their refusal to lay out the welcome mat for any visitors to Vicarage Road, as Liverpool discovered two weeks ago, and when Aleksandar Kolarov headed Ben Watson’s corner past Hart in the 55th minute, City looked ragged. They had little margin for error. Arsenal’s late victory over Newcastle United earlier in the day meant that City were six points off the top before kick-off.\n\nThe signs were ominous for City in the opening stages, with Watford determined to demonstrate that they were not cowed by their illustrious opponents. Passing the ball swiftly and sharply in midfield and using the movement, brawn and skill of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo to great effect in attack, the hosts created four clear opportunities in a frenetic opening 15 minutes.\n\nAlmen Abdi whistled a drive inches over from 20 yards and Ighalo had the clearest opportunity, spinning Nicolás Otamendi far too easily, only for Joe Hart to smother his shot. Deeney had a penalty claim waved away by Martin Atkinson, who correctly saw nothing wrong with Kolarov’s challenge, and the extent to which City miss the assurance of the injured Vincent Kompany in central defence was painfully obvious.\n\nIghalo clearly had the beating of Otamendi and Eliaquim Mangala, while Touré, playing in a midfield two alongside Fernandinho, had his ego pricked by a couple of dainty touches from José Manuel Jurado.\n\nCity slowly came into the game as the first half wore on, Gomes keeping out efforts from Kevin De Bruyne and Fernandinho, and some of Watford’s early zip had disappeared by the time Allan Nyom was booked for a risible attempt to win a penalty in the 38th minute.\n\nThat shabby moment aside, Nyom embraced the challenge of marking Raheem Sterling with such relish that the City winger was replaced by Jesús Navas after 60 ineffective minutes, while there were times when Agüero looked like he was playing on one leg. The old Agüero burst failed to materialise whenever City tried to pick him out with balls over the top, and when the striker isolated Craig Cathcart on the edge of the Watford area, he was unable to slip past the centre-back and work the ball on to his right foot.\n\nWayne Rooney to rescue for Manchester United against Swansea Read more\n\nWatford were good value for their lead when they went ahead moments after Fernandinho had missed a free header at the other end. Ighalo hassled Mangala into conceding a corner on the left – Pellegrini felt that it should have been a goal-kick – and Watson’s cross towards the near post flicked off Kolarov’s head and past Hart.\n\nPellegrini had to gamble. Mangala was hauled off and Wilfried Bony joined Agüero up front. Even so, the damage would have been irreparable if Capoue had shown more composure when he barrelled through and fired over with only Hart to beat.\n\nThat miss allowed Kolarov to redeem himself by sending in the corner that Touré volleyed past Gomes at the near post, before Agüero sent the travelling fans into ecstasy, expertly heading in Bacary Sagna’s cross.

While Christian Benteke’s latest goal against opponents he cannot stop scoring against entitles Jürgen Klopp to think about a return to the Champions League, Sam Allardyce’s side appear entrenched in 19th position.\n\nWith only Aston Villa in a worse situation, Saturday’s game here between the bottom two threatens to be a dress rehearsal for Championship combat next season but Sunderland have only themselves to blame.\n\nAfter flattering to deceive in the opening half they regressed to all too familiar bad habits during a second period when, without being anywhere near their best, Liverpool’s football might have been from another planet.\n\nEven so, Klopp’s players began in distinctly mortal mode. In an untidy start Sebastián Coates, perhaps momentarily forgetting he was no longer an Anfield defender, gifted possession to Philippe Coutinho. The centre-half watched in alarm as Coutinho played in Roberto Firmino but the forward’s touch was heavier than you would expect of a player who cost £29m, the ball bounced awkwardly and Coates was reprieved.\n\nInjuries to Younès Kaboul and John O’Shea dictated that Wes Brown, very much a forgotten man, returned to the home defence alongside Coates and enjoyed a reasonably quiet re-introduction to first-team life.\n\nAdmittedly it was a worrying moment when Coutinho held off Lee Cattermole before curling a long-range shot wide of the post but, at the other end, Jermain Defoe forced Simon Mignolet to tip another shot over the bar.\n\nIf that was a reasonably routine diversion, Vito Mannone did rather better to fingertip a Firmino shot on to a post after the Brazilian – suddenly looking seriously expensive – switched the ball on to his right foot and sent it swerving towards the top corner.\n\nLiverpool dominated possession but, worryingly for Klopp, were far from in control. In contrast Allardyce would have been temporarily encouraged by the albeit fragile sense that Sunderland were, at long last, beginning to bear a few of the hallmarks traditionally associated with his teams.\n\nSunderland frustrate Liverpool but Klopp unfastens Allardyce’s straitjacket | Alan Smith Read more\n\nShowing off some long-craved organisation and defensive resilience, Sunderland also offered sporadic threats on the break. One of the best such attacking cameos arrived when Fabio Borini aimed to jog a few memories among his former Merseyside employers by curving a shot fractionally the wrong side of a post.\n\nPerhaps noticing Klopp’s technical area frown, Nathaniel Clyne advanced from right back to unleash a cross in Firmino’s direction. If Mannone – once again preferred to Costel Pantilimon in Sunderland’s goal – seemed pleased to palm the resultant header to safety, Allardyce was still assessing the fallout from an enforced reconfiguration of his side in the wake of Jack Rodwell’s latest injury.\n\nDespite Rodwell’s hamstring pull, Sunderland, collectively, looked convalescent at that point but they suffered a relapse only 22 seconds into the new half and were soon en route to a fifth successive defeat.\n\nSurrendering possession near the halfway line prefaced yet more self destruction and, sure enough, Clyne was allowed to dispatch a ball into the box which Adam Lallana rather fortuitously flicked on towards Benteke.\n\nFrom around seven yards out, the centre-forward dinked it beyond Mannone and Allardyce’s game plan was reduced to tatters. The home manager is extremely unlikely to have been impressed by the ease with which Benteke – who has now scored six goals in seven Premier League games against Sunderland for Liverpool and Aston Villa – stole behind Brown and Coates. Patrick van Aanholt, too, should not be exactly delighted with his positioning.\n\nRefusing to abandon hope, Cattermole kept endeavouring to cajole his team-mates forward but, with their final balls invariably disappointing, getting behind Klopp’s defence proved near impossible and Defoe became increasingly anonymous.\n\nA big part of the problem was that, with Emre Can having upped his technically assured midfield game, Liverpool now had their hosts’ measure. Of equal concern to Allardyce was an injury to Coates which left him with a makeshift defence featuring three full-backs.\n\nAlthough Benteke shot straight at Mannone when clean through that backline held firm on a night when Jeremain Lens, on as a substitute, was arguably lucky to be only booked for a nasty tackle on Mamadou Sakho. That challenge prompted animated exchanges between the two benches but, otherwise, there was relatively little for Klopp to get exercised about on a night when he conceded “we were not in wonderland”."}, {"date": "29/12/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32072, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds":

probably a measure of how far Leicester City have come in the past year that they might reflect on a goalless draw against an expensively assembled cast of Premier League all-stars with a tinge of disappointment. Claudio Ranieri’s team could not conjure up the win that would mean finishing the year looking down on everybody else but they matched a side that has won the title in two of the past four seasons and Jamie Vardy could probably be excused on this one occasion that he was unable to take the chance that might have sent them back to the top of the division.\n\nVardy’s first-half miss was incongruous to how the rest of his season has gone but Leicester should not be too distraught when they have reached the midway point in the leading pack, and are denied top spot only by goal difference. They did not always show the adventure seen at other times this season but it was indicative, perhaps, that the last piece of action involved Riyad Mahrez bamboozling Kevin De Bruyne, the most expensive player in the league, with a wonderfully impudent Cruyff turn. Leicester, the success story of 2015, gave the impression they still want to be in our thoughts in 2016, too.\n\nMahrez became increasingly dangerous as the game wore on but here was a night when Manchester City reminded themselves it was possible to keep out the opposition without Vincent Kompany and, for Manuel Pellegrini, that cannot be understated when they had registered only one clean sheet in the previous 13 matches, with a worse goals-against column than Crystal Palace and Stoke City. Pellegrini’s team still look short of their most exhilarating peaks but, defensively, this was a clear improvement when they have been so susceptible recently without their captain. Joe Hart was protected well, for the most part, and in some ways it was a surprise Leicester did not have more faith in themselves to expose those defensive flaws.\n\nWhen Leicester’s ewoks stood up to Manchester City’s Death Star Read more\n\nOne of the joys of Leicester’s rise has been their willingness to take the game to their opponents from the first whistle. Here, though, there was a measure of conservatism, with a new-look 4-1-4-1 system. “Perhaps they did it out of respect for us,” Pellegrini volunteered. “It is the first time I can remember they have used four midfielders and only one attacker.”\n\nRanieri’s team were clearly mindful about how devastating their opponents could be on the counterattack. The high sense of adventure that has been Leicester’s trademark was missing in the opening exchanges and, for the first time in a long time, it was possible as well to detect a few nerves among the crowd. Leicester’s defeat at Liverpool on Boxing Day was their first since September and there was a sense early on, as passes were misplaced and the ball aimed long, that their momentum may have been broken or at least that it was beginning to fray around the edges.\n\nThe old confidence did gradually begin to seep back but Leicester were indebted to Kasper Schmeichel’s goalkeeping during those moments in the first half when the movement and speed of their opponents left them vulnerable. Raheem Sterling had been moved from the wing to take up a more central position. He was an elusive opponent while in the wide positions Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva showed their soft-touch refinement. With Sergio Agüero lurking in dangerous places, that attacking quartet always gave Pellegrini’s team a menacing edge in the opening 45 minutes.\n\nAll the same Leicester still created the two most inviting chances of the first half. The home side took a while to work up a head of steam but suddenly burst into life with a flurry of pressure at the end of that period. Marc Albrighton could not apply the finishing touch after a wonderful left-wing delivery from Christian Fuchs and, shortly afterwards, the ball was at Vardy’s feet in the position where he loves to be, bearing down on goal with the time to draw back his foot and pick his spot. Fernandinho had lost possession in front of his own penalty area and Vardy, played in by Danny Drinkwater, has been so prolific this season it came almost as a jolt that he could not punish that carelessness. His shot flew over the crossbar and the crowd went into half-time wondering how costly that miss might prove.\n\nVardy’s directness and raw pace, coupled with his absolute determination to influence the course of the match, still made him a dangerous player and Leicester began the second half with a new impetus. Drinkwater might not attract the same publicity as Vardy or Mahrez but his intelligent midfield play has been a prominent factor in Leicester’s success and he had another fine game. N’Golo Kanté showed his qualities again and, more than anything, Leicester seemed more intent on examining the capabilities of Nicolás Otamendi and Eliquim Mangala. As it turned out, City’s central defenders looked more assured than at other times this season.\n\nFor Leicester Wes Morgan can reflect on a night when he eventually got the better of Agüero, leading to the Argentinian’s substitution on 63 minutes. He did not look too happy when he came off, convinced that he had been fouled inside the penalty area in the previous attack. That was the second penalty appeal Craig Pawson turned down, having decided that Danny Simpson’s handball did not constitute a spot-kick, but Pellegrini rarely criticises referees and did not want to prolong the argument afterwards."}, {"date": "28/12/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 23714, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [],

I would have been more content if I had been given a chance and not taken it, but I haven’t started a game in the Premier League and, for a young player like me, that’s not what you need.\n\n“It was my decision. The coaches have just found out – I have told them I am going. I think the manager already knew but, the physios and [some of the] coaching staff, I have just let them know and said bye now. The gaffer’s not actually spoken to me and I’ll go in and say goodbye but I think it will be fine. We’ll shake hands and say it didn’t work out. No hard feelings. I had to do it because, for my development, it is crucial I play games. Obviously there are a lot of things I could say that frustrated me. But I got on well with the gaffer and I like him, and it was just one of those that didn’t work out.”\n\nAndy Carroll comes off the bench to help West Ham beat Southampton Read more\n\nPalace’s strikers have not been a regular source of goals this season with Connor Wickham’s penalty at Stoke their only reward. He is currently out injured, along with the hamstrung Dwight Gayle, while Marouane Chamakh lasted only 45 minutes against Swansea. “There were a few reasons [given for me not playing] but I kind of saw through them,” said Bamford. “I was frustrated because there weren’t many strikers scoring. Connor only scored his first goal last week.\n\n“As a striker, it might be short-sighted of me but obviously scoring goals is a striker’s job. If you are not playing and the other strikers are not scoring and you are not getting a chance, obviously I was, like, pulling my hair out. That was a bit frustrating for me. Apart from that, the team has been doing really well so I couldn’t really complain about getting involved sometimes. I’ve learned things so I wouldn’t say it has been a waste of time, but we’ll see what happens next. I know I can fit in at this level.”\n\nBamford, who will not be eligible to play against Palace on Sunday when Chelsea visit, struck this game’s best opportunity straight at Lukasz Fabianski having replaced Chamakh at the interval. Aside from the injuries which have eaten into Pardew’s options, the team will also be without Yohan Cabaye on Sunday after the France international was shown a fifth yellow card of the campaign to incur a one-match suspension.\n\nThese teams have virtually swapped places over the last 12 months and it was Swansea, managerless but rugged where they might usually be expected to scintillate, who departed more satisfied to have chiselled out a draw. They were stretched only in fits and starts, Fabianski making one excellent block down to his left as Brede Hangeland flicked on Cabaye’s free-kick, with Ashley Williams outstanding in marshalling a revamped side. Their own threat was sporadic before the substitute, Gylfi Sigurdsson, forced Wayne Hennessey into a fine save from a free-kick in stoppage time at the end.\n\nThe draw edged Swansea two points clear of the relegation zone and left the caretaker manager, Alan Curtis, relatively satisfied as the search for a new manager continues. “The club are interviewing people, and we can’t just pluck anybody from obscurity, but there is a need to ‘sign’ somebody slightly different,” said Curtis. “We need a different voice. Someone who can tweak it a bit. The players might respond to that, but we have to bring the right person in. If it takes until the summer, so be it.”"}, {"date": "28/12/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39340, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [26]}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [71], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [22, 64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [26], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philipp Wollscheid", "yellows": [23], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [16, 45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marco van Ginkel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jakob Haugaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "One of the games of the season produced one of the goals of the season but, worryingly for Roberto Martínez, the story of Everton’s season continued uninterrupted. The Everton manager blamed the referee, Mark Clattenburg, for Stoke City’s late, late victory at Goodison Park when greater responsibility lay with the defensive vulnerability that has stranded his gifted team in mid-table. The mantle of winless entertainers is taking hold.\n\nEverton twice came from behind to lead 3-2 with 10 minutes remaining, Romelu Lukaku leading the way as usual with his 17th and 18th goals of the campaign, only for a weak punch from Tim Howard and a rash challenge by John Stones to conjure defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nMarko Arnautovic sealed Stoke’s latest eye-catching result with a 90th-minute penalty having been felled by the England international while substitute Joselu levelled following Howard’s error. But it was Xherdan Shaqiri who provided the platform for Mark Hughes’ side with his first two goals in English football, the second a truly exquisite strike.\n\nIt was a breathless game from two teams committed to flowing, attacking football rather than disciplined defending but Martínez’s ire was reserved for the referee, who deliberated long and hard over Stones’ tackle with the defender making slight contact with the ball before tripping Arnautovic.\n\n“I cannot understand how such an experienced referee gives that decision,” said the Everton manager, whose anger was inflated by Clattenburg’s refusal to award a first-half penalty against Erik Pieters for clipping Séamus Coleman. “It was such a wrong call. John got a touch on the ball and you could see there was doubt in the referee’s mind. He didn’t give it straight away, he wanted confirmation from his linesman who is 45 yards away. To give that penalty in the 90th minute you have to be certain.”\n\nHughes, unsurprisingly, saw the penalty award differently but preferred to dwell on Shaqiri’s immense contribution rather than a decision that could have gone either way. The Switzerland international’s first Stoke goal stemmed from a fine team move involving Bojan Krkic and Arnautovic. The former Barcelona forward collected Geoff Cameron’s pass and spun easily away from Stones before slipping the ball inside to Arnautovic, who did likewise as Ramiro Funes Mori came across to cover. Shaqiri read the move perfectly and arrived in front of Brendan Galloway to convert from close range.\n\nAs in their previous home game against Leicester City, Everton equalised swiftly through the formidable Lukaku. The Belgium forward started the move by releasing Ross Barkley into space on the left and continuing his run into the area. Barkley squared to James McCarthy, he sent a disguised pass into Lukaku and, with Pieters playing him onside, the 22-year-old had time and space to beat Jack Butland convincingly. The assist proved to be McCarthy’s last contribution, however, as he aggravated a hip injury on his return to the side and had to be replaced by Tom Cleverley. Cleverley would also create an equaliser before giving way to injury, in his case an achilles problem with potentially serious consequences.\n\nThe leveller brought Goodison Park to life and sparked a dominant spell from Everton, who went close through Galloway but had Gerard Deulofeu booked for an embarrassing dive over Ryan Shawcross’s leg. But Stoke regained the lead courtesy of a glorious goal from Shaqiri. Krkic carved open the Everton defence with a sweeping cross behind Galloway at left-back. The ball was still running away from Shaqiri when he flicked a first-time, nonchalant finish over the head of Howard and inside the far post from the corner of the area.\n\nGoodison, the away section included, fell silent for several seconds in shock and awe at the magnificent touch.\n\n“It was a goal of great technique,” said Hughes. “It was a high-quality goal from a high-quality player. The first goal was just as satisfying because it was a great team goal and Shaq was on the end of a great move.”\n\nEverton reacted impressively. Lukaku levelled for the second time when he controlled Cleverley’s cross-field pass on his chest and maintained his balance long enough to finish under the Stoke keeper. The striker then released Barkley behind Shawcross and Deulofeu was perfectly placed to convert the midfielder’s cross as it flashed across Butland’s goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Stoke’s Xherdan Shaqiri scores a stunning second goal in the rollercoaster match against Everton. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nThere appeared little prospect of the goals ceasing there and so it proved when Stoke scored their third. Howard had spared Steven Naismith with a vital challenge on Arnautovic from the substitute’s back-pass but his weakness at dealing with crosses into his six-yard box cost Everton once more. The US international met Arnautovic’s delivery with a feeble punch that fell to Joselu, and the Stoke substitute produced an emphatic finish from the angle.\n\nEverton’s implosion, however, was not yet complete and Stones’ foul on Arnautovic produced the final drama of a memorable game. “As a team we need to be wiser and we need to learn quickly,” lamented Martínez. “We didn’t manage the game. Yes it is a recurring theme but it is one that shows we are on the right path. We need to protect these leads and make sure we get the return on points that we deserve.”"}, {"date": "28/12/2015", "arena": "Carrow Road", "attendance": 27071, "home_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastien Bassong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [24], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexander Tettey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Hoolahan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [87], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Whittaker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Lafferty", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Micah Richards", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Jordan Veretout", "yellows": [42], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carles Gil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Bunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Lyden", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rudy Gestede", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "If David Cameron really does support Aston Villa, as he sometimes claims, then what a lovely first day on the job this was for the new Norwich City chairman, Ed Balls. The former shadow chancellor watched Jonny Howson and Dieumerci Mbokani score the goals that boosted his team’s chances of ending the campaign triumphantly and cut the fallen Midlands aristocrats further adrift at the bottom of the table. With half the Premier League season gone, Villa have one foot in the Championship.\n\nVilla came to Carrow Road with their condition already critical. Signs of recovery had been detected in Rémi Garde’s previous seven matches in charge – and the run of two matches unbeaten prior to this was epic by the club’s recent standards – but they had still lost ground on the teams above them and urgently needed a victory here, their only one of the campaign so far dating back to August.\n\nNewcastle’s Karl Darlow has debut to forget as West Brom win at last Read more\n\nNorwich began in 17th, the position that Villa dream of reaching. But the visitors could not effect a swing in their favour and this defeat leaves them 11 points below 17th. Good luck finding an opinion poll that gives them any chance of escaping relegation now. Even the shrewdest political spin doctor would struggle to get Villa fans looking on the bright side of their season so far.\n\nGarde tried his best to put on a brave face. “I won’t tell you that I’m sure we’re going to be safe,” the Frenchman said. “But I will be the last one believing it is not impossible. Until we are mathematically gone, I will believe.”\n\nTottenham’s Son Heung-min grabs late winner after Watford red card Read more\n\nHe also said he will do his utmost to entice reinforcements during the January transfer window, but admits that the club’s predicament complicates recruitment. “Of course we are not the most attractive club in the Premier League,” he said. “But I have some ideas of players who hopefully could still believe that we could improve.”\n\nFor this match against Norwich Garde altered his line-up, making three changes to his back four and also rejigging his attack. Alex Neil also tinkered, making four changes to the side beaten at Tottenham Hotspur on Boxing Day.\n\nBoth teams began full of nerves, as evidenced by a rash of wayward passes. Villa were the first to hint at a goal, when the left-back Leandro Bacuna unleashed a 20-yard drive that Declan Rudd had to palm behind for a corner.\n\nVilla remained marginally more tidy than their disjointed hosts and Jordan Ayew brought another save from Rudd when he met a free-kick by Jordan Veretout with a header from 10 yards.\n\nThe largely artless skirmish continued until the 24th minute, when Norwich seized the lead following their first piece of composed play near their opponent’s area. Nathan Redmond exchanged a cute one-two with Robbie Brady, then clipped a cross towards Dieumerci Mbokani near the penalty spot. Bacuna, having abandoned his position on the left, won the aerial duel for the ball but succeeded only in glancing it on to Howson, who took advantage of being free on the left-hand side of the box to volley the ball into the net from 10 yards.\n\nHaving watched his side toil in vain for a really clear opening, Garde was exasperated by the ease with which Villa allowed Norwich to take the lead. “If you look at the goals we’ve conceded previously, they’re all silly goals,” he said.\n\nThe Frenchman would have been even more aghast if Graham Dorrans had increased Norwich’s lead before the break after being allowed to meet a low corner from Redmond, but the midfielder fired his shot wide.\n\nVilla lacked thrust up front and solidity at the back but at least they were not short of spirit. Their persistence might have been rewarded with a penalty early in the second half when Ayew tumbled under a challenge in the box from Alex Tettey, but the referee saw nothing untoward.\n\nNorwich’s play was more scrappy than usual but they looked the more dangerous side on the occasions when they did manage to piece moves together. Howson should have doubled their lead on the hour but sidefooted wide after Brad Guzan spilled a shot from Redmond.\n\nGarde tried to stimulate his side by replacing Sinclair with Adama Traoré with half an hour to play. That was longer than the exciting young Spaniard had been given in previous outings and the hope was that the trickery and acceleration he had shown briefly before would stimulate a late turn around here.\n\nAfter seeing a couple of crosses from Traoré headed away by the impressive Ryan Bennett, Garde decided to throw on a striker who could pose more threat in the air. On came Rudy Gestede with just over 20 minutes to play. Much bluster ensured from the visitors but nothing that stretched the home defence.\n\nThree minutes from time Mbokani topped off a valuable win for Norwich by nodding a cross from Wes Hoolahan into the net. “This has certainly been our biggest win of the season,” said Neil. “Because it takes us to that 20-point mark at halfway and I still think there is more to come from us in the second half of the season. If it does, we’ll be fine.”\n\nAs for Villa, the last time they were relegated Margaret Thatcher was about to begin her third term as prime minister.

Son, though, earned the points and inflicted a first defeat in six on Quique Sánchez Flores’s impressive side.\n\n“The numbers reflect that it is possible,” Pochettino said of Spurs’ title chances. “But the most important thing is to try to win every game and work very hard.\n\nNorwich City’s Dieumerci Mbokani ensures Aston Villa’s gloom deepens Read more\n\n“But to speak about the title? It is more important to keep working hard and show our maturity. The key is to behave in the same way as six months ago when we started. We have to try and keep a good balance.”\n\nIt took a while for things to get going, understandable considering both had only one day’s rest, but the game then fell into a predictable groove. Spurs controlled a larger share of possession but found things difficult against a compact Watford who were happy to counter-attack.\n\nFlores’s team have enjoyed considerable success playing in that manner though it was a little surprising to see Pochettino, a staunch believer in 4-2-3-1, deviate from his favourite system by deploying a three-man defence containing Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Eric Dier. For the most part it worked well and Spurs deserved to be in front even if the opener came from a Craig Cathcart error.\n\nHe was caught in two minds near halfway and, after he took a sloppy touch, Dele Alli intercepted before feeding Lamela. The Argentinian strode forward, Miguel Britos attempted to close the angle but Lamela dispatched a low effort past a stationary Gomes from the edge of the area.\n\nAlli, Harry Kane and Lamela missed from range but the hosts grew in stature as half-time approached and the equaliser arrived four minutes before the break. In such destructive form Ighalo needs only the slightest sniff at goal and typically his trusty sidekick, Troy Deeney, was the provider, heading down a crossfield pass from Almen Abdi. Spurs’ back three had been tight up until that point but Ighalo was too strong for Dier, brushing him off before slipping the ball between his legs and finishing low past Hugo Lloris.\n\nSpurs resumed control of the ball upon the restart and Harry Kane misdirected a header from Kieran Trippier’s cross before tempers boiled over and Watford were reduced to 10. Aké, returning to the side after missing the Boxing Day trip to his parent club, Chelsea, due to the terms of his loan, was late and high on Lamela near halfway and Anthony Taylor did not hesitate in brandishing his red card.\n\nA couple of minutes earlier Flores was urging his players to calm down following a flurry of tasty but fair challenges. There could, however, be few complaints over the dismissal. “He’s a very, very fair player and always plays in a good way,”the Watford manager said. “He went for the ball, it’s football and these things happen.”\n\nThe dismissal gave Tottenham plenty of time to search for a winner and while they monopolised the ball, Watford went close to stealing a goal by forcing a succession of late corners, including one from Ben Watson that almost crept over the line.\n\nBut Spurs built up a final head of steam and after Gomes punched clear Trippier’s initial cross, a second fell to Son at the near post and he back-heeled the ball past Gomes."}, {"date": "28/12/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 26313, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz

"This time, Arsenal did make it to the summit of the Premier League. The lead might not last beyond Tuesday night, when Leicester City would return to the top with a home win over Manchester City but, for 24 hours at least, Arsène Wenger and his players can savour the view.\n\nThey had fluffed their lines in the 4-0 Boxing Day drubbing at Southampton but there was reassurance here against a Bournemouth team that looked tidy enough but lacked ruthlessness at both ends. Arsenal have not now lost to a newly promoted team in 22 matches and once Gabriel had punished slack marking from a 28th-minute Mesut Özil corner to score his first Arsenal goal since joining them in January, the die was cast.\n\nWenger’s team had too much savvy and at a relatively subdued Emirates Stadium, where the home fans were clearly expecting victory, they got the job done. They might even have won by more because they created the chances, with Per Mertesacker blowing the best of them from point-blank range.\n\nEddie Howe’s team had decent spells of possession but they could not create anything of clearcut note and Petr Cech reached his heavily signposted milestone as the Premier League’s clean-sheet king without needing to make a serious save. Cech has now surpassed David James’ record of 169 shut-outs.\n\nArsenal v Bournemouth, West Ham v Southampton: Premier League clockwatch – as it happened Read more\n\nIt was Özil who called the tune. The corner for Gabriel’s goal represented his 16th assist of the Premier League season, while he scored the second himself with an ice-cool finish, following Olivier Giroud’s lovely flick. It was his fifth goal of the campaign and Wenger said that the numbers added up to make Özil not only the “complete player”‚ but one who deserved to be compared to the Arsenal great Dennis Bergkamp.\n\n“Bergkamp was more of a goalscorer than him and Mesut was more of an assists man but now he becomes more of a goalscorer, so they really are comparable,” Wenger said.\n\nArsenal had started nervously, with Wenger admitting that the Southampton debacle was prominent in the thoughts of his players. Bournemouth looked comfortable.\n\nYet they switched off for Özil’s corner to present Gabriel with the breakthrough and, in a heartbeat, the tone of the occasion changed.\n\nPreviously, there had been a few grumbles from the home support; now, they could relax. Gabriel had given Charlie Daniels the slip and his header arrowed into the top corner.\n\nWenger marvelled at the zip and timing of Özil’s passes. He described him as “the song leader with the right tone”, but, from Bournemouth’s point of view, there was a savage quality to his performance.\n\nBefore Gabriel’s goal, Özil had almost teed up Theo Walcott twice and after that, he set about turning the screw. There were two more killer passes for Walcott before the end of the first half, with the forward twice denied by Artur Boruc and there was also his threat from corners, which was revealed as Bournemouth’s achilles heel.\n\nHowe’s team failed to cope with Gabriel’s runs and Arsenal were inches from extending their lead in the 34th minute. Gabriel got the run on his markers once more from an Özil corner and his flicked header beat Boruc only to rebound off the far post.\n\nMertesacker was on hand with the goal at his mercy but the ball flew back at him with too much speed and he could not adjust in time. It seemed to hit him on the head, rather than him making a conscious attempt at the ball and it squirmed the wrong side of the post.\n\nRemarkably, there were three more Özil corners before the interval that sparked panic in Bournemouth’s defensive ranks and, from the third, after another Gabriel flick-on, Aaron Ramsey almost got in at the far post.\n\nGabriel was one of four Arsenal changes from the Southampton game, coming in for Laurent Koscielny and he could reflect on a fine individual performance. Calum Chambers, brought in for a defensive midfield role, was also polished.\n\nHowe had changed only two players from the 0-0 draw at home to Crystal Palace on Boxing Day and his team demonstrated their comfort on the ball. But they struggled for cutting edge and it was here that Özil made the difference.\n\nHis goal in the 63rd minute was a beauty, the Germany international playing a couple of one-twos on his way into the area for the one-on-one with Boruc. The second was with Giroud and the France striker’s return flick took out three Bournemouth defenders.\n\nÖzil barely had to break stride, although he gives the impression that he never does so anyway and, after one touch, he opened up his body to shoot low past Boruc. And that was pretty much that. Arsenal threatened the third through Walcott, Giroud and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain but they had made their statement."}, {"date": "28/12/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75275, "home_team":

Their imperfections are numerous but United did at least show in spells they can remove the tactical straightjacket and start to play the old way, with width and penetration, and the crowd seemed to appreciate what they were watching.\n\nThe opening 45 minutes was their best for some time and it was their willingness to take a few risks, something their supporters will always tolerate, that explained, in part, why they lost their structure during the later exchanges.\n\nA better side than Chelsea might have taken advantage in a slightly dishevelled second half and the match has to be put in the context that the team Guus Hiddink has just inherited are drifting through the most implausible title defence in memory, fifth from bottom in the league but too haughty to think of themselves in genuine relegation danger, while so far adrift they have nothing left to chase.\n\nAll the same it was an improvement from Van Gaal’s team. They have failed to score in 11 of their 26 league fixtures since April and there are all sorts of galling statistics attached to Van Gaal reign, featuring a lower win ratio than David Moyes’ time in charge. The bottom line, however, is that this did not seem a performance that would end in the manager being fired or choosing to sever ties himself.\n\n“There is no reason to sack me,” Van Gaal said afterwards, sounding newly emboldened.\n\nThe Dutchman had talked of his team not “daring to play” when they lost at Stoke City on Boxing Day but there was nothing timid about the shot Juan Mata cracked against Thibaut Courtois’s crossbar in the opening exchanges and the same again, on 17 minutes, when Anthony Martial’s low drive struck a post, flashed across the goalmouth and spun out of play. United were indebted to David de Gea at times but nobody could accuse them of plodding, sideways football. That felt like a start given the allegation that has circled them of repetitive dreariness.\n\nEqually it could conceivably have become another ordeal for the team that is now five points off the top four. Chelsea will reflect on the occasions when David de Gea’s goalkeeping saved his team and, more than anything, the counter-attacking move that finished with Nemanja Matic galloping clear for the game’s outstanding chance.\n\nMatic might wake in a cold sweat when he thinks about what happened next. De Gea is a formidable goalkeeper to beat but the Chelsea player made a terrible hash of his shot, putting the ball into the crowd when he had the time and space to pick his spot.\n\nPlaying on the break, Chelsea’s attack looked light in the absence of the suspended Diego Costa, if only because it meant they did not have a natural striker for the role. Eden Hazard’s tendency was to roam to wide positions and in the first half, lacking anyone to hold up the ball, they were pinned back for long spells. Ashley Young and Matteo Darmian had the licence to advance from United’s full-back positions. Martial’s directness and quick feet made him a difficult opponent and United generally look a more rounded team when Marouane Fellaini is not in the starting line-up.\n\nThe temptation to aim the ball high was removed and United began the game with the kind of quick tempo that has become a rarity under Van Gaal.\n\nThe mood might have been entirely different if De Gea had not turned John Terry’s header over the crossbar from an early corner but Chelsea did not have the impetus that is usually expected of them on these occasions. The champions did improve after the interval and, shortly before the Matic miss, there was a wonderful double save from De Gea to keep out Pedro’s shot and then turn away the follow-up effort from César Azpilicueta.\n\nCourtois’s reflexes to keep out Anders Herrera at the other end showed there is still competition to be recognised as the best goalkeeper in the league and Van Gaal was left to rue Wayne Rooney’s late miss and a couple of reasonable penalty claims. It was a scrappy finish, with both teams demonstrating why they are struggling, and Rooney leaving the imprints of his studs on Oscar’s leg.\n\nUltimately, though, Chelsea will be happier, having gone three matches unbeaten in the league for the first time this season. Van Gaal will have heard the boos at the end but there was sympathetic applause elsewhere in the ground and little sense that the tall man making his way along the touchline would not be back next

to leave severe and lasting damage on West Ham United and the boos were ringing out around Upton Park Slaven Bilic could have been forgiven if he had retreated into his shell. The visitors, buzzing after thrashing Arsenal on Boxing Day, created enough chances to win several matches and Ronald Koeman cannot have imagined that he would end up sighing that “football is 90 or 95 minutes” after the quality of his team’s football in the first half.\n\nWest Ham, however, showed spirit and togetherness to withstand Southampton’s onslaught before emerging with renewed purpose after the break to win for the first time in nine matches and overcome an injury list that meant they were without half a team. For all the good fortune of Michail Antonio’s bizarre equaliser, Bilic made positive tactical alterations at half-time and one of them was the introduction of Andy Carroll, who headed in the decisive goal on his return from a groin strain.\n\nCarroll has his faults but he also scored the winner in West Ham’s previous victory, the 2-1 win over Chelsea on 24 October, and Southampton struggled to deal with his threat in the air. “We lost more balls and we did more mistakes,” Koeman said. “That’s the reason we lost today.”\n\nBilic, who expects Dimitri Payet to return for the visit of Liverpool on Saturday, admitted that his team could not have played much worse in the first half and, taking Southampton’s long spells of superiority into account, it is slightly incongruous that West Ham are up to seventh, even though they are unbeaten in six matches now.\n\nCarl Jenkinson, deputising for Aaron Cresswell at left-back, was an obvious weak link in an unfamiliar position and the manner of Southampton’s goal in the 13th minute was troubling for Bilic, given how straightforward it was for Shane Long to win a header in front of James Collins, race on to Steven Davis’s pass and slide a low centre into the six-yard box. Dusan Tadic attacked it and his touch went in off Jenkinson.\n\nWest Ham were overrun in midfield, simple passes went astray and they struggled to get out of their half after falling behind, let alone threaten the Southampton goal. The visitors had 10 shots in the first half.\n\nThere were mitigating circumstances for West Ham, who were also missing Victor Moses, Winston Reid and Diafra Sakho, yet Southampton failed to kill the game off. Carroll and Manuel Lanzini replaced Mauro Zarate and Alex Song, while Jenkinson was more comfortable after switching positions with James Tomkins.\n\nThe changes led to an improvement and West Ham’s persistence was rewarded when they equalised with one of the strangest goals Upton Park has seen.\n\nAntonio struggled to explain how he scored his first West Ham goal after he took advantage of slack defending from Cuco Martina, fell over a risky challenge from José Fonte in the area and then found himself celebrating when Victor Wanyama’s attempted clearance deflected off his head and looped over Maarten Stekelenburg in the 69th minute.\n\nTen minutes later, Antonio then played a part in West Ham’s winner, meeting Enner Valencia’s cross with a header that crashed off the bar and rebounded to Carroll, who nodded the ball past Stekelenburg."}, {"date": "26/12/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27426, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland",

Manchester United manager. The grim reaper appeared for one of David Moyes’s matches and Van Gaal is straying into similar territory. His team were abject for long spells and the last time they went so long without a victory goes back to an eight-match sequence from December 1989 to January 1990, in the days when a banner appeared at Old Trafford calling time on the pre-knighted Alex Ferguson. “Tara Fergie,” it read. “Three years of excuses and we’re still crap.”\n\nAt the risk of being cruel, Van Gaal has managed the same in 18 months, with no apparent sign he is any nearer to everything clicking. This was their fourth successive defeat in a run of seven games without a victory and it finished with him floating the idea he may yet resign. A plodding team have managed 14 goals in 16 matches and it cannot be written off as a blip when, going back to April, they have won only 14 of their last 34 games.\n\nWhile Bojan Krkic, Marko Arnautovic and Xherdan Shaqiri led their opponents a merry dance, United aimed for Marouane Fellani, misplaced passes, lacked clarity and in the worst moments looked like they would rather be somewhere else. “We did not dare to play football,” Van Gaal said, a sentence that goes against everything that should happen when the players pull on the club’s colours.\n\nThe indignities now include Stoke’s supporters chanting “boring, boring” when Van Gaal’s team had the ball. United’s manager could not confirm he would still be in charge for Monday’s game against Chelsea and perhaps the most startling part is that their latest ordeal ought to have been an occasion when his players put on a united front. On the contrary, if you came here looking for signs that they are as puzzled by Van Gaal as everyone else, there were plenty of them. Their body language was appalling during those first-half moments when the damage was inflicted.\n\nStoke have now beaten three out of England’s four Champions League qualifiers here this season and it would be a tremendous pity if, among all the scrutiny of Van Gaal, that record was overlooked. They attacked with great flair during the first half, sensing their opponents were there for the taking, and when they were put under sustained pressure we saw the old doggedness after the break, defending with great determination while still looking dangerous on the counterattack. Mark Hughes described them as “brave and confident” – all the things that United were not. “It would have taken a very good team to stay with us,” the Stoke manager added.\n\nLouis van Gaal criticises players at Stoke and attacks headline ‘rubbish’ Read more\n\nVan Gaal can take a glimmer of encouragement from his team’s improvement after the interval but he would be wrong to dwell it on too much and it was strange to hear him talking of a team that had lost its nerve on an afternoon when he dropped his captain. Wayne Rooney might not be the player he was but, for all his flaws, he does not lack heart or the appetite to get on the ball.\n\nAs it was, United were lucky Arnautovic, having scored a beauty, could not make it 3-0 after he ran clear on 36 minutes and a traumatic first half for Van Gaal was summed up by Daley Blind trying a cross from the left, scuffing it out of play and ending up on his backside. Blind had terrible problems trying to subdue Shaqiri. Ashley Young’s inexperience as a full-back was shown up and Juan Mata rarely came out of a shell of his own making.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal looks on as behind a Stoke fan wearing a José Mourinho mask poses with a P45 banner. Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters\n\nAs for Memphis Depay, his ordeal lasted only 45 minutes, featuring the ignominious moment when he attempted a back-header to David de Gea, made a pig’s ear of it and cost his team the opening goal. Krkic was left with virtually an open goal after Glen Johnson picked out his run and the days have gone when United went by the mantra that they always had to respond forcefully once they went behind.\n\nSeven minutes later, Young’s hare-brained handball gave Krkic the chance to try to curl a free-kick around the defensive wall. The ball came back off the cluster of bodies and what happened next from Arnautovic epitomised Stoke’s confidence. His first touch set up the shooting opportunity and the second was lashed past De Gea with power and precision, swerving in from more than 20 yards.\n\nRooney came on at half-time for Depay and there was at least a measure of urgency to United’s second-half play. Their best chance came after 64 minutes but Jack Butland has been outstanding for Stoke this season and spared his team with a sprawling save to keep out Fellaini’s shot. It was fine goalkeeping but Fellaini, six yards out, should have made a much better contact from Rooney’s cross. Butland also turned away later efforts from Anthony Martial and Mata but it was not the onslaught that might have been anticipated.\n\nThe old United are no more and the lingering memory of Martial’s performance will be his dive to try to conjure up a first-half penalty. “That’s just embarrassing,” the home crowd chanted. Krkic did the same in the second half but the difference was that Stoke’s tormentor-in-chief could get the better of his opponents in a legitimate way, too. For Van Gaal, it was a long walk down the touchline to pass the away end."}, {"date": "26/12/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 38193, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name":

Villa, their fifth successive Premier League draw.\n\nHiddink gets taste of his Chelsea task after Oscar blows late penalty against Watford Read more\n\nThe centre-back, who had signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract on Thursday, was steadfast in defence as Aston Villa pressed for a winner after Jordan Ayew had equalised from the penalty spot in the 62nd minute. Collins denied Villa a possible winner when he cleared a header by Alan Hutton off the line.\n\nAfterwards Bilic said of Collins, who rejoined West Ham from Villa in 2012: “He was again outstanding. He is in good form. It’s not just today, it’s ever since I came here. At the beginning he didn’t play a lot, but every time he’s played he is not only reliable, he has been magnificent. It’s great to have him. We decided to offer him a new contract way before and he deserves it.\n\n“He’s a good player and I watch him in training every day and he’s good on the ball. It’s not just kicking the ball around. His presence is a very dominant one. I wouldn’t call those players old-fashioned, he’s just a really good centre-half.”\n\nBilic’s team had taken the lead on the stroke of half-time when Aaron Cresswell was given time and space to unleash a rasping 20-yard drive, which flew low past Brad Guzan and the manager was unhappy with the referee, Mike Dean, at his decision to award Villa their when Rudy Gestede went down under a challenge by Angelo Ogbonna. He also felt West Ham should have had two penalties for handballs against Leandro Bacuna and Ashley Westwood.\n\n“I’m West Ham manager and I’m not objective, but I’m trying to be,” said Bilic. “When it happened I saw Ogbonna in front of Gestede and Gestede came in front not because he was quicker, but because he pulled his shirt. It was long enough for the referee to notice.\n\n“After that we had a couple of situations with handballs which, considering that penalty, these ones should have been given to us.”\n\nFor Villa, who have not produced a league victory since the opening day of the season when they beat Bournemouth 1-0 away, this result did little to ease their plight after a club record run of 17 league games without a win. They lie bottom, nine points behind Norwich City who they play at Carrow Road on Monday.\n\nRémi Garde said: “When you look at the game I think we deserved more points, but West Ham defended very well. We knew that because they’d had three clean sheets in a row.\n\n“The feeling is frustration more than anything else, because when you play like we played we gave 100% and deserved more than that.”\n\nThe Villa manager added: “If you add the last 45 minutes at Newcastle it’s now a long time we’ve played good football without being rewarded with goals. It’s a little bit frustrating, but the way we put them under pressure was a very nice feeling. I’m disappointed for the players.”"}, {"date": "26/12/2015", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11218, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [36], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}], "subs": [{"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tokelo Rantie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun MacDonald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yann Kermorgant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eunan O'Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}], "subs": [{"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Chamakh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Dymond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Alan Pardew arrived on the south coast smiling and will have left with the same expression after stretching Palace’s unbeaten run to five matches, but he still found it tough to pin down Eddie Howe. Pardew, who twice tried to sign the Bournemouth manager as a player, sorely missed the added pizzazz of the winger Yannick Bolasie who missed the trip with a back injury.\n\nPalace’s commanding defensive pairing of Damien Delaney and Scott Dann rarely looked unnerved and only a deflected shot from Junior Stanislas and a header from Matt Ritchie worried the visiting goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey.\n\n“My back four were terrific – we had to lean on them a little bit. They were so resilient, so organised that back four,” said Pardew, lauding his players another near perfect away display. Palace had recorded wins on the road at Chelsea, Liverpool and Stoke this season but never really looked like racking up another on the south coast, despite evidently shaking off any Christmas hangovers with an assured and strong display.\n\nThe draw means Palace can still very much dream of playing European football next year after Manchester United’s defeat at home to Stoke moved them up to fifth.\n\nSwansea City end losing run after Ki Sung-yeung’s goal beats West Brom Read more\n\nGlenn Murray, who scored 44 goals for Palace across a four-year spell at the club and was serenaded by the away supporters throughout, was guilty of missing Bournemouth’s best chance. The striker was on the receiving end of a few cuddles during the pre-match handshakes and looked like a man who did not want to score when his powder-puff effort failed to trouble Hennessey, following a driving run from the midfielder Dan Gosling.\n\nHe was arguably at fault for gifting Palace one of their better openings, too, losing possession to the Palace captain, Delaney, who brilliantly picked out Fraizer Campbell with a diagonal ball, but his curling effort failed to test Artur Boruc.\n\nCampbell, making only his second league start of the season, had Boruc back-pedalling after nine minutes when his strike deflected off Adam Smith and narrowly over the frame of the hosts’ goal.\n\nPalace were in the mood and Bournemouth, after three wins on the bounce, were more careless than usual. Pardew, who is in early talks over a new contract at Selhurst Park, patrolled the touchline with his pen and paper, kicking every ball. He started the game giving the thumbs up to home fans before watching his side slowly lose their grip. First, he lambasted the winger Wilfried Zaha for failing to track Stanislas.\n\nJoel Ward, who made 16 appearances for Bournemouth while on loan, struggled to contain Stanislas and allowed the winger to float the ball towards Murray, only for the Scotland international Ritchie, arriving late into the box, to nod his header wide of Hennessey’s goal.\n\nThe meeting of two of the Premier League’s in-form teams – second and fourth in the form table – was never easy on the eye and there was certainly no love lost between the two sides here. The referee, Michael Oliver, booked the Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter for a late, crunching challenge on Zaha. Delaney did his best to calm Zaha while Arter did not return for the second half.\n\n“Wilf doesn’t like getting tackled,” said Pardew. “He is a wide player – none of them do. Every wide player I have worked with – they never like it.”\n\nHowe, though, will take great solace in silencing Palace’s wide men, given that a trip to the Emirates Stadium is up next. “It is a sign we have grown as a side and have improved,” said Howe. “We are harder to beat now and that is six games unbeaten now.”\n\nWhile Pardew threw on Yohan Cabaye, the club’s £10m record signing, the Bournemouth manager, who is close to sealing a loan move for the Roma forward Juan Iturbe, turned to the South Africa striker Tokelo Rantie, who has not scored since October last year, but he, too, failed to trouble the Palace defence.\n\n“I had to bring on Cabaye to try to get some of the ball,” said Pardew. “In the last six minutes I think it showed – Bournemouth couldn’t raise a leg last six minutes, probably our best period of the game.”"}, {"date": "26/12/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41630, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois",

will better understand the scale of the task he has taken on at Chelsea. This was an occasion to sum up the champions’ slapdash campaign, a game that might have been claimed early only to be surrendered as Watford exposed all the frailties that had undermined the last few months of José Mourinho’s tenure. In the context of a deficit recovered against a team on the fringe of the Champions League places, and grasping for positives, it did at least offer flashes of the character the home support deemed to have been so absent of late.\n\nJordan Ayew secures point against West Ham but Aston Villa stay adrift Read more\n\nYet, by the end, it was the sense of pantomime which rather lingered with the contest’s comical moment delivered at Chelsea’s expense. There were 11 minutes still to play, the home side relieved by Diego Costa’s second goal of the afternoon which had drawn them level, when Valon Behrami upended Eden Hazard, substitutes both, to earn the hosts a penalty. The non-award of spot-kicks had become one of Mourinho’s regular gripes over the latter days of his stewardship, with this a second in successive games since the axe fell. But, given everything that has gone before, the locals should have known better than to sense success.\n\nUp strode Oscar, staggering in his runup to put off Heurelho Gomes, only to slip as he struck the ball and sky the effort high into the Matthew Harding stand. “In this weather he shouldn’t have put slicks on,” offered Hiddink. “He should have used normal tyres and put it away.” The club’s principal shirt sponsors might have something to say on that front but the miss checked the optimism, the sense of anticlimax exacerbated by Costa’s lunge at Craig Cathcart which earned him a fifth yellow card of the season. The Spain forward had looked more like his old self here, taking his goals impressively, but will now be absent through suspension at Manchester United on Monday. Chelsea’s timing has been abysmal all year.\n\nIn truth, and as Hiddink later suggested, Watford had merited reward from their trip to west London even if a glance at the league table made their celebrations of a draw feel rather incongruous. So aggressive had they proved up to the interval, with Étienne Capoue and Ben Watson such an energetic central midfield pairing behind a potent strike force, that Hiddink had opted to withdraw Cesc Fàbregas at the break craving better balance to his own lineup. The Spaniard, while no longer booed, had been peripheral in a half which might have been lifted straight out of October’s capitulations to Southampton and Liverpool.\n\nThe home side, while rarely fluent, chiselled out a lead as Willian’s corner was nodded back towards the clutter in the six-yard box by John Terry for Costa to spin and crunch a fine volley into the net from close range. In previous seasons that might have been the prelude for a cricket score, particularly against opponents who had been competing in the Championship a few months ago. But there is too much fragility in this lineup at present to be masked by a one-goal advantage, with Watson’s corner eventually handled by Nemanja Matic, waving his left arm needlessly to invite disaster, allowing Troy Deeney to score an equaliser from the spot.\n\nA deflection thrust the visitors ahead.Odion Ighalo was permitted too much space and spat away a shot which flicked off Gary Cahill’s instep and looped beyond a wrong-footed Thibaut Courtois, the Nigerian registering for a fifth top-flight game in succession.\n\nChelsea could bemoan that familiar ill-fortune with the spin of the loose ball, though their goalkeeper and Terry had both been forced into smart blocks to deny Capoue moments earlier. “But it was important, given the recent past, the team reacted at that point against a very well-organised opponent,” said Hiddink. “They did that, and showed their ambition.”\n\nWillian’s sumptuous diagonal pass, perfectly placed and weighted to cut out the entire Watford backline, duly offered a route back, with Costa darting between Allan Nyom and Cathcart to collect. His first touch created an angle and drew out Gomes, with his second steering the ball back across the goalkeeper and into the far corner for a first brace in 343 days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Diego Costa celebrates after scoring his second goal. Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA\n\n“He focused on the things he’s good at, and where he is dangerous,” said the interim manager. “He’s not wasting extra energy where he shouldn’t, and he did that today. Losing him at United is a set-back, of course, and we have 48 hours to solve that problem.”\n\nAt least they travel to Old Trafford in the knowledge it will be their embattled hosts, rather than the faded champions, who are under the acutest pressure on Monday.\n\nWatching from the stands as Sunderland were put to the sword here the previous week was one thing for Hiddink, but this was more reflective of everything Chelsea have been of late, even if it did offer hints at what they could yet become. It says everything that, once Quique Sánchez Flores’s initial elation dies down, it will be Watford who feel they might have missed out."}, {"date": "26/12/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance":

that troubled him so much as Leicester City’s inability to enjoy life at the summit. These are days to savour, according to the experienced Italian, but it was inhibited league leaders who slipped up at Anfield.\n\nChristian Benteke emerged from the bench to give Liverpool a first win in five matches and condemn Leicester to a first league defeat since 26 September. A clean sheet against a team that had previously scored in every game this season, with Dejan Lovren excelling on his return from injury in a defence where resilience has recently gone awol, may prove just as important to Jürgen Klopp. For Ranieri, however, there was bewilderment at the passive, subdued display that enabled Liverpool to dominate.\n\nLeicester roused themselves only after Benteke’s sixth goal of the season – it reflects badly on Liverpool that the struggling striker is now their leading goalscorer – and, with Manchester City to come on Tuesday, this was a bad time to suggest resources are stretched by the demanding festive schedule. “Sooner or later we have to lose and it’s OK,” said the Leicester manager. “Liverpool deserved to win but we only started to play when we fell behind and I don’t know why. We were too nervous and anxious before that. I don’t know why. It is important we recover now mentally but we shouldn’t lose confidence.”\n\nManchester City kill off Sunderland and make short work of the task Read more\n\nThe visitors’ approach would not have surprised Klopp but that did not simplify the task confronting Liverpool. Leicester sat deep, absorbed almost constant pressure and struck with pace and aggression on the counterattack, as had been the case throughout their remarkable rise to the Premier League summit. They were content to let Liverpool dominate possession but with Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez blunted on the break – both were suffering from a fever, according to Ranieri – it was a calculated risk minus an outlet.\n\nKasper Schmeichel was the busier goalkeeper although Simon Mignolet made the finest save of the first half when Mahrez exchanged passes with the livewire N’Golo Kanté and forced the Liverpool keeper to tip over a goal-bound drive from the edge of the box.\n\nSchmeichel also survived unscathed for over an hour thanks to Liverpool’s failure to hit the target when given time and space in front of goal. Philippe Coutinho curled two decent chances wide, the second a clear opportunity from Origi’s cut-back, and Adam Lallana found the side-netting when put through by Jordan Henderson’s long pass, an option he appeared under instruction to take throughout. Injury to the impressive Divock Origi did not help Liverpool’s momentum either.\n\nKlopp had spoken to Benteke about the faltering start to his Anfield career, and what was required to correct it, having dropped the £32.5m summer signing against Watford last weekend and introduced the inexperienced Origi ahead of him when Martin Skrtel limped off with a hamstring injury. The heart-to-heart did not result in a different approach against the league leaders. Origi was preferred once more and the 20-year-old’s work-rate and movement caused Leicester frequent problems on only his third Premier League start. He too succumbed to a hamstring problem shortly before the interval, however, but his misfortune offered a route back into favour for Benteke.\n\nThe first time Leicester’s defence lost concentration amid the Liverpool pressure, they were punished ruthlessly. Roberto Firmino was again largely anonymous but, having combined with Emre Can, floated an inviting cross towards the penalty spot where Benteke lurked unmarked. The substitute steered a fine half-volley into Schmeichel’s bottom left corner at full stretch.\n\nKlopp said: “Benteke did really good in the last week in training but we decided on this line-up because we needed the speed of Origi. Christian is fast but we needed Divock’s movement behind the lines. It was not easy for Christian to come in for the first 10 minutes but in the second half he did much better and fought for the team; then he made this goal perfectly.We have to see if he can come in regularly now – we hope so.”\n\nOnly when behind did Leicester display the necessary intent. Mignolet saved from Nathan Dyer when the substitute connected with Christian Fuchs’ cross towards the near post; Huth almost capitalised on Leonardo Ulloa’s long throw into the six yard box; and Andy King volleyed another Ulloa throw goalwards only for Can to deflect over.\n\nAt the opposite end Coutinho went close from distance and Henderson squandered a glorious opening when played through by Firmino. Leicester besieged the home box in the final moments only to find Lovren in commanding form. Benteke missed an open goal – hitting Wes Morgan instead – when allowed to run through on goal despite being offside with Schmeichel stranded in the Liverpool half having ventured forward for a Leicester corner. Mercifully for the former Aston Villa man, his mantle as the match-winner was confirmed moments later."}, {"date": "26/12/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54523, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Silva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [4], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [12], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [22], "missed_pens": [69], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Sergio Agüero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabian Delph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gael Clichy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [36], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastián Coates", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yann M'Vila", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [59], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeremain Lens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ola Toivonen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Duncan Watmore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "On such occasions, Manchester City have no need for Pep Guardiola. And when Sunderland are so abject, it is tempting to wonder if even the most coveted manager in Europe could save them. While Sam Allardyce was parachuted in as a relegation firefighter, he now seems armed only with a glass of water as he confronts a blazing inferno.\n\nFor the second successive week, Sunderland were beaten by the time latecomers took their seats. They have become ideal opposition for those in need of a win, whether a bedraggled Chelsea last Saturday or a besieged Manuel Pellegrini. The Chilean’s side had lost three of their previous five league games yet they remain formidable opponents on their own turf. This was a 10th win in 11 home games, and they have plundered 38 goals in that time.\n\nFew were simpler than these four. Sunderland eased City’s passage to victory although with Kevin De Bruyne in this form, they needed little assistance. The Belgian scored one and made two more. Midway through his first campaign in Manchester, his tally stands at 10 goals and as many assists. “That is why we bought Kevin,” said Pellegrini after watching his £54m purchase. The Chilean can be grateful for his potency. The spectre of Guardiola looms large over Pellegrini but he is not the most beleaguered manager in Manchester right now.\n\nSuch problems as he encountered were caused by a different sort of leader. Vincent Kompany had missed City’s previous eight games but his return spanned nine second-half minutes before he hobbled off with yet another calf injury. “It was not the best news,” said Pellegrini, showing a fine line in understatement. The manager insisted he had not rushed the captain’s comeback but Kompany will undergo a scan on Sunday.\n\nAllardyce had altogether different defensive troubles. He changed goalkeepers, bringing in Vito Mannone. The Italian has played twice this season and conceded four to City in each game. Allardyce switched the back five he abandoned midway through the first half at Chelsea for a four-man defence. It was no more successful. They were two goals behind after 13 minutes at Stamford Bridge and three adrift after 22 at the Etihad Stadium.\n\n“It is hard to think what my best team is,” Allardyce lamented. “They were three goals we could have done a lot better with, particularly the first and third.” Sandwiching a 20-yard drive by Yaya Touré, they bore distinct similarities to each other with De Bruyne serving as City’s creator in chief. Each was a header from the Belgian’s right-wing centres and was aided by dreadful defending. For the opener, Raheem Sterling outjumped Billy Jones, who is five inches taller. Wilfried Bony then leapt above John O’Shea to meet De Bruyne’s free kick.\n\nThe Ivorian nevertheless produced another rather typical, decidedly mixed performance, notable thereafter for his profligacy. He skied a penalty after Sebastián Coates fouled the ever influential David Silva. Aggrieved to be omitted for a semi-fit Sergio Agüero at Arsenal last Monday, Bony may find himself back on the bench at Leicester on Tuesday. The Argentinian was not required.\n\nSupplier turned scorer when De Bruyne added City’s fourth, even if his initial intention was to record a hat-trick of assists. He tried to find Bony but the hapless Jones slid in and only succeeding in redirecting the ball back to De Bruyne, who beat Mannone.\n\nManchester City unveil new club crest before home game against Sunderland Read more\n\n“Until we start getting better defensively we are going to struggle,” added Allardyce. “That is our big problem.” He had made six changes and suggested further, more drastic alterations will follow when he can start trading. “Everyone has had a chance now and they have not done as well as they should,” he said. “Now it is my time to make some big decisions ahead of the January window.”\n\nAn August addition had reduced the deficit for Sunderland but Fabio Borini is becoming a specialist in consolation goals. He had scored one at Chelsea and recorded another here. City still have not kept a clean sheet in a game Kompany has not started this campaign.\n\n“If you tell me now we are going to win all the games 4-1 here, I don’t have any problem,” said Pellegrini. Should City’s fears about Kompany be confirmed, such attacking elan may be required.\n\nManchester City revealed their new club crest, featuring a traditional sailing ship above three stripes, indicating the city’s three rivers, and a red Lancashire rose.

a day when the Welsh club picked up only their second victory in 14 league matches to climb out of the bottom three and lift some of the gloom that had descended on these parts.\n\nBournemouth and Crystal Palace share spoils after Matt Ritchie miss Read more\n\nA long overdue first goal of the season from Ki Sung-yueng provided the defining moment in a desperately poor game that felt more like an end-of-season relegation scrap at times. Swansea were hanging on come the end and the raucous celebrations that greeted the final whistle spoke volumes for the relief that this much-needed win delivered.\n\nThese days it is all about results not performances for Swansea, and a rare home triumph – the first since Manchester United were defeated here at the end of August when the mood at the club was full of optimism and Garry Monk was being spoken about as a future England coach – should buy their chairman, Huw Jenkins, a bit more time in his protracted search for a new manager.\n\nWhile there was no shortage of effort from the Swansea players, in particular the indefatigable Leon Britton who received a standing ovation when he was substituted in injury-time, the home team never looked comfortable and could count themselves fortunate that Roger East, the referee, turned a blind eye to what looked like a nailed on West Brom penalty in the first half.\n\nPerhaps that was the break that Swansea so badly needed to get them out of their rut. “I think we can play better, but I think we showed a different side to our game today,” said Alan Curtis, who has now picked up four points from his three games in temporary charge. “We said before the game that as much as we want to maintain our style, we have to find a way to win as well. We were under the cosh, sometimes it wasn’t pretty, a little bit un-Swansea like. But we showed enough to get us over the line and pick up three points.”\n\nAs for Albion, they are now only two points above Swansea after failing to win any of their last five league games and the lack of goals must be a concern.\n\nTony Pulis felt aggrieved that his team had been denied what he described as two clear penalties. Albion’s manager certainly had a strong case with the first of those appeals, when Àngel Rangel clearly fouled Chris Brunt just inside the area – although the second was harder to call and it looked as though Callum McManaman was going to ground before Britton made contact with him.\n\n“The first one is a stonewall penalty,” Pulis said. “The lad actually goes for the ball but Chris just touches it away, and he goes through him. And then Callum, we’ve seen that again and the lad catches him. We had a penalty given against us last week against Bournemouth which is outside the box, two today that we should have had, two against Leicester that we should have had.\n\n“We’re really disappointed. There is no way if there was any justice that we should be coming away from this place with no points. But there you are. We have to get on with it, you can’t get in your mind that these decisions are going against you.”\n\nAlbion have now gone five games without a win, their worst run since Pulis was appointed manager almost a year ago.\n\nSwansea’s goal came from the best move of the game by a distance, although there was an element of good fortune about the way Boaz Myhill was unable to keep the ball out. Rangel linked with André Ayew, who laid the ball off for Wayne Routledge to slide an incisive pass into the path of the marauding right-back. Running into the inside-right channel, Rangel drilled a low shot that hit the near upright, struck the prone Myhill on his right elbow and slipped out of the Albion goalkeeper’s grasp as he tried to lay his left hand on the ball.\n\nKi, from all of two yards, gleefully swept home. “We hope it will be a turning point,” said Curtis, who singled out Britton for special praise. “Leon was outstanding and he’s been so fundamental to this team for the last 10 or 11 years.”"}, {"date": "26/12/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35198, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup":

you cannot argue with his team’s groove. It took a while for Tottenham to find their rhythm against Norwich but once they did they swept the visitors aside with stylish moves and great hits.\n\nManchester City kill off Sunderland and make short work of the task Read more\n\nThere are good vibrations around and Harry Kane and Dele Alli are the duo that really matter at White Hart Lane. “Everybody in the club, all eyes on us,” was the lyric cited by the manager as he urged his players to focus on their own performances while they pursue a top-four Premier League finish. If his team stay in the same groove displayed here, and Kane and Alli remain beautifully in sync, then Spurs can look even higher.\n\nFor a moment Norwich must have fancied their chances of replicating last week’s win at Old Trafford. Alex Neil made two alterations to his side and the addition of extra muscle in midfield looked a canny plot initially against a home team who started stodgily. Hugo Lloris had to make a smart save in the fifth minute from a fine curling shot from the edge of the area by Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe, a Belgian midfielder making his first Premier League start for Norwich. But once Spurs edged in front in the 26th minute thanks to a penalty, the home side took over.\n\nThe breakthrough came courtesy of a combination between Spurs’ most lively attackers. Alli, who bubbled with inventiveness and industry all game, slipped a cute ball through to Kane, who prodded it past the advancing goalkeeper, Declan Rudd, before being upended. Kane got up to convert the inevitable penalty.\n\nSuddenly Spurs were super-charged, a new fizz coursing through their play. Rudd was looking jittery and fumbled the next corner after the goal, before exhaling with relief as Kane and Jan Vertonghen bumped into each other at the back post as each tried to head into the net. The wickedness of Christian Eriksen’s deliveries from corners tormented Norwich from then on. Toby Alderweireld met the next one with a powerful header and Rudd produced an excellent reflex save to beat it away before tipping over the follow-up from Alli. Moments later Érik Lamela swung in a corner from the other side and Alderweireld soared high as Norwich defenders stood and watched. But the centre-back nutted the ball wide from six yards, provoking furious gesticulations from Pochettino.\n\nThe Tottenham manager was soon given the tranquilliser he craved, Kane administering it with an impeccably taken second goal. Alli was again involved, joining in a breakaway attack to knock the ball through to the striker, who swept a low shot into the net from a difficult angle. That was the striker’s 11th league goal of a season that he began with a long luckless streak.\n\nThe interval did not disrupt Spurs’ fluency. Nor could Norwich. Rudd, at least, was defiant and the goalkeeper denied Alli in the 56th minute, making a close-range save after a lovely one-two between the 19-year-old and Kane. Rudd then turned away Lamela’s rebound.\n\nThe feelgood factor among Pochettino’s team was such that they began showcasing their party tricks. Lamela failed to pull off an attempted bicycle kick but in the 62nd minute very nearly scored with an even more spectacular feat. Running on to a pass from Alli the Argentinian attempted to recreate the rabona goal that he scored last year against Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League. Top marks for artistic merit – but no goal because Rudd tipped the ball out for a corner.\n\nAlli was taken off to a rousing ovation in the 78th minute and, as if to spread the positive feeling throughout the squad, the substitute Tom Carroll scored Spurs’ third goal. And a wonderful strike it was too, the midfielder firing a swirling shot into the bottom corner from outside the area.\n\nPochettino, a stickler for high standards, almost exploded with rage on the sidelines when his team bungled a four-on-one breakaway, Lamela dawdling as he tried to find a way to present a hat-trick opportunity to Kane. Lloris then spared the home defence a rollicking by making an acrobatic stop from Dieumerci Mbokani.\n\n“We feel very proud of our players, it was a fantastic performance,” said Pochettino, who added that it was important for his team to reassert their high quality after losing their previous home league game, to Newcastle. “I’m very pleased with the reaction. Now we can say it was an accident against Newcastle. We cannot forget that we are the youngest team in the league but we are showing consistency and very mature performances every week. We are fourth in the table but we need to keep working hard. This sort of result should give us more belief.”"}, {"date": "26/12/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51682, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [11], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chancel Mbemba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yoan Gouffran", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Thauvin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheick Tiote", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mbabu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ivan Toney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leighton Baines", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [36], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "What a moment for Tom Cleverley to score his first goal of the season. What a cruel way for the otherwise excellent Rob Elliot to preface a defeat which leaves Newcastle United in the bottom three.\n\nWhen Steve McClaren’s goalkeeper could only punch Leighton Baines’s stoppage-time corner the ball fell to Cleverley who, with the evening’s final touch, not only headed the winner but perhaps suggested that this is not necessarily destined to be another season of Premier League underachievement for Everton.\n\nIt was surely no coincidence that Gerard Deulofeu had stepped off the bench in time to be heavily involved in the winning of a set piece destined to ruin McClaren’s mood on a night when Newcastle’s second-half endeavours at least earned them a standing ovation from the Gallowgate End.\n\nNewcastle United 0-1 Everton: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nTravelling Everton fans had long been demanding the former Barcelona winger’s introduction to a game in which their team dominated possession for protracted periods and only a series of outstanding saves from Elliot prevented Romelu Lukaku extending his scoring streak.\n\nParadoxically though, Newcastle – operating very much on the counterattack – had created the best two chances with Aleksandar Mitrovic, their £14.5m Serbia striker, heading two highly inviting crosses wide. Less positively for McClaren, Everton’s Tim Howard made a solitary save – to keep out Gini Wijnaldum’s header.\n\n“In football you have to take your chances,” reflected Roberto Martínez, Everton’s manager. “For us to win with the last kick was very cruel for Newcastle but it was a very well-deserved three points. I was really pleased with the way we controlled the game. We were totally dominating.”\n\nMcClaren appeared rather less imbued with festive cheer. “Never before have I felt so upset and disappointed for a set of players,” he said. “They didn’t deserve that. They gave everything but that performance bodes well for the future.\n\n“We couldn’t keep the ball at first but once we grew into the game in the second half we went toe to toe with a very good Everton team. A draw would have been a fair result. This game is cruel but the key thing was the appreciation from the fans.”\n\nEverton, all one- and two- touch passing, initially dominated possession to an almost embarrassing extent. With Séamus Coleman and Baines playing more like wingers than full-backs and Lukaku shrugging Fabricio Coloccini aside in an increasingly disdainful manner, Elliot was kept busy.\n\nNewcastle’s goalkeeper was soon saving smartly with his legs to deny first Kevin Mirallas and then Lukaku. A little earlier Coloccini – who like his central defensive partner, Chancel Mbemba, would later improve considerably – had been extremely lucky not to concede a penalty after sneakily hauling Lukaku back.\n\nWhen Mitrovic, possibly distracted by Coleman, headed a cross from Daryl Janmaat (later lucky not to be sent off for a second bookable offence) wide it was very much against the run of play.\n\nAlmost imperceptibly, though, the power balance began shifting. As good as Everton were at passing the ball around at the back and as enjoyable as it was to watch John Stones’s ease and elegance in possession from centre-half, Newcastle had sussed that Martínez’s team are not actually that hot in the air.\n\nAccordingly when the visitors completely misread Elliot’s long kick, Ayoze Pérez dragged a shot fractionally wide. Then Moussa Sissoko broke fast before crossing impressively for Mitrovic who, once again, headed off-target.\n\nHappily for Martínez, Cleverley would make no such mistake on a night when the sight of his header looping into the net might as well have been a stake through McClaren’s heart."}, {"date": "26/12/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31669, "home_team": {"name":

net, related to the continued implausibility of this Premier League season’s plot-lines. The Rotterdam-born Curaçao international right-back was making his full league debut for Southampton and not even he could have dreamed this up beforehand.\n\nBut it really did happen and, for the second season in succession, Southampton did win this fixture. Last time out, on New Year’s Day, it had seemed like less of a surprise. Southampton were flying then and Arsenal, of course, are always prone to locating a banana skin. Southampton’s 2-0 victory will be remembered for the Arsenal goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, making a couple of bad errors and then sparking up a cigarette by the shower area of the dressing-room.\n\nThis time Arsenal crashed even harder and it did Arsène Wenger no credit that he sought to blame the referee, Jon Moss, for Southampton’s first three goals. The Arsenal manager complained there had been an offside in the buildup to Martina’s opener, a foul by Shane Long before the second and an erroneously awarded corner on the third.\n\n“Only the first three? He didn’t say anything about the fourth goal?” Ronald Koeman, the Southampton manager, asked. “If you lose 4-0 and you talk about the referee – it’s not my away of analysing a football match. It was not about the referee tonight.”\n\nThis game was about Southampton’s desire to fire an upturn after a dismal sequence of results – they had drawn one and lost five of their previous six – their physical sharpness and, yes, their quality, as epitomised by Martina’s unlikely blockbuster. Koeman described their second-half performance as “perfect”.\n\nIt was also about Arsenal’s timidity and their infuriating habit of going missing when a big opportunity beckons. After Leicester City’s defeat at Liverpool earlier in the day Arsenal knew a victory would lift them to the top of the table. They blew it. Was it the pressure? “I don’t think so,” Wenger said. “But it’s difficult to check that.”\n\nArsenal had beaten Manchester City in their previous game to fire their title credentials but they undermined them here. Long bullied Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny, the Arsenal centre-halves, and it was difficult to remember too much of note from the visitors in an attacking sense.\n\nSo many of their key players were invisible and once José Fonte had made the game safe with the third goal, Southampton threatened to turn the scoreline into a humiliation. Long was denied only by a post in the 89th minute before he added his second and his team’s fourth in stoppage time. Wenger said that Long had “got away with a lot” in a physical sense. Mertesacker and Koscielny will bear the scars.\n\nKoeman had lost Graziano Pellè and Cédric Soares to injuries in training – Pellè, he said, would be out for “some weeks” with a knee problem – but how Long and Martina, the £1m summer signing from FC Twente, seized their opportunities in their stead.\n\nGoals had been a problem for Southampton but you would not have known it from Martina’s screamer, after Mertesacker had headed away Ryan Bertrand’s left-wing cross. Martina moved on to the ball, 30 yards out, to the right of centre and he made the split-second decision to take on the shot. With the outside of his right boot. Against one of the best goalkeepers in the division.\n\nThe very attempt was audacious but everything about the execution was perfect. The shot started yards outside Cech’s far post but it bent back wickedly inside it. When it swelled the net,Martina stood still for a moment, his arms outstretched. Even he looked stunned.\n\nMoments earlier Martina had been guilty of a poor clearance which went straight to Nacho Monreal but the Arsenal full-back’s shot was kept out by Maarten Stekelenburg. The defensive jitters, though, belonged to Arsenal.\n\nMertesacker’s clearance in the 25th minute found only James Ward-Prowse, who advanced, jinked inside and dragged his shot wide. Koscielny made an error that almost ushered in Steven Davis and, just before the interval, Long outpaced Mertesacker but his finish was high.\n\nThe second half was all Southampton.

They are, however, entitled to think their team must have an outstanding chance if they can keep this momentum going and, just as importantly, Manchester City continue defending in a way that helps explain why the sheikh and his colleagues in Abu Dhabi are apparently intent on ushering in Pep Guardiola.\n\nArsenal are still two points off Leicester but they now have a four-point lead over City in third position and, though there were some heart-stopping moments after Yaya Touré’s wonderfully taken 83rd-minute goal, Manuel Pellegrini’s insistence afterwards that his side had been the “dominant” team was generous, to say the least, and largely ignored their deficiencies. This was their fifth defeat already this season and a more accurate reflection would be that Arsenal had the better blend between defence and attack.\n\nThe bottom line for City is they cannot expect to defend this badly and get away with it. They badly miss the organisational skills of their captain, Vincent Kompany, and left themselves with too much ground to make up after the first-half goals from Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud that swung the game in favour of Arsène Wenger’s team.\n\nCity’s goals-against column is worse than Watford, Crystal Palace and Stoke City, and Eliaquim Mangala’s part in the second goal was particularly wretched. His shanked pass, when under no pressure, immediately put his team in danger. Giroud ran on to Mesut Özil’s through ball to fire a low, angled shot beneath Joe Hart and, for Mangala, the harsh reality is that this has become a recurring theme. At £42m, his progress continues to be interrupted by a tendency to make costly errors.\n\nArsenal 2-1 Manchester City: five talking points from the Emirates | Sachin Nakrani Read more\n\nÖzil also played the final pass for Walcott to open the scoring 12 minutes earlier with a curling, diagonal finish. The German has now set up 15 of Arsenal’s league goals and, to put it into context, the next player on the list of assists, Gerard Deulofeu, has contributed seven for Everton.\n\nArsenal found a way to subdue David Silva, who was eventually substituted in the second half. City found it harder trying to pin down the elusive Özil and, with Walcott and Joel Campbell getting the better of Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov, Arsenal could also reflect on several chances at 2-0 to extend their lead. Pellegrini was right that City had spells on top but so did their opponents, creating the better chances.\n\nThe score at half-time was slightly misleading because City did look like the more rounded side in the opening half an hour. Pellegrini had chosen to abandon his normal formation in favour of a new 4-1-2-2-1 system that, early on, seemed to have identified Arsenal’s left side as a potential weakness. As well as Kevin De Bruyne operating on the right, Silva also seemed to be under instructions to drift to the same side and double up on Nacho Monreal.\n\nThose two caused plenty of problems during the opening exchanges but on the one occasion Arsenal looked really vulnerable, with only two defenders back and Laurent Koscielny hopelessly out of position, De Bruyne chose to shoot when Silva was free to his left, shouting for the pass that would have almost certainly led to the opening goal. The shot flashed past the post and De Bruyne’s error of judgment was compounded in the next attack when Walcott, operating on the left, collected Özil’s pass and was given far too much space to line up his shot.\n\nCity had plenty of defenders inside the penalty area but none of them took decisive action. Sagna hung back while Kolarov appealed for offside and then positioned his hands behind his back as if anticipating the shot. With nobody closing him down, Walcott took a touch inside, shaped his body and sent the ball around Hart with just the right amount of curl and pace.\n\nDe Bruyne suffered an ignominious moment early on when he went to take a corner, accidentally kicked the flagpole and ended up on the floor, but it was that wasted opportunity that can be traced back as the moment the game turned in Arsenal’s favour. Until that point, City had been knocking the ball around confidently and controlling the tempo. Thereafter, they looked dishevelled and accident-prone. They lacked cohesion at the back and it needed a couple of sprawling saves from Hart to prevent Campbell and Aaron Ramsey punishing them again in the first 15 minutes of the second half.\n\nPellegrini brought on Raheem Sterling for Fabian Delph at half-time and, after 63 minutes, there was the now-familiar sight of Agüero gingerly making his way to the touchline, accompanied by a member of the medical staff. Silva’s influence had dropped and Sterling found it difficult to get into the match until Touré, with an elegant swish of his left boot, directed a rising, diagonal shot into the top right-hand corner of Petr Cech’s net. It was a beauty, ensuring a nerve-shredding finale. Wilfried Bony, who had replaced Agüero, turned one shot just wide and Arsenal had to endure four minutes of stoppage time. They held out and, as Wenger noted, these are the kind of wins that give a team chasing the title new belief."}, {"date": "20/12/2015", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20707, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [3], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Almen Abdi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Manuel Jurado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [15, 85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Valon Behrami", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Obbi Oularé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alessandro Diamanti", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Giedrius Arlauskis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Adam Bogdan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [41]}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [41], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Fulton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Randall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Odion Ighalo helped Watford to fire their Champions League charge with a comprehensive victory over a Liverpool team that lags in mid-table. It is not a sentence that might plausibly have been conceived at the beginning of the season but this is no ordinary season and Watford are riding the wave of this unpredictability.\n\nJürgen Klopp angered by Liverpool reaction after Watford defeat Read more\n\nQuique Sánchez Flores’s team registered a fourth consecutive victory to lift themselves to within a point of the top four and this was their first major scalp of what is becoming an unforgettable season for them.\n\nThe manager had made Premier League survival the priority and even in the heady aftermath of possibly the best result for the club since the Graham Taylor years, he repeated the call to “stick to the plan”. Getting carried away, he warned, would “be a very, very bad thing”.\n\nBut this was a day of celebration for the Watford support, of rip-roaring enjoyment and if their top-four prospects should not be exaggerated then the possibilities have been made to feel rather greater than simply retaining their top-flight status.\n\nIghalo added to Nathan Aké’s opener with his 11th and 12th goals of the league campaign and, when he was substituted late on, he departed to thunderous acclaim. The home crowd, who must be pinching themselves, had unfurled a banner beforehand that paid tribute to the club’s owners, the Pozzo family.\n\n“So here’s to you, Pozzo family. Watford loves you more than you would know,” it read, riffing on the old Simon and Garfunkel lyric. Love is most assuredly in the air in this part of Hertfordshire.\n\nWatford’s simple formula leaves Jürgen Klopp searching for solutions Read more\n\nFor Liverpool it was an afternoon to forget and it compounded the recent disappointments against Newcastle United and West Bromwich Albion, from which they had taken only one point. Watford swarmed all over them at the outset, hustling them into errors, and when they had finished their early burst they were two goals up and in control.\n\nThe tone was set by Ighalo and Troy Deeney up front, both muscular, harrying presences, and it was clear Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho would have an uncomfortable afternoon. Skrtel lasted until the 41st minute when he was forced off with a muscular injury. Watford won so many of the one-against-one duels.\n\nThe opening goal was a present and it came gift-wrapped by Adam Bogdan, the Liverpool goalkeeper, who made his Premier League debut for the club in place of the injured Simon Mignolet. Bogdan dropped Ben Watson’s corner and, when it bounced back up for him, Aké nicked it off him and forced home. It was the on-loan Chelsea defender’s first goal for the club.\n\nBogdan claimed he had two hands on the ball before Aké robbed him and, when there was a break in play on the half hour, he could be seen in discussion with the referee, Mark Clattenburg. Jürgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, later insisted it had been a foul. But Bogdan lacked conviction and it was not certain he had the ball under his control.\n\nAké had won the corner on the left through sheer persistence and Watford’s performance was embossed with the virtue. The second goal was loaded with it, too, with the non-stop Deeney winning the ball off Lucas Leiva and sending it over the top for Ighalo to chase.\n\nIn a straight fight with Skrtel the Liverpool defender, initially, looked the favourite. But Ighalo muscled in and, when the ball broke wide, he reacted the quickest, getting his body shape right before hooking a low shot into the far corner.\n\nKlopp felt the swirling wind had distracted Skrtel but he had bigger complaints, chiefly his team’s collective reaction to the concession of the opening goal. To his annoyance Liverpool failed to play the simple game he wanted and they were second best, particularly in the first half, when Watford might have scored more. Bogdan had a couple more nervy moments while he made a low save to deny José Manuel Jurado.\n\nWatford keep it compact to squeeze life out of Klopp’s baffling lineup Read more\n\nThe home crowd roared their approval for every block and challenge and there was a standing ovation when Almen Abdi slid in to nick the ball away from Adam Lallana in the 33rd minute, which reflected the bond between the team and the stands that Flores has worked to establish.\n\nKlopp had started with Roberto Firmino at the tip of a 4-3-3 formation but he switched things after Skrtel’s injury, sending on Divock Origi to play up front. It was interesting Klopp introduced Origi ahead of Christian Benteke, who had been dropped from the starting line-up. Benteke eventually came on, together with Jordon Ibe, in the 74th minute but it was not a day for any of Liverpool’s strikers.\n\nThe visitors created little in the first half but they had clearer chances after the interval. There were flickers for Alberto Moreno and Origi straight away, Lallana looped a header off target and Jordan Henderson got the better of Aké before seeing Heurelho Gomes tip over his shot.\n\nBut Watford had more of their own with Bogdan denying Ighalo one-on-one. Ighalo deserved to have the last word and he got it when Valon Behrami, the substitute, crossed from the right. Watford’s man of the moment buried his header from close range.\n\nMan of the match Odion Ighalo (Watford)"}, {"date": "20/12/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20661, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Jordi Amat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marvin Emnes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Modou Barrow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Oxford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Cullen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stephen Hendrie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Goals are as hard to come by as managers in this part of south Wales at the moment.

Swansea are 18th, two points adrift of safety, and the vacancy in the dugout is starting to look like a job for a firefighter rather than a long-term project.\n\nSwansea dominated, enjoying 73% possession against a severely depleted West Ham, yet the fact they registered only two shots on target tells its own story.

José Morais, who was José Mourinho’s assistant at Chelsea, is the latest name to be linked with the Swansea role.\n\nWith no suggestion that an announcement is imminent, Alan Curtis, who was asked to take over in a caretaker capacity in the wake of Monk’s departure, said that he is working on the assumption he will be in charge for the Boxing Day home match against West Bromwich Albion as well as the trip to Crystal Palace two days later.\n\nViewed as a safe pair of hands by the board, as well as a man in tune with the club’s playing style, Curtis saw a few positives despite Swansea’s failure to score. “I thought in terms of possession we were excellent,” he said. “I think we looked like a Swansea City team again.\n\n“Certainly we bossed the game in terms of territory but we probably just lack that killer edge up front, and that’s partly to do with the service that players get. I think sometimes we just need a stroke of luck, we could do with something like a deflection or, having looked at the monitor, a penalty decision go our way.”\n\nCollins certainly handled Ki’s shot and the Swansea players were furious that Mason rejected their penalty claims. Two minutes before that Cheikhou Kouyaté could only half-clear Gylfi Sigurdsson’s free-kick and Cork struck a superb 20-yard volley that was arrowing towards the top corner until Adrían intervened. Earlier in the game Ki was thwarted by Adrían, who stuck out a leg to repel the South Korean’s shot after some neat build-up play involving Neil Taylor and Bafétimbi Gomis.\n\nAs for West Ham, Slaven Bilic departed “happy with a point”. With Andy Carroll, Winston Reid, Victor Moses, Manuel Lanzini, Diafra Sakho and Dimitri Payet all injured, this is a very different West Ham side from the one who wreaked havoc away from home earlier in the season. Mauro Zárate had a couple of speculative shots in the first half and Enner Valencia, his replacement, forced Lukasz Fabianski into a fingertip save late on but West Ham offered only a sporadic threat.\n\n“We were very resilient, very stubborn in a positive way, we defended really well and I think we deserved a point,” said Bilic, whose team have failed to win in seven games.\n\n“It’s all about the squad but why I want to praise the team is that we didn’t sink. Four or five weeks ago when we were really hit with these injuries, I said the only way we are going compensate is with teamwork, and that’s exactly what we’ve done in the last three matches.\n\nMan

Chelsea came the strangest of afternoons and, watching on alongside Roman Abramovich, Guus Hiddink may well have wondered what he has let himself in for, having agreed to become the club’s interim manager for a second time. There were chants of support for the man he is replacing, jeers for the players that remain, and a performance that veered from the sublime to the stuttering in what felt like a blink of an eye. Welcome back Guus, it’s going to be one hell of a ride.\n\nMutiny in the air as Chelsea’s players are pilloried after José Mourinho’s exit | Dominic Fifield Read more\n\nThat should perhaps be expected from a club that appears incapable of escaping drama and at the end of another tumultuous week in their history the most important thing was that they recorded a first win in four league matches. This, as incredible as it continues to sound, was a relegation scrap and Chelsea did enough to prevail.\n\nOne can only wonder what José Mourinho made of it all, especially upon hearing Chelsea had taken a 2-0 lead, though goals from Branislav Ivanovic and Pedro, inside 13 minutes on the back of a display brimming with verve and vigour, drive and desire. The Portuguese, who was at the Amex Arena watching Middlesbrough, managed by his former assistant at Real Madrid Aitor Karanka, beat Brighton, may well have wondered why they could not do the same for him for the bulk of this campaign, and in particular at Leicester on Monday when yet another insipid display by the champions led to Mourinho accusing his players of a “betrayal” and he, in turn, losing his job as Chelsea manager for the second time in eight years.\n\nIt is a question which many Chelsea supporters have also been asking and they used this match to make their frustrations and fury clear. Mourinho’s name was chanted loud and lustily while some spectators held aloft banners declaring their love for their former leader and disgust with those in blue. Cesc Fàbregas’s and Diego Costa’s names were booed prior to kick-off and after Pedro had scored came the first chant of “Where were you when we were shit?”\n\nThe atmosphere was poisonous, not to mention bewildering as a group of fans became increasingly irritated by the sight of their team playing well. But they were perhaps right to ask where this combination of style and substance had been in recent weeks. As one banner declared: “You let José down. You let us down.” Another called Fàbregas, Costa and Eden Hazard, who was absent here due to the hip injury he picked up at the King Power Stadium, “rats”.\n\nThe players may argue that their display came from a collective sense of liberation given they no longer have Mourinho’s intense methods and scathing words wearing them down. With the assistant coach, Steve Holland, in charge, they certainly played like a group reborn. The passing was crisp, the pressing purposeful and the movement relentless as Sunderland came up against a tidal wave of blue right from kick-off.\n\nIvanovic struck after just five minutes, sending Willian’s corner into the roof of the net with a powerful header, and also played a role in Chelsea’s second, directing a cross into the area that Pedro smashed past Costel Pantilimon.\n\nSebastián Coates was at fault for both goals and so it was no major surprise to see the defender replaced by Adam Johnson on 23 minutes as Sam Allardyce, the Sunderland manager, looked for a way to get his team back into the contest. But Chelsea kept on coming. Fàbregas and Nemanja Matic were dominating midfield while ahead of them, Willian, Oscar and Pedro were proving impossible to pin down. Diego Costa, meanwhile, was being a nuisance for all the right reasons and came close to scoring twice before the interval.\n\nDiego Costa and Cesc Fàbregas booed by disgruntled Chelsea supporters Read more\n\nOscar made it 3-0 via a 50th-minute penalty, which led to more chants in support of Mourinho. It was perhaps apt, then, that Chelsea began to perform, defensively at least, like they so often had under the Portuguese.\n\nThibaut Courtois pushed Younès Kaboul’s header on to the knee of Fabio Borini to hand the Italian his first goal of the season and from there nervousness spread within the hosts’ ranks. Borini came close to scoring again shortly afterwards and, following more poor handling from Courtois, the excellent Duncan Watmore could have scored on 78 minutes for a Sunderland team that remain 19th having lost for a third successive time.\n\nChelsea did have chances to extend their lead, most notably via Pedro’s 78th-minute strike, and Courtois made an excellent save from Jermain Defoe late on. But this remains a side short of confidence and poise and it will take Hiddink time to change that. His first opportunity comes with Watford’s visit here on Boxing Day. The 69-year-old will also have to win over the home crowd. He did that during his first spell here in 2009 but the task is more difficult now given the resentment that has developed following Mourinho’s sacking.\n\nThe anger is clear, as it also clearly remains inside Costa given he stormed away from this stadium having been booed by some fans after being substituted late on. Mourinho has gone but the strife remains.

Christmas Day 2015 and Claudio Ranieri’s team will be peering down on the billionaires, the so-called established order and the beleaguered after securing top spot with a statement victory at Everton. Their transformation is to be savoured regardless of what unfolds over the next 21 games.\n\nManchester United lose again as Alex Tettey seals win for Norwich City Read more\n\nRanieri underplayed the Christmas No1 spot as he has talk of the most unlikely championship success. “It means nothing,” the Italian said of Leicester’s place on the summit. “It means we are on a good run and in good form.” But win number 11 from 17 matches was the stuff, whisper it, of champions. Missing key players to injury and suspension, the visitors dug in when they had to, were clinical when opportunity arose and received the benefit of the doubt from the referee at vital moments. Their commitment to the cause was unquestionable.\n\nThis was the kind of hard-fought away win on a cold, miserable day in the north-west that José Mourinho revelled in during his title-winning pomp at Chelsea. Having signalled the end of Mourinho’s second coming on Monday, Ranieri reacted with a simple celebratory punch to the final whistle that followed two Riyad Mahrez penalties and a fine finish from the recalled Shinji Okazaki.\n\nLeicester’s manager is not getting ahead of himself but their supporters had every reason to savour victory here. It felt like a significant day for both managers. Roberto Martínez’s designs on Champions League qualification are disappearing with a run of two wins in 10 league matches while his Leicester counterpart has gathering momentum.\n\n“Football is crazy and if it is crazy in this way, I am very happy,” said Ranieri. “Today was a difficult, difficult, difficult match. Everton is a good team, they move the ball so quickly but we were very concentrated and did not allow them much space. In the first half we didn’t react well. In the second we were much better.”\n\nLeicester followed their manager’s instructions for more composed, counterattacking football in the second half but Everton clearly did not listen to Martínez’s pre-match warning about the visitors’ threat from throw-ins from the left. It was embarrassing for Everton that two of the Leicester goals arrived from throw-ins, and one was their own, though not as shameful as Gerard Deulofeu’s childish antics whenever he was refused a free-kick for the slightest physical contact.\n\nChristian Fuchs’s throw was flicked into the penalty area by Jamie Vardy and should have prompted a routine clearance from Ramiro Funes Mori. Instead, the Argentina international attempted to shepherd the header out of play but succeeded only in hauling Okazaki to the ground. The referee, Jon Moss, correctly pointed to the spot and Mahrez converted a confident penalty under Tim Howard’s right hand for his 12th league goal of the season.\n\nThe away section was still chanting “We’re gonna win the league” when Everton hit back with the equaliser. The otherwise cumbersome Aroune Koné and the sharp Romelu Lukaku turned a Deulofeu cross into Tom Cleverley inside the area, the midfielder found Ross Barkley and his low shot was saved by the legs of Kasper Schmeichel. Barkley had a second go from the rebound but Andy King blocked on the line only for the ball to drop to Lukaku, who swept home his 13th league goal of the season from close range.\n\nCrystal Palace sink Stoke through Lee Chung-yong despite soft penalty Read more\n\nMahrez was back on level terms with the Belgium international, and Leicester back in front, 20 minutes into the second half. The game developed into a far more open, end-to-end affair that suited the visitors immediately from the restart. Everton, their midfield exposed and the defence unprotected, failed to react.\n\nVardy curled inches wide from one break down the Leicester left and Leighton Baines was forced to make a vital tackle on Okasaki inside the area from another. The pressure continued to build on Everton’s goal and the visitors retook the lead from their second penalty when Mahrez slipped Vardy in behind the defence and the striker was sent sprawling by Howard having nicked the ball beyond him. The Algeria international converted into the opposite corner, sending Howard the wrong way.\n\nLeicester’s third arrived moments later from an Everton throw-in. Marc Albrighton charged down Séamus Coleman’s attempted clearance, with what appeared his hand, and the ball broke to Vardy who squared across the area for Okazaki to finish in style.\n\nThe Everton substitute Kevin Mirallas ensured a nervous finale for Leicester with a close-range finish in the 89th minute but Ranieri’s men held firm and march on.\n\n“I will enjoy Christmas with the turkey, not lasagne, too heavy,” said Ranieri. “Merry Christmas to you and your families.” It will be in Leicester."}, {"date": "19/12/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75320, "home_team": {"name":

The Manchester United manager said he had no words to describe the disappointment of the past week, going out of the Champions League, going down at Bournemouth and so on, so imagine his dismay when Alex Neil’s relegation-battlers took a first-half lead here and held on for three points.\n\nPressure builds on Louis van Gaal as José Mourinho waits in the wings Read more\n\nUnited are now out of the top four and Van Gaal said the first home league defeat of the season confirmed a crisis of confidence. “We are in a bad period and we have to stick together to come out of it,” the manager said. “We had our chances, but didn’t finish, and I have been saying that for a while. You have to win against Norwich City at home.”\n\nThat came as news to his counterpart Neil, who described his side’s first win here in 26 years as possibly his greatest managerial achievement. “We kept them to just two shots on target and that’s to our credit,” the Norwich manager said. “We knew if we could cut out the silly errors we would give ourselves a chance, and that is what happened. We didn’t come just to defend; it’s not like the old days here when you might get hit for four or five.”\n\nBy the time Cameron Jerome slotted a shot past David de Gea six minutes before half-time the match had already settled into a familiar pattern.\n\nUnited had started brightly, with Anthony Martial looking lively on the right wing, but a series of half-breaks and potential openings had come to naught. While Norwich were stretched at the back at times, and occasionally defending doggedly, shots on target for the keeper, Declan Rudd, to deal with were few.\n\nWayne Rooney, playing up front for a change on the occasion of his 500th United appearance, saw a shot deflected narrowly wide midway through the first half and might have expected Memphis Depay to do better than spoon the ball over the bar when he sent in a tantalising, curving cross a couple of minutes later. That was about it for serious goal attempts before the interval, at least from the home side.\n\nNorwich did rather better, after initially looking short of confidence in front of goal. Alex Tettey might have opened the scoring after wrongfooting the United defence with a delightful turn, only to send in a tame shot with a clear sight of goal.\n\nThe visitors were at least gaining a foothold in the game as the interval approached and they gained a reward for endeavour when Nathan Redmond helped set up the first goal. At first it looked as though the winger might have shown too much of the ball to the defence, yet he managed to gain a crucial last touch to nudge it past Phil Jones and into the path of Jerome, who slipped Chris Smalling’s attempt at a covering tackle and held off Michael Carrick’s challenge to place a shot past an exposed De Gea.\n\nThere were mild boos and jeers from the home crowd as the players left the pitch, but worse was to come. Norwich doubled their lead just before the hour with an even better goal than the first, made by Jerome and capably finished by Tettey. Jerome was in the centre circle when he received possession, yet with a determined twisting turn he was free and his pass played Tettey into the inviting gap between Ashley Young and Smalling. De Gea was beaten for the second time in the afternoon by a crisp shot from the edge of the area, with Rudd at the other end still waiting to be tested.\n\nMutiny in the air as Chelsea’s players are pilloried after José Mourinho’s exit | Dominic Fifield Read more\n\nRooney almost managed that with an overhead kick that flew too high, before Van Gaal sent on Ander Herrera in place of Marouane Fellaini. The crowd approved of that, for although Fellaini’s distinctive head had been a focus for much of United’s attacking, it was an approach that all too clearly was not working.\n\nUnited redoubled their attacking efforts, all the while aware that Norwich were quite handy on the counter, and gained a reward when Rooney touched Young’s cross on to Martial, who showed strength and perseverance in riding a couple of last-ditch penalty-area challenges before crashing a shot high into the net. That brought the stadium fully to life, the previous carping abandoned in anticipation of a grandstand finish, but those days appear to be gone.\n\nJuan Mata finally forced a save from Rudd from a free-kick, Young sent a piercing low cross into the Norwich penalty area that surprised his team-mates as much as the opposing defenders and Smalling managed to miss the target with a close-range header in the closing seconds. The visitors, though, managed to come closer to scoring another when De Gea had to beat out Youssouf Mulumbu’s late effort.\n\nNorwich are out of the bottom three and deservedly so. They did not have had as much of the ball as United, but they were sharper with their chances. Without a win in six games, this is not the Christmas that Van Gaal was hoping for, especially now former players are calling for change and a couple of top-quality coaching alternatives have just become available."}, {"date": "19/12/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31636, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [40], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordy Clasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juanmi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [43], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [40], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Wimmer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Winks", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Southampton may not share the dejected appearance common among some of their peers but alarm bells are getting louder. This defeat, their fourth in the last five games, was troubling for its snug fit into the mould familiar to struggling teams: failure to capitalise on chances, followed by catastrophic defending and a subsequent loss of steam. Tottenham did not need to play especially well to win and Ronald Koeman, mentioned in connection with the Chelsea job earlier in the week, evidently has enough concerns closer to home.\n\nTwo penalties by Riyad Mahrez against Everton help keep Leicester top Read more\n\nThe sloppiness that conceded the match in a three-minute spell before half-time will top Koeman’s list. Southampton had emerged sharply, dominating the opening half-hour and pressing from the front in the manner that became familiar last season. But there was none of that intensity when Harry Kane ran through three challenges to score the 40th-minute opener and barely a defender in view when Dele Alli, alone six yards out, was afforded two touches to double the lead within 180 seconds.\n\n“We need to change our attitude,” said Koeman, who pulled no punches afterwards. “Normally I am the first to defend my players, but this time I criticise because we need to change our mentality. [We need] the mentality that, as a player, I win my battle against my opponent.\n\n“Tottenham were more clinical, more clever and we were so naive in defending. If we don’t change then we will continue struggling because the teams in this league are too strong.”\n\nSuch admonishment might have been averted if Sadio Mané had not been thwarted by Hugo Lloris inside the first 10 minutes. His sidefooted shot from 15 yards was not quite far enough into the goalkeeper’s right-hand corner and Lloris got down to deflect it away.\n\nWhat followed bore the hallmark of a side whose confidence has taken a beating. First Kane, given the chance to break after Alli bravely beat José Fonte to the ball, was allowed to run past two defenders and, gifted a sight of goal by Virgil van Dijk’s decision to take a wild swipe at the ball, beat Paulo Gazzaniga comfortably on his 100th Tottenham appearance.\n\nAston Villa boosted as Jordan Ayew earns draw with Newcastle United Read more\n\nShortly afterwards Kyle Walker advanced and, with Van Dijk backing off, centred low. With none of Southampton’s back five commanding the six-yard box, Alli had time to complete a finish of bemusing simplicity.\n\n“Maybe the players don’t realise enough the situation that the club is in today,” Koeman said. “Maybe they are still living with what they did last season. If we don’t give more than 100% we have a normal team and they have to realise that.”\n\nExcepting an added-time examination of Lloris’s reflexes by James Ward-Prowse, Tottenham cruised through an almost event-free second half. This win, on Mauricio Pochettino’s former turf, arrested a stutter of their own and moved them up to fourth place. “I think we fully deserved the victory,” Pochettino said. “It’s true that for 20 minutes Southampton were better, but we managed the game and the effort was fantastic against a great team and manager with one of the best squads in the league.”"}, {"date": "19/12/2015", "arena":

Crystal Palace looked to have been denied victory by a penalty that was rather less clearcut, and their supporters would probably maintain that the substitute Lee Chung-yong’s late winner, a fine, curling shot struck from outside the penalty area, ensured justice was done. Even so, they would also have to acknowledge the debt owed to their goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, who made a series of fine saves to keep Stoke at bay.\n\nManchester United lose again as Alex Tettey seals win for Norwich City Read more\n\n“It was a far from underperforming side we beat today,” said Alan Pardew. “The first half was tight, but Stoke have a lot of very good technical players. In the second half they really showed their flair and we really had to dig in. But that’s the beauty of this team – it has great spirit and determination.”\n\nIt also has two new American investors prepared to fund the £50m rebuilding of Selhurst Park, and Josh Harris and David Blitzer, sitting alongside the chairman, Steve Parish, in the stands, can only have been impressed by the manner in which Palace, missing their playmaker Yohan Cabaye, lifted themselves level on points with fourth-placed Spurs and Manchester United.\n\nStoke supporters still buzzing from their team’s previous home performance – the disconcertingly (to some, at any rate) scintillating demolition of Manchester City – can only have been delighted to hear Xherdan Shaqiri had recovered from the hamstring tweak that caused him to miss last Saturday’s draw at West Ham.\n\nWhether the little Swiss midfielder’s attacking combinations with Marko Arnautovic and Bojan Krkic would prove as effective against a Palace team which came into the game having conceded only six times away from home this season, however, remained open to question – and indeed with Stoke themselves having kept seven clean sheets in their previous nine games, the feeling was goals could be at a premium.\n\nThe first half-hour reinforced that impression. The visitors were prepared to cede Stoke the majority of possession, closing down in the final third and only occasionally looking to break. Chances at either end were minimal, and it was only when Palace lost the ball on a rare foray upfield, and for the first time were caught slightly short of numbers at the back, that Arnautovic finally found enough space to tee up Krkic. The Spaniard’s shot was low and crisp, and it needed a smart, diving save from the in-form Hennessey to beat it out.\n\nHennessey had to rely on the woodwork 10 minutes later when Marco van Ginkel flicked Erik Pieters’ low diagonal cross against the outside of the goalkeeper’s right hand post, but just when the half looked certain to remain goalless, Palace went ahead.\n\nWilfried Zaha was actually heading away from goal when Glenn Whelan put a foot in and clearly clipped ankle rather than ball. Connor Wickham drove the penalty straight down the middle.\n\nHarry Kane scores as Tottenham beat Southampton to go fourth Read more\n\nAfter the break, Hennessey soon impressed again, plunging to his right after Glen Johnson’s shot found its way through a crowd of players. At the other end a stretching James McArthur just failed to turn Zaha’s cross past Jack Butland and, with Mark Hughes’s side now having to commit men forward, the pace and indeed power of Yannick Bolasie and Jason Puncheon were a growing threat.\n\nArnautovic saw a shot deflected just wide but Stoke looked to be running out of steam when the referee, Bobby Madley, decided the ball had brushed Damien Delaney’s hand on the way down after the defender had challenged for a cross in his own penalty area. Krkic finally beat Hennessey but, with added time approaching, Stoke failed to properly clear a bouncing ball and Lee’s side-footed curling effort from distance was too good for Butland in the Stoke goal.\n\n“Disappointed with the result, but not the performance,” said Hughes. “We’ve played worse than that and won games.

The fact it was against 10 men doesn’t really change their threat from set pieces. It is a great win for us. It was hard to create chances in the first half – anyone who sees us consistently will say we are a side that creates more chances than today.\n\n“Personally I thought it [McClean] was a red card. They [McClean and Smith] came together just seconds before that tackle and James just lost his head a little bit and seemed to go over the ball from my angle so I wasn’t surprised when the red card came out.”\n\nHowe said Rondón’s red card was “a silly one”. “Both players came together and I’m pleased my lads kept their cool and control.

To say Gestede shook things up a bit would be an understatement and, equally important, the substitute striker brought the previously slumbering Jordan Ayew to life.\n\nBournemouth’s Charlie Daniels spot-on as nine-man West Brom suffer Read more\n\nAyew duly scored a stunning equaliser and, although the resultant point leaves Villa still bottom and seemingly still doomed to relegation, Garde will surely feel a sliver of encouragement. Steve McClaren, meanwhile, merely received a reminder that his own relegation worries are anything but behind him.\n\n“Nobody is dancing, of course, but the mood is good,” said Garde. “I like to be optimistic and maybe this is the point that will keep us up at the end of the season. Gestede made a big impact, he brought us back into the game. When we had nothing to lose, we started to play.”\n\nAll aimless high balls and squandered possession, the first half was so desperately poor that Garde and McClaren could probably have stepped into midfield and not looked out of place. As the weather became more tropical monsoon than winter shower, the ball started sticking in numerous puddles and Papiss Cissé injured himself.\n\nEnter Aleksandar Mitrovic. If the Serb’s first act after stepping off the bench was infinitely forgettable – he completely missed Moussa Sissoko’s inviting low cross – his second proved instrumental in Newcastle taking the lead.\n\nMeeting Jack Colback’s subtly curved free-kick, Mitrovic forced Brad Guzan to tip his looping header over the bar. The resultant corner – from Colback again – was not executed that well but, even so, Villa’s defence allowed the ball to roll across the area towards Fabricio Coloccini. With Joleon Lescott, his supposed minder, having lost his man, Newcastle’s captain, unleashed a right-foot shot that Guzan should arguably have saved. By way of celebration the much criticised Sissoko stuck two fingers up at a television camera and may need to explain himself to the Football Association.\n\nThe rain eased in the second period but, with the pitch waterlogged in places, players slithered all over the place and accurate passing became impossible. Undeterred, Villa finally conjured up a clearcut chance, involving Rob Elliot doing well to parry Jordan Veretout’s low shot. Granted Idrissa Gueye and Carlos Sánchez continued to struggle in midfield – although Gueye did produce the odd moment hinting at the possibility of better days to come – but Villa were improving.\n\nChelsea fans boo their own players in win over Sunderland Read more\n\nThey proved it when Ayew dodged Daryl Janmaat, switched the ball to his right foot and curled a wonderful shot into the top corner from the edge of the area. “A brilliant goal from a talented player,” said Garde.\n\nMcClaren was left to rue the moment shortly before when Siem De Jong missed a sitter, somehow heading Georginio Wijnaldum’s cross wide.\n\nVilla might have taken the lead when Ayew crossed in Gestede’s direction. He had fazed Coloccini and company ever since replacing the ineffective Scott Sinclair but he could not quite make the required connection.\n\nAgainst all odds the game had become compelling, with Janmaat and Ayew falling out and Wijnaldum, Gestede and Ayoze Pérez all spurning presentable scoring chances.\n\n“We should have won,” said McClaren. “Siem’s miss was the absolute decisive moment.”"},

become, it came during those moments when Leicester City – the team, lest it be forgotten, that began the season as 2,000-1 outsiders to win the title – started showboating against the side who call themselves Premier League champions but are hovering only a point above the relegation zone. Wes Morgan shimmied with the ball and eluded a couple of challenges. Riyad Mahrez played those lovely soft-touch passes. Jamie Vardy wanted to take on everyone and Leicester, almost implausibly, went back to the top of the league, enjoying the view.\n\nClaudio Ranieri laughs last with José Mourinho looking far from special | Stuart James Read more\n\nThey were brilliant, once again, and if the chasing pack are underestimating Claudio Ranieri’s team the story of this match should remove any complacency. Chelsea, in turn, have now lost five of their past seven league fixtures, leaving them fifth from bottom, and José Mourinho’s declaration that his players had “betrayed” him will bring another wave of scrutiny on an increasingly beleaguered manager. Mourinho, an expert in manipulating the headlines, used that word in virtually every interview and it felt like a calculated gamble on a night when John Terry was substituted and the faultlines appeared in the manager’s relationship with Eden Hazard.\n\nIf nothing else, Mourinho can take a glimmer of encouragement from the way his team fought to save themselves during the final exchanges. A header from the substitute Loïc Rémy ensured a nerve-shredding finale and the one redeeming feature for Chelsea was that they did show a flicker of the old spirit after Riyad Mahrez had made it 2-0.\n\nUltimately, though, it was another chastening experience for Mourinho and their nine defeats this season is the same number as the two previous seasons combined. Vardy added another goal to his collection and when Leicester are playing with this much vibrancy their supporters are allowed to wonder where it is all going to end.\n\n“We’re going to win the league,” they sang, interspersed with the night’s best put-down, directed towards the away end, of “Jamie Vardy, he’s scored more than you”. It was not strictly true but the man who has just won back-to-back Premier League player-of-the-month awards now has 15 in the league, which is only three short of Chelsea’s total.\n\nVardy’s speed and directness were prominent features from the start, spreading anxiety among what used to be the most reliable and parsimonious defence in the country. He and Mahrez have a wonderful understanding and Ranieri was adamant afterwards that Leicester would not sell their most prized assets. “Nobody has the money,” he said matter-of-factly.\n\nRanieri cannot think any other way when the two players link up as exquisitely as they did for the opening goal. The cross came from the right, clipped over with the deft accuracy that has made Mahrez arguably the most effective wide player in the league. Vardy had already been involved in the build-up and as the ball was moved out wide he was already getting into position. Kurt Zouma hesitated for a split second. Terry was out of position and Vardy sent his volley past Thibaut Courtois with the confidence of a man who expects to score.\n\nChelsea’s position had been weakened shortly beforehand when Vardy, trying to win the ball in midfield, banged into Hazard and jarred the Belgian on his side. Chelsea’s medical staff sprayed Hazard’s lower back and hip but Mourinho initially instructed him to stay on while Pedro took off his tracksuit to warm up. Within moments the ball was played to Hazard but he was in so much discomfort he could barely move. He looked unimpressed, to say the least, that Mourinho had asked him to continue and there was an angry flick of his hand as he made his way past his manager.\n\nLeicester had lost one of their own key players by that stage because of a hamstring injury for Danny Drinkwater but his replacement, Andy King, filled in seamlessly. There was a streak of confidence running through Ranieri’s team, encapsulated by the moment Mahrez slipped the ball through Ramires’s legs.\n\nThree minutes into the second half, there was another demonstration of Mahrez’s gifts. He was on the right-hand side of the penalty area when Marc Albrighton’s long, crossfield pass picked him out. His control and footwork teased and tormented César Azpilicueta. The angle was tight but Mahrez has a rare knack for being able to put the ball where he wants it. He applied just the right mix of curl and pace and, with an elegant swish of his left foot, his shot curled around Azpilicueta and high into the far corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eden Hazard trudges off past José Mourinho. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nA lot will be made of Terry’s withdrawal but Mourinho was entitled to think the change to a three-man central defence improved his team.

While the scoreline was the same at the interval here, history never looked like repeating itself as Arsenal took their place at the Premier League summit and condemned Villa to a defeat that leaves them looking desperately lonely at the other end of the table.\n\nOlivier Giroud’s 50th Premier League goal, via a penalty kick after some strange refereeing from Kevin Friend, put Arsenal on their way and a routine victory was effectively wrapped up when Aaron Ramsey broke away and added a second seven minutes before half-time following yet another Mesut Özil assist. It was a superb team goal, showed Arsenal at their counterattacking best, and emphasised the chasm in class.\n\nAston Villa v Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWhile Villa improved in the second half, when they at least played with some intensity, the damage was done and there was no way back for a team who look destined to start next season in the Championship. Villa have now gone a club-record 15 league games without a win, they remain eight points adrift of safety, and Rémi Garde could be forgiven for privately wishing that Arsène Wenger, his mentor, had talked him out of, and not into, this thankless job.\n\nAs for Arsenal, this was the sort of match they had to win if they are going to mount a legitimate title challenge. Özil, who has created 13 Premier League goals this season, showed some splendid touches, Giroud followed his midweek hat-trick against Olympiakos with his 11th goal in his past 13 appearances and Ramsey, who was playing in a more withdrawn role, never stopped running throughout. Wenger described the Welshman as “outstanding”.\n\nArsenal, in truth, were coasting. At times, especially in the second half, they seemed to be playing within themselves, taking their foot off the pedal and almost winding down in preparation for Manchester City’s visit on 21 December. Theo Walcott was withdrawn in that period and Özil also came off as Wenger’s mind started to turn to that intriguing meeting with Manuel Pellegrini’s team at the Emirates.\n\nThrough to the last 16 of the Champions League and able to enjoy the view from the top of the Premier League four days later, Wenger joked that he has had worse weeks in the job. Garde, on the other hand, is in charge of a team stuck in a permanent rut and there was a wry smile afterwards when the Villa manager was asked if he could find some positives. “Every week I am asked the same thing after defeats, which is not easy,” he said.\n\nBereft of confidence, the last thing Villa needed was to concede early, yet they were behind within eight minutes and from that moment on the outcome was never in doubt. Giroud’s opener arrived in slightly odd circumstances and only Friend knows why he took so long to point to the spot after Walcott, running on to Mathieu Flamini’s inviting pass, was pulled back by Alan Hutton and then bundled over for good measure.\n\nStanding no more than 10 yards from the incident, the referee could not have been in a better position and it was curious how he retreated initially, prompting a protest from Walcott, before then awarding the penalty. There was no indication that he received any help from the assistant referee covering that half of the pitch – the official was standing 60 yards away on the opposite touchline – and it can only be assumed that the referee reconsidered his own decision.\n\nEither way, he got it right in the end and Giroud, sending Brad Guzan the wrong way, dispatched his kick with the minimum of fuss. Wenger’s side spent the next half an hour controlling possession for long periods without threatening too much, although Giroud did come close to adding a second when he met Özil’s free-kick with a glancing header only for Rudy Gestede to nod clear.\n\nThe visitors were almost toying with Villa and it was no surprise when they doubled their lead. The goal was a beauty, started and finished by Ramsey in a breathtaking piece of free-flowing football that saw Arsenal sweep from one end of the pitch to the other in a blur of fluid passing and movement. Villa were left wondering what had hit them.\n\nRamsey, deep inside his own half, robbed Idrissa Gana and Giroud nudged the ball on to Özil, who quickly found Walcott. Cutting in from the left, he threaded a lovely pass into the path of the German, who was breaking into the inside-right channel, and he could have decided to go it alone and shoot. Instead, Özil unselfishly squared for Ramsey, who had charged from one end of the pitch to the other, to sweep home emphatically.\n\nFrustrated with Friend’s refereeing as much as their team in the first half, Villa supporters finally had something to cheer after the restart. Playing with much more belief, Garde’s team started to take the game to Arsenal.\n\nGestede’s glancing header drifted wide, Scott Sinclair should have done better with another headed chance – he was totally unmarked inside the six-yard box – Leandro Bacuna curled a 25-yard shot that skimmed the roof of the net and Adama Traoré went close late on.\n\nThat spirited second-half display was never going to be enough, however, and the final whistle was greeted with the boos that have become the soundtrack to Villa’s season.\n\nWith three of their next four league matches against Newcastle, Norwich and Sunderland, Garde admitted that Villa have now entered “must-win” territory. “We can still be safe,” he said, doing his best to sound upbeat.\n\nMan of the match Mesut Özil (Arsenal)"},

Sunday amateur leagues. Jürgen Klopp responded to Divock Origi’s 95th minute equaliser by beating his chest in front of the West Bromwich Albion bench, eyeballing Tony Pulis and leading Liverpool’s players in triumphant applause to the Kop. “Sometimes it takes more than a few seconds to cool down,” he explained. With the heartbeat slowed, the reality of Liverpool’s weaknesses in defence will not have escaped their overexuberant manager.\n\nKlopp’s refusal to shake hands with Pulis after the final whistle and wild celebration of a point salvaged at home in stoppage time reflected a tense, ugly encounter at Anfield. Animosity built between the Liverpool manager and the Albion bench from the moment Dejan Lovren was taken off on a stretcher as a consequence of Craig Gardner’s dangerous challenge. It erupted spectacularly when the substitute Origi spared Liverpool a second successive Premier League defeat with a deflected goal and Klopp revelled in the visitors’ misfortune.\n\nJürgen Klopp snubs Pulis after Liverpool’s late draw with West Bromwich Read more\n\nKlopp said: “We conceded from two set pieces. I don’t know how many of our goals are from set pieces but it feels like 98%. They only play long balls and only want set plays. Maybe the crowd were disappointed but they didn’t show it. It was only one point but it felt like three, an explosion. It was the best atmosphere in my time in England, absolutely great and I wanted to say thank you. Sometimes a point deserved in the right way is more important for the development of the style of play against a team like this. To stay in the game, that is a big moment in football. I really enjoyed this game, I enjoyed the atmosphere with my whole body.”\n\nKlopp’s assessment glossed over Liverpool’s lack of creativity against a towering Albion defence and the instability that Simon Mignolet’s goalkeeping continues to spread throughout his back-line. The German coach had warned Liverpool of Albion’s strength at set pieces but two Chris Brunt corners yielded goals for Craig Dawson and Jonas Olsson, after Jordan Henderson had given the home side a merited lead, while Olsson had another effort disallowed for offside from Gardner’s free-kick.\n\nLiverpool controlled the early stages, their willingness to mix the direct approach with the intricate work of Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana paying dividends. Coutinho played a quick, diagonal cross into the penalty area where Lallana of all people leapt above Brunt to head into the path of the incoming Henderson. The Liverpool captain marked his first league start since August with a sweeping finish beyond Boaz Myhill from close range. Pulis would have appreciated the style of the breakthrough had he not been on the receiving end.\n\nAlbion levelled when Brunt swept an inviting corner to the back of the six-yard box. Mignolet came for the cross but fatally did not collect, waving at thin air as the ball struck Salomón Rondón and Nathanial Clyne and dropped for Dawson to convert beyond the despairing challenge of James Milner. Klopp claimed: “I said to Simon at half-time: ‘If somebody says it was your fault, it is not true, it is my fault. I want a keeper who comes out and tries for everything.’”\n\nThe Belgium keeper almost gifted Pulis’s team a second goal when attempting to keep a Dawson cross in play and finding only James McClean. He survived on that occasion and when Olsson volleyed home from Gardner’s free-kick, he was eventually given offside by an assistant referee who did not raise his flag.\n\nThe second half developed into an increasingly bruising encounter that left Klopp raging at the Albion bench when Lovren was injured by a sickening tackle from Gardner. The midfielder won the ball in a 50-50 with the Croatian defender but followed through with a studs-first challenge that buckled Lovren’s knee. Liverpool’s central defender was carried off with his knee in a brace and an oxygen mask on his face. Gardner was not booked.\n\nMoments earlier Olsson had given the visitors the lead with a glancing header from Brunt’s corner to the near-post. Myhill saved well from Lallana and the substitute Jordon Ibe went close as Liverpool pressed for an equaliser that arrived five minutes into eight minutes of stoppage time. Origi had been summoned from the bench when Lovren departed and Klopp’s boldness was rewarded as the striker’s shot deflected off Gareth McAuley and sailed beyond the wrong-footed Myhill. Cue bedlam in the technical area.\n\n“He has got to do what he has got to do,” was Pulis’s diplomatic take on the finale. “I am more disappointed about the way they came back to make it 2-2. The great thing about this league is, irrespective of all the money, power and talent that clubs like Liverpool have, smaller clubs will come here and have a go and that is what we have done.”\n\nMan

"report": "Newcastle United had not won back-to-back Premier League fixtures since November of last year. They had not won three straight at White Hart Lane since 1911. And when they trailed at half-time to Eric Dier’s headed goal, the historians did not appear ready to be unduly troubled.\n\nMauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham Hotspur manager, described his team’s first-half performance as one of their best of the season, which was probably stretching the truth a little bit but the general point was sound. Spurs were in control. And they had not lost in their previous 14 league fixtures.\n\nNoisy half-time inquest fuels Newcastle win at Spurs, says Steve McClaren Read more\n\nNewcastle, though, staged a revival to thrill their travelling supporters, who included the owner, Mike Ashley, up in the directors’ box, and it culminated in the substitute Ayoze Pérez embarrassing Hugo Lloris at his near post at the very last.\n\nThe Newcastle manager, Steve McClaren, could revel in the changes that he made because another substitute, Aleksandar Mitrovic, had earlier pounced to equalise from close range. It was also Mitrovic who flicked on to set up the winner. Pérez’s first touch was assured and his second, a rasping low shot, squirmed underneath Lloris.\n\nIt was remarkable how history had repeated itself in another sense. In the corresponding fixture last season Tottenham had led 1-0 at the interval only to cave in to lose 2-1 and it was Pérez who scored the winner then, too.\n\nThis was supposed to be the day when Tottenham won to move up into the top four, to set the seal on a period of burgeoning promise and achievement. But instead, they suffered their first league defeat since the opening day of the season, and it said everything about modern football that there were boos from a section of the White Hart Lane crowd at full-time.\n\nIt was Newcastle – driven by Moussa Sissoko in the second half – who were allowed to build on their home win over Liverpool from the previous Sunday and they are now up and out of the relegation zone. But for the first 45 minutes the prospect had looked slim.\n\nTottenham were the better team before the interval, playing some zippy passing stuff in patches, and McClaren had reason to curse the breakthrough, mainly because no manager ever wants to concede from a set piece. Christian Eriksen whipped over the corner from the left and Dier flicked his header towards the far corner. It was helped in by Rob Elliot’s fingertips. It was Dier’s third goal of the season, which is a pretty decent return thus far for a defensive midfielder.\n\nThe pickings had been slim until Erik Lamela, fresh from his hat-trick in last Thursday’s Europa League home win against Monaco, roused himself. He watched Elliot claw away his first-time effort on 36 minutes, after Danny Rose’s smart cut-back, and almost immediately afterwards, from Harry Kane’s flicked header, he surged through and prodded on to the roof of the net.\n\nElliot produced an outstanding reflex save but from the ensuing corner Dier profited and, moments later, Rose flashed a low shot past a far post. Kane, sliding in, was inches from making a decisive contact.\n\nNewcastle had previously scored only three times in seven away games and with Papiss Cissé labouring up front, things did not look good. He had got in the way of a goal-bound shot in the early running from Siem de Jong and also headed off-target from a Paul Dummett cross later in the first half. After the interval he fizzed narrowly wide of the far post, following Sissoko’s surge and pass, and headed weakly at Lloris from a Sissoko cross.\n\nKane worked Elliot from distance in the 53rd minute but the second half came to belong to Newcastle, who showed a hearty appetite for the fight. Sissoko broke on several occasions and it was surprising to see how many of Tottenham’s players faded or made errors to infuriate Pochettino who complained that Spurs were virtual imposters after the interval, impossible to make out from their first-half display. Sissoko bristled with pace and power and he deserved the plaudits that he later heard from McClaren.\n\nNewcastle seemed to be building towards the equaliser and it came after Rose had been penalised for repelling Daryl Janmaat’s cross from the right with a hand. Jack Colback’s free-kick was deep and when Fabricio Coloccini headed back, Chancel Mbemba nodded goalwards. Lloris half-saved but the ball rolled away from him and Toby Alderweireld and, from all of 15 centimetres,, Cisse’s replacement, Mitrovic, stabbed home. As with the winner, Lloris looked slightly suspect.\n\nThere was only one team that was going to win from 1-1. Mitrovic ought to have settled it in the 90th minute only to somehow fail to get a touch to Sissoko’s low cross but Pérez ensured that there would be the happiest of finales for his team.\n\nMan of

"Roberto Martínez praised the threat of Romelu Lukaku despite ruing the striker’s failure to secure three points at Norwich. Lukaku became the first Everton player in 40 years to score for a seventh successive game, but spurned further chances in a first half the visitors dominated.\n\n“That’s where you judge a striker. It’s the amount of threat he carries,” Martínez said. “The clear-cut chances he produced is a very positive sign. On another day he would have scored four goals, or a hat-trick. It’s been another top performance from him. It’s just making sure he keeps creating chances, because it’s very rare that he’s not going to convert more than the one he did today.”\n\nLukaku has scored in six consecutive Premier League games, closing in on Jamie Vardy’s record of goals in 11 successive games. Leicester are Everton’s next opposition next Saturday.\n\nMartínez would swap Lukaku’s shot at history for a clean sheet, after one shutout in the last 10 in the Premier League, with Everton’s defending again culpable for Wes Hoolahan’s equaliser two minutes into the second half.\n\n“I would swap any record just to try to keep a clean sheet,” Martínez said. “As a team we know we’ve got incredible individuals, probably some of the best young players in European football. What we need to do is become a team that can control games and make sure we finish with a win, rather than just performing well and dropping points.\n\n“Overall the performance leaves you with a feeling of disappointment, as that should have been a three-point performance.”\n\nJohn Stones damaged an ankle in the warm-up and appeared to twist his knee during the first half but there is no cause for concern. Martínez said: “He didn’t want to come off. He was magnificent.”\n\nEverton dominated to such an extent they could have been coasting at half-time. The fit-again Leighton Baines hit a post and Arouna Koné was twice denied by Declan Rudd.\n\nAlex Neil felt his side had “polar opposite” performances either side of half-time, when he expressed his displeasure to his players. The Norwich manager said: “Everton could have been leading 2-0 or 3-0 at half-time. We were fortunate it was only 1-0.\n\n“I thought the intensity of our game was poor and once they scored, you could sense a bit of unrest among the fans and that bled into the players. They looked a bit timid and a bit scared to go and express themselves.\n\n“That wasn’t a good enough first half. I wasn’t best pleased. We had a good discussion in terms of what’s acceptable and all the questions I posed to them at half-time they came out and answered.\n\n“The only thing that changed was the way the players attacked the game. Tactically nothing changed.”\n\nThe change that meant Andre Wisdom went off at half-time was prompted by a hamstring injury, but his replacement, Ryan Bennett, made his mark when his header from Robbie Brady’s corner led to Hoolahan’s equaliser.\n\nIt was not pretty, but Norwich cared not a jot as it was their fourth goal in seven Premier League games. The need for a goal was highlighted by their supporters serenading the Everton substitute Steven Naismith as he warmed up. A bid from Norwich was rejected for the Scot in the summer.\n\nCameron Jerome might have won it for the home side but fired over from Hoolahan’s flick. “We definitely had opportunities where we could have gone on to win it,” Neil said."}, {"date": "12/12/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24914, "home_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows":

optimism at Crystal Palace believe this most unpredictable of seasons could potentially yield European football, so victories like this will only fuel such conviction. Alan Pardew’s team bucked a trend here to check a run of seven successive league defeats to Southampton and now loiter right on Tottenham Hotspur’s shoulder in sixth place. These are heady days indeed in this corner of south London.\n\nThat has been achieved by a side who had been saddled with problematic home form and remain without a goal from a conventional striker in the league. Imagine what they might achieve if they had a regular scorer at the tip of their formation, for all that Connor Wickham’s feverish energy and rugged determination drew post-match praise from the management. This win might have been far more comfortable, with excellent opportunities created only to be passed up. As it was, it ended up with the locals hailing the intervention of their goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey, in stoppage time and Pardew mopping his brow in mock relief on the touchline.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read more\n\nThe chance had been squeezed out from a rare defensive error, Scott Dann and Damien Delaney challenging for the same lofted pass only for the loose ball to drop for Shane Long at the centre-halves’ back. The striker, free in the penalty area, gathered the ball and spat away a shot that Hennessey blocked with his legs. “A scary moment, I have to say,” said Pardew. “I thought he was going to score. But Wayne stood up and made it difficult for him. It was a good win, a good performance, a good day for Crystal Palace.” It was not a bad one for Hennessey, either, given the task he has faced in making the goalkeeper’s jersey at Palace his own. Julian Speroni and Alex McCarthy may have to be patient for their own opportunities.\n\nThe victory might actually have been more emphatic, and there would have been a collective gnashing of frustration from the majority within the arena had Southampton, now winless in five games, plucked parity at the last. In Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha the home side boasted the contest’s most effervescent attacking forces, with Jason Puncheon more like his old self and Yohan Cabaye an imperious presence in central midfield. The Frenchman is an inspiration in this lineup, starting and finishing the game’s only goal, and dictating the play almost unnoticed. Those creative talents around him thrive in his calming presence, with Pardew describing his performance as “a masterclass”.\n\nThe goal was actually pilfered after Southampton’s only concerted spell of pressure all afternoon. Hennessey had watched Sadio Mane curl a delicious shot marginally wide of the far post, and then reacted smartly to turn aside Steven Davis’ flicked header from Cedric Soares’ centre. Unperturbed, Palace broke downfield seven minutes from the break with Zaha doing well to control an awkwardly bouncing ball, played by Cabaye from the halfway line, before liberating Bolasie at his side.\n\nThe Congolese initially needed to readjust his body shape, though that served to rock José Fonte on to his heels and, with the centre-half slightly off the pace, the forward was away. He burst to the byline, those elastic legs a blur, with his pull-back dispatched first-time from close range by Cabaye. The Frenchman’s own dart from his original pass had gone completely untracked by a slack midfield and a defence that had been pulled to pieces. In truth, they had already been heavily reliant upon Paulo Gazzaniga up to then, the Argentinian goalkeeper offered a chance by Maarten Stekelenburg’s toe injury and excellent in denying Bolasie, Cabaye and Wickham in quick succession early on.\n\nHe was just as impressive keeping out the forward in the frenzy at the end, pushing out a shot at his near post, and then pawing away Bolasie’s belted volley from the resultant corner. “Neither goalkeeper deserved to be on the losing side,” said Ronald Koeman, a grumpy presence desperately trying to draw positives in defeat. “I’m worried about results, not about how we play football. But today we worked hard and did everything. We had the best chances to score. If we keep the level of today then three points will come, I have no doubts.”\n\nThe Dutchman will surely be proved right on that score, with this team crammed with too much quality to remain in a slump for long.

Champions League group in midweek it was an emphatic return to the ordinary until Yaya Touré produced something special in stoppage time. The home side had just been caught by a 90th minute equaliser and Swansea fully deserved it. But for Joe Hart, easily the busier of the two goalkeepers, the visitors could already have been in front. Given that Swansea only went behind through deserting their defensive duties at a first half corner Manchester City were about as unconvincing as it is possible to be without actually dropping points, though in the short time that remained after Bafétimbi Gomis had levelled Touré managed to save the day.\n\nThere is be an argument for awarding the winning goal to Kelechi Iheanacho, who unintentionally gained the final touch, though Touré’s shot from a narrow angle appeared to be on target anyway. It certainly deserves to be remembered as a Touré goal. The Ivorian did not have one of his most influential afternoons, but his will to win was there when City needed it. It had been a terrible game on a terrible day, yet it boasted an astonishing last five minutes. “I would have been happy with a 1-0 win, because we did not play well,” Pellegrini conceded. “But the last two minutes said a lot about my team. Even though time was short and things were not going well we tried to score, we wanted to win the game.”\n\nFor all their current problems – no manager, allegedly dispirited dressing room, one win in 11 matches – Swansea did not start the game like a side low on confidence. It was their other failing, the lack of a reliable goalscorer, that counted against them most as they had a couple of clear chances to take the lead before the home side settled into their rhythm.\n\nNeat passing from Jack Cork and Gylfi Sigurdsson opened up Manchester City as early as the sixth minute, and though the final ball was intended for André Ayew it turned into a better opportunity for Wayne Routledge, who effortlessly left Nicolás Otamendi behind but was unable to beat Hart. The England goalkeeper was needed again to deny Sigurdsson 10 minutes later when Àngel Rangel played a clever pass behind Gaël Clichy that Routledge turned back from the byline.\n\nSwansea caretaker Alan Curtis stays positive after defeat by Manchester City Read more\n\nManchester City were doing their share of attacking, though with Kevin De Bruyne rested they lacked some of their usual invention and were making hard work of breaking Swansea down until a set piece came to their rescue. Jesús Navas left Neil Taylor on his backside with a sharp turn and shot for goal, only for Ashley Williams to head behind for a corner. Navas swung in a cross from the left and, though Williams appeared to be marking Wilfried Bony at first, by the time the ball arrived the former Swansea striker had lost him and Lukasz Fabianski had little chance with a firm header from the six-yard line.\n\nSwansea have never really replaced Bony, and if it was not exactly a surprise to see him open the scoring against his old club, almost equally inevitable was the sight of Ayew leaping to meet Sigurdsson’s corner a couple of minutes later but putting his header over the bar.\n\nAn ineffective Raheem Sterling was withdrawn at half-time to enable Pellegrini to bolster his midfield defence with Fabian Delph. De Bruyne came on for Silva midway through the second half without making much difference.\n\nThe only save Fabianski had to make was from a Touré free-kick, although the Ivorian did put in a strong run moments later before shooting too high. Hart had to save on two more occasions from the impressive Sigurdsson, and when he was finally beaten by the Icelander five minutes from the end the goal did not stand because of dangerous play by Gomis. The referee was probably right but it was a close call.\n\nIf that was tough on Swansea tougher still was to come. Gomis brushed away Eliaquim Mangala with contemptuous ease to reach Rangel’s through ball and beat Hart legitimately with a blistering finish. Swansea celebrated wildly, as well they might, with the fourth official about to hold up the board indicating four minutes of added time.\n\nThanks to Touré the celebrations proved premature. It seems to be true that struggling sides do not get any luck, though on the evidence of this encouraging performance it is hard to see why Swansea should struggle.\n\n“We were excellent,” the caretaker manager, Alan Curtis, said. “We deserved something from the game and we thought we had it. It was disappointing to lose after we had clawed our way back but we set a standard that we now have to keep up. Every point is vital.”"}, {"date": "12/12/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 43989, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [19]}, {"name": "Sebastián Coates", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Ola Toivonen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yann M'Vila", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Duncan Watmore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [19], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Matthews", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeremain Lens", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Almen Abdi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Manuel Jurado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [4], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Obbi Oularé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Carlos Paredes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Berghuis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alessandro Diamanti", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Giedrius Arlauskis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A couple of hours before kick-off, north-east England received its first snowfall of winter. Minutes into the first half Sam Allardyce must have wished it had been sufficiently severe to prompt the postponement of a game that would leave his side stuck in the bottom three and a thoroughly impressive Watford surveying the view from the heights of seventh place.\n\nSunderland’s manager had cautioned John O’Shea and the rest of his apparently frozen back-five about the danger posed by Odion Ighalo but such warnings were clearly in vain. Individual defenders had been sent video clips of how to try to stop the Nigerian striker but they either failed to open the attachments sent to their laptops and tablets or, more probably, simply found the task of putting theory into practice well beyond them.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read more\n\nBy the end, an amalgam of his own profligacy – he missed three inviting chances – and Costel Pantilimon had come between Ighalo and the celebration of a hat-trick. No matter, Sunderland’s failure to prevent him reprising what looked a well rehearsed training ground manoeuvre ensured Quique Sánchez Flores’s centre-forward effectively settled matters in the fourth minute.\n\nWhen Allan Nyom – industry personified down the visitors’ right flank – crossed low, Ighalo ghosted in front of a startled Sebastián Coates before directing the ball beyond Pantilimon from close range. Or at least that is how it appeared to the naked eye; television replays suggest Coates may possibly have applied the final touch.\n\nFlores’s sole concern was the scoreline’s slenderness. “We could have won more comfortably,” said a manager who, having hugged assorted players, walked off at the end arm in arm with Troy Deeney, his captain and an indefatigable presence at both ends of the pitch. “We’re always thinking about how we can improve but I’m very proud of everyone.”\n\nIt was no surprise that Flores had appeared slightly miffed when Allardyce claimed this was a relegation six-pointer. Perhaps attempting to prove they are entitled to harbour somewhat loftier ambitions, Watford should really have doubled their advantage after Ighalo seamlessly turned O’Shea before his shot was blocked. It provoked an almighty goalmouth scramble that concluded with José Manuel Jurado shooting against a post.\n\nAllardyce barely had time to sigh with relief before scrapping a five-man defence that was clearly malfunctioning in the absence of the unwell Younès Kaboul. With DeAndre Yedlin – responsible for a few concessions of possession – taken off, Jack Rodwell was introduced into a central midfield department also struggling without the injured Lee Cattermole.\n\nAlthough Pantilimon did well to repel a low, curling strike from Étienne Capoue, Sunderland’s new look 4-1-4-1 ensured they saw a bit more of the ball, even appearing mildly threatening at times.\n\nNot that this prevented Watford from continuing to menace on the counterattack or the home side being booed off by the near 44,000-strong crowd at half-time.\n\nEndeavouring to change the mood music, Allardyce pressed almost every available tactical button, a process that meant the ineffective Fabio Borini was replaced by Adam Johnson.\n\nWatford, finally, needed to do some proper defending but they seemed rather good at it, generally restricting their hosts to shooting from long range until finally becoming somewhat unnerved by Jermain Defoe’s arrival from the bench.\n\nBefore Defoe’s emergence – coinciding with Allardyce’s introduction of a diamond formation – Heurelho Gomes had done little notable bar divert Rodwell’s vicious drive, but the switch was to precipitate all sorts of questions as to why the former England striker had not been sent on earlier.\n\nAlmost immediately Defoe had the ball in the back of the net, only for that strike to be, correctly, ruled out for offside. Suddenly Sunderland were rampant. Duncan Watmore unleashed a swerving shot that whizzed fractionally wide and Gomes performed wonders to deny Defoe before watching, gratefully, as Johnson and Defoe volleyed marginally off target.\n\nIn between Pantilimon, Coates and his own miscue prevented the rapidly breaking Ighalo from scoring.\n\n“We didn’t play very well in the first half. We had to change the system after 20 minutes to try and load up the midfield but the second half was a different story,” said Allardyce. “The biggest disappointment is that the gap between us and mid-table is getting bigger. If we can’t win we need to make sure we draw.”"}, {"date": "12/12/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34857, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Oxford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Josh Cullen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Shawcross", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philipp Wollscheid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Marco van Ginkel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [56]}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Phil Bardsley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [56], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jon Walters", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jakob Haugaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "West Ham United and Stoke City had compelling reasons to feel quietly optimistic after an entertaining goalless draw that left the Upton Park crowd in a surprisingly content mood. A stalemate in this fixture would have been a cure for insomnia in the past, but here was further evidence their respective cultural evolutions could bring both sides success.\n\nThe length of West Ham’s injury list made this an acceptable point for Slaven Bilic. Although they have not won since beating Chelsea 2-1 on 24 October, a winless run that was stretched to six matches after a draw that kept them a point above Stoke, their makeshift side was applauded off after a commendable effort against opponents who threatened to turn the game into an ordeal.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read more\n\nFor Stoke, it was a missed opportunity after their 2-0 victory over Manchester City. They fluffed a couple of glorious chances in the first half and West Ham were indebted to Adrián for making two late saves to deny Mame Biram Diouf.\n\n“I think, as 0-0 goes, there was plenty of incident,” Mark Hughes said. The Stoke manager added: “We’ll look back at the end of the season and think it was a decent point.”\n\nBilic agreed. “Both teams defended really well,” West Ham’s manager said. “It was a very good game. With a little bit of luck we could have won this game.”\n\nWest Ham certainly had their moments as the match wore on, while Stoke bristled with intent during the opening 30 minutes. There was a swagger to their play and West Ham’s defence looked vulnerable without the injured Winston Reid.\n\nIbrahim Afellay started instead of the injured Xherdan Shaqiri on the right, and he created three chances in the space of a couple of minutes. Afellay’s best days might be behind him at the age of 29, but his neat footwork was a joy to watch during the first half and Stoke’s threat faded once West Ham had a read on him.\n\nThe first flash of Afellay’s class almost led to Marco van Ginkel scoring the opener, only for the midfielder to catch Adrián in the midriff with his studs. Afellay then forced the West Ham goalkeeper to save with his feet and the flurry ended with Van Ginkel wastefully dragging his shot wide from close range.\n\nMauro Zárate was failing to protect Aaron Cresswell. Glen Johnson burst into the area and Marko Arnautovic, who later hit the bar with a deflected free-kick, stabbed wide from six yards out.\n\nWithout the injured Manuel Lanzini, Victor Moses, Dimitri Payet and Diafra Sakho, West Ham found it tough to create chances against opponents who have kept seven clean sheets in their past nine matches. Andy Carroll was engaged in a futile wrestling match with Shawcross. Michail Antonio was willing on his full debut, ramming one volley straight at Jack Butland, but Zárate was largely ineffective in the areas that mattered.\n\nBilic and Hughes made positive substitutions in the second half. West Ham were boosted by the return of Enner Valencia from an ankle injury, while Stoke’s attack was given a more robust look by the introduction of Diouf.\n\nBojan Krkic had been snuffed out in his central role for Stoke and Hughes’s tweaks would have paid off if Diouf’s finishing had been more incisive. His misses nearly proved costly when Zárate crashed a shot against the left post, before Butland pushed Valencia’s swerving free-kick over.\n\nCheikhou Kouyaté and James Tomkins had efforts cleared off the line in the fourth minute of stoppage time, but it was a match when the teams cancelled each other out with their lack of ruthlessness."}, {"date": "12/12/2015", "arena": "Vitality Stadium",

troubled times at Manchester United. This thrilling win came a week after victory at Chelsea, leaving Eddie Howe’s top-flight debutants celebrating unprecedented achievements and United fans questioning harder what Louis van Gaal’s philosophy really means.\n\nThis defeat was a severe blow to the Dutchman, just days after United’s premature elimination from the Champions League. United, who have now failed to win in five matches, returned to domestic duty with a side even more depleted than the one beaten in Wolfsburg on Tuesday, injuries to Chris Smalling and Matteo Darmian forcing Van Gaal to field an inexperienced back four, with Paddy McNair and Guillermo Varela joining Daley Blind and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson.\n\nLouis van Gaal says Manchester United can still win the Premier League Read more\n\nBut sympathy has been in short supply for Van Gaal, whose pre-game grumbles about United fans’ unreasonable expectations did nothing to spread belief in his management. Bournemouth supporters are certainly unlikely to tolerate sob stories from United, as Howe has had to contend with a fraction of United’s resources and an injury roster just as debilitating. But there is no doubt that Howe’s philosophy fits.\n\nBournemouth immediately attacked United’s weak spot here, tearing into the visitors’ rejigged defence from the start. Marouane Fellaini deflected a header from Dan Gosling into the side netting in the first minute but United’s woes were about to deepen. Junior Stanislas scored directly from the ensuing set piece, David de Gea’s fingertips not strong enough to prevent a curling delivery from going in at the back post. De Gea had hitherto been United’s most consistent performer in an underwhelming season and the sight of him being caught out from a corner did not suggest the club’s fortunes were about to soar.\n\nUnited sought to banish that impression quickly. Artur Boruc had to excel to stop the visitors equalising in the fifth minute, tipping away a 10-yard shot from Fellaini and then diving to save Michael Carrick’s headed follow-up. It was an encouraging reaction from the visitors, who benefited from unwitting assistance from Stanislas in the 18th minute, when a wayward pass from the forward led to Anthony Martial racing through on goal. The striker fired a low shot inches wide. Stanislas could have celebrated that reprieve by treating himself to another goal when United’s defence was bisected by a wonderful pass from Gosling. But this time De Gea did well, diving to dispossess Stanislas as he tried to skip past the goalkeeper at the edge of the area.\n\nThat chance exemplified Bournemouth’s menace on the counterattack as United enjoyed the majority of possession in the first half. Van Gaal’s side did not attain the level of control that their manager craves but, on the other hand, they were not as ponderous as they have been on occasions this season, playing with a higher tempo and, due mainly to the presence of Fellaini, more directness. With Bournemouth full of zest and defiance, the game zipped by.\n\nUnited fans, however, were growing concerned by the absence of more clear scoring opportunities for their team and gave an airing to the familiar “attack, attack, attack” appeal in the 23rd minute. Moments later their team drew level. Carrick aimed a fine pass over the Bournemouth defence and Memphis Depay ran on to it and killed the ball on his chest before shooting from 12 yards. Boruc saved but Fellaini reacted sharpest to bundle the rebound into the net.\n\nBut things remained far from rosy for United and they suffered another injury on the half-hour, with Jesse Lingard replaced by Andreas Pereira. Ashley Young was left on the bench, as he had been at Wolfsburg.\n\nThe half-time scoreline seemed fair and United could be reasonably satisfied with the showing of their youngsters, especially Borthwick-Jackson. But they deteriorated alarmingly in the second period and struggled to contain Bournemouth, especially the rapid Josh King.\n\nIt was a surprise to see Simon Francis, a centre-back, maraud all the way into the United box in the 52nd minute and unleash a shot De Gea batted behind for a corner. Bournemouth then enacted a well-planned set piece and Blind lost track of King, allowing the forward, who started his career at United, to hammer Matt Ritchie’s low delivery into the net from eight yards. “Two set plays, two goals, you cannot accept that as a manager,” Van Gaal said. “Also against Wolfsburg, that was the reason they lost, so it is a very strong lesson for us.”\n\nUnited grew frantic in their search for another equaliser and their raggedness left them more vulnerable to the speed of Bournemouth, who did not merely sit on their lead although they had to defend plenty. Francis’s foiling of Fellaini on the hour was one of several excellent blocks. But Bournemouth created the best chance to score again, Glenn Murray sending a shot skyward when clean through.\n\nVan Gaal tried the solution that had failed at Wolfsburg, introducing Nick Powell as Young and Morgan Schneiderlin were left on the bench. United haphazardly chased an equaliser Bournemouth made sure never came.\n\nHowe hailed his midfielder Harry Arter for keeping his emotions in check after he and his partner lost a child at birth in midweek. Arter was close to tears when booked for a fulsome challenge, with Howe embracing his combative star on the final whistle.\n\n“It’s been a really tough week for Harry and his family,” the manager said. “Life has a way of throwing these things at people and families, and it’s been a hugely emotional week for him.”"}, {"date": "07/12/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 35736,

The Crystal Palace defender scored once again on his Merseyside homecoming but, unlike last month’s late header at Anfield, he was denied the match-winner’s glory by a more natural predator. Romelu Lukaku gave Everton a deserved point and Chelsea another reminder of what they have lost with his 50th goal in 100 games for Roberto Martínez’s side.\n\nLukaku struck for the 14th time this season, for the seventh time in six matches and in the fifth Premier League game in succession – the first Everton player to do so – to puncture Palace’s resistance in an absorbing game at Goodison Park. Jamie Vardy’s goal streak and place at the top of the Premier League’s scorer’s chart remain in his sights. Lukaku’s overall display gave further credence to Martínez’s claim that the 22-year-old is an established elite-level player with more to come. But this was a night when the managers shared the positives as well as the points.\n\nAlan Pardew bemoaned the officials’ refusal to award the visitors two penalties – for a shirt-pull on Mile Jedinak by Gareth Barry and Ramiro Funes Mori’s late trip of Jordon Mutch – but a hard-earned draw and sixth place in the table provided ample compensation. His 31st away point since returning to Palace in January, a tally bettered in that period only by Arsenal’s 35, was further evidence of his team’s commitment, discipline and organisation.\n\n“I think the pull on the shirt was certainly a penalty. I went to see the linesman on my side about that one,” said the Palace manager. “The second one I think is a penalty as well. He has gone to ground, he has not won the ball and has clipped Mutch. I can’t understand how he has not seen that from 12 yards. But I’m not going to moan about the result. That was a really high quality Premier League game with tough men out there.”\n\nMartínez was more reluctant to distribute praise, harshly describing Palace as “not good on the eye but, with their power and pace, they have the perfect combination away from home”. The sight of Everton hitting the frame of the Palace goal three times may have fuelled the manager’s resentment.\n\nHe was rightly effusive on the form of his £28m record signing, however. “Rom has been very consistent in the last 12 months, that is 27 goals in the calendar year which is quite impressive,” said Martínez. “When you look at the overall development in the last 12 months, it makes you realise what a special footballer we have here.\n\n“We are not talking about potential now. We are talking about an established goalscorer who has a big responsibility in our team and can control the moment.” Lukaku’s goalscoring record over 100 Everton games is the best since Joe Royle’s 51 in the late 1960s.\n\nThe performances of Dann and Damien Delaney against the in-form Belgian were essential to Pardew’s game-plan. All three impressed, as did both goalkeepers and the woodwork from a Palace point of view. Lukaku struck a post with Everton’s best opening of the first half after exchanging passes with Ross Barkley and beating Wayne Hennessey in the visiting goal with a low left-foot drive from the edge of the area.\n\nWayne Rooney was in the director’s box, along with his son Kai, to watch his boyhood team while Manchester United prepare for a crucial Champions League test in Wolfsburg without their injured captain. He will have been familiar with the long wait for a breakthrough.\n\nGerard Deulofeu took a while to find his range but was central to Everton’s improvement once he did so. The home side’s threat increased gradually, Connor Wickham diverting a Barkley free-kick against his own crossbar, yet it was Palace who made the breakthrough after catching Martínez’s side on the counter-attack.\n\nTim Howard produced a fine stop to deny Jason Puncheon after Wickham and Yohan Cabaye combined on the break but, from Puncheon’s subsequent corner, Dann always had the run on Barry and sent a towering header beyond the American goalkeeper. “Scott is having a great season for us,” said Pardew. “I keep giving him a nod towards England. Not only does he defend well but he is a big threat from set pieces.”\n\nEverton almost struck back immediately but, remarkably, hit the woodwork for a third time when Lukaku beat Hennessey with a dipping left-foot shot from 25 yards only for the bar to intervene. The Palace keeper had earlier made a terrific save from Tom Cleverley’s volley towards the top corner but was beaten with nine minutes remaining when Barkley released Deulofeu down the right, the Spaniard drove a cross to the back post and Lukaku, inevitably and deservedly, converted."}, {"date": "06/12/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 51273, "home_team": {"name":

Steve McClaren. As Merseyside reflected on an afternoon that made all the recent talk of an Anfield title challenge seem a little silly, Newcastle United’s manager quite possibly saved his job.\n\nThe former England coach’s taut, tense body language betrayed the reality that, had his side suffered yet another stumble, McClaren could well have been sacked. Instead he not only choreographed a most unexpected win but saw Newcastle keep a rare clean sheet.\n\nIt might have been different had Alberto Moreno’s exquisite 79th-minute volley not been ruled out for offside, when television replays suggested it should have stood. Not that Klopp made too much of a fuss about that particular piece of officiating on a day when his players produced their worst performance since he succeeded Brendan Rogers.\n\nIt had been an awful day at the office for the German but, creditably, he possessed sufficient class to recognise that this was potentially a watershed moment for an old Bundesliga adversary. Once Georginio Wijnaldum had quite sublimely put the result beyond doubt, the German stepped over to the home technical area and embraced McClaren, who spent nine months as manager of Wolfsburg in 2010-11, with real warmth.\n\nAn hour and a half earlier the Yorkshireman would not have dared to envisage it ending this well. Jordon Ibe’s pace on Liverpool’s right flank posed his nervous team – and Paul Dummett especially – persistent problems.\n\nFortunately for McClaren, Liverpool lacked end product. So much so that a close-range miss on Christian Benteke’s part and a shot, curled just over, by Ibe represented the sum of their first-half threat. Perhaps it was a little bit of complacency, a sense that their mere presence on the pitch would be sufficient to beat Newcastle, but collectively they rarely matched Klopp’s dynamism in the technical area.\n\nIn mitigation, the injury that sidelined Philippe Coutinho and the physical fragility that ensured Daniel Sturridge began on the bench hardly helped the Liverpool cause on a day when their manager experimented with a flexible version of 4-4-2.\n\nGranted this configuration was sufficiently fluid to frequently morph into a more familiar 4-3-3 but generally it seemed designed to deploy Ibe and James Milner as orthodox wingers, with a brief to attack Dummett and Daryl Janmaat. This might have been all right in theory but, not for the first time, Milner proved why he is much better deployed as a central midfielder. Meanwhile, without Coutinho and Sturridge around, Benteke looked a little lost – and very ordinary.\n\nLiverpool were playing far too many long balls in the forward’s direction but McClaren had no reason to relax. Aware a side in sharper mode than Klopp’s might well have punished some needless concessions of possession in central midfield, the Gallowgate End were becoming restless.\n\nWatching the recalled Siem de Jong fail to meet a volley before controlling the bouncing ball with a hand and then shinning it into the touch, it was hard to blame them. That cameo seemed horribly emblematic of a thoroughly underwhelming opening half which ended unadorned by a single shot on target, but almost imperceptibly something was shifting, and Klopp’s demeanour slowly shifted from jovially laid-back to scratchy and irritable.\n\nRoberto Firmino, who was beckoned to the technical area and admonished for pulling out of a challenge, summed up Liverpool’s strangely tentative mood. Very shortly afterwards the Firmino/Benteke attacking axis was replaced by Sturridge and Adam Lallana.Still, though, Lucas Leiva’s passing radar kept going awry.\n\nFinally cottoning on to the fact Liverpool’s gegenpressing was malfunctioning, Newcastle’s confidence rose and when Moussa Sissoko whipped in a cross, Wijnaldum stuck out a boot. His connection was not the best and the shot was going well wide, but the ball struck Martin Skrtel on the thigh and deflected beyond Simon Mignolet.\n\nNewcastle were ahead without really having had an effort on target all afternoon. Unconcerned, they set about further frustrating opponents who since the arrival of Sturridge and Lallana had been forcing them ever deeper.\n\nMoreno’s disallowed strike highlighted their vulnerability but generally intelligent defending from Fabricio Coloccini – who would have been dropped at centre half had Mike Williamson not damaged a hamstring – ensured that Rob Elliot remained relatively untested in goal. Admittedly Sturridge might have done better than shoot wide after being sublimely put through by Lallana, but it was his sole chance.\n\nMcClaren had pondered omitting Sissoko and Wijnaldum along with Coloccini but his faith was rewarded as Sissoko eluded Moreno and launched an imperious stoppage-time counterattack, concluding with Wijnaldum quite brilliantly dinking the ball over Mignolet."},

The headline acts in Stoke’s fourth consecutive home victory were Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic, who scored both goals and could and should have had a hat-trick.\n\nShaqiri was the Potters’ creator and the visitors’ tormentor-in-chief. It was his two sublime balls that punched the hole in the visiting defence from which Arnautovic beat Joe Hart.\n\nManchester City’s feeble defeat at Stoke unacceptable, says Joe Hart Read more\n\nAs Hughes said: “We had a number of chances. We were way ahead of Man City and could have made it embarrassing for them. But we’re happy with two goals and the fact that we knew what we had to do today and we went out there and did it. It came off because the players worked so hard to make it happen.”\n\nStoke were so impressive, defying the stereotype that they are a dour, unadventurous proposition. But the visitors, in truth, were close to embarrassing. There are ways to be beaten and to go down toothless while hitting passes straight out, lacking a first touch, and having all other base elements of the elite player missing is unforgivable.\n\nThe fault line in Pellegrini’s team runs through the defence. When Vincent Kompany is absent they struggle. The captain is out with his latest calf injury and yet again his side paid. Martín Demichelis, Saturday’s replacement for the Belgian, had already been left behind by a scampering Arnautovic before he punished City with the opener. This time the Austrian beat Demichelis to Shaqiri’s perfectly measured cross and it was 1-0. Yet the centre-back would not have been exposed if Fernando had earlier challenged the Swiss along the Stoke right to prevent him motoring forward and finding Arnautovic.\n\nMore of the same slipshod defending was about to come. The Stoke No10’s first came after seven minutes, his next was on the quarter-hour. Again, Shaqiri was the provider. Again, Fernando, who suffered a hamstring problem and so could be a seventh City player unavailable through injury, failed to reach him. This time the forward skipped infield from the right and passed forward towards Bojan Krkic. The latter failed to collect and the ball travelled on to Arnautovic. Bacary Sagna may have been covering across from right-back but the Frenchman should still have been closer. He was not and Hart was given no chance by Arnautovic for his fifth of the campaign for the club.\n\nSo scant were the visitors’ forays into Stoke territory that any felt like news. Kevin De Bruyne was as becalmed as Raheem Sterling, Wilfried Bony and David Silva, who was making a first league start since 3 October. The Belgian did dart along the left once before pinging the ball in towards Silva. The Spaniard allowed it to run and the move folded.\n\nManuel Pellegrini pleased with Manchester City’s response to injuries Read more\n\nAt the other end Stoke’s ability to carve through the Sky Blues had become regulation by the break. First, Arnautovic was slipped in with ease by Krkic. Later, the latter strolled past the struggling Demichelis into Hart’s area. And, Arnautovic (yet again) had a golden chance for his third. This time Glenn Whelan’s left boot placed the ball on to the 26-year-old’s head and while the effort wrongfooted Hart it was inches wide of the right post.\n\nFour minutes from the interval Jack Butland saved a fierce Aleksandar Kolarov shot from close in on an angle from the left and this was about as good as it got all day for the left-back’s team.\n\nWhen the sides had walked off the visitors were fortunate to be only 2-0 behind and to still have a chance. The potent Shaqiri-Arnautovic axis again came close to extending their team’s advantage. The former beat the comatose rearguard with the same familiar ball around the back and the latter was unlucky to see his shot rebound from Hart’s left post, the Austrian’s standing foot slipping as he unloaded with the right.\n\nNormal business was resumed when the second half began. Sterling and Kolarov delivered miscued balls, and Krkic and Arnautovic each might have beaten Hart. These opportunities came from the same passage of play: Krkic dribbled along the right and when Hart saved Arnautovic failed to finish the rebound.\n\nLater, Krkic slipped in Arnautovic, who squared the ball to Shaqiri. The goal was gaping, Hart was out of position, but he failed to make it 3-0.\n\nBy the closing third of the contest Jesús Navas, for Silva, Kelechi Iheanacho, for Bony, and Fabian Delph, for Fernandinho, had all been thrown on by Pellegrini. The changes made little difference. On afternoons such as this – the 4-1 defeats at Tottenham Hotspur and at home to Liverpool are other illustrations – City seem more like title pretenders than genuine contenders."}, {"date":

sluggish, incisive and oddly jumpy as Olivier Giroud scored at both ends, one Sunderland’s equaliser, the other the second of his side’s three goals. At the end of a week when all the talk has been of Arsenal’s mob-handed injury crisis the win leaves them second in the Premier League, still paddling, still defiantly afloat.\n\nVictory against a composed, fast-breaking Sunderland was a reminder that there is still plenty of attacking edge in this team. While Mesut Özil – who again looked at times like he’d wandered in from some superior parallel universe – can still twist and turn and pick a pass there will always be hope.\n\nFans jeer as Manchester United are held to dull stalemate by West Ham Read more\n\nFor all that, by the end Arsenal had six defenders on the pitch and the visiting manager, Sam Allardyce, was urging his team on wildly from the touchline. Sunderland broke with pace and purpose at times, with Duncan Watmore an energetic menace throughout.\n\nThey ought to have equalised with two minutes left with the score at 2-1 – Patrick van Aanholt shooting over the bar from 10 yards with the goal gaping after a fine Jack Rodwell pass. “We exploited the weaknesses of Arsenal very well apart from putting the ball in the net,” Allardyce said. “I’ve never been here and created as many chances as we made today.”\n\nFor all the talk of twangs and tweaks Arsenal were still able to field a strong team with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joel Campbell replacing the injured Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sánchez, and Mathieu Flamini and Aaron Ramsey manning a depleted central midfield.\n\nSunderland lined up in a straight 4-5‑1, their grass-hued away kit creating a slightly unnerving camouflage-swarm effect as that massed, flat back-line stood shoulder-to-shoulder. The visitors came to play, though, and with four minutes gone they should have opened the scoring as Watmore took Arsenal’s entire back six out of the game with a diagonal pass to Fabio Borini. Unmarked, he shot straight at Petr Cech – the finish of a man who has one goal since May 2014.\n\nSunderland kept coming. Five minutes later Borini drew another save from Cech, this time with a close-range prod to the corner after more beavering from Watmore. Arsenal, meanwhile, were in Olympiakos mode, waiting for the game to turn, ponderously, their way.\n\nÖzil made the opening goal, scored pretty much out of nowhere 12 minutes before half-time. Ramsey fed the ball into Giroud. He laid it back to Özil, who stroked a delightful little pass inside the full-back for Campbell to slip the ball past Costel Pantilimon.\n\nCampbell celebrated his second Premier League goal by sucking on a dummy hidden in his shorts, although he might have considered offering it to Özil, whose drive and execution made the goal at a moment when Arsenal were flat. It was Özil’s ninth assist, to go with four goals, in his last 13 games in all competitions.\n\nSunderland’s equaliser came just before half-time, helped along by some horribly limp defending. Yann M’Vila delivered a low free-kick from the left. Ola Toivonen, unmarked, skipped over the ball and Giroud poked out a leg to shin the ball into his own net. At the end of a brittle half from Arsenal it was a fittingly porous moment, the kind of goal you might expect to see most weeks in the under-eights where blocking the ball or marking an opponent have yet to be fully ingrained.\n\nWest Brom’s James McClean strikes to deny record-equalling Tottenham Read more\n\nArsenal pushed a little more at the start of the second half, but Sunderland might have taken the lead on the hour as Watmore fed Steven Fletcher whose low hard shot was palmed past the post by Cech. From the corner, Fletcher almost prodded in at the far post.\n\nGiroud, though, had a point to prove and with 65 minutes gone, from the same patch of grass from where he’d scored the own goal, Arsenal’s centre-forward put them ahead with a neat, headed finish made by Ramsey’s cross. Giroud grabbed the ball and walloped it up into the stands in relief.\n\nWith the returning Theo Walcott introduced on the right, Arsenal looked more urgent. They duly added a third just before the end, Ramsey poking in after a series of ricochets.\n\n“It was a very, very important game for us for psychological reasons,” Arsène Wenger said. “We were edgy in the first half against a well-organised team. But in the second half the team showed their mental strength.”"}, {"date": "05/12/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75350, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [44]}, {"name": "Bastian Schweinsteiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Memphis Depay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [44], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Borthwick-Jackson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Guillermo Varela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Song", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [37]}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [37], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Oxford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Wayne Rooney had an alibi for this latest Manchester United disappointment. If the home side’s play was slow and ineffective, lacking conviction in front of goal, it clearly could not be the injured captain’s fault. This could have been the day when United overtook their neighbours in the top four, instead it was another letdown.\n\nThe home wingers displayed an early confidence but soon lost it, the midfield passing was predictable and frequently inaccurate, consequently Anthony Martial was as uninfluential as Rooney has been. United have now drawn their last three games and scored one goal in the process, so good luck to them on Tuesday night with their must-win Champions League game at Wolfsburg.\n\nManchester City caught napping by Stoke’s Marko Arnautovic Read more\n\n“We don’t have any luck, but we need to be more composed too,” Louis van Gaal said. “We dominated in the second half but you have to score. We need to get over this period because with the chances we are creating we could be first in the league. But you have to put them in. I am not so worried, but everybody knows we must score in Wolfsburg.”\n\nUnusually for Old Trafford these days the game got off to an eventful start. Marouane Fellini sent a header narrowly over Adrián’s bar from Paddy McNair’s inviting cross in the opening minutes, then David de Gea prevented an early goal at the other end by coming out to save from Victor Moses. Actually Moses should have done better with that early chance, particularly as he pulled up injured before the interval. He had only the goalkeeper to beat after Daley Blind had wrongfooted his own defence by passing straight to Mark Noble. West Ham could not have asked for a clearer opportunity to go in front.\n\nFellaini’s ability in the air was being put to good use, and when he knocked down a cross for Martial the striker seemed certain to score with a close-range shot on the turn, only to find Winston Reid putting his body in the way to block. With West Ham hitting the same post twice in quick succession, once when Chris Smalling and Mauro Zárate challenged for the loose ball after De Gea spilled a cross, the next time when Reid was unlucky with a header from a corner, there was more goalmouth incident in the first half hour than this crowd has seen in whole games of late.\n\nThere was a certain amount of atmosphere too, thanks mostly to the West Ham fans keeping up a persistent din and celebrating the 15th anniversary of Roy Keane’s prawn sandwich remarks by noting the reserve of the home support. “Is this the Emirates?” they chorused, getting in two digs for the price of one. Reid was having a busy game, involved at both ends, as well as getting on the end of an elbow from Bastian Schweinsteiger just before half-time that ought to have earned the German at least a booking. “He deserved to be sent off,” Slaven Bilic said. “The referee told me he didn’t see it. Fair enough, I believe him.”\n\nArsenal’s Olivier Giroud recovers after scoring Sunderland equaliser Read more\n\nThe tempo had dropped by the break, however, and the second half was a plodding affair all too familiar to critics of Van Gaal’s patient passing game. By the hour mark only the flair and occasional audacity of Zárate was keeping the West Ham fans awake. The forward should have scored when a touch from Andy Carroll played him in behind the home back line yet he managed to miss the target completely after timing his run to perfection to stay onside.\n\nIn the closing stages West Ham were defending most of the time and living a little dangerously, as their opponents applied pressure without managing to make it tell. Juan Mata capped an anonymous game by shooting wide, Schweinsteiger’s last act before being substituted was to fire over the bar. Ten minutes from the end United at least put a stylish attacking move together, Memphis Depay and Fellaini combining to allow Martial a shot, though the effort went wide, as did one from Jesse Lingard moments later.\n\nThere was no need for spectators to chant “attack, attack, attack” (although a few did), because United were attacking.

Ronald Koeman’s team shared the points by passing up an abundance of opportunities before allowing Joleon Lescott to put Villa into an improbable lead. Oriol Romeu came off the bench to score for the home side, who failed to make another breakthrough despite dominating. For Villa this was progress.\n\n“We suffered a lot but the team showed spirit,” said Rémi Garde, who has now presided over two draws in four matches in charge. “Southampton were pushing and creating many chances but I never saw one of my players get down. Everyone was fighting for one another. We have shown the spirit that we need to show in every game to avoid relegation.”\n\nArsenal’s Olivier Giroud recovers after scoring Sunderland equaliser Read more\n\nKoeman was aghast that his team did not welcome Villa as brutally as they had done in May, when they won 6-1. “We were 4-0 up after 20 minutes in that game and we had four big opportunities in the first 20 minutes here also,” said the frustrated Dutchman, who wondered whether his players’ inaccuracy was rooted in their three-game losing streak prior to this.\n\n“If you miss four chances and don’t get one on target, I don’t understand,” said Koeman. “Maybe it’s a lack of confidence or having more doubts than normal, but the players have quality and need to bring more.”\n\nSadio Mané scored a hat-trick in record time in the May victory and the winger created Southampton’s first chance here in the first minute, slinking past Leandro Bacuna before pulling a pass back to Dusan Tadic, who shot over from 12 yards. That pattern would recur, as Graziano Pellè was guilty of an equally wayward finish two minutes later before Victor Wanyama headed wide from eight yards and Mané blazed over from 16.\n\nRudy Gestede cleared off the line in 19th minute after Brad Guzan punched a corner to José Fonte. Then Mané missed again, heading over from close range.\n\nVilla were a shambles defensively while all over the pitch they behaved like determined contrarians, utterly eschewing the current trend for pressing opponents. Yet the seeming inevitability of an opening goal for the hosts sucked the intensity out of Southampton’s play. They should have been punished for dropping their standards in the 29th minute, when Villa’s most dynamic player, Jordan Veretout, jinked down the right and crossed for Gestede. The striker fluffed his shot from 15 yards.\n\nPellè missed with a header after Lescott failed to cut out a cross by Mané in the 34th minute. But Lescott soon made up for that by exploiting equally dozy defending by Southampton, guiding the ball into the net from close range after a corner by Veretout.\n\nWatford’s Troy Deeney spot-on to leave Norwich City struggling Read more\n\nWanyama fired over as Southampton tried to make amends immediately and Mané had a shot deflected wide early in the second half but Villa were performing better now. Garde’s side put together spells of tidy possession and threatened to increase their lead with a couple of long shots. Mostly, however, the visitors defended more diligently. When Southampton managed to prise Villa apart, they were thwarted by last-ditch interventions, Alan Hutton blocking a shot by Steven Davis in the 63rd minute.\n\nWhen Davis put Juanmi one-on-one with the goalkeeper eight minutes later, Guzan saved. But Villa could not maintain their vigilance and Southampton equalised with a goal similar to the one that they had conceded, Romeu stabbing James Ward-Prowse’s corner into the net.\n\nAt least Villa did not crumble after that. They would have regained the lead if Ashley Westwood had not slashed wide after a pass by Carlos Sánchez.

For once the story was not about Jamie Vardy, unable to equal Jimmy Dunne’s top-flight record of scoring in a dozen consecutive games, but about his august deputy Riyad Mahrez.\n\nThe winger reached double figures for the season with a clinical hat-trick to send Claudio Ranieri’s team back to the top of the tree, strengthening their case to be this year’s Christmas No1.\n\nBournemouth’s Glenn Murray heads home to pile more misery on Chelsea Read more\n\nLeicester were rampant, delivering a display of such dazzling counterattacking play that the hosts were lucky to still be in with an outside chance at half-time. Swansea City improved in the second half, but the damage had been done. Garry Monk’s team have now won once in 11 and further questions have been raised about the manager’s future.\n\n“It was bleak,” said Monk, who vowed to “work as hard as I can until I’m told not to because nobody knows this club better than myself”, but admitted that the result was “not acceptable” and that his team’s performance was “extremely poor”.\n\nMahrez was reportedly involved in an altercation with Ashley Williams outside the dressing rooms after the game, but the incident was defused and the Leicester player was ushered away. “I don’t know anything about that – it’s the first I heard of it,” Monk said when asked about the incident. A Leicester official refused to comment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Swansea City manager Garry Monk faces further pressure after this latest defeat. Photograph: BPI/Rex Shutterstock\n\nIt was not enough to take the gloss off another fine performance from the Foxes. Vardy has been the leading light, but Mahrez’s form has been nothing short of sensational at times. The pair have 24 goals combined, four more than Manchester United, and without them Leicester would be closer to the bottom of the table than top. Ranieri, though, would not single anyone out for praise. “All the team played well. We played like a team, helped each other. Everybody was looking for Jamie to score and I was so pleased when he could have shot but passed to Mahrez for the hat-trick.”\n\nOnly Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion have enjoyed less possession than Leicester’s 44.2% per game, and they have the worst pass-completion rate in the league, a shadow over 71%. But why worry about ball retention when you have such blistering pace and clinical finishing?\n\nDefensively, the home team endured a horror show – but considering Leicester’s gameplan is based on pace, it was little surprise to see a high line consisting of Kyle Bartley and Williams – fine defenders but not exactly fleet of foot – suffer countless times.\n\nIt took only five minutes for Mahrez to score his first, but it could easily have been avoided. Bartley conceded a cheap corner, slicing the ball away in a panic. Marc Albrighton delivered from the left, it evaded a cluster of players at the front post, and Mahrez got in front of Bafétimbi Gomis to bundle the ball in from close range. It was not the prettiest, but the die was cast.\n\nVardy should have equalled Dunne’s record nine minutes in, when he dispossessed Williams in the centre circle and sped clear. Lukasz Fabianski was alert, however, and emerged from the goal-line, spread his arms, and did well to close down the angle before saving.\n\nThere was little the keeper could have done to deny Mahrez his second – though it should not have stood because the Algerian was offside. Either way, it was another goal from a rapid break. The move started with Christian Fuchs’ long pass to Vardy. He controlled the ball nonchalantly and laid it off to N’Golo Kanté, who sent a delightful diagonal pass to Mahrez. The assistant referee Mick McDonough’s flag remained down, allowing Mahrez to control before side-footing home.\n\nHe was denied a hat-trick inside 25 minutes by Fabianski, having found his way past a suffering Neil Taylor, while Leonardo Ulloa curled the ball inches wide having been played in by Vardy.\n\nJamie Vardy's extraordinary Premier League goalscoring record – in pictures Read more\n\nIntroducing Jefferson Montero at the break did boost Swansea’s attacking output momentarily and while Ki Sung-yueng headed off the bar from a corner, Gylfi Sigurdsson was left to rue driving a good opportunity over in the 53rd minute.\n\nAny hope was quenched 15 minutes after that, however, when Mahrez completed his treble. Kanté galloped forward and fed Vardy in the D. The striker turned and found Mahrez to his right, who tucked the ball, first time, into the bottom-left corner.\n\nVardy drilled over after getting behind Bartley and also hit the side-netting, resulting in the loudest cheer of the day from the Swansea fans after he kicked an advertising board in frustration. He responded in kind by showing them three fingers with one hand and making a zero with the other.\n\nSigurdsson hit the woodwork with a curling attempt late on but – outfought and outclassed – Swansea departed to jeers. Monk said he is “taking full responsibility”, but unless things improve he might not be in control much longer."}, {"date": "05/12/2015", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20422, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [60], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Manuel Jurado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [30], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Obbi Oularé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Carlos Paredes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Almen Abdi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alessandro Diamanti", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Giedrius Arlauskis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastien Bassong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexander Tettey", "yellows": [29], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Grabban", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}], "subs": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Quique Sánchez Flores talked of his love for Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney after Watford’s impressive strike duo scored in the defeat of Norwich.

They started brightly: after 13 minutes Ben Watson took aim at the Norwich goal but his 20-yard effort deflected off Sébastien Bassong for only a corner. Seven minutes later, Ikechi Anya found space on the right-hand side, but his cross lacked any quality and went straight into the body of Declan Rudd.\n\nWith 30 minutes gone, Étienne Capoue dispossessed Alex Tettey, who was dithering on the ball, and in his attempts to make amends for his error, the Norwich captain, returning to Alex Neil’s starting XI after missing the 1-1 draw against Arsenal with a groin problem, then hauled Ighalo down.

a spirited second-half assault from West Bromwich Albion.\n\nHugo Lloris’s implausible save from Jonas Olsson 17 minutes from time left Mauricio Pochettino grateful to “one of the best goalkeepers in the world” but it was the manner in which the team as a whole refused to buckle as Tony Pulis’s players built up a head of steam in difficult conditions that augurs well for Spurs’ chances of a top-four finish.\n\nOriol Romeu saves Southampton’s blushes against Aston Villa Read more\n\nNot since 1985 have Spurs gone this long without defeat but their new-found resilience was tested to the full by an Albion side buoyed by James McClean’s first goal for the club, the equaliser after Dele Alli’s opener.\n\nWest Brom have now come from behind to earn points in their last three games – beating Arsenal and drawing at West Ham – and with the wind swirling wildly around and the Hawthorns crowd finally buying into “Tony Pulis’s blue and white army” with encouraging gusto, Spurs of yore might have wilted.\n\n“In the past, maybe,” Pochettino agreed. “This was the sort of game that has always been difficult for Tottenham. But today we had a group who are very strong. It was a good test and a good opportunity to show we can compete.”\n\nFor a clash between the roundheads and the pragmatic cavaliers of the Premier League, Spurs enjoyed the expected majority of possession in the first half without making it pay.\n\nThey came into the game as the division’s second most prolific accurate shooters – only Manchester City had struck more efforts on target than their 92 – whereas Albion were bottom of the table in mustering only 117 shots in total, on or off. No team has sampled less possession in the Premier League this season than West Brom, who have averaged less than 40% of the ball.\n\nBut while Spurs had almost twice as much ball, even allowing for the Baggies’ second-half surge, they were grateful to share the goals. Alli, in front of the watching Roy Hodgson on the England manager’s return to The Hawthorns, struck first, with the kind of goal often associated with West Brom.\n\nThe England midfield player, who recently scored on his full England debut against France, ran in between Craig Dawson and Gareth McAuley to volley Toby Alderweireld’s long diagonal pass through Boaz Myhill’s legs.\n\nWhen Albion equalised six minutes before half-time, it was with a Spurs type of goal. There was some sweet short passing before Stéphane Sessègnon played in Darren Fletcher down the right wing for a cross that McClean headed emphatically home, for his first goal since his £1.5m transfer from Wigan in the summer.\n\nArsenal’s Olivier Giroud recovers after scoring Sunderland equaliser Read more\n\n“He’s been playing ever so well,” said David Kemp, the assistant head coach on media duties as Pulis was suffering from flu. “Goals are what he hasn’t brought to the team but hopefully he can go on and score a few more now. I don’t think anyone was doing somersaults when we signed him but his performances have been top class.”\n\nThe tempo of the game intensified in the second half, with West Brom going the extra mile to battle their way into the ascendancy. Lloris flung his arms up to tip the ball over the crossbar after Olsson toe-ended the ball goalwards from six yards out, following Dawson’s downward header from Chris Brunt’s free-kick, and then Salomón Rondón hesitated, allowing Kyle Walker to clear, after Craig Gardner’s dink invited the £12m striker to shoot.\n\nEven with Saido Berahino confined again to the substitutes’ bench, after Pulis had admitted Spurs’ £23m summer target has been affected by the whole transfer saga, West Brom had enough to win the game. But Spurs gritted their teeth, stuck out their chests and hung in for the kind of point that is winning them a new sort of admiration."}, {"date": "05/12/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41631, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baba Rahman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bertrand Traoré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [63], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [23], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}], "subs": [{"name": "Tokelo Rantie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yann Kermorgant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Allsop", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [82], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eunan O'Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Butcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baily Cargill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "So much for the recovery. This was a defeat to sum up Chelsea’s traumatic title defence, a loss that four months ago might have been considered inconceivable but which, these days, bore all the hallmarks of this season’s regular failings. Bournemouth arrived here after nine winless games, a side shredded by long-term injuries to key players and a team who had not managed a clean sheet away from home since a trip to Hartlepool of the basement division in August. They departed with their manager, Eddie Howe, celebrating the “best individual result in our history”. The way things have been going this season, even Roman Abramovich up in the west stand should have seen this coming.\n\nThere were the usual local complaints over the display of the officials. Some of those pointed out by José Mourinho were valid. Glenn Murray may well have been marginally offside at the far post when Steve Cook clipped the ball back into the six-yard box after Thibaut Courtois had pawed away a late corner, the substitute nodding down and through Gary Cahill on the goalline with his first touch. He had been on the pitch for 99 seconds. Perhaps more doubtful was a call for a penalty after Diego Costa’s pull-back struck the sliding Simon Francis’s arm in the other penalty area. In another season, the first might have been ruled out and the second awarded, but this campaign is like no other in recent memory.\n\nChelsea v Bournemouth: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nMourinho’s post-match gloom reflected as much, his criticisms of the officials all rather half-hearted given the fact that, when he has lambasted perceived mistakes this term, he has been slapped down with heavy fines, a stadium ban and a threat of another to come. What was arguably more revealing of Chelsea’s dismal predicament – they are 14th and only three points above the relegation zone – was the recognition there is no bite to his lineup. No incision across the front line. Branislav Ivanovic, Willian and Pedro all flung tantalising low centres into the penalty area when the hosts finally built up some momentum after the interval but, even with the brooding Costa introduced at the break, the delivery was only greeted with hesitancy.\n\n“All those crosses from the right side, short crosses, we have to touch the ball in front of goal because the goalkeeper would have no chance,” said the manager, his exasperation all too evident. “If you are in the box you have to attack the ball and touch it in. These are big chances. Big chances you have to take. The only time we made contact was with Matic, where it was difficult for him wearing his mask and with the cross really fast. It was difficult for him to react and give direction to the ball.” That effort flew over the bar.\n\nMourinho was left to bemoan a lack of consistency in individual performances. Eden Hazard was not quite as effervescent as he had been at White Hart Lane. Oscar was anonymous and withdrawn, while Cesc Fàbregas continues to labour. “Today, again, we had a couple from whom you need more and expect more, and they don’t give enough,” added the Portuguese. “But there were ‘unlucky details’ too. You cannot have bigger details than one penalty that is not given and an offside goal that decides the game.”\n\nJosé Mourinho starts hoping for Europa League finish after Bournemouth blow Read more\n\nPerhaps, but it still felt a wasteful display rather than one where Chelsea had been cheated of a result. Instead, Bournemouth could bask in their own seismic moment. This victory hauled them out of the bottom three and was remarkable given the crippling injuries which have robbed them of Callum Wilson and Tyrone Mings, Tommy Elphick and Max Gradel. Or, indeed, all the niggling setbacks suffered over the week which meant the 18-man match day squad included every outfield senior player available. “We were magnificent, and we had to be to win here so I’m incredibly proud of the players,” said Howe. “The injuries knocked us for six and meant we lost our balance for a while, but we’ve found a way to work that can be effective. And if we can come here and win, we can do it anywhere.”\n\nThat might be pushing it given that four teams have now won at Stamford Bridge but, for Bournemouth, it ended an occasion that potentially eclipsed the FA Cup win against Manchester United in 1984, or the win against Grimsby in 2009 that staved off the threat of relegation from the Football League. They would have been forgiven a nervy start but, instead, forced the returning Courtois into first-half saves from Josh King and Junior Stanislas.\n\nThey had to be cannier after the interval when Chelsea were far more aggressive, with Mourinho infuriated by their eagerness to break up play, before a substitute reduced to a bit-part role sprang from the bench to claim the contest. The hosts had prayed that would be Costa. Instead it was Murray. “We’ve never been in the Premier League before, so to come to the champions and win,” added Howe. “It’s the best individual result in the club’s history.” For Chelsea, it was the stuff of nightmares."}, {"date": "29/11/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35639, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds":

their best run since a 14-game stretch from November 1984 to March 1985 with Peter Shreeves as manager and Ossie Ardiles flitting around in midfield, but they did not have the wit or creativity to add to Chelsea’s troubles on the day José Mourinho decided Diego Costa was no longer worthy of a place in his team.\n\nChelsea’s Diego Costa ‘privileged’ not to be dropped before – Mourinho Read more\n\nMourinho’s decision to leave Costa on the bench certainly jarred with his claim they had resolved their argument during the game against Maccabi Tel Aviv last Tuesday. If there were “kisses and cuddles”, as the Chelsea manager said, it was followed by the cold shoulder here. When Mourinho made his substitutions it was Kenedy and Ruben Loftus-Cheek who were instructed to come to the touchline and, for Costa, it was not far off a public humiliation given that Chelsea did not have another fit or available striker in the squad.\n\nInstead, Eden Hazard was given the leading role and Chelsea can be encouraged by the way they subdued a Spurs team who had scored at least three times in three of their last four matches at White Hart Lane. Chelsea still have not managed back-to-back league wins this season but they did gradually emerge as the more likely winners and with John Terry injured, can feel relatively satisfied about limiting Spurs to only a couple of decent chances in the first half and virtually nothing after the interval. This was Chelsea’s first clean sheet away from Stamford Bridge in the league this season and that at least seems like a start. “The best Chelsea this season,” Mourinho said. “I think we have a team again.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Diego Costa cut an unhappy figure as an unused substitute at White Hart Lane. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian\n\nAs well as reflecting badly on Costa, a statement like that speaks volumes about how they have played before this point because it was still alarming to see the number of times a midfielder with Cesc Fàbregas’s gifts misplaced passes that would once have been routine. Nemanja Matic is still not influencing the games in the manner of old and though Hazard showed glimpses of last season’s form and was acclaimed by his manager as “phenomenal”, it was probably unfair to expect him to take on Costa’s role seamlessly.\n\nHugo Lloris kept out his volleyed effort with a splendid save midway through the second half but Hazard’s misplaced header after Oscar’s cross had set up the outstanding chance of the opening 45 minutes exposed the obvious flaw of using a wide player as a centre-forward. Willian helped to give Chelsea’s attack some energy and directness, with Pedro and Oscar buzzing around in support, but the tactic of not playing with an orthodox striker worked only sporadically.\n\nEden Hazard shows José Mourinho what Chelsea have lacked with Diego Costa Read more\n\nWhatever is eating away at Costa, Chelsea will be a much more rounded team when, or if, manager and player can sort out what has been going wrong and find a way to fix it – and the player glowering on the bench, arms folded, collar turned high, did not give the impression that he had taken it well.\n\nMourinho said it was not an issue that Costa did not take part in the warm-up and he might also have pointed out that another of his substitutes, Mikel John Obi, chose not to go out. It was strange, though, that when Costa did appear from the tunnel he was not even wearing his boots. He barely went through the motions when he was asked to warm up and when it became obvious he would not be playing a single minute he returned to his seat, pulled his bib over his head and tossed it over his shoulder, landing not a great distance from Mourinho’s seat. “If he wants to hurt me, it’s not with a bib,” a smiling Mourinho said afterwards, adding that he was “not expecting a player to be on the bench jumping and singing”. A difficult day for Costa was completed by Mourinho’s eulogy about how well the team had played without a natural front-man.\n\nTottenham had a more conventional formation with Christian Eriksen and Son Heung-min operating either side of Harry Kane. They started off as the more dangerous team but their passing was disappointing and it was tempting to think Thursday’s trip to Azerbaijan to play Qarabag in the Europa League had dulled their senses.\n\nThe home side tailed off badly in the second half and did not move the ball well enough to get behind the visitors’ defence. “My players are heroes,” Pochettino countered. “Their effort was unbelievable after a difficult week.”\n\nSpurs must have been grateful it was Hazard, rather than Costa, with the headed opportunity to open the scoring but they also had a similar chance in the first half when Kane’s right-wing cross deserved better than Son tamely heading the ball straight at Asmir Begovic. After that, however, there was not a great deal for Chelsea’s goalkeeper to do and Pochettino, as he is sometimes inclined, was stretching the truth when he said his side deserved more than a draw.\n\nMan of the match Willian (Chelsea)"}, {"date": "29/11/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34914, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [],

to be petering out at West Bromwich Albion but the 33-year-old proved that there is life in him yet, as he came off the bench to revive his team and help salvage a point that had looked improbable.\n\nThe 33-year-old has started only three Premier League games for Albion since tearing himself away from Liverpool in the summer in search of more action and, as with every game since early September, he started as a substituteat Upton Park. But with Albion grateful to be trailing only by one goal at half-time – an exquisite free-kick by Mauro Zárate – Lambert was thrust into the fray and created an equaliser within five minutes, his shot from 20 yards deflecting off Winston Reid and into the net.\n\nWest Ham United 1-1 West Bromwich Albion: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\n“Rick is an absolutely wonderful professional,” said the Albion manager, Tony Pulis. “Since he’s joined the club he’s not played as much as he wanted and that’s my fault, not his. But his attitude to training is wonderful. He’s a real throwback to the times when footballers cared about football. He’s been a terrific signing to the club although he’ll say: ‘I haven’t played as much as I’d like.’”\n\nThe Albion players who did start here did not play much in the first half. West Ham dominated despite coming into the game on a downer, having failed to win in their previous three matches and lost Dmitri Payet to injury. And Albion clearly arrived with the intention of depressing them further, adopting the same stultifying approach that they tend to use on all their travels.\n\nIf you only ever watched West Brom away, you would deduce that Pulis’s wildest dream is an endless traffic jam. His team are not exactly expansive at home but away their game-plan is based around the erection of roadblocks. Sometimes it works – they had kept four clean sheets in their six away league prior to this – and it briefly threatened to pay off here, too, as the opening minutes were so dull that the crowd’s pre-match cheer was quickly forgotten.\n\nBut the home team soon brought the smiles back. In particular, Manuel Lanzini crackled with creativity, his movement and trickery trumping Albion’s spoiling tactics. Still, it took a fright to stoke West Ham into action, as Salomón Rondón almost capped a fleeting Albion attack with a goal in the 13th minute, his ferocious shot from the corner of the box fizzing just past the far post. Then West Ham took over, their running, passing and imagination making the visitors look like mere bouncers amid a whirr of party people.\n\nWhen Gareth McAuley was sanctioned for being too forceful in his attempts to subdue Diafra Sakho in the 17th minute, Zárate stepped up and curled the free-kick into the top corner from 25 yards. Albion had not previously conceded a first-half goal away in the league this season but they should have been further behind before the break.\n\nCheikhou Kouyaté glanced a header wide from eight yards after an excellent cross from Aaron Cresswell. Lanzini then ambushed Claudio Yacob in midfield, jiggled forward and nearly bamboozled the goalkeeper from 25 yards, but Boaz Myhill managed to improvise a save with his feet. The goalkeeper foiled the same player again five minutes later. Albion were so impotent going forward that further misses before the interval by Sakho and Victor Moses did not necessarily look costly. But Albion went into the changing room and emerged transformed.\n\nPulis replaced Stéphane Sessègnon with Lambert rather than Saido Berahino. That decision was vindicated five minutes into the second half when Darren Fletcher chested the ball to Lambert and the striker unleashed a shot that wound up in the back of the net thanks to the unfortunate Reid. Suddenly the sides were trading blows, Albion giving at least as good as they were getting. Jonas Olsson had to make a timely tackle to prevent Sakho from turning in a fine cross by Cresswell, and Adrián then had to pull off a superb save to deny Rondón, who was poised to celebrate after meeting a cross from Fletcher with a powerful header.\n\nBoleyn becomes bygone: West Ham’s Upton Park upheaval a sign of the times | Daniel Taylor Read more\n\nZárate tried to repeat his free-kick feat in the 63rd minute but this time Myhill pushed his shot away. That chance came via a counterattack, Albion having now established a degree of territorial superiority. But that did not necessarily perturb West Ham, who have the speed to cause trouble on the break. Moses led a lightning raid in the 71st minute, charging 50 yards forward before slipping the ball to Sakho, who let fly from 15 yards.\n\nOlsson slid into to divert the shot into the side-netting. Sakho had to depart with a thigh injury after that. “It does not look good,” said the manager Slaven Bilic, noting that a long layoff for the Senegalese striker would be problematic given that Enner Valencia is also on the casualty list.\n\nOlsson was in the way again in the 82nd minute, thwarting Andy Carroll, who, like Michail Antonio, was introduced to help West Ham’s quest for a first win since that rousing defeat of Chelsea more than a month ago. In the end they had to make do with a point that pleased Pulis much more."}, {"date": "29/11/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 43905, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Henderson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Bogdan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Randall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Britton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eder", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Grimes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "There was no lack of endeavour, cohesion or spirit from Swansea City but, crucially, no points either for Garry Monk. The under-pressure manager was condemned to unfortunate defeat as Neil Taylor’s handball gifted Liverpool victory at a wind-swept Anfield. Jürgen Klopp, in stark contrast, has his players in the habit of winning.\n\nLiverpool’s sixth win in seven matches arrived courtesy of James Milner’s second-half penalty and out of a performance to forget. Where Klopp’s team had excelled at Manchester City last weekend they laboured against the struggling Welsh club. But their manager had little cause for concern given the end product was unchanged.\n\nManchester City’s Sergio Agüero a doubt for Stoke match due to foot injury Read more\n\n“Football is not a sport where you can only use one way,” said Klopp. “The City and Chelsea [performances] can’t be compared because of the way your opponent plays. I haven’t seen the stats but I think we had about 70% possession today [it was 54%]. For most of the game we had the ball. We deserved the win, that’s for sure, and that’s all we should care about. We had to fight in difficult circumstances and that’s what we did. Difficult game, a deserved win, 23 points. Very good.”\n\nSecond-half substitute appearances from Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge, their first outings since Klopp took charge following long-term injuries, increased the sense of gathering momentum at Anfield.\n\nHow Monk could do with a similar break. Swansea played for their young manager – “Anyone who would suggest otherwise is very stupid,” he said with undisguised disdain – were organised, rarely troubled and unnerved Liverpool when they belatedly exerted pressure in the closing stages, albeit without testing Simon Mignolet. But they lacked the conviction that victory was achievable at Anfield and, as often happens to a team in the mire, the only contentious decision went against them. It is now one win in 11 for Monk’s men with the top two, Leicester City and Manchester City, up next.\n\n“It’s my responsibility to get results, I understand that,” the Swansea manager said. “But you can see it’s only a matter of time before we get a result and are flying again. There’s never any danger we will be in that relegation fight. That didn’t look like a team in trouble. It didn’t look like a team who’s had the run of form we had. To come here and limit an attack minded team to pretty much nothing is impressive but to lose to an extremely soft decision is so disappointing. The players deserved a lot more than they got.”\n\nNeither side had a shot on target in the opening 45 minutes as Swansea’s five-man midfield sat deep and Liverpool struggled to pick a way through.\n\nAs against Crystal Palace a fortnight ago there was a lethargy to Liverpool’s play three days after a Europa League game. The absence of the Brazilians Philippe Coutinho and Lucas Leiva, to a hamstring injury and suspension respectively, also hindered the home side. The wind played havoc with both sides’ distribution.\n\nLiverpool went close to an early lead when the Swansea defender Kyle Bartley diverted the ball against his own post while challenging Jordon Ibe. The winger had been put clear by Adam Lallana after Milner pressed Leon Britton into a mistake and, though Liverpool denied the visitors time on the ball throughout, they rarely got behind the Swansea defence. Christian Benteke should have done when the impressive Emre Can sent a delightful ball over Bartley’s head but the Belgium international’s first touch was poor, and continued to be until he was replaced by Sturridge with 19 minutes remaining.\n\nA dull game was decided by a correct penalty decision from the linesman Simon Beck. Not that Swansea will agree. The second half had also failed to ignite when Ibe crossed from the right wing. The ball struck Taylor’s raised right arm as the left-back leapt to block and, while the referee, Anthony Taylor’s, view was obstructed, his assistant immediately signalled for a spot-kick. Milner converted confidently, side-footing into the roof of the net after Lukasz Fabianski had dived to his right.\n\nMonk argued: “It hits his elbow and Neil is facing the other way. I thought handball had to be intentional. It clearly wasn’t intentional but the linesman had his flag up very quickly at the Kop end where everyone around him was howling for a penalty.”\n\nHenderson came on to a rapturous reception and created a decent opening for Milner, who shot wide of Fabianski’s far post, while the substitute Bafetimbi Gomis went close from distance for the visitors. Sustained Swansea pressure spread anxiety around Anfield but Mignolet was under-employed.\n\nMan of the match: Alberto Moreno (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "29/11/2015", "arena": "Carrow Road", "attendance": 27091, "home_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastien Bassong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Wes Hoolahan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Grabban", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [43], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vadis Odjidja-Ofoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [11]}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [30], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [11], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeff Reine-Adelaide", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was another one of those days for Arsenal.

The home team finished more strongly and they had a couple of chances when the winning goal looked within reach.\n\nWenger said Koscielny “could not walk” after feeling a spasm in his hip on eight minutes, which led him to hold his lower back. There had even been an injury issue before kick-off, when it emerged that Kieran Gibbs was out with calf trouble.\n\nBut Sánchez’s hamstring dominated the post-match discussion. Wenger had admitted during the week that the forward had felt tightness in the muscle after the Champions League win over Dinamo Zagreb. The club’s tests had shown that he was fine to play but when he burst towards a ball in the 59th minute, with Ryan Bennett coming across to challenge, he pulled up dramatically.\n\nSánchez sat forlornly on the pitch and made the signal that something had torn. The manner in which he limped off, very slowly and with the leg completely stiff, further emphasised the worrying nature of it all.\n\nWenger was angry about the result and he was waspish when questioned about the decision to push Sánchez through the game. “The players are there to play football, not to be rested when the press decide they need to be rested,” Wenger said. “Nobody is scientifically developed enough, not even the press, to predict when a guy will be injured. We checked him. When you have normal stretch and force, there is no problem.”\n\nOn Cazorla Wenger said: “He had a kick on the knee. We don’t know if he has jarred the knee ligament or was it a kick on the nerve? The worrying thing was that it got worse.”\n\nArsenal had bossed the opening 40 minutes or so, going close through Mesut Özil, Olivier Giroud and Sánchez before making the breakthrough. Sánchez robbed O’Neil, after the Norwich midfielder had been put in trouble by John Ruddy’s risky clearance, and he ushered in Özil. The German dinked his finish coolly over the advancing Ruddy.\n\nNorwich had set up to frustrate Arsenal, to limit their space and punch on the counter and, after Robbie Brady had worked Cech, they found the equaliser. Koscielny’s replacement, Gabriel Paulista, erred when he tried to intercept Brady’s ball up to Grabban, rather than hold his ground and, when the Norwich striker rolled him, the chance suddenly opened up.\n\nGrabban’s finish was marked by composure and, moments later, Hoolahan lifted over when gloriously placed following Andre Wisdom’s cross.\n\nÖzil could not finish after a scramble early in the second half and Arsenal laboured for penetration as the game wore on and Norwich could have nicked it. Martin Olsson’s cross hit Gabriel and Cech had to save smartly before, from the ensuing corner, Bennett headed down and Jonny Howson hooked over from close range.\n\n“There was more of an edge to Grabban’s game because he hasn’t been involved,” Alex Neil, the Norwich manager, said. “Management is about making decisions you think are right when everyone else thinks they are wrong.”\n\nMan of

enough salt in recent wounds, Aston Villa had their latest disappointment rubbed in by a Birmingham fan fulfilling his wish of scoring in front of the Holte End. Troy Deeney, having equalised against Manchester United last Saturday only to score a late own goal, experienced only unmitigated joy as he headed home the clinching goal against his old enemy.\n\nJunior Stanislas strikes twice to rescue battling Bournemouth against Everton Read more\n\nThe Watford captain, who spurned a trial at Villa at the age of 15 and has a Birmingham City tattoo on his calf, scored his fourth goal in five games five minutes from the end of regulation time on a day when his team survived the loss of Heurelho Gomes to an initially worrying head injury that led to 10 minutes’ stoppage time. The Watford goalkeeper went for a scan before receiving the all-clear.\n\nVilla remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League as they equalled the divisional record of the lowest number of points from the first 14 games. No team have avoided relegation having had five points at this stage of the campaign. They also equalled a club record of 13 consecutive league games without a win and have not tasted victory at home in the league since May. Three games into Rémi Garde’s reign and Villa are still looking like relegation certainties.\n\nDeeney was a thorn in their side throughout and a pain in the backside to supporters who jeered him until he got the better of Ciaran Clark to make it 3-1 with Watford’s first headed goal of the season. He got booked for his exuberant celebrations in front of the Villa diehards.\n\n“I can’t explain how good that was,” he said. “Their fans gave me stick all the way through, which lets me know I am doing something right. I slid on my knees, everyone does that. It’s football, we get caught up in the emotion. I do not think I offended anyone – you should have heard what the crowd were saying to me! But I am thick-skinned and can take it. I’m more interested in taking three points.”\n\nDeeney’s partnership with Odion Ighalo continues to be so productive that Watford, despite losing their two previous games, are halfway to gaining sufficient points to stay up. The duo press so hard and so high and the rest of the team feed off this. “It is amazing the connection they have during the match,” Quique Sánchez Flores, the Watford manager, said.\n\nAfter Ighalo’s initial shot was saved superbly by Brad Guzan, the ball came back to him when Ben Watson’s shot deflected off Clark, and the Nigerian made the most of being played onside by Kieran Richardson to score his eighth goal of the season.\n\nVilla played their way back into the ascendancy and deserved to be in front before the interval. Pushing the full-backs very high, they created a plethora of chances although Carlos Sánchez’s poor touch and distribution from central defensive midfield left them vulnerable in the extreme.\n\nBefore he scored late on, Jordan Ayew had three efforts when the game was in the balance, one in particular that he should have converted, while Scott Sinclair came inside and dispatched a dipping right-footed shot that Gomes tipped over in spectacular fashion before Villa equalised four minutes before the interval. Alan Hutton drove inside from wide on the right and, when he was tripped, Jordan Veretout chipped in for Richards – albeit from an offside position – to power in a header for his first goal for Villa.\n\nSunderland out of bottom three after Duncan Watmore sees off Stoke City Read more\n\nRichards celebrated wildly – the former England defender had accused his team-mates on the eve of the game of being too “nice” and eyeing their exit route should Villa be relegated. He couldn’t afford not to contribute in the most positive fashion.\n\nDespite dominating possession in the second half, Villa failed to continue creating such a sequence of clear chances and were undone on the counterattack. Watford defended deep and compactly and, even when they lost Gomes following a collision with Craig Cathcart, Villa could not unduly trouble Giedrius Arlauskis, the Lithuanian international keeper coming on to make his Premier League debut. Instead Watford pounced on the break. When Deeney attempted to play Ighalo in, Hutton inadvertently guided the ball past his own goalkeeper.\n\nThen after 85 minutes Deeney got his wish, heading home in front of the Holte End as Clark dawdled while awaiting Ighalo’s deflected shot to come down.\n\nAyew blasted home to add tension to the 10 minutes of added time but Villa’s unwanted succession of records was extended, and there is little sense of them ending any time soon.\n\n“It is painful for my players to have this result,” said Garde. “I think we deserved better. But there were mistakes. We lack efficiency in both boxes and maybe we had a lack of patience because we knew it was important to win. Everybody has to improve their levels, and we can.”"}, {"date": "28/11/2015", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11228, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Junior Stanislas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [87, 90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Arter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [80], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shaun MacDonald", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yann Kermorgant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Allsop", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eunan O'Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baily Cargill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [25], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [90], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [36], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It was only a point but, considering the manner in which it was achieved, felt like so much more for Bournemouth, and it would not be beyond the imagination to suggest this could be a turning point in their first top-flight season.

Everton’s fans invaded the pitch to celebrate, leading to the referee Kevin Friend adding on additional time to the five minutes advertised, and when play restarted Stanislas headed a Charlie Daniels cross from the left home.\n\nCue wild scenes of jubilation around the rest of this small but electric ground. While they remain two points from safety, Bournemouth’s players departed with a newfound sense of belief. Dauntingly Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal will be faced in December, but moments like these can be defining. “I couldn’t believe it,” Howe said. “I am very proud of the fightback from our lads, it shows the character of this squad.”\n\nEverton were a level above in the first half and Funes Mori’s opening goal had been on the cards. Adam Federici, who needed treatment early on after landing awkwardly when punching clear a corner and was eventually replaced at half-time, denied Arouna Koné and Lukaku while also getting in the way of a tame James McCarthy attempt.\n\nThere was, however, little he could do to deny the Argentinian defender his first goal for Everton and the team’s first from a set piece this season. Barkley sent in a deep corner and after climbing higher than Steve Cook, the centre-half directed a header across goal, far from the keeper’s reach. Joshua King could not clear it off the line.\n\nQuestions must be raised over the hosts’ defending for Lukaku’s simple second, though plenty of credit should go to Gerard Deulofeu for sending a delicious pass from the right into the Belgium striker’s path. The ease with which Lukaku turned Cook before burying the ball past Federici at the near post left Howe shaking his head in disgust.\n\nCook was hooked at the break, and the club’s third-choice keeper, Allsop, who spent last season on loan at Coventry, made his top-flight bow after Federici was deemed unfit to continue. Howe’s initial diagnosis was that it is a serious ankle injury.\n\nWatford’s Troy Deeney seals victory to deepen Aston Villa’s misery Read more\n\nThere were encouraging signs on the restart. King pick-pocketed a dozing Barkley before his attempt was blocked by John Stones, Dan Gosling headed a Daniels cross into the arms of Tim Howard and the left-back also forced the Everton keeper to save.\n\nLukaku was denied a second by Allsop after Seamus Coleman delivered a tasty cross from the right but Bournemouth’s pressure continued to build, their belief never wavering. And with 10 minutes to go a lifeline arrived as Smith halved the deficit with a sublime long-range effort that went in off a post after Everton failed to clear a corner and the substitute defender was left unmarked outside the area.\n\nEverton looked out on their feet and with the division’s smallest stadium suddenly vibrating Bournemouth threw everything forward. King danced down the right before sending a low cross in and Stanislas was on hand to slot home first time at the near post past Howard.\n\nThere were three minutes left but it all seemed like an appetiser to an incredible finale. Fed by Coleman, Barkley’s goal from eight yards looked like being enough, but with 97 minutes and 13 seconds played Stanislas arrived to head home Daniels’ cross from a similar distance. “At times in football you have to accept these moments,” Martínez said. “We lost two points twice – that’s a feeling that’s difficult to explain.”"}, {"date": "28/11/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance":

recovery.\n\nTwo goals apiece from James McArthur and Yannick Bolasie, added to by Wilfried Zaha, made the point amply but it could have been more and the fact that it was Alan Pardew, their former manager, who inflicted the damage this time merely compounded the humiliation. While McClaren’s position will be untenable if this persists, it is tempting to wonder whether his team is simply unmanageable. “It’s not about ability, not about tactics or systems,” said McClaren after seeing his team jeered by the visiting supporters throughout the second half and told, among other things, that they were “not fit to wear the shirts”.\n\n“It’s about doing your job, doing the basics. When we go behind or have disappointments in games we’re not refocusing on our jobs. That’s about mentality and it’s just one of the things we have to work on with this group – we knew that when we came here.”\n\nThe problem here was that Newcastle did not look especially focused when they were ahead, either.\n\nThey scored in the 10th minute when Crystal Palace, who had lost at home to Sunderland on Monday, lapsed again at the back. Daryl Janmaat did not appear to be offering any immediate danger as he advanced but the pitch opened up as he skipped past the weak challenge offered by Jason Puncheon.\n\nHis chipped cross towards Cissé would have been routine if Damien Delaney and Scott Dann had not stood still in a misguided attempt to play the centre-forward offside.\n\nInstead, Cissé was left unattended to glance into the corner and you could almost hear the offers coming in for McClaren, who had given his players an expletive-filled rebuke after last week’s insipid defeat to Leicester, to pen a study on man-management.\n\nPalace’s equaliser arose from the mixture of inattention and ill-luck that plague struggling sides.\n\nConnor Wickham did well to beat Fabricio Coloccini to a ball down the left and hold off the under-fire Newcastle captain, a negligible presence in this particular tussle. He squared to McArthur, whose shot from just inside the ‘D’ was aimed to Rob Elliot’s left but struck Paul Dummett and span into the opposite corner with the goalkeeper committed.\n\nJust as damaging to Newcastle is their propensity to concede in clusters and Palace’s second was not long in coming. Wickham was involved again, collecting from Zaha on the right side of the penalty area and crossing low. The ball nicked off Coloccini and Zaha left it for Bolasie to shoot crisply past Elliot.\n\nThe situation worsened four minutes before half-time when Zaha, who had just blotted an otherwise outstanding performance with a yellow card for diving under Dummett’s challenge, sent a bouncing volley up and over Elliot from Wickham’s left-wing cross.\n\nJunior Stanislas strikes twice to rescue battling Bournemouth against Everton Read more\n\nWickham’s hat-trick of assists, after an injury-affected start to his Palace career following his move from Sunderland, pleased Pardew, who preferred to reflect on his own side’s improvement than apply any further pressure in McClaren’s direction.\n\n“He showed all the potential we hoped for as a No9 today – it was an outstanding display,” said Pardew.\n\n“It was a pivotal game, whoever the opposition were. Were we going to become a mid-table team and drift around, or were we going to put ourselves back in contention with the top eight sides? We’ve put ourselves back in with them and that’s where we want to be.”\n\nMcClaren’s introduction of a centre-back, Jamaal Lascelles, for the forward Ayoze Pérez at the interval smacked of damage limitation but it took 97 seconds to render any fresh motivational speech irrelevant, Johan Cabaye’s free-kick being won in the air by Delaney – aided by Janmaat’s reluctance to offer even a token challenge – and allowed to travel far enough to Bolasie to stab home. The second half must have felt like an eternity to McClaren, who saw Wickham, Puncheon, Bolasie and Joel Ward all miss further chances before McArthur’s angled finish in stoppage time.\n\n“I’m hurting, not as much for ourselves as for the fans,” he said. “We knew this was a tough job but it’s getting tougher by the week. Thirteen games gone, 25 to go and we know we’re in a relegation battle.”\n\nIt will not have been lost on those fans that, 15 minutes from time, Pardew was able to bring on Chung-yong Lee and save the legs of Cabaye, the heartbeat of his Newcastle side in what surely seems a lifetime away now.\n\nWhat Newcastle would give for a modicum of their application from the men who have replaced them."},

by swatting aside lesser sides on their own turf, but they remain very good at it. After a chastening week that included defeats to Liverpool and Juventus, they produced a characteristic rejoinder. Emphatic in attack, if brittle in defence, a team with a solitary goal in their previous three outings struck three times. “It was a very important reaction,” said their manager, Manuel Pellegrini.\n\nCrystal Palace hammer Newcastle to leave Steve McClaren in deep trouble Read more\n\nSouthampton arrived at the Etihad Stadium boasting an unbeaten away record. They battled valiantly to preserve it departed defeated.\n\nIf a 13th win in 15 home league games rendered this the same old City, a first league victory in November was nonetheless fashioned by newcomers. Summer signings starred. Raheem Sterling emerged from a personal slump to make the opener. Kevin de Bruyne had endured the longest barren run of his time at the Etihad Stadium, his previous four games yielding neither a goal nor an assist, but the he broke the deadlock and created Aleksandar Kolarov’s clincher.\n\nFabian Delph’s City career had lasted four months and encompassed two hamstring injuries before his maiden competitive start. It produced a goal.\n\nThe blight on City’s day came with the sight of their top scorer hobbling off. Sergio Agüero has not completed a game since September. He was never due to finish this, but the manner of his exit was worrying, if not for his manager. “He was not going to play more than 65 minutes,” said Pellegrini. “He had a pain in his heel but it was nothing important.”\n\nCity must hope their often vague manager is right. It looked as though Agüero, who returned only a week ago from a month on the sidelines, had landed awkwardly on his ankle. He will be assessed on Sunday.\n\nIf City seem disproportionately dependent on Agüero, they could at least savour the return of substitute David Silva, following a nine-game absence, and further proof they can source goals from other departments of the pitch. A winger, a midfielder and a full-back scored.\n\nSterling almost supplied the breakthrough in the first minute and, when it did come, the manner of it was instructive.\n\nCity had been unsettled by Liverpool’s relentless pressing seven days earlier. They borrowed a trick from their tormentors’ handbook. It proved equally effective. Bacary Sagna had had his pocket picked by Philippe Coutinho when Liverpool struck first last weekend. This time the visiting right-back, Maya Yoshida, was robbed by Sterling. He accelerated clear and centred. De Bruyne was afforded a tap-in.\n\nDelph drilled in the second, aided by a sizeable deflection off Virgil van Dijk, but Southampton could not, and did not, pronounce themselves unfortunate.\n\nSeconds earlier, Steven Davis had escaped a red card. Fernandinho had met De Bruyne’s corner with a powerful header. Lurking on the line, the Northern Ireland captain seemed to use his left arm to turn the ball past the post. The referee, Roger East, awarded a corner. His haplessness proved a recurring theme.\n\nJunior Stanislas strikes twice to rescue battling Bournemouth against Everton Read more\n\n“There were strange decisions,” the Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, said. “I had a talk with Pellegrini and we were both surprised about the referee.” Not that odd decision-making was confined to the official. Koeman omitted his first-choice right-back, Cédric Soares, for the blundering Yoshida.\n\n“If you lose the ball to players like Sterling, you know they will punish you,” the Dutchman said. “Maybe we were lucky to be only 2-0 [down] after 20 minutes because we lost every ball.”\n\nSouthampton’s carelessness was compounded as they neglected to select a trump card. Dusan Tadic was introduced at the break and looked a catalyst for a comeback. Sadio Mané, who was then shifted to the right flank, crossed for Shane Long to deliver a bullet header. Tadic sashayed his way through as the City defence parted obligingly. An equaliser beckoned.\n\n“We had the best chance to score the 2-2,” said Koeman, but his side were twice denied. Willy Cabellero clawed Tadic’s shot away. Fernandinho seemed to handle Long’s follow-up effort. Consistent if nothing else, East again refused to award a penalty.\n\nCity threatened to squander their lead. “I was concerned, of course,” Pellegrini said. Kolarov allayed his fears, drilling in City’s third goal after De Bruyne, as if using a sand wedge, chipped the ball to the far post. “That killed the game,” Koeman accepted."}, {"date": "28/11/2015",

Watmore at the moment but much more of this and the Sunderland’s manager only option will be to invest in earplugs.\n\nManchester City’s Kevin de Bruyne leads clinical defeat of Southampton Read more\n\nFrom the moment he stepped off the bench to replace a hamstrung Jermain Defoe, the England Under-21 forward and Wearside supersub illuminated a previously monochrome game while disconcerting a hitherto comfortable Stoke City.\n\nIt was a foul on Watmore that led to Ryan Shawcross’s dismissal early in the second half and the same bundle of attacking energy deservedly scored Sunderland’s excellent second goal after Patrick van Aanholt’s free kick had broken the impasse.\n\nPartly thanks to Watmore’s contribution, Mark Hughes’s European aspirations were left looking a little, well, ambitious as Sunderland clambered out of the bottom three.\n\n“We just have to keep Duncan’s feet on the ground,” said Allardyce, who has presided over three wins in six games – the others against Crystal Palace and Newcastle United – since succeeding Dick Advocaat. “Duncan had a major impact. He caused Stoke’s central defenders so many problems.”\n\nSunderland’s manager road-tested his new look 3-5-2 formation in a home game for the first time and, ignoring the familiarity of their surroundings, his players initially operated more like an away team.\n\nAs their hosts sat back, waiting to pounce on the counterattack, Stoke enjoyed plenty of possession. Unfortunately for Hughes it rarely came in areas where they could cause any real damage and as visiting tensions rose a wayward, highly speculative 25-yard shot unleashed by Bojan Krkic seemed emblematic of a team traversing the border between frustration and desperation.\n\nIf a pronounced lack of width hardly helped Stoke’s cause, Pantilimon was at least forced into one key intervention, doing very well to deny Jonathan Walters from point-blank range with his legs just as the striker attempted to connect with a left-wing cross.\n\nWatford’s Troy Deeney seals victory to deepen Aston Villa’s misery Read more\n\nBy then Watmore had infused Sunderland with an energy so intense it could probably have powered the Stadium of Light’s floodlights. Shawcross and company certainly did not seem to relish “the Ginger Messi” running at them with a dizzyingly disorientating amalgam of skill and sheer, pace-propelled persistence.\n\nTwo minutes into the second half Shawcross collected a second yellow card after felling Watmore and Stoke were down to 10 men. With Sunderland finally upping their possession quota Jack Butland assumed centre stage, the goalkeeper performing acrobatic wonders to repel Sebastián Coates’s header following Jeremain Lens’s cross.\n\nSensing Sunderland were in danger of drawing a game they needed to win, Allardyce attempted to change the narrative. Withdrawing John O’Shea, he switched to a back four and did not have to wait long for a breakthrough.

If there was any disappointment at having to share the points with Manchester United and the lead with Manchester City it was mitigated by a new scoring record and the fact that the visitors were also prevented from going top.\n\nJamie Vardy's extraordinary Premier League goalscoring record – in pictures Read more\n\nLeicester beat United in one of the more famous results from last season but the stakes are higher for both sides now. While the result might not have been the most notable aspect of this game at least Leicester showed their current position is not a false one. On the only other occasion they have faced opponents from the Champions League bracket this season, Arsenal gave them a 5-2 hiding and their only defeat to date. There was no suggestion of that here; the two sides were as evenly matched as the score suggests.\n\n“Little by little,” Claudio Ranieri said with a smile. “I told the players to win and try and help Jamie break the record. I am really pleased he has done, we can all be very proud about it and I hope he carries on, but the real target this season is 40 points and now we have 11 to go. That is our project, and we are getting there.”\n\nManchester United reverted to the three-centre-back system they started out with under Louis van Gaal for their visit to the erstwhile league leaders, partly out of respect for Vardy’s hot streak but also because Marcos Rojo had to pull out injured. Predictably all the attention was on Vardy in the opening stages, the striker having to cope with the novel pressure of a huge weight of expectation, yet it was Riyad Mahrez who caused the United defence most problems. Ashley Young was deservedly cautioned for pulling back the Algerian when beaten early in the game, and Daley Blind was lucky not to join him in the book for a blatant block on the same Leicester player a few minutes later.\n\nThe significance of Young’s booking was seen when Vardy sent an already loud stadium into full party mode midway through the first half. The wing back knew he had to either check Vardy’s run or stay with him, and in the event he could do neither. He was clearly tempted to tug the striker’s shirt but thought better of it, undoubtedly due to his earlier yellow card, and Vardy was free to steal in behind Matteo Darmian and provide the finish Christian Fuchs’ glorious pass deserved. It was the sort of goal you could see happening almost in advance, once the move started, and the greatest compliment one could pay the scorer was that as soon as he read Fuchs’ intentions and began his run there was never any doubt how he would finish it.\n\nA new Premier League record deserves enormous credit, even if Jimmy Dunne’s all-time top-flight feat is still another goal and game away, yet Mahrez was unwilling to be upstaged. As Leicester began to show their attacking class in a period of pressure before the interval he first brought a save from David de Gea with a shot from a narrow angle, then delighted the home fans with another piece of skill on the edge of the area to create another opening.\n\nLeicester’s Jamie Vardy makes history to show the pest is the best | Stuart James Read more\n\nUnited weathered that storm, though were not really producing much in reply. Again there was too much space between midfield and attack, with the inclusion of Juan Mata not significantly raising the levels of creativity after the sterile display against PSV in midweek, though right on the stroke of the interval the visitors managed to draw level from a set piece. Bastian Schweinsteiger had narrowly failed to meet an Anthony Martial cross in front of goal a few minutes earlier, but when Blind sent over a corner from the right in virtually the last act of the first half the German met it solidly even with Shinji Okazaki hanging off his back. Kasper Schmeichel had no chance with the firmest of headers from the six-yard line.\n\nWhile parity slightly flattered United at the break they almost took the lead at the start of the second half from an almost identical set piece. This time Blind dummied a free-kick on the right to let Young send over a cross. Schweinsteiger was the target and once again he made a powerful connection, only for Schmeichel to react quickly and beat away his header. After an hour the game was finely poised. Leicester had lost their initial attacking urgency and United’s slow build-ups were gradually moving them further up the pitch. With most of the contest now taking place in the Leicester half the home side were going to need a breakaway goal to regain the lead, and it should have arrived when Mahrez launched a quick counter from his own half, got goal-side of Blind and laid the ball off to his left to allow Leonardo Ulloa a clear shooting opportunity. The newly arrived substitute’s shot was on target but lacked conviction, De Gea saved with his feet and United breathed again. The rest of the game in brief: Wayne Rooney was substituted early, Vardy missed a 90th-minute chance to either score or set up a winner.

Sunderland were organised in defence, strong in midfield and, most importantly, decisive in attack. The visitors may not have deserved to leave south London with all three points but that is what they achieved and they should no longer feel relegation is a formality.\n\nThere is still work to do, given that Sunderland remain in the bottom three and are one point from safety before Saturday’s visit of Stoke, but there is now undoubtedly a firm base to build on. Allardyce intimated as much when describing this win, Sunderland’s second of the season and first away from home, as “massive” and one that “hopefully instils more confidence in the players”.\n\nAnd surely no one will feel more enthused than Jermain Defoe, who got the winner here in a style that showed at the age of 33 he remains a finisher who retains cleverness of movement and thought when it matters most. This contest appeared to be heading towards a stodgy goalless draw when, with 10 minutes remaining, Scott Dann failed to deal properly with Billy Jones’s pass. The Palace defender could have shepherded the ball back to his goalkeeper, Wayne Hennessey, or cleared it out of play, but instead he felt Defoe’s breath on his neck and panicked, hooking the ball straight into the path of Sunderland’s No18, who rounded Hennessey and was never going to miss with the net gaping in front of him.\n\nFor Dann it was some way to crash back to earth having scored Palace’s late winner when they won 2-1 at Liverpool before the international break and for all those associated with the south London club, who could have moved up to sixth with victory here, the sense of injustice was obvious. They had dominated possession, territory and chances created against opponents who from the outset were content to defend deep and counter-attack when the opportunity presented itself.\n\nFrom Allardyce came no apologies for his methods. The manager’s decision to line up his team in a 3-5-2 formation, which had backfired when used in the 6-2 defeat by Everton at the start of the month, had worked a treat, with the three-man defence of Sebastián Coates, John O’Shea and Younès Kaboul particularly impressing with their organisation and relentless desire to block and clear every cross and shot that came their way. A clean sheet, Sunderland’s second of the season following the one they achieved in the recent 3-0 win against Newcastle, was fully deserved.\n\n“I have no problem winning 1-0 and playing exactly how Crystal Palace play away from home,” said Allardyce. “Palace do it better than us but we’ve done it sufficiently well tonight. We nullified Bolasie, frustrated Zaha and haven’t allowed Palace to create any clear-cut chances. We know the goal came from a mistake by the opposition but, when the opposition make a mistake, you have to capitalise on it and that’s what we did.”\n\nPalace did create chances but, as Allardyce said, their key threats were kept at bay, with Yannick Bolasie, Wilfried Zaha and Jason Puncheon unable to find the time and space behind the former Sunderland player Connor Wickham, playing alone up front, to cause problems with their pace and trickery. The home team were being restricted to speculative efforts, with the most eye-catching in the first half being James McArthur’s long-range drive on 30 minutes that Costel Pantilimon comfortably saved.\n\nPardew brought Bakary Sako on for Puncheon at the break and switched to a 4-4-2 formation in an attempt to break Sunderland down and while Palace, playing with more pace and gusto, did begin to make inroads, with Yohan Cabaye and Sako – who had to be replaced himself on 69 minutes due to a suspected hamstring strain – delivering decent shots on goal within a matter of minutes, the threat from those in red and blue was never overwhelming.\n\n“We weren’t as good as we normally are,” admitted Pardew. “A few of our players were not at their best and we couldn’t find a way to break Sunderland down. It’s a painful loss for us.”\n\nAnd it was not lost on Pardew that the pain was ultimately delivered by a player he knows well, having managed Defoe during their time together at West Ham. The striker’s goal was his seventh of the season and credit should be given to Jones for the role he played in the decisive moment, stealing possession from Bolasie close to the halfway line before delivering a quick pass through the heart of Palace’s defence.\n\n“The players have got to be saviours, not me,” said Allardyce. “I can guide them but they need to go out and prove themselves and the only way they can do that is by getting results like this one.”"}, {"date": "22/11/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35968, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup":

start backing Tottenham Hotspur for a Champions League finish.\n\nAfter the encouragement of the performance, if not entirely the result, in the 1-1 draw at Arsenal before the international break they swatted aside a West Ham United team who have made a habit of rousing themselves for the big away games.\n\nTottenham Hotspur v West Ham: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nApart from a decent enough opening 20 minutes Slaven Bilic’s team were second best in all areas – particularly defensively – and it was hard to think of any of his players who truly showed their best, apart from the goalkeeper, Adrián. He conceded four times and was at fault for Harry Kane’s second goal but he was comfortably West Ham’s best player.\n\nTottenham revelled in a victory that extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to 12 matches, a club record. The goals are flowing once more for Kane and the two here made it eight in his last five club appearances. He has scored in his last four league games. Jamie Vardy, watch out.\n\nManuel Lanzini is a hit for West Ham from well under the radar Read more\n\nThe White Hart Lane crowd shouted they wanted five after Kyle Walker had played a give-and-go with Son Heung-min to curl home the fourth with the outside of his boot for his first goal since December 2013 and it was one of those days when virtually everything went to plan.\n\nThe only disappointment for Tottenham was the needless booking that Dele Alli picked up after he became embroiled in a row with Mark Noble which had not really concerned him. Alli stepped in to stand up for Kane after a skirmish and he will now be suspended for Sunday’s home game against Chelsea.\n\nIt was Tottenham’s intensity, their high line and the sheer ferocity of their collective pressing, together with their decisiveness, that stood out. They were quicker, physically stronger and they squeezed the life out of West Ham, whose only response was the late consolation from Manuel Lanzini, a wonderful strike that deserved better than to be relegated to a footnote. Lanzini turned Walker inside then out before he lashed the ball into the roof of the net.\n\nWest Ham had arrived on the back of their best Premier League start, having won all three of their London derbies this season and with a positive recent record at this stadium. But they unravelled after Kane had opened the scoring and they could have suffered a much heavier defeat. Mauricio Pochettino could be seen urging his Tottenham players to press higher and higher and it was they who earned the right to play their football; West Ham blinked first and then again and again.\n\nAdrián had repelled Christian Eriksen’s drive, which took a slight deflection off James Tomkins, when Tottenham went ahead. Bilic could be deeply unhappy with his defenders at various points of the afternoon and the first instance was Carl Jenkinson’s failure to keep hold of Kane.\n\nSon worked the ball to Alli and the midfielder’s shot was blocked, before it squirted back off him towards Kane. It was crowded inside the area and Jenkinson appeared to have the position on Kane. But the striker used his strength to roll away from him and thrash a shot high past Adrián.\n\nBilic barely flinched when Tottenham’s second went in. Instead he stood and stared at the carnage that Toby Alderweireld had wreaked inside the West Ham box. It was not difficult to read his stony features. From Eriksen’s corner Alderweireld got the jump on Winston Reid with a quick dart towards the near post and, when the West Ham defender passed him on to Andy Carroll, the alarm bells were ringing. Alderweireld rose in front of Carroll to flash his header home.\n\nTottenham might have had more before the interval. Son threw West Ham’s defenders with a drop of the shoulder before working Adrián and, on the follow-up, Alli put his head in front of Tomkins’ high boot to loop an effort against the crossbar. The clearest chance fell to Kane in the 39th minute after a ricochet off Reid but, one-on-one with Adrián, he dragged his left-foot shot badly.\n\nWest Ham lamented the moment at 1-0 when, after Noble’s shot had looped up and the offside flag mystifyingly stayed down, Cheikhou Kouyaté leapt into an overhead kick and crashed the shot against the crossbar.\n\nTottenham, though, turned the screw in the second half and the third goal followed West Ham’s most excruciating lapse. Tomkins, attempting to play out from the back, rolled the ball straight to Eriksen who shifted it quickly up to Kane. His low shot flicked off Reid and fizzed underneath Adrián, who had to do better.\n\nAlli and Noble were booked and so were Walker and Diafra Sakho for more of the same later, but it was Tottenham who smelled blood. Adrián made a double save to deny Son and Eriksen in the 53rd minute and after Lanzini’s goal Tottenham almost got the fifth only for the substitute Ryan Mason’s long-range shot to hit the post.\n\nMan of the match Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur)"}, {"date": "21/11/2015", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20702, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [68], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Almen Abdi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [90], "goals": [87], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Manuel Jurado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Obbi Oularé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Carlos Paredes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Víctor Ibarbo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alessandro Diamanti", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Giedrius Arlauskis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Young", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bastian Schweinsteiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [25]}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Memphis Depay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [25], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paddy McNair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcus Rashford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sean Goss", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "No Wayne Rooney, no Anthony Martial, no problem. Manchester United willed themselves to a precious victory thanks to a dramatic late intervention from a striker, although it was a player in a yellow shirt rather than a red one who got the telling touch during a breathless assault on the Watford goal in stoppage time.\n\nThose final few minutes will be hard for Troy Deeney to absorb. Watford’s captain appeared to have rescued a point for the hosts when he shattered David de Gea’s magnificent resistance with a penalty in the 87th minute and it seemed that the day would end in frustration for United, who had spurned so many chances after Memphis Depay’s early goal. Yet the sucker punch came when Deeney’s attempt to clear Bastian Schweinsteiger’s shot ended with the ball trickling over the line. “It was painful,” Quique Sánchez Flores said.\n\nSanti Cazorla’s penalty slip costs Arsenal a draw at West Bromwich Albion Read more\n\nSchweinsteiger admitted that it was an own goal and the German will have to wait a little longer for his first goal in English football, but it was an afternoon when United concentrated on collective rather than personal glory. The only frustration was that Ander Herrera and Phil Jones are highly doubtful for the visit of PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League on Wednesday, although Van Gaal expects Rooney to return. “We are in a lousy period because there are a lot of injuries,” he said. “Jones has a twisted ankle and Herrera maybe a hamstring injury.”\n\nWith his attack depleted by Rooney’s illness and Martial’s ankle injury, Van Gaal improvised. Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson were also missing and the fear for United was that Van Gaal’s thinking outside the box would reduce their threat inside Watford’s. At first glance Van Gaal resembled a chef who had been asked to provide a roast dinner, only to find that there was no meat in the fridge, yet United’s manager was invigorated by the challenge of solving the tactical puzzle and Watford struggled to come to terms with the visitors’ fluid formation at first.\n\nUnited’s front three alternated positions cleverly. Sometimes Depay was on the left, sometimes he was through the middle. Sometimes Juan Mata took up a central role, sometimes it was Jesse Lingard, and if it was difficult to keep track of United’s movement from the stands, imagine how tough it was for Watford’s defenders.\n\nThe early signs had been less than promising when Ashley Young charged down the right and sent a cross into the Watford area. The ball sailed behind for a goal-kick. Yet United continued to probe down that flank and their approach brought them the opening goal in the 11th minute. Herrera’s bending cross reached Depay and he punished Watford’s woeful marking by cushioning a firm volley past Heurelho Gomes. Van Gaal had the response he wanted from Depay on the forward’s first league start since he was hauled off at half-time against Arsenal on 4 October.\n\nEverton’s Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku lead thrashing of Aston Villa Read more\n\n“A superb goal,” Van Gaal said. “The way we played, it suits them. That was good. Now we know we can play in another system. But we have to improve our positional game. We were very good in other games – so good that it was boring.”\n\nVan Gaal smiled after that reference to United’s critics. He feels that their structure disturbs opponents but there was more zip to United’s play here and it was only their lack of ruthlessness that made them vulnerable. Morgan Schneiderlin whistled a volley over and Lingard was twice denied by Gomes when he was through on goal.\n\nWatford began nervously, Odion Ighalo missing their only chance of the first half, but they improved after the break and De Gea made two outstanding saves, the first from Deeney’s thunderous drive, the second from Almen Abdi’s prod.\n\nThe final 20 minutes became a physical battle for a tiring United and a jet-lagged Marcos Rojo fouled Ighalo in the area. Yet Deeney’s equaliser merely jolted United into life and when Gomes saved Lingard’s low shot, Schweinsteiger squeezed the ball back into the middle and it went in off Deeney.\n\n“I am very proud I am the manager of that team,” Van Gaal said.

defeats, although none were as loud as José Mourinho’s.\n\nBack in his usual habitat of his side’s once impregnable fortress after his one-match stadium ban, Mourinho spent the majority of the last 20 minutes of this nervy win over Norwich glued to his seat on the bench.\n\nChelsea’s Eden Hazard looks as if he has woken from a baffling dream | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nWhen the referee, Craig Pawson, finally blew for full-time to confirm Diego Costa’s second-half goal as the match winner, the Chelsea manager allowed himself a brief punch of the air in triumph before disappearing down the tunnel.\n\n“It was bit of relief,” he admitted. “I’m not nervous on the bench, I am OK, I am fine. I think we don’t deserve the heartbeat of the last four minutes. I think we deserve to be enjoying the last three, four minutes with a two, three, 4-0 result, relaxed. But we couldn’t.”\n\nDespite Costa’s third Premier League goal of the season, that Norwich could so easily have snatched an equaliser late on could largely be attributed to his failure to take more than one of the succession of chances that came his way. By this stage last year, the Spain international had scored 11 times in the Premier League but he looks a shadow of that player.\n\nAfter side-footing over from the penalty spot having been picked out by Pedro, Costa wasted the best chance of the first half when he dallied for too long and was denied by John Ruddy in the Norwich goal. That miss was not well received in the Chelsea dugout and Mourinho must have been considering substituting his combative striker moments before the game’s key moment arrived. A quickly taken free kick from Cesc Fàbregas caught the Norwich defence cold and this time Costa found the corner of the net.\n\n“If I had to choose somebody to score the winning goal, I would go exactly with him,” Mourinho said. “Every game that you don’t score goals, you get 5kg more. You get heavy and the pressure is there.\n\n“In the first half he misses two chances. The second one, in the last minute, is really a big one. So it was important for him. Important for us, the result and the goal, but I think also for him.”\n\nYet if this does end up being a turning point in Costa and Chelsea’s season, Mourinho will know that Eden Hazard deserves just as much credit. The Belgian has looked like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders in recent months but offered a timely reminder of his quality just when Chelsea needed him..\n\nMourinho rose to applaud him with the rest of the home supporters when he was substituted in injury time after an energetic performance that should have created at least one goal had Costa been at his best. In the end, though, it was one moment of indecision from the well-organised Norwich defence that proved decisive, much to the chagrin of Alex Neil.\n\nArsenal sunk by Mikel Arteta own goal at West Bromwich Albion Read more\n\n“The first thing we should do is get around the ball to stop it being taken quickly, or take the ball with us, and even then recover our positions quicker,” lamented the Norwich manager, who also felt his side could have had a penalty when Robbie Brady was felled by a fast-retreating Willian in the first half. “That little lapse in concentration ultimately cost us the match.”\n\nAfter the last few results, Mourinho will be thankful that it did. Hazard aside, Chelsea still look a shadow of the team that won the title last season and the decision to drop César Azpilicueta and play the Brazilian teenager Kenedy out of position at left-back illustrates the depth of their problems. Branislav Ivanovic did make his first start since the 3-1 home defeat against Southampton at the beginning of October, although there seemed to be lack of cohesion in both defence and attack.\n\nAgainst better sides, they will surely have to improve, although Mourinho was realistic enough to admit that they still have plenty of work to do before the season is anywhere near back on track. “We have to go game after game,” he said. “But I said already that the fourth position for me is not an impossible mission. If you ask me the title I would say impossible mission. Maybe Tom Cruise can do it,” he said with the afternoon’s first hint of a smile.\n\n“It’s complicated because you have to recover points from four candidates. But to recover positions and points to teams that normally are in the middle of the table and to grab one of the ones that go up and will also have a little bit of a collapse for sure, because everybody will have.

Now they are reduced to making history of a different sort. The poorest start in their 141-year existence has got worse.\n\nBournemouth unhappy over Swansea fightback while Garry Monk feels heat Read more\n\nIf Rémi Garde was under any illusions about the scale of the challenge he has taken on, he should not be now. Villa’s last 12 outings have produced only two points and the Frenchman’s first defeat was cemented before the interval. “When you are 3-0 down at half-time, the game is over,” the new manager admitted. While Villa acquitted themselves commendably to secure a draw against Manchester City in Garde’s debut, they capitulated embarrassingly here.\n\n“We could have done much better,” the Frenchman said. That amounted to an understatement. Villa should be grateful the substitute Kevin Mirallas did not add a fifth goal in a sparkling cameo.\n\nAs it was, Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku scored twice apiece for an elegantly rampant Everton side who are developing a taste for thrashings. “Ten goals from open play in two games at home is quite remarkable,” said their manager, Roberto Martínez. “It is a group of players with an incredible chemistry.”\n\nLike Sunderland’s Sam Allardyce, another recent appointment whose new charges were eviscerated at Goodison Park, Garde saw Everton illustrate the problems he inherited. Villa were anaemic in attack, where the loneliest of lone strikers, Jordan Ayew, was distanced from his team-mates, insipid in midfield and dismal in defence.\n\nIndeed, Garde’s troubles have mushroomed. Within half an hour, the absence of left-back Jordan Amavi, who is out for the season with a knee injury, assumed huge proportions. Amavi’s deputy, Kieran Richardson, cut a hapless, helpless figure as he was subjected to trial by the tricky Gerard Deulofeu. “Gerry has been at that level for many weeks,” added Martínez.\n\nEach of Everton’s first four openings stemmed from their right flank. Two produced fine saves from Brad Guzan, denying Séamus Coleman and, brilliantly, Arouna Koné. The other two brought goals. The dazzling Deulofeu was the instigator of the first. After Guzan succeeded in parrying his shot, Barkley swept in the rebound.\n\nEverton continued to plough a productive path. Coleman delivered a right-wing cross that Lukaku met with a glancing header. His 50th Premier League goal was perfectly placed and he joined a select band, with Robbie Fowler, Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, who have reached that landmark before their 23rd birthday. “It is an impressive list of elite footballers and Rom fits into that group extremely well,” said Martínez. “We keep getting a reminder of what a special talent we have at the football club. He is a very young man with incredible potential and still only 22.”\n\nBojan Krkic goal for Stoke City sees off Southampton and keeps up fine run Read more\n\nBarkley is still only 21. His second goal was as simple as his first, but each was proof of his predatory instincts. When Guzan was unable to cling on to the ball as he challenged Koné, it broke free for Barkley. It amounted to an open goal. Villa were duly vanquished.\n\n“The Premier League is very physically demanding and in the first 45 minutes we couldn’t answer,” Garde said. If his side were marginally brighter after the break, Everton’s fourth goal was as damning as any that preceded it. Martínez’s men simply passed their way through the middle of the visitors’ defence, Deulofeu, Barkley and Lukaku combining for the Belgian to score his second.\n\n“That partnership between Rom and Gerry was very lively,” said Martínez. Everton could savour the Rom and Gerry show.

Or that a former non-league striker would have equalled Ruud van Nistelrooy’s feat of scoring in 10 successive Premier League games?\n\nArsenal sunk by Mikel Arteta own goal at West Bromwich Albion Read more\n\nVan Nistelrooy set that record with Manchester United and, perhaps appropriately, Leicester’s Jamie Vardy will endeavour to break it when Louis van Gaal’s side visit the east Midlands next Saturday. If Vardy does score against United, then Jimmy Dunne’s top-flight record of 12, from 1931-32, will be his next target.\n\nNewcastle United’s persistent failure to second-guess Vardy’s slick movement and defender destabilising change of pace resulted in Steve McClaren’s side being jeered off with relegation fears renewed.\n\nDamningly, they failed to direct a single shot on target on a day when the No9’s opening goal, deftly registered on the brink of half-time, seemed to provoke a near wholesale home surrender.\n\nAs Ranieri – delighting in confounding those who mocked his appointment at the start of the season– revelled in life at the top of the table McClaren was a study in introspection. How Newcastle’s manager must have regretted likening himself to the captain of the Titanic in the preamble to kick off.\n\nIn contrast Ranieri cannot put a foot wrong at present. “We’re top for the moment,” he beamed. “But I want to see us there at the end of the race. I’m very happy for Jamie. It’s a great achievement, not easy to do but the team made a fantastic performance. Jamie said thank you to everybody in the dressing room afterwards. He’s a nice boy.”\n\nSnow had to be shovelled off the pitch on Saturday morning and Newcastle remained in semi-frozen mode throughout. Apparently oblivious to the Arctic chill, Leicester required no thawing out; for a team which supposedly prefers to operate on the counterattack they enjoyed an awful lot of the ball.\n\nWith Vardy showing no signs of the hip injury which necessitated a late fitness test the otherwise disappointing Aleksandar Mitrovic was required to throw himself into a vital block in order to deny the man of the moment a goal. Subsequently only Vurnon Anita’s clearance prevented Leonardo Ulloa from scoring following excellent play on Riyad Mahrez’s part.\n\nSignificantly Anita was the sole Newcastle player who could hold his head high at the end.\n\nIf the early injury that prefaced Cheik Tioté limping off to be replaced – somewhat surprisingly and perhaps unwisely – by the rather less combative Florian Thauvin hardly helped McClaren’s cause, it does not fully explain the poverty of his team’s performance.\n\nThe only surprise was that it took Vardy almost until the interval to take one of the chances that kept coming hisway. Appropriately he began the decisive move exchanging passes with Ulloa and making an angled, offside defying run, before cutting cleverly inside Chancel Mbemba. All that remained was for him to shoot low, unerringly, beyond Elliot.\n\nDiego Costa on target as Chelsea beat Norwich to end disastrous run Read more\n\nAt a stroke Van Nistelrooy’s record was equalled. Sportingly Newcastle fans joined in the applause. When, very shortly afterwards, the half-time whistle blew such generosity of spirit was swiftly replaced by a much more familiar sound track: booing.\n\nAs dusk descended, McClaren shifted uneasily on the touchline. The Newcastle manager’s mood can hardly have improved as, having met Mahrez’s ball, Vardy, all too easily dodged the usually dependable Mbemba before hitting the bar.\n\nOnce again the home side failed to heed that warning. When the influential Mahrez deceived Paul Dummett before whipping in a fabulous cross, they seemed immune to the danger from the late dashing Ulloa who was permitted to advance unimpeded before heading Leicester’s second goal. It was an excellent finish but marking rarely comes more slapdash.\n\nHis work done, Vardy high-fived his way off. “I’ve managed to get there, I’ve equalled Van Nistelrooy’s record and we’ll see what happens next,” he says. “Every day I have to keep pinching myself but the most important thing is that we got three points and kept a clean sheet. We’ve got a never say die attitude, we’ll fight for each other to the very end and it shows.”\n\nPerhaps anxious to remind everyone they are not quite a one-man team, Leicester extended their lead without him, Shinji Okazaki forcing a rebound across the line from close range after Elliot could only parry Danny Simpson’s shot.\n\n“No excuses, our worst performance of the season,” McClaren said. “We’ve been progressing but today was a setback. It’s a big blow. It’s a case of two steps forward, three steps backwards at the moment. It’s not easy.”"}, {"date": "21/11/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30039, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

charged clear down the right and, as the England full-back Ryan Bertrand ushered the Swiss winger inside, he played the ball across the 18-yard line to Marko Arnautovic.\n\nThe Austrian helped the ball out to the overlapping full-back Erik Pieters, whose cross was flicked in at the near post by the unmarked Krkic.\n\n“He has that ability to drift between defenders,” said Hughes. “It wasn’t an easy finish – it was a good ball in but it still needed converting.\n\n“That’s the ability he has. You need that creative spark, players who can make a difference, and we have two or three of those now.\n\n“If you get those players in the right areas and give them opportunities, they will win you games. Bojan has won a game for us in terms of the goal he scored.”\n\nHughes’s side have lost once on their travels this season, winning three and drawing three, and they moved to within a point of Southampton after halting the hosts’ six-match unbeaten streak in the Premier League.\n\nThey could, and probably should, have scored more, with Shaqiri – starting to show the class that persuaded Hughes to spend a club record £12m to sign him from Internazionale – wasting two good chances to open his account for the club, Arnautovic twice firing narrowly wide and Ibrahim Afellay having an effort cleared off the line.\n\n“I’m very pleased.

manager wanted but any sense of frustration and injustice belonged to Eddie Howe after Bournemouth squandered a two-goal lead and saw a dubious penalty awarded against them on a day when the Swansea supporters briefly threatened to turn on their team.\n\nAndré Ayew’s instinctive back-heel, only 87 seconds after Dan Gosling had doubled Bournemouth’s advantage, could not have been better timed from Swansea’s point of view. The mood changed and so did the momentum of the game for a moment as Swansea hauled themselves level when Jonjo Shelvey converted from the spot after Simon Francis was rather harshly adjudged to have tripped Ayew.\n\nJamie Vardy equals Premier League record as Leicester win at Newcastle Read more\n\nThat goal could have provided Swansea with a platform to go on and win the game against a Bournemouth side that had lost their previous five matches but nothing is straightforward for Garry Monk’s team right now. Confidence is brittle and it showed on an afternoon when Bournemouth played with a belief and intensity that was hard to reconcile with their league position and poor run of results.\n\nMonk spoke about the encouragement he took from seeing his team fight back but it was hard to find many other positives. Boos reverberated around the stadium when Bournemouth scored their second and the discontent, while not as vociferous, was evident again at the final whistle. Swansea have now won only one of their last nine league games and Monk remains a man under pressure.\n\n“It’s not about me,” Swansea’s manager said. “I’m not the important one here. The important ones are the players. It’s trying to help them get back to winning ways, give them confidence and that will be done by results. You could see clearly how much the players wanted to put it right. It didn’t go to plan but I have to give the players massive credit. My job is to try and push these players and get them back to their best, and that’s what I do. Everything else is out of my hands.”\n\nWhile Monk felt that Andre Marriner, the referee, had been right to allow both Swansea goals to stand, Howe described them as contentious. Francis made some contact with Ayew but it appeared accidental and it also seemed as though the Ghanaian tripped himself up when he finally went to ground. With the first goal, Ayew was close to straying offside. “Simon admitted there was contact with Ayew but felt he tripped over his own feet,” Howe said. “Something about it did not look right. If it was outside the box no one would have argued. Inside the box it is a huge moment in the game.”\n\nBournemouth’s opener came about after some shambolic defending. Junior Stanislas overran the ball only for Kyle Bartley – one of three Swansea players making his first Premier League start of the season – to kick his clearance against Ki Sung-yueng. Stanislas accepted the gift as the ball rebounded to him and the winger delivered a low cross that King turned in.\n\nAdam Federici denied Wayne Routledge and Éder – another player brought in from the cold – as Swansea threatened to equalise only for Bournemouth to breakaway and score a second. Charlie Daniels carried the ball from deep and off-loaded to Harry Arter, who could easily have opted to shoot. Instead he picked out Matt Ritchie, who was given the time to hold on to the ball before waiting for Gosling to stride into the area. Gosling’s fine first-time shot arrowed into the top cover and the home fans made their thoughts known.\n\nMonk felt that reaction filtered through to the players. “It’s quite natural for them to feel that, especially when you’ve conceded the goal and then you feel that tension in the crowd and they transfer that to the pitch. But that’s where I thought the players deserved tremendous credit for coming back under those circumstances.”\n\nCrucially, Bournemouth were unable to hold on to that two-goal lead for long. Ayew, showing some dexterous footwork, controlled the ball with his right foot and back-heeled home with his left and within the blink of an eye Swansea were level through Shelvey’s penalty.

This defeat dredged up those old concerns about the mental fortitude of Arsène Wenger’s men and also highlighted the damage wrought by their long casualty list.\n\nTheir problems on the latter front were aggravated by injuries to Francis Coquelin and Mikel Arteta. Wenger could have done without such blows before Tuesday’s match with Dinamo Zagreb, which Arsenal must win to avoid an unusually early exist from the Champions League.\n\nArsène Wenger angered by Arsenal’s nightmare showing at West Brom Read more\n\nThe hope among many Arsenal fans since their team’s sloppy start in the Champions League has been that failure in Europe could help fuel success in the Premier League, but there was little to feed that optimism here, as they looked short of resources and resourcefulness. Which is not to diminish the valour of their hosts, who worked hard for their win even if they were thankful for a comical late penalty miss by Santi Cazorla.\n\nArsenal have grown used to suffering away to teams managed by Tony Pulis and their trip here proved to be as chastening as their visits to Pulis’s Stoke tended to be. Some Albion fans have grumbled about the no-frills football served up this season but a satisfying result and some fine displays by their attackers, especially from James McClean and Salomón Rondón, meant no home fans were complaining about their approach to this match.\n\nSaido Berahino was left on the bench and Albion adopted their familiar posture from the start, immediately filing backwards and allowing Arsenal possession. The visitors’ challenge was to plot a path through the massed defence and to guard against quick counterattacks. For most of the first half they failed both tasks. There was an early indication of their vulnerability to counterattacks when McClean, starting as he would continue, darted between Alexis Sánchez and Héctor Bellerín in the seventh minute before curling a dangerous pass across the face of goal. No Albion player was near enough to goal to take the chance.\n\nPulis’s plan then looked to be undone by nothing more cunning than a well-flighted set-piece. Sánchez had gone close from a free-kick in the 15th minute – Boaz Myhill saving the Chilean’s 20-yard drive – and then, in the 28th, another free-kick led to Giroud nodding Arsenal into the lead. Albion defenders were conspicuous by their inertia as the striker met Mesut Özil’s delivery from 10 yards.\n\nThe onus now was on Albion to conjure something special. Or retort through a free-kick of their own, which is what they did seven minutes later. Chris Brunt curled in a free-kick every bit as sweet as Özil’s and Arsenal defended every bit as badly as Albion had, allowing Morrison to fire first time into the far corner.\n\nThe creation of Albion’s second goal was more artful, even if it started with Özil being pestered into surrendering possession near halfway. Rondón and McClean then combined neatly before the Irishman pinged a cross from the byline to the near post and Arteta inadvertently bundled it into his own goal.\n\nArteta had been introduced as an early substitute for Coquelin, who hurt his knee in a zealous tackle on Claudio Yacob. However, a more significant factor as Arsenal sought a way back into the game was the enforced absences of several fast and creative players, such as Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Danny Welbeck and Aaron Ramsey. Arteta, meanwhile, lasted a little more than half an hour, being replaced by Mathieu Flamini early in the second half.\n\nEven deprived of so many creative talents, Arsenal almost equalised just after the interval, Özil latching on to a breaking ball in the box before unleashing a shot that bounced back off the post.\n\nArsenal’s injury problems have precluded Wenger from resting Sánchez but the Chilean was making light of his heavy workload and a brilliant run in the 53rd minute created a chance for Kieran Gibbs. But Craig Dawson threw himself in front of the shot to make a superb block.\n\nWest Brom 2-1 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAlbion did more than merely defend, with Rondón and McClean causing occasional panic in the Arsenal rearguard.\n\nAfter two enforced changes, Wenger used his third substitution to cast on Joel Campbell just after the hour. The Costa Rican was soon presented with a great chance to mark his arrival but he bungled badly. A slip by Brunt allowed a pass by Santi Cazorla to land at the feet of the winger six yards from goal – but Campbell stuck out his foot with all the conviction of a shopper unsure about tripping a fleeing thief, and he wafted the ball away from goal.\n\nJonas Olsson, excellent defensively, almost scored a third for Albion but his header from a corner did not cross the line after hitting the underside of the crossbar.\n\nArsenal were then given another chance to salvage a point, the referee pointing rather generously to the spot after Sánchez tumbled under a challenge by Brunt. Cazorla slipped as he was about to connect with the penalty, sending the ball high over the bar and summing up Arsenal’s miserable afternoon."}, {"date": "21/11/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium",

thrilling football that Manchester City’s owners in Abu Dhabi want to see of their own team. Jürgen Klopp’s side should really have made this an even more comprehensive rout, offering great encouragement for his coaching expertise behind the scenes, and the modern-day City have never been beaten so heavily in their 12 years at this ground.\n\nManuel Pellegrini: ‘I am more than angry, it was a complete disaster’ Read more\n\nLiverpool were three ahead after 33 minutes and, as Manuel Pellegrini accepted afterwards, could conceivably have scored that many again before Sergio Agüero’s goal, on his return from injury, briefly offered City a flicker of hope before half-time. Philippe Coutinho, in particular, was exhilarating, scoring one and playing a significant part in two others. Roberto Firmino had his best game for the club and it was almost a surprise Liverpool restricted themselves to only one more goal in the second half, courtesy of Martin Skrtel’s 81st-minute shot.\n\nJames Milner, one of several outstanding performers, will have cherished his return to his former club, putting in an indefatigable shift, and Emre Can played with great distinction. Raheem Sterling, in stark contrast, had a difficult game against his old team-mates, culminating in him completely missing the ball with the goal at his mercy. Yaya Touré and Jesús Navas were substituted at half-time and, though Joe Hart was partly to blame for the third goal, his team-mates ought to be grateful that his goalkeeping prevented the ordeal being even worse.\n\nNo team can defend this badly and expect to get away with it and City were so desperate there was the rarity of a Pellegrini press conference when he actually offered his genuine thoughts. He was “more than angry”, describing it as a “complete disaster” and saying he had “never seen this team play the way we did tonight”. Yet this was actually City’s second 4-1 beating in their last six league games, following on from the game at Tottenham Hotspur on 26 September, and it finished with their heaviest home defeat since a 5-1 thrashing against Arsenal at Maine Road in February 2003. It was more than coincidence, some may feel, that the Spurs game was the last time Martín Demichelis started in defence.\n\nThe tone was set after eight minutes when Eliaquim Mangala could not arrange his legs and, almost in slow motion, diverted Firmino’s cross into his own net. Vincent Kompany might be occasionally accident-prone but he is still the best organiser City have defensively and, with their captain missing because of his recurring injury issues, it must have been startling for Pellegrini to see how vulnerable his team were. Mangala is one of the world’s costliest defenders but, for all his raw potential, he still has a tendency to be a danger to his own team. Demichelis was just as bad and Bacary Sagna’s part in the opening goal, collecting the ball from Hart and promptly losing it to Coutinho, must have made City’s supporters pine for the days when a fit, trustworthy Pablo Zabaleta brought steady assurance to the right-back spot.\n\nMaybe, in hindsight, Pellegrini will regret not starting Nicolás Otamendi in defence and, likewise, it was perplexing that he left out Fernandinho in favour of the inferior Fernando. City’s manager repelled all those questions afterwards, but the Demichelis-Mangala axis simply had no answer for the quick, decisive counterattacking football of Klopp’s team. Their only mitigation was the lack of protection from midfield and Touré, who virtually pulled out of one 50-50 with Can, has never had a more ignominious game in City’s colours.\n\nWithout exaggeration, Liverpool could feel aggrieved not to leave the pitch at half-time with at least two more goals to show for their supremacy. They were rampant, breaking at speed and quickly sensing that the team that began the day at the top of the league were there for the taking. Firmino had a couple of clear chances at 3-0 and Liverpool, at that stage, must have been astonished by the generosity of their opponents.\n\nManuel Pellegrini’s defence gamble fails badly for Manchester City | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nCoutinho, aided and abetted by Firmino, was brilliantly sharp and alert, whereas City appeared to be playing in a straightjacket. The second goal came midway through the first half, originating from a misplaced Demichelis header but also featuring another demonstration of Mangala’s lack of anticipation. Liverpool were attacking with width and penetration and Firmino latched on to the loose ball, crossing from the right for Coutinho to nip in and score from eight yards.\n\nAgüero’s goal was a superb reminder of his finishing skills as he turned inside Lucas Leiva and curled a shot around Simon Mignolet from more than 20 yards. Yet it flattered the home team. It was difficult to remember a worse 45 minutes for City in Pellegrini’s time as manager, featuring a good half an hour when Liverpool threatened with virtually every attack.\n\nThe third goal was preceded by Hart making an unconvincing block from a Coutinho shot. As the attack continued, Can’s backheel was beautifully delivered, springing open the entire City defence, and Coutinho slipped a little pass to his right to bypass Hart and leave Firmino with an open goal. The passing and movement was exquisite.\n\nCoutinho had to be substituted during the second half and Liverpool will desperately hope it was cramp he felt in the back of his left leg rather than a tweaked hamstring. The Brazilian had tormented City but Klopp, understated and commenting more about City’s goal than the four Liverpool racked up, was correct afterwards when he pointed out it was a collective effort. Adam Lallana seems to be revitalised. Can was superb and Hart kept the score down before the ball dropped to Skrtel at a corner and he buried his shot. City had been outplayed and, on this evidence, the Klopp effect might be taking hold much more quickly than most people thought likely."}, {"date": "08/11/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance":

The Belgian, trying to backheel an inviting centre from Jesús Navas, inadvertently kicked the ball against his other leg and the home fans breathed a huge sigh of relief.\n\n“Those are decisions that the player has to make in one second,” the City manager said. “It is difficult to try and tell him to do it another way. Maybe if he had scored that goal we would be applauding him.”\n\nPellegrini made the point, with some justification, that City’s chances extended beyond the opportunities that Fernando, De Bruyne and Sterling wasted, and the Chilean also highlighted the fact that Villa, for all their commitment, failed to register a shot on goal in the entire 90 minutes.\n\nWhile Bony now faces a spell on the sidelines, Pellegrini offered some better news about Sergio Agüero, whom he suggested could return to feature against Liverpool on Saturday week. “I hope that this week he, Silva, Nasri and Zabaleta will work with the physiotherapist and next Monday they will start working with the squad. We will see in the way Agüero improves but I think there is a chance he can be fit for Liverpool.”\n\nFor Garde, the absence of a cutting edge is arguably his biggest problem, yet this was not the day to bemoan their toothless attack. With confidence so low and the league leaders in town, Villa were entitled to cherish the fact that they had stopped the rot.\n\nGarde has wasted no time in making his mark on the team and it came as no surprise that the Frenchman restored all four signings from Ligue 1 – Jordan Ayew, Jordan Amavi, Jordan Veretout and Idrissa Gueye – to the starting XI. Not so expected was the sight of Charles N’Zogbia among the substitutes, with the Frenchman coming on to make his first appearance since the FA Cup final.\n\nA little flat in the first half, City dominated after the interval and but for an almost comical save from Brad Guzan would have taken the lead in the 54th minute, when Sterling, who was only four yards out, met Navas’s perfect cross with a powerful header that hit the Villa goalkeeper on the head.\n\nDe Bruyne then made a pig’s ear of his gilt-edged opening after Navas had once again exposed Amavi’s defensive limitations – the 21-year-old looks much better with the ball than he does without it – and by the time Fabian Delph came on in the 78th minute, to a chorus of boos and abuse, City’s search for a goal had become increasingly desperate.\n\nIt was another substitute, Rudy Gestede, who threatened to cause havoc. After City had kicked the ball out to allow N’Zogbia to receive treatment, Gestede took the throw-in and returned it to Joe Hart at some pace. City’s goalkeeper was unable to control the ball and conceded a corner from which Gestede, of all people, swept a first-time left-foot shot that skimmed the roof of the net.\n\nMan of the match Jesús Navas (Manchester City)"}, {"date": "08/11/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60060, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Per Mertesacker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mikel Arteta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Iwobi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Eriksen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [32], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Heung-Min Son", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joshua Onomah", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Lads, it’s Tottenham. The story that Roy Keane tells about the London club, which recalls a pre-match team talk from Sir Alex Ferguson, touched a nerve because for so many years, it has been accurate. Nice and tidy, but do they have the steel to win?\n\nMauricio Pochettino’s current crop are bucking a few stereotypes and they ought to have won this ferocious north London derby. They were the better team for 75 minutes and they had plenty of chances to build upon the lead that Harry Kane’s sixth goal in four matches had granted them.\n\nArsenal 1-1 Tottenham: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThis was a performance of conviction, with plenty of fine individual displays, not least from Mousa Dembélé and Dele Alli in midfield. But just when only a second away win over Arsenal in 22 years was calling, they were undone, and it was a moment that might have had Keane, and others, rolling their eyes.\n\nWhen Arsène Wenger introduced Kieran Gibbs for Joel Campbell on the flank, nobody saw the left-back as the potential saviour. But Gibbs got on the end of Mesut Özil’s cross to jab a volley at goal. Hugo Lloris should have done better. The goalkeeper had to do better. He looked to have the position. But in much the same way that he conceded the late equaliser at Monaco in the Europa League, he could not keep the ball out and it wriggled over the line.\n\nArsenal threatened a late winner through Olivier Giroud, the striker who had blown two clear chances earlier in the second half but defeat would have been too cruel on Tottenham. Pochettino’s men are now unbeaten in 11 games and although Arsenal missed the chance to climb above Manchester City at the top of the table, they had to be happier with the point.\n\nIt was an occasion that was coloured by noise and energy, and shaped by mental fortitude. Arsenal dug deep to find it towards the end and Wenger highlighted how his team had once again found the means to bounce back from a bad result – in this case, last Wednesday’s 5-1 Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich.\n\nBut for long periods it was Tottenham who imposed their personality. Pochettino started with Alli as the No8 and Dembélé as the No10 but he switched them after the early running and both could reflect upon outstanding displays.\n\nDembélé’s wiry strength, control and acceleration stood out while at times like these, it is impossible to look at Alli and realise that he is still only 19. His drive was relentless and some of his tricks were pretty nifty, too. With Santi Cazorla a virtual passenger because of an illness, Tottenham bossed midfield in the first-half. Wenger was forced to withdraw Cazorla at the interval.\n\nAlexis Sánchez had the home team’s only flicker in the first-half but he could get nothing meaningful on Campbell’s low cross and by then, Tottenham were in front. Space had been at a premium but rather abruptly, Kane was afforded yards of it in the 32nd minute when he tore on to Danny Rose’s ball up the inside-left channel. Laurent Koscielny had tried and failed to push up and catch him offside.\n\nKane’s composure was breathtaking. He did not take a touch, rather concentrated on getting his body shape right and when the moment was right, he bent the first-time shot with the inside of his right boot past Petr Cech.\n\nThe game was full-blooded and niggly. Özil had something thrown at him from the enclosure that contained the travelling fans as he went to take a first-half corner; Rose felt Campbell’s flailing arm in his face and he went down theatrically while Jan Vertonghen wrestled Giroud to the ground, off the ball, as they jostled inside the area on 36 minutes. Giroud jumped back up and bumped Vertonghen over.\n\nTottenham had other moments in the first-half. Érik Lamela and, later, Alli could not find a final ball for Kane while Eric Dier headed wide from the corner of the six-yard box. Kane also worked Cech from a tight angle in the 45th minute.\n\nArsenal were much better in the second-half of a contest that became more open and exciting. Lloris had to palm away Campbell’s left-foot curler for the far corner and Giroud had his chances. On the first one he stretched and headed against the crossbar and on the second, having got the better of Dier, he nodded wastefully wide.\n\nTottenham, however, had the opportunities to have made the game safe, and how they came to rue them. Christian Eriksen banged narrowly wide shortly after the restart and, later on, he fully extended Cech after Kyle Walker’s cut-back; Kane twice went close and on 70 minutes, Toby Alderweireld stole on to Lamela’s corner to power a header goalwards.\n\nCech’s reflex save was marvellous and not for the first time, Arsenal were indebted to him. “Goalkeeper is the most underrated position in football because there is always a moment in the game when they can keep you in it,” Wenger said. “If we’d have gone 2-0, it’s bye-bye.”\n\nInstead, Gibbs said hello to a precious point, which extended Arsenal’s unbeaten run in the Premier League to six games. Arsenal pushed hard in the closing stages and they might have found the winner only for Lloris to turn another close-range header from Giroud to safety. Arsenal did not do enough to merit victory.\n\nMan of the match Mousa Dembéle (Tottenham H)"}, {"date": "08/11/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44115, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [40]}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [42], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [40], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Brannagan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Bogdan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joao Carlos Teixeira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [82], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [21], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}], "subs": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Bamford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "“You must be sick of us,” the Crystal Palace fans sang, and Liverpool could only concur. Alan Pardew’s team inflicted the first defeat of the Jürgen Klopp era with their third consecutive Premier League victory over the men from Anfield. One month into the job and Klopp is au fait with Liverpool’s problem club.\n\nGoals from the excellent Yannick Bolasie and Scott Dann, a former Anfield season-ticket holder, gave Palace their latest Merseyside triumph. Pardew has now been involved in all three of Palace’s league wins at Anfield, as a player in 1991 and twice as a manager in 2015, and Liverpool again struggled against his enterprising tactics. Klopp was dismayed by both the outcome and the number of early leavers after Dann scored in the 82nd minute.\n\nThe former Borussia Dortmund coach had a point; this was an absorbing contest and Christian Benteke squandered several chances, but the visitors’ defence and counter-attacking play were outstanding. It was the perfect combination for an eye-catching away win.\n\n“We made a conscious decision to take the game to Liverpool,” said Pardew, who had promised his players an extra day off this week in the event of victory. “I said to the players that the problem with this team is it doesn’t trust how good it can be. We proved that when we backed off and allowed Liverpool to dominate but once we went toe-to-toe with them we held our own. It is difficult to do that at these big arenas like Liverpool and Manchester United. In the last two games we have defended brilliantly and it has got us four massive points against two big clubs.”\n\nSteven Gerrard was in the crowd for the first time since departing for Los Angeles and must have had flashbacks to his last appearance at Anfield. Palace started in the same dominant fashion that ruined his Liverpool farewell in May, with Pardew’s deployment of Bolasie alongside Bakary Sako in attack unnerving the home defence.\n\nBolasie, outstanding in Palace’s 3-1 win last season, once again troubled Liverpool with his pace and touch. Only after the Congo international had given the visitors a deserved lead did Klopp’s team find the urgency, accuracy and energy demanded. They could not sustain it and a potentially serious knee injury to Mamadou Sakho compounded the new manager’s misery. “I would rather lose 4-1 and keep him in the team,” said Klopp about the France defender, who will have a scan on Monday.\n\nPalace punished several defensive lapses from Liverpool in opening the scoring. Sako rode a weak challenge from Alberto Moreno to release Wilfried Zaha down the right. Emre Can made a hash of clearing Zaha’s low cross, Bolasie reacted quicker to the loose ball than Lucas Leiva, captain for the day in the absence of the injured Jordan Henderson and James Milner, and beat Simon Mignolet with an unstoppable finish from 10 yards.\n\nLiverpool looked like a team that had made a 5,000-mile round trip to Kazan in midweek but the breakthrough woke them from their lethargy. Jordon Ibe and Nathaniel Clyne began to dominate the right wing, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana found space behind Palace’s midfield shield and the visitors struggled to break in numbers.\n\nBenteke forced Wayne Hennessey into his first save of the game with a textbook header from Ibe’s corner and wasted a good chance from Lallana’s inviting pass. The equaliser arrived from an excellent team move that sent Klopp high-fiving into the supporters behind his dugout. Ibe released Clyne on the right of the penalty area, Lallana flicked the full-back’s cross towards the far post and, just as he did at Stamford Bridge last weekend, Coutinho brought Liverpool level with an emphatic shot beyond Hennessey.\n\nAn open game continued to flow and both sides had cause to regret their finishing in the second half. Benteke, who struggled throughout, shot over from Coutinho’s through ball, headed over from Moreno’s cross and over-elaborated inside the area when put clear by the Brazilian. Sako wasted a better opening for Palace, hitting the side netting from six yards after Bolasie’s break and cross from the right had left the striker with only Mignolet to beat.\n\nKlopp replaced the poor Can with Roberto Firmino and switched to a 4-1-4-1 formation but the changes prompted an improvement only from Palace, who retook the lead with eight minutes remaining. Liverpool fan Dann towered over Firmino to head Yohan Cabaye’s corner goalwards, Mignolet parried the effort but straight back to the defender who steered his second header into the top corner. “Scott had about 15 family members here today,” said Pardew. “I think he has been really underestimated throughout his career but now I manage him I realise how good he is.

Bournemouth bombarded Elliot’s goal but it was Steve McClaren’s side who smuggled the three points away from the south coast, recording their first away win since they beat Hull City 3-1 in January.\n\nManchester United far from pretty but Jesse Lingard sinks West Brom Read more\n\nThe Republic of Ireland international again deputised for the injured number one, Tim Krul, having been nursed through training during the week after limping off at Stoke City last Saturday. Elliot stood firm when the defence in front of him capsized, as they struggled to contain Bournemouth’s attacking trio of Matt Ritchie, Junior Stanislas and Joshua King, amid the swirling wind and relentless rain.\n\nNewcastle’s only meaningful attack of the entire 90 minutes handed them a priceless away victory, when Ayoze Pérez fired his third goal of the season past the Bournemouth goalkeeper, Adam Federici, who should have done better.\n\n“It just shows, football sometimes can be unexplainable and sometimes during a season you get that,” said the Newcastle manager, McClaren, after watching his side cling on for the victory. “We got the result through character, through endeavour, through organisation and perseverance. We defended for our lives and, when we did that, we got through it.\n\n“I think people talk about goalkeepers getting you points and, if you are a top keeper, you get 15 or 20 points because of performances like that. Last week, he made a great save and got us a point, and today he got us three points, without a shadow of a doubt.”\n\n“You will see him walk out with cotton wool wrapped around him for the next two weeks, so that’s what we will have to do. Karl Darlow is not far from it, but Rob has been heroic the last two games to get us through what was a big crisis, and we need more of that.”\n\nNewcastle will have to rely on character a lot more this season if they do not improve the quality of their football. McClaren’s side were second best throughout and failed to conjure up anything more than the one, decisive shot on target. Chancel Mbemba and Fabricio Coloccini struggled to contain King, while the gritty Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter ensured his side won the midfield battle on only his third appearance of the season.\n\nMcClaren, surprisingly, did not change tactics or personnel at half-time, despite a lethargic first 45 minutes. Immediately after the break, his men were vulnerable once more. The Bournemouth defender Adam Smith rampaged down the right flank, crossing for the on-running Ritchie, who sent a flying header towards goal, only for his effort to be tipped over by Elliot.\n\n“I was disappointed with our game with the ball, it was like a hot potato – we could not keep the ball,” said McClaren of his side’s display. “We will take the three points and quickly go back home.”\n\nLeicester City’s Jamie Vardy eyes scoring record after helping defeat Watford Read more\n\nIn the 27th minute, the Newcastle defender Paul Dummett had found Aleksandar Mitrovic, who superbly back-heeled for Georginio Wijnaldum. He drove forward before feeding Pérez, who rounded off the visitors’ only quality move of the game. The striker was left unchallenged, shrugging off the attentions of Dan Gosling and Simon Francis to slot home.\n\nThe preceding minutes were dominated by Bournemouth. King, playing the lone-striker role, forced Elliot into smart saves four times in the first half alone. Earlier, King had got the better of the Newcastle captain, Coloccini, but any claims of a penalty were dismissed by the referee, Lee Mason. Bournemouth had 20 shots at the Newcastle goal, 16 corners and six minutes of added time to find a way through, but they could not beat Elliot.\n\nEddie Howe could not, however, call upon the qualities of his striker Glenn Murray, who was left out of the match-day squad. “I have not fallen out with anybody and, unfortunately for me, I have to pick players to play,” said Howe, of his decision to omit the former Crystal Palace striker from his squad. “The keeper has had a very good day and made some good saves.\n\n“The pleasing thing is that we did create chances and, if we create those again, you would bank on us to score three or four goals.”"}, {"date": "07/11/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 32029, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup":

Jamie Vardy was on a personal mission to extend the remarkable goalscoring form that has propelled him into the England squad, and he had just won a penalty for Leicester City with one of those bustling runs away from his markers in the Watford defence. Any debate about who was going to take it was surely going to be a short one.\n\nManchester United far from pretty but Jesse Lingard sinks West Brom Read more\n\nYet Riyad Mahrez was apparently unaware of the moment’s significance, snatching the ball and heading towards the spot, an unwelcome gatecrasher at Vardy’s party. Vardy shouted at Mahrez. He looked furious, the crowd was agitated and, eventually, Mahrez decided that taking a goal off Vardy was not one of his better ideas.\n\nCrisis averted, the striker hoisted Leicester level with Arsenal and Manchester City at the top of the table – and moved within touching distance of Ruud van Nistelrooy’s record of scoring in 10 consecutive Premier League matches – by blasting the penalty into the roof of the net.\n\nVardy’s 12th goal of the season meant that Leicester edged a slow-burner of a game and their 2-1 victory hinged on a farcical mistake by Watford’s goalkeeper, Heurelho Gomes, who gifted the hosts the opening goal when he let N’Golo Kanté’s tame effort squirm past him in the 52nd minute.\n\n“We support the goalkeeper,” Watford’s manager, Quique Sánchez Flores, said. “He is part of this team. He is a leader in the dressing room.”\n\nYet Watford shot themselves in the foot. They were confident after consecutive 2-0 victories over Stoke City and West Ham United, but Flores was disappointed with his side’s lack of incisiveness, lamenting their inability to capitalise on their dominance of the ball. Troy Deeney’s late penalty was a mere consolation for the visitors.\n\nThe early signs were positive for Watford; their shape was good and their hunger out of possession impressive, and they were desperately unfortunate not to take the lead after 20 minutes, Deeney lobbing a pass through to Odion Ighalo, who confused Wes Morgan with a clever piece of control with his knee. Ighalo, so prolific this season, saw his looping shot hit the inside of the left post, possibly via the faintest of touches by Kasper Schmeichel, and he would not threaten the Leicester goal again. Schmeichel saved the rebound from Almen Abdi.\n\nLeicester encountered difficulties in their attempts to penetrate Watford and this was actually one of Vardy’s quieter games. Flores was pleased with the way that Miguel Britos and Craig Cathcart kept him on a tight leash during the first half, restricting Vardy to a solitary effort from 20 yards out, while Mahrez had no influence on the game in his free role.\n\nEtienne Capoue and Ben Watson had been effective shields at the base of Watford’s midfield and Claudio Ranieri reacted by switching Leicester’s formation to 4-4-2 at half-time. Shinji Okazaki came on for Jeffrey Schlupp and joined the hitherto isolated Vardy up front, allowing Mahrez to drift to the right and run at Nathan Aké.\n\nThe Tinkerman’s alterations sparked an instant improvement and soon Mahrez was rolling a pass through to Marc Albrighton, who shot weakly at Gomes. Yet having coped so well with everything that Leicester had thrown at them before the interval, the game ran away from Watford in the space of 13 chaotic minutes – and Gomes was at the heart of their implosion.\n\nWatford’s goalkeeper has been a solid performer this season, but the back catalogue of calamitous moments from his Tottenham Hotspur days still linger in the memory. He could almost have saved Kanté’s shot in his sleep but instead his dozy goalkeeping allowed the ball to slip through his fingers, almost in slow motion.\n\nYou are the Ref No347: Jamie Vardy Read more\n\nGomes was a mess from that moment onwards and his next contribution was to send Vardy flying with a crude attempt to win the ball just inside Watford’s penalty area. The Brazilian was booked and, once Mahrez had seen sense, Vardy made it 2-0.\n\nWatford grabbed a lifeline when Kanté fouled the substitute Juan Carlos Paredes with 15 minutes remaining and Deeney rolled in the penalty, but Leicester held on, allowing Vardy to switch his focus to England’s friendlies against Spain on Friday and France next week.\n\nYet he may have one eye on Leicester’s trip to Newcastle United on 21 November, when he will have Van Nistelrooy’s record in his sights."}, {"date": "07/11/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75410, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester

it was won the Louis van Gaal way? Most would surely accept it, so perhaps the degree of criticism aimed at the manager is unfair.\n\nEspecially as he is currently achieving the right results. Tuesday evening’s victory over CSKA Moscow carried United top of their Champions League group, and this win brought them to within one point of Manchester City and Arsenal, who have played a game fewer, and Leicester, who have played the same number of games as United.\n\nThere can be no disguising, though, that this was hardly a display of liquid football. It required a sweet Jesse Lingard goal – his first for the club – and a late Juan Mata penalty to confirm the points, after Gareth McAuley was sent off for tripping Anthony Martial. But the bottom line is Van Gaal’s men won, and this is the name of the managerial game.\n\nUnited came into the contest having not scored a Premier League goal for 208 minutes, since Wayne Rooney’s 62nd-minute strike at Everton on 17 October. On Tuesday there had been chants of “Attack, attack, attack!” before and during the 1-0 win over CSKA, and boos when Martial was replaced by Marouane Fellaini, viewed as another negative move from the 64-year-old.\n\nBoosted by the result, Van Gaal poked fun at the fans for this. “Against CSKA when you are yelling: ‘Attack, attack, attack!’ and when you are 85 minutes on the attack, then you have to think by yourself, as a fan: ‘Hey, hey, is that all right to yell?’ They want to let them [the players] know that we have to score. Of course, my mother also knows that and my grandmother knows that.”\n\nOn Saturday there was applause and oohs and aahs, and no mutinous noises. United dominated from the start and offered enough potency to suggest they would score first.\n\nMartial was again the No9 and Rooney the second forward, as Van Gaal likes to describe the captain when he operates in a slightly withdrawn role. Rooney had one volley blocked, then created an opening for Mata. The Spaniard attempted a curler beyond Boaz Myhill, aimed to go inside the goalkeeper’s right post, but it went wide.\n\nMartial is on a run of form where just about every time he pulls on the United shirt he impresses. Jonny Evans was the latest defender to be burned by the Frenchman, when being barged aside, before Martial turned, moved effortlessly into space and crossed.\n\nThe half’s outstanding moment was also his. From a duff Rooney free-kick that hit the first man, the ball was eventually headed by Chris Smalling to Martial in a crowded area. One shimmering shoulder drop later the 19-year-old was in a yard of space and Myhill did well to repel the rocket that was propelled at his goal.\n\nVan Gaal again started Michael Carrick and Bastian Schweinsteiger in central midfield, as he had against CSKA. Their contribution was hardly eye-catching and the German, especially, lacked sharpness, ballooning one shot into the crowd. Morgan Schneiderlin was said by Van Gaal to be ill, though the former Southampton midfielder was well enough to be named on the bench.\n\nTony Pulis’s side had come to defend so they would have been content as the second half began. This was about to change. Martial, again, was the spark. The striker wandered along the left and floated in a cross, which Chris Brunt headed straight into the path of Lingard. From outside the area and to the left of centre the forward steered a composed finish inside Myhill’s left post.\n\nRomelu Lukaku’s cool finish earns Everton a point at West Ham United Read more\n\nThis stopped the clock on United’s league goal drought after four hours and 20 minutes and when the camera cut to Van Gaal he was chuckling as a melee of United players mobbed Lingard.\n\nWest Brom now enjoyed their brightest passage – this is a relative judgment – and should have had an equaliser after 74 minutes. Craig Dawson swung in a ball from the right that landed plumb on Saido Berahino’s head, yet from right in front of David de Gea the striker sent the ball over the bar. An infuriated Pulis hopped around on the sideline in incandescent fashion.\n\nAfterwards the West Bromwich Albion manager said: “If you need a gilt-edged chance to drop to anyone, you hope it will be Saido.”\n\nWith 14 minutes left the Manchester-born Cameron Borthwick-Jackson, an 18-year-old left-back, replaced Marcos Rojo to make his debut for United. Later, Rooney was replaced by Ander Herrera to a soundtrack of cheers. These seemed to be in appreciation of the captain rather than his removal, though there was a moment when it was difficult to tell.\n\nThere was, though, no confusion regarding the home supporters’ jubilant reaction to the final whistle.

Repeatedly. It is safe to assume this had nothing to do with the Sunderland manager’s choice of shampoo and was all about the dawning realisation that heis facing possibly his biggest managerial challenge.\n\nNorwich City’s heads lifted by Jonny Howson against Swansea City Read more\n\nIn some ways, and particularly in defence, the Wearsiders have clearly improved since he replaced Dick Advocaat. But all things are relative; Allardyce has now lost three of his first four games in charge and, seemingly super-glued into the relegation zone, Sunderland have won one Premier League game all season.\n\nDespite the slender scoreline, Southampton merited victory on a day when Maarten Stekelenburg had only one serious save to make and Yann M’Vila’s lapse of judgment in needlessly felling Ryan Bertrand prompted a penalty impeccably converted by Dusan Tadic’s left foot.\n\nRonald Koeman is limping slightly after surgery to repair a ruptured achilles tendon but his side moved with a freedom and fluency Sunderland struggled to contain. “We had a lot of possession and if we have the ball they can’t score,” said Southampton’s manager. “We like to enjoy ourselves, if you enjoy the way you play you’ll win a lot of games.”\n\nIt is a long time, and several managers, since Sunderland fans have derived any sustained pleasure from observing their team in action and sure enough, watching Allardyce’s charges was once again, a somewhat gruelling experience.\n\n“A frustrating afternoon,” he said, well aware his defensive tightening would quite possibly have earned a point had M’Vila – otherwise by far the home team’s best player – not erred.\n\n“We were playing against a very good team but we gave a soft penalty away. I’m disappointed. Yann M’Vila didn’t need to bring Ryan Betrand down but that sort of thing seems to be part of our makeup. In training I see a lot of good things but I ain’t seeing it when we get on the pitch. Certainly the players have to produce more.”\n\nAllardyce thought his side might have had a penalty of their own for an arguable handball against Maya Yoshida but he was the first to agree Sunderland were outmanoeuvred as the aptly named Jordy Clasie controlled the pace and tempo from midfield. Some of Clasie’s interchanges with Tadic doubled as mini masterclasses in ball manipulation.\n\nYet much as Koeman’s charges dominated possession, they were persistently thwarted by much improved central defensive positioning on the part of the previously suspect Sebastián Coates and Younès Kaboul, with that pair ably protected by M’Vila’s defensive midfield intelligence.\n\nNewcastle United leapfrog Bournemouth thanks to Ayoze Pérez Read more\n\nIn the wake of last Sunday’s 6-2 reverse at Everton Allardyce had sensibly scrapped his experiment with three at the back and Costel Pantilimon appeared a key beneficiary. Admittedly he made a handful of important saves, most notably from Tadic and Mane, but he must have been pleasantly surprised at how many of Southampton’s final balls were being cut out.\n\nThen came one those moments of self destruction so wearingly familiar to Sunderland fans. His generally sure judgment momentarily deserting him, M’Vila lunged in on Bertrand - (who awkwardly positioned, posed no immediate danger) - in the penalty area and Tadic’s confident penalty killed the contest.\n\nSunderland’s problem was that, having fallen behind, they presented minimal attacking threat, with the highly promising young winger, Duncan Watmore offering their sole genuine outlet.\n\nUnfortunately the concentration on defence left Watmore lacking support and the lone striker, Steven Fletcher, isolated. Tellingly Stekelenburg’s sole proper save featured the diversion of an Adam Johnson volley. Despite Jermain Defoe finally stepping off the bench, it seemed almost an unnecessary precaution when Koeman protected his lead by switching to a back five.\n\n“An outstanding performance,” enthused Southampton’s manager. “Maybe that was the best we’ve pressed when we lost the ball. We want European football next season – for us, that would be liking winning the title.”\n\nOn planet Sunderland finishing 17th would represent an equivalent achievement."}, {"date": "07/11/2015",

successive appearance against the Hammers on a muggy, wet afternoon at a subdued Upton Park. Otherwise this was a low-pressure meeting of two neat, quick-passing teams, illuminated by some nice touches but little in the way of unbound attacking play.\n\nWhen counterattack meets counterattack the result can often be a little lukewarm. By the end a 1-1 draw was fair enough in a game marked out by two delightful first-half goals, the first a dreamy finish by Manuel Lanzini, the second from Lukaku made by an outstanding through pass by Gerard Deulofeu.\n\nNewcastle United leapfrog Bournemouth thanks to Ayoze Pérez Read more\n\nIf there was little in the way of sustained pressure from the home team, Slaven Bilic was happy enough afterwards with a point before the international break, less happy with the injuries suffered by Dimitri Payet and Enner Valencia.\n\nBoth teams had lined up in a sprightly looking 4-2-3-1, with Andy Carroll starting his second Premier League game in a row for the first time since January and Payet and Deulofeu both in fine form of late. In the event Carroll was applauded off the pitch having spent much of the previous 86 minutes chasing John Stones, who was excellent throughout. “John was immense,” Roberto Martínez said. “It was a magnificent performance.”\n\nPayet never recovered from a heavy scissors tackle in the first half from James McCarthy, a shame as the Frenchman had started brightly, one early thrust down the right teeing up Victor Moses for a shot that crept wide. Payet also provided the moment of a cagey first quarter with a slick drag-back nutmeg on Ross Barkley in the centre circle that had half the stadium breaking out in a kind of delighted giggle.\n\nEverton had come here slightly unnerved by the openness of their 6-2 victory against Sunderland – “We put a lot of emphasis on wanting to be solid after our performance last week,” Martínez admitted – and it showed as both teams settled into a pattern of cautious thrust and counter-thrust.\n\nIt took a moment of off-the-cuff brilliance from Lanzini on the half-hour to open the scoring. Moses drove into the box and shot hard and low. The ball was blocked and finally cleared by Stones to Lanzini 30 yards out. The Argentinian tiptoed forward, shifted the ball between his feet and curled a sensational finish up and over Tim Howard into the top corner.\n\nA 1-0 lead rarely brings the kind of full team bundle West Ham’s players staged near the corner flag in celebration. But this was a genuinely outstanding piece of skill, imaginatively conceived and brilliantly executed, the ball seeming to hang, then dip, before finding a spot Howard just couldn’t reach.\n\nDusan Tadic penalty seals win for Southampton at Sunderland Read more\n\nThe goal did little to change the cagey pattern of the game. Like West Ham’s goal, Everton’s equaliser two minutes before half-time came from nowhere, the product of a moment of off-the-cuff brilliance from Deulofeu. Payet lost the ball trying to slalom past McCarthy. Deulofeu picked it up and slid a gorgeous pass through the tiniest channel, perfectly weighted for Lukaku to take the ball around Adrián and finish. It would be hard to blame Payet. The pass to make the goal was instant perfection, the West Ham defence filleted a little too easily. Plus, of course, Lukaku is the hammer of the Hammers, and scorer now of five goals in his last six Premier League games.\n\nThe Belgian has again been linked with a move away from Everton this week, with Juventus the latest reported suitors, something Martínez spun impressively afterwards, saying: “What I don’t like is when teams are looking at our squad and nobody’s interested, nobody thinks we’ve got good players.”\n\nFour minutes into the second half Payet went off, Valencia taking his place and then leaving on a stretcher 20 minutes later having injured both ankles in quick succession. “The first was a bad challenge,” Bilic mused.\n\n“The second was … English”.

It was their third successive league defeat, for the first time in the Roman Abramovich era, and though the owner will never divulge his thoughts publicly it must be startling for everyone connected with the club that we are only in Bonfire Night week and Mourinho has already forsaken his record of having never lost seven times in a single season.\n\nChelsea dismiss Stoke steward’s claims of clash with Diego Costa Read more\n\nTo trace the last time Chelsea lost three in a row would mean going back to Gianluca Vialli’s tenure in October 1999 and if Abramovich is looking for signs that his manager has it under control it cannot help that Mourinho was prohibited from entering the stadium. In total, they have lost 10 times in all competitions. It was not the worst performance of Chelsea’s season by any measure and they gave everything during their late search for an equaliser, but they have lost their knack of recovering from going behind and Marko Arnautovic’s goal, eight minutes into the second half, was decisive. Something has changed and it leaves Chelsea two places above the relegation zone, with problems all over the pitch and a genuine crisis enveloping the club. “That’s why you’re going down,” the Stoke fans sang, and the indignities continue to stack up for the team who were parading the championship trophy six months ago.\n\nThis defeat ended with a steward making a complaint of assault against Diego Costa for allegedly treading on his toe when he went to collect the ball. The television pictures looked innocuous and on this occasion Costa probably deserves the benefit of the doubt. Chelsea have much bigger concerns and, wherever he was watching it, Mourinho must have found it a chastening experience.\n\nIt wasn’t easy to keep count of the number of times the television cameras flashed to the leather padded seat he should have been occupying. There was a cardboard cutout in the away end and various Mourinho masks in other parts of the ground. Outside a chair had been placed on the grassy bank, with a note: “Reserved, Jose Mourinho.” As for the man himself, he was in a hotel somewhere, trying to avoid the photographers who had tailed the team bus on the way to the ground. Perhaps Mourinho should have sat in the stand wearing a Mourinho mask and hoped nobody noticed. Either way, it was unsatisfactory in all sorts of ways and not something Chelsea will want to repeat any time soon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chelsea fans wore José Mourinho masks in the stands but their manager was absent. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nThey were also facing a Stoke side that might pass the ball better than the old model but still have a strong competitive edge. Ryan Shawcross did not give an inch in his mano-a-mano with Costa and Erik Pieters played most of the match with a broken nose, requiring a change of blood-stained shirt, after taking an accidental kick from Pedro. Bojan Krkic took a bang in the first half which seemed to reduce his output and it was Xherdan Shaqiri who caught the eye. Shaqiri’s diminutive stature, low centre of gravity, improvisational dribbling skills and clipped left-footed passes are reminiscent of Georgi Kinkladze. He just works an awful lot harder and that made him a dangerous opponent.\n\nMark Hughes’s team were pinned back in the last quarter of an hour when, if nothing else, Chelsea did show some of the old fight. The home side rode their luck during that onslaught and no doubt Mourinho’s impression of Premier League referees was not enhanced by the moment late on when the substitute Loïc Rémy ran through on goal only to lose his balance as he tried to evade the oncoming Jack Butland. A cynical view would be that Rémy ought to have gone to ground to win a penalty. The striker preferred the more honest approach but an argument could still be made – and almost certainly would have been if Mourinho was present – that the goalkeeper caused the fall without getting to the ball.\n\nDiego Costa’s goalless performance not what José Mourinho needed Read more\n\nStoke attacked at times in a way that made it feel strange they had begun the day with only nine goals from their previous 11 league matches, the least impressive figures in the top division. Equally, Chelsea did have spells of the game when they looked a little more like the team that turned last season’s league into a procession.\n\nCesc Fàbregas is having a spell out of the league side and, though Chelsea could desperately do with him regaining his form, there was a reasonable look to the team’s midfield. Willian’s energy and directness created space for Eden Hazard and Pedro in the wide positions and the two sides matched other in a first half featuring some fine goalkeeping. Butland tipped a dripping volley from Ramires over the crossbar as well as keeping out Costa’s low drive and at the other end Asmir Begovic, facing his old club, saved well from Glen Johnson after an early foray from the right-back.\n\nJohnson’s ability to drive forward was also a prominent feature in Arnautovic’s goal. Shaqiri’s pass was beautifully weighted for the former Chelsea player to surge beyond Baba Rahman and turn the ball into the penalty area. Jonathan Walters, whose new two-and-a-half-year contract was confirmed before the match, had his back to goal but as he tussled with Kurt Zouma the ball popped out to Arnautovic. Leaning back, the Austrian adjusted his body shape and, six yards out, scored with a swinging volley.

Mauricio Pochettino pounded around his technical area barking instruction to players suddenly unnerved, a comfortable evening’s work apparently squirming away. Then Érik Lamela, calm amid the jitters, threaded a pass into the penalty area around which Harry Kane wrapped his right foot. The shot was whipped into the top corner and, with that flash of quality, Tottenham Hotspur had their reassurance.\n\nAston Villa appoint Rémi Garde as new manager Read more\n\nThe Premier League’s longest current unbeaten run was extended to 10 games at the expense of Aston Villa whose new manager, Rémi Garde, freshly arrived by private jet from Lyon via Luton, watched on from the upper tier of the west stand. Spurs will go into Sunday’s north London derby in rude health. Kane’s finish, yielding a fourth goal in two games, was confirmation the England striker is rediscovering his bite. Lamela had his moments and, in Dele Alli, Spurs boasted energy and class in central midfield to leave Roy Hodgson drooling a few seats along from Garde on high.\n\nPochettino’s team are fifth and climbing, their collective qualities very evident in a side not over-reliant on one world-class talent these days. “I love the way that, in the rugby World Cup, they play like a team,” said the Argentinian after thematch. “I watched a lot of games live and the mentality, the philosophy and spirit… When you watch the effort, the fantastic spirit, that’s what we need to translate into our football.” Garde will presumably have similar objectives at Villa as he sets about instigating a more prolonged revival than the 11 minutes of frantic late pressure offered up by his new team here.\n\nThat passage of play was not reflective of the match but still shaped the lasting impression it left. Spurs were almost sleepwalking to a comfortable win, with even the crowd lulled into the inevitability of it all, when sloppiness flared. Leandro Bacuna shrugged Villa awake by curling a shot against Hugo Lloris’s post from distance. Spurs were still digesting that let-off when the substitute Ryan Mason gave up possession carelessly and Jordan Ayew fizzed in another attempt which deflected off Jan Vertonghen to scuttle beyond the French goalkeeper.\n\nRudy Gestede might have nodded in an unlikely equaliser having outjumped Lloris but his attempt dribbled wide. Quite how it had come to this was something of a mystery but those were the flashpoints which will sustain Garde as he prepares for the visit of Manchester City to Villa Park on Sunday and will ensure Pochettino remains wary before his own team’s trip to Arsenal. “Maybe it’s because we are young,” conceded the Tottenham manager. “Our mentality is to go forward all the time, when sometimes it’s better to be safe when the game is under control.” Yet they still merited the success and, sometimes, the odd awkward passage is useful to ensure expectations do not become too inflated.\n\nEveryone at Spurs recognises the opportunity this campaign is offering them. A place in the top four, now just a point away, is there for the taking given Chelsea’s toils across town and there is enough quality and momentum behind this team to take advantage. Tottenham did not actually have to play particularly well to prise Villa part. This was far from the vibrant, fluent attacking display permitted them by Bournemouth in their previous game but they scored early and late in the first half and, it seemed, had the contest secured by half-time.\n\nAston Villa’s Micah Richards suspended for one game after Swansea fracas Read more\n\nGarde had barely taken his seat when Danny Rose’s pass – hardly defence-splitting – down the left found Mousa Dembélé. The Belgian held off Ciaran Clark to wriggle infield and spit a shot which flew through Brad Guzan’s legs at the near post. The efforts of both centre-half and goalkeeper were feeble, the absence of Micah Richards – fined £10,000 and banned for this game by the Football Association following a clash in the tunnel after the defeat by Swansea last month – keenly felt.\n\nRichards’ team-mates were industrious in the period which followed, the play disrupted by petty fouls and a concussion to Ashley Westwood from Dembélé’s flailing arm, but Spurs prospered again before the interval. Christian Eriksen wriggled free and liberated Rose down the left, the full-back’s cross nodded up by Joleon Lescott with the ball looping invitingly to Alli just inside the penalty area. The 19-year-old was permitted time to collect on his thigh and dispatch a volley which flew through the bodies and into the net. “We saw big potential in Alli from the first day of pre-season,” added Pochettino.\n\nVilla will hope Garde, similarly, spied enough in his new team’s ranks to instigate a revival.

They rejoiced loudly at Goodison Park in the “six in a row” of Tyne-Wear derby victories but recoiled at a six-goal performance from Everton that exposed the cause of their team’s latest fight for survival. Constructing a recognisable defence remains an urgent priority for Sam Allardyce.\n\nArouna Koné scored his first hat-trick in English football, Romelu Lukaku led the Everton attack superbly and Gerard Deulofeu was a constant creative menace as Roberto Martínez’s team recorded the club’s highest goal tally in a Premier League fixture since a 7-1 win over Roy Keane’s Sunderland in 2007. Everton’s balanced, clinical attack pulverised the visitors with three goals in a seven-minute spell at the heart of the rout.\n\nYet that does not explain the nature of Sunderland’s defeat. Allardyce’s side had 17 shots on goal, 12 on target in Tim Howard’s 400th appearance for Everton, and recovered from two goals down to equalise early in the second half. But Sunderland’s defensive unit was appalling, their game intelligence non-existent when they had the chance to capitalise on Goodison’s frustration. The hosts appeared to be scoring at will midway through the second half as the visitors stood back and admired devastating counterattack after counterattack.\n\n“I am concerned about the lack of understanding in certain periods of the game, particularly when we got back to 2-2,” the Sunderland manager said. “We decided to go and attack for the third and within seven minutes we tossed the game away and allowed Everton to score three silly, sloppy goals. That lack of discipline, understanding has really frustrated me. We should have been satisfied with the 2-2 and we might have got on the end of a counterattack and made it 3-2. That sums it up for me, lack of understanding. We made the wrong decisions.\n\nEverton’s Ramiro Funes Mori happy at deep end after River Plate education Read more\n\n“A 2-2 is like a win in the position we are in. We can score a goal and create chances but until we get into the habit of defending better out of possession, it is worthless how many goals we score. The lack of discipline and understanding is the biggest concern for me.”\n\nIt added to Allardyce’s frustration that Sunderland made the better start. The plan to stifle Everton’s creativity by employing wing-backs, nullify the threat of Lukaku with three central defenders and hit Steven Fletcher early initially succeeded. Sunderland were unfortunate not to be two goals ahead as Patrick van Aanholt and Adam Johnson hit the post before Everton created a meaningful attack.\n\nFletcher was dominant in the air against John Stones and Ramiro Funes Mori with Jermain Defoe alert to the flick-on but Sunderland’s defence disintegrated at the first sign of Everton ingenuity. The outstanding Koné exploited the space between Billy Jones and the left wing-back Van Aanholt with a delightful pass through to Deulofeu. The young Spaniard scored his first league goal of the season confidently, cutting inside Jones before converting through the legs of Costel Pantilimon. Everton seized control and Koné doubled the advantage with a fine finish after a slick one-two with Lukaku. Pantilimon was easily beaten despite being close to the shot but could also ask why six outfield players allowed the Everton forwards to pass at will on the edge of their area.\n\nThe game appeared over as a contest and Everton believed so too. Their play became increasingly sloppy and Defoe gave Sunderland a superb lifeline with the final kick of the first half. Stones was guilty of ball-watching as Sebastián Coates drilled a long ball forward. Defoe nipped in as the defender backed off, lifted the ball over the covering Funes Mori and beat Howard with the aid of a slight deflection off the England defender.\n\nEverton v Sunderland: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nSunderland levelled when Fletcher beat Funes Mori to Van Aanholt’s left- wing cross and headed inside Howard’s right-hand post. Everton’s response to throwing away a comfortable margin was emphatic. By the hour the visitors had been destroyed. Goodison thought Lukaku had restored Everton’s lead with a diving header from a Deulofeu cross but it was Coates who got the final touch. The Belgium international did score when Deulofeu delivered another touch of creative class, dissecting the Sunderland defence with a superb pass that allowed Lukaku to round Pantilimon and convert.\n\nKoné claimed his second with a composed left-foot finish after Ross Barkley and James McCarthy had led another incisive break and his hat-trick arrived with a header at the near post from a Lukaku cross. Again, no Sunderland defender was alert or close enough as Koné headed beyond Pantilimon at close range. Howard saved well from the substitute Duncan Watmore, Van Aanholt and Defoe late on. But there was no consolation for Allardyce, only a reminder of the task ahead on the day Goodison delivered a tumultuous ovation to the late Howard Kendall and a display the club’s most successful manager would no doubt have approved of."}, {"date": "01/11/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31229, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg",

really is to provide the Premier League with a vibrant, updated regional rivalry then it will need to serve up more balanced contests than this. Perhaps it will require another triumph against the odds from Bournemouth and Eddie Howe, too. Southampton did the hard work in the first half of this rarely-contested derby, superbly-crafted goals from Steven Davis and Graziano Pellè just reward for their complete dominance, and saw out a victory in which the away side were treated as arrivistes who needed an exacting lesson or two.\n\n“I think it was maybe our best 45 minutes in more than a year,” said Ronald Koeman of an opening period in which Bournemouth, feted for their elegance on the ball and diligence off it, made no impression whatsoever. “We had a high tempo and good ball possession. If you watch the two goals it’s all about a high quality of football, and I’m very pleased about that.”\n\nHe had every right to be. Davis’s goal was the finishing touch to a rat-a-tat of a move that saw Pellè backheel a pass from the impressive Jordy Clasie into the path of Ryan Bertrand, whose first-time centre was impossible to pass up on. Pellè’s goal, a powered header from a player who makes hanging in the air an art form, came after a sublime ball from Sadio Mané to Dusan Tadic, whose stood-up cross from the left bore a certain expectation of what would happen next.\n\n“We know Graziano is a very good striker – scoring goals, strong, one of the best in the Premier League,” said Koeman of his nine-goal striker. Pellè just gets better and his first-half performance here, in which he bullied centre-backs Simon Francis and Sylvain Distin into meek submission, was a precis of his team’s overall display.\n\nThe concerns for Bournemouth, who have just one point from their past five games, amplify by the week. Their injury list is well-documented but it was clear to see what players with the power and pace of Callum Wilson and Max Gradel would have added in a game like this. Although the return of the midfielder Harry Arter, who started his first Premier League match after three months out with a hip injury, bodes well there was little going on ahead of him, lone striker Glenn Murray nowhere near the kind of outlet needed for a side that was put on the back foot from the off.\n\n“In the first half we weren’t ourselves, in or out of possession,” said Howe, who had hoped Arter’s presence would bolster a side that had lost its previous two league games 5-1 to Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. “I thought Southampton were very good and am not taking anything away from their performance but physically we weren’t where we needed to be and it looked like the game on Wednesday [in the Capital One Cup at Liverpool] had an effect on some of our players. It took us until half-time to rejig things and get a response.”\n\nBy then it was too late. Southampton could have been a couple of goals ahead early on, Pellè and Mané seeing shots deflected just off target before they combined for a chance that the Senegal forward, volleying into the ground and over from 12 yards, should have put away.\n\nDavis’s goal came as no surprise, with the provider Bertrand operating almost as a winger, and nor did that of Pellè, who bested Distin’s aerial challenge in a manner that starkly illustrated the 37-year-old’s declining powers. Pellè celebrated his goal by dancing a ‘haka’ with the Saints’ New Zealand-born sports therapist, Graham Staddon, whose sporting weekend could hardly have been better.\n\nHowe introduced the pace of Junior Stanislas and Josh King at the interval, correcting his team’s speed deficiency but simply saw Southampton drop back a yard in reply. They dominated a half in which barely a single clear chance was created, Maarten Stekelenburg’s late save from Lee Tomlin and a needless second yellow card for Victor Wanyama the only items of note.\n\n“I think it’s impossible to play 95 minutes the way we played in the first 45,” Koeman said. “We lost more battles and more passes, and it was not the same, but it also depended on an opponent who put everything into the second half.”\n\nBournemouth will need to step up rather more quickly in future if Koeman’s wish for a continuation of hostilities – “the atmosphere in the stadium was fantastic, it’s a local derby and I hope it will also be next season” – is to be granted.\n\nMan of the match Graziano Pellè (Southampton)"}, {"date": "31/10/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge",

It was not that Chelsea succumbed to a sixth league loss of a hapless Premier League title defence. Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool were excellent and would have tested teams far more confident than the ailing champions. Rather, it was the manner of the surrender. To have led and then disintegrated, just as they had to Southampton earlier in the month, felt damning and, in truth, far too much of this was humiliating.\n\nJosé Mourinho defiant and says he expects to stay as Chelsea manager Read more\n\nThe manager, initially reluctant to offer any assessment at all of a dispiriting afternoon, ended up treading a familiar path. He would not say it himself, what with two sanctions already hanging over him from the Football Association, but his post-match referrals to a “lack of respect for his players” centred upon the referee, Mark Clattenburg, and his fourth official, Lee Mason. There was exasperation at the excessive stoppage time played at the end of the first half, in which Philippe Coutinho drew the visitors level, and vehement complaints that Lucas Leiva’s brace of fouls within 10 second-half minutes, when the game was level and tension was mounting, drew only one yellow card when Mourinho and his players were baying for a red.\n\nThe Brazilian was fortunate – Crystal Palace’s Dwight Gayle, sent off by the same referee for a pair of similar fouls against West Ham two weeks ago, may echo the locals’ frustration – and even Klopp acknowledged “you need a bit of luck if you want to win at Chelsea”. Yet, as ever, the visitors could point to other inconsistencies, not least an apparent kick from Diego Costa into Martin Skrtel’s chest, as having gone similarly unpunished. That pair have history. Yet Mourinho’s complaints over the performance of the officials could not mask the deficiencies in his own players’ display. There was no lack of effort or commitment but there was a dearth of bite, cohesion and belief. Confidence is still shattered and, as yet, Mourinho has offered no indication that he can restore it.\n\nThe scenario played out here, with the Portuguese helpless and alone in his technical area, was all too familiar.\n\nIt was actually near identical to the thrashing endured against Ronald Koeman’s team on 3 October: the plundering of an early goal to suggest dominance, only for that hint of ascendancy to prove deceptive; a steady erosion of conviction thereafter; and a collapse midway through the second half. Ramires’s early header, thumped down and through Simon Mignolet as he burst beyond a dawdling Alberto Moreno, was a false dawn. Chelsea had outnumbered and outpassed James Milner and Nathaniel Clyne on the opposite flank, with Eden Hazard flicking César Azpilicueta to the byline for the Spaniard to supply the centre. But that was the Belgian’s only real eye-catching contribution. He would not see out the hour and, instead, the playmaker in the opposing ranks would hold sway.\n\nCoutinho revelled in the space afforded him by an obliging Chelsea defence. The Brazilian had Emre Can or Lucas snapping away at his back, regaining possession and closing down the hosts higher and higher up the pitch, while Milner and Clyne made amends down their flank to force the champions further into retreat. The sight of Gary Cahill and John Terry flinging themselves in the way of battered attempts drew appreciation from those in the stands but the desperation of the defending reflected a shift in momentum. Liverpool, with Klopp a frenzy of instruction in the technical area, had realised they were the more threatening side and, as the contest progressed, their stranglehold was reflected in the scoreline.\n\nJosé Mourinho’s post-match interview after Chelsea 1-3 Liverpool: full transcript Read more\n\nAsmir Begovic claimed from Adam Lallana and Lucas but Clyne and Milner, culpable at Liverpool’s concession, were making too many inroads on the wing. The hosts were praying for a half-time whistle, Mourinho waiting in the mouth of the tunnel, when Coutinho gathered on the edge of the box, cut inside Ramires’s lunge and curled a sumptuous shot inside the far post beyond Begovic’s despairing dive. Coutinho’s second, from just inside the penalty area, flicked off the advancing Terry and deflected in beyond Begovic. Christian Benteke, performing the Graziano Pellè role, calmly added a third as Chelsea failed to close down the substitute, though, by then, there was a certain inevitability to it all.\n\nKlopp will have spied plenty from his first away win, and the side’s first since the campaign’s opening weekend, to offer encouragement that Liverpool, under his guidance, will recover their own poise, even if he was comically dismissive of ambitious talk of an early title challenge. “Oh please, are you crazy?” he said with a guffaw. “I’ve been here three weeks. You think, after one win at Chelsea, we should be thinking about a title?”\n\nThere was a time, not long ago, when triumphing at Stamford Bridge would have fuelled such belief but not at present. Mourinho has never lost more than six league games in a single season, and he has suffered that many in 11 matches to date this term. He will reconvene his coaching staff back at Cobham on Sunday to begin preparations for Wednesday’s Champions League contest against Dynamo Kyiv, with another trip to Stoke City to follow on Saturday. Both might once have been considered very winnable games but there is no respite at present and no real sign of recovery.

The big one fell to Yohan Cabaye but, from an unmarked position, he hooked his volley wide of the far post.\n\nPalace felt that they were robbed in this fixture last season, when United somehow scrambled to a 2-1 win, and the club’s 24-year wait for a league victory over them goes on. “United were really fortunate,” Alan Pardew, the Palace manager, said. Nobody could disagree.\n\nVan Gaal’s team last scored, through Martial, in the 1-1 Champions League draw at CSKA Moscow and they have now been barren for 325 minutes, taking in the stalemates against Manchester City in the Premier League and Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup, a tie that they lost after extra-time and penalties. United are the lowest scorers in the top six and with Wayne Rooney continuing to look isolated and starved of service up front, it is extremely difficult to make the case for them winning the title. Compared with City and Arsenal, they do not have the firepower.\n\nNor, it seems, do they have the desire to commit men forward. The travelling supporters implored the team to attack and they made the point that they were United, so that is what they ought to do. But there was precious little to excite them, particularly in the second half.\n\n“Of course, I am concerned [about the lack of goals] but today, when you are not creating so many chances, I cannot complain,” Van Gaal said.\n\n“Against Middlesbrough, I thought we created a lot and then it is more concerning. Nevertheless, we had chances today and you have to finish. But we were not the better team, and it would have been too much for us to win. It can change in one match and let it be against CSKA on Tuesday because we need a victory.”\n\nPardew was justifiably pleased with the performance of his players. After three straight defeats in all competitions, the intensity and what he called the “freshness” was back. Palace pressed high and hard, they dominated the first 20 minutes and they went close to taking the lead.\n\nBolasie’s shot from Scott Dann’s assist reared up and David de Gea had to show his reflexes to get his fingertips to it. The ball crashed to safety off the crossbar. United’s start was sloppy with the right-back, Matteo Darmian, guilty of a couple of errors and he needed De Gea to bail him out.\n\nOn the first occasion, De Gea saved low from Dwight Gayle. Dann also extended the goalkeeper from Cabaye’s corner.\n\nUnited found a bit of rhythm, they worked their way into the first half and they had a few chances. Rooney curled a free-kick over the defensive wall that Wayne Hennessey dealt with comfortably while he narrowly failed to run on to Martial’s through-ball. Van Gaal was particularly unhappy when Ander Herrera fluffed a side-footer from Martial’s cut-back just before the interval.\n\nIt was a niggly encounter, peppered by fouls, yellow cards and arguments.\n\nPardew claimed United had targeted Cabaye, saying they fouled him repeatedly and that he was unhappy his senior players did not highlight it to the officials.\n\nThe excitement was provided by Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha, the unpredictable Palace wingers, and it was no surprise when Van Gaal withdrew Darmian, who had been booked for a block on Zaha.\n\nThe United fans continued to beg their players to attack in the second half but they laboured, their stutters summed up when Herrera got his wires crossed with Bastian Schweinsteiger on a rare break. Herrera was also guilty of going down too easily in search of a penalty.\n\nIt was Palace who should have nicked it. Cabaye sank to his knees after his 72nd-minute miss while Dann sent another header from a corner inches wide, with Delaney failing to touch home at the far post. James McArthur was denied by De Gea and Bolasie also went close at the very end."}, {"date": "31/10/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 53418, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [67], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [89], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [54]}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [54], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Roberts", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Garcia Alonso", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [], "reds": [88], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastien Bassong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexander Tettey", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Youssouf Mulumbu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [83], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}], "subs": [{"name": "Steven Whittaker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Grabban", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Hoolahan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Here was the dullest of games with the liveliest of endings, thanks to clangers from each goalkeeper in the last 10 minutes of the match. Joe Hart appeared to have presented Norwich with a share of the points seven minutes from the end when he dropped Robbie Brady’s cross to leave Cameron Jerome the simplest of tap-ins, and he must have been the most relieved man in the stadium when John Ruddy returned the favour five minutes later.\n\nThe Norwich keeper came out to claim the ball and stranded himself at the edge of his area, allowing Raheem Sterling a shot at an unguarded net that Russell Martin could only divert with his arm. The Norwich captain received a red card as a result, while Yaya Touré slotted home the penalty to keep his side at the top of the table. Even then there was still time for Hart to redeem himself with a fine save from Martin Olsson that denied a second Canaries comeback, and for Aleksandar Kolarov to miss another penalty with the last kick of the game after Brady had brought down Sterling.\n\nArsenal’s Joel Campbell nets on first league start in win over Swansea Read more\n\nThere was plenty to talk about in the end, though it was all packed into those final 10 minutes. Before that Manchester City had been making conspicuously hard work of seeing off a resolute Norwich side, conserving energy for their trip to Sevilla on Tuesday perhaps but displaying a lack of attacking ideas and invention that will encourage their Champions League opponents. Spanish scouts will also have noted below-par performances from Touré and Kevin De Bruyne, and the fact that Wilfried Bony is far from lethal in front of goal. “Norwich defended very well,” Manuel Pellegrini pleaded in mitigation. “They made it very difficult for us to find space.”\n\nNorwich boasted a flat back five and a plan to stay compact behind the ball, which worked for over an hour even if it did invite the home side to camp out on the edge of their area.\n\nBony three times had chances to open the scoring but found Ruddy equal to his first speculative effort, then he missed the target completely from a better opportunity set up by Kelechi Iheanacho. Having swooped on to the ball and past Sébastien Bassong in one imperious surge the striker seemed to have done all the hard work, only to allow Ruddy and the Norwich goal a reprieve by firing into the crowd. Bony had just put another shot wide from De Bruyne’s pass when Norwich almost scored on the counterattack, Matt Jarvis showing more accuracy than Bony from Brady’s diagonal ball forward and bringing a good save from Hart. While it would have been completely against the run of play Norwich could have put themselves in front before the interval.\n\nCity did not have a great deal to show for almost three-quarters of the first half possession. Pellegrini was boasting in the match programme about his side having scored 18 goals in the previous four home games and at half-time he must have been demanding to know where the attacking desire had gone. Early in the second half he made the obvious change, sending on Sterling in place of Iheanacho. The 19-year-old had not looked out of place on his first Premier League start – just prior to his withdrawal he had created an opening for Bony that Bassong had to be alert to snuff out – though between them the front pair were not really giving Norwich too much to think about.\n\nThese are the sort of games in which Touré can usually step up to make a difference, though the Ivorian was quiet and when the breakthrough came it was a defender who scored from a set piece. Norwich must have been kicking themselves. De Bruyne swung over a corner in one of his last acts before being substituted and Nicolás Otamendi rose unchallenged to nod firmly past Ruddy from close to the penalty spot for his first league goal for the club.\n\nIt all felt a bit anticlimactic really, after all the goals that had rained in during October, though no one had any idea of the drama still to come. “It feels like we chucked away a point,” Alex Neil said when the dust had settled. “We thought it would be naive to go toe-to-toe with City so we set up to defend, we were doing well, and for basic errors from individual players to let us down was extremely frustrating.”"}, {"date": "31/10/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 47139, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot",

Steve McClaren’s side are improving incrementally but their failure to dismantle a stubborn visiting defence arguably highlighted the Tyneside club’s folly in refusing to sanction a move for an extra striker in the Charlie Austin mode last summer.\n\nWatford’s Odion Ighalo on target again in defeat of West Ham United Read more\n\nWithout such a figure, Newcastle are left stuck in the bottom three and their manager facing yet another apparently must-win fixture at Bournemouth next weekend.\n\n“Very frustrating,” said McClaren who suspects Joe Hart has serious competition on his hands in the England goal. “But the future certainly looks brilliant for English goalkeeping. I had Jack on loan for a couple of months at Derby and he was excellent. Jack wins you points.”\n\nHow Newcastle could do with a Butland – and especially at a time when a groin injury sustained by Rob Elliot makes McClaren’s third-choice goalkeeper a major doubt for the Bournemouth game. With Tim Krul and Karl Darlow already sidelined, the teenager Freddie Woodman is Newcastle’s only fit keeper and an emergency loan seems inevitable.\n\nOtherwise McClaren continues to dismiss talk of crisis. “We played some very good football and we created chances,” he said. “If we keep going this way we’ll be OK. Everyone can see we’re growing, progressing. We’re dominating opponents. The key thing is this team now looks capable of winning. We’re going the right way.”\n\nStoke hoped to force Newcastle into an early wrong turn when Paul Dummett clipped Bojan Krkic but Roger East, the referee, was not buying the visiting penalty claims. Reprieved, McClaren’s players delighted in showing off slick little cameos invariably featuring Ayoze Pérez, Georginio Wijnaldum and Moussa Sissoko. Aleksandar Mitrovic, too, looked dangerous and it took stalwart defending Philipp Wollscheid’s part to deny the Serbia centre-forward a goal following his connection with a Dummett cross.\n\nThere was though a caveat: along with certain team-mates, the potentially excellent Pérez did much of his best work in areas of the pitch where serious damage was never likely to be inflicted.\n\nThat all looked set to change, though, when Mitrovic met Sissoko’s cross with an imperious arcing header. Unfortunately for McClaren it rebounded tantalisingly off a post before Butland eventually gathered.\n\nClutching his head in his hands, the disbelieving Newcastle manager started talking to himself but it could have been worse. Minutes earlier the otherwise impressive Chancel Mbemba had been thoroughly wrong-footed by a wonderful ball from Charlie Adam before looking mighty relieved when Jonathan Walters somehow failed to turn the ensuing opening past Elliot.\n\nIt served as a reminder that Newcastle needed to start making their final balls count. Attempting to heed this warning, Pérez curled the subtlest of shots fractionally wide and Wijnaldum directed a free–kick against the bar.\n\nArsenal’s Joel Campbell nets on first league start in win over Swansea Read more\n\nPreviously elusive, clear-cut chances were suddenly emerging and the hitherto underemployed Elliot reacted smartly to repel Walters’s point blank-range header in the wake of Marko Arnautovic’s cross. Stoke had improved considerably since Hughes’s decision to replace the largely ineffective Bojan with Ibrahim Afellay.\n\nEven so Butland remained the busier goalkeeper and did very well to first deny Sissoko after a defence-bisecting one-two with Wijnaldum and then to divert Pérez’s shot away for a corner.\n\nBy now Mitrovic was becoming a little frustrated and when he and Wollscheid squared up after contesting a loose ball much macho posturing followed. Iit concluded with the Serb falling theatrically to the floor clutching his head in an unforgiveable attempt to get his opponent sent off.\n\nThere was a case for McClaren opted against withdrawing but instead he simply told him to calm down. Sand such faith almost reaped reward but Mitrovic the Serb was denied what seemed a certain goal by Eric Pieters’s 11th hour last-ditch block.\n\nAfter that the game might have been a subplot to Butland’s England audition with the keeper saving brilliantly when Sissoko sold the visiting defence a clever dummy before unleashing a shot.\n\nThen came a vicious Jamaal Lascelles header which he pushed over the bar. “Jack’s a top-level keeper,” said Hughes, deadpan. “That’s what he’s paid to do.”"}, {"date": "31/10/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20937, "home_team":

This result could have been different if debatable refereeing decisions had not gone in their favour, but ultimately Arsène Wenger’s men returned as comfortable winners from a trip that was as much a test of the strength of their character as of their squad.\n\nManchester City stay top after late drama against Norwich City Read more\n\nWenger’s team were beaten twice by Swansea last season and gaining vengeance, especially amid an injury crisis, is the sort of achievement that gives credence to suggestions that Arsenal may finally have the gumption to become champions once again.\n\nIt was also a fine way to banish memories of that feeble midweek elimination from the Capital One Cup by Sheffield Wednesday. Only four of the players who began that non-performance were included in the starting line-up here, one of them being Joel Campbell, who, owing to multiple casualties on the right of Arsenal’s midfield, made his full Premier League debut four years after joining the club. The Costa Rican did well, and even completed the scoring with a crisp finish in the 73rd minute. Olivier Giroud struck the first early in the second half before Laurent Koscielny plundered a contentious second.\n\nKoscielny was immaculate, and Héctor Bellerín and Petr Cech also made key contributions as Swansea forced Arsenal to show the defensive fortitude that has led them to concede only eight goals in 11 Premier League match this season.\n\nAlthough they finished strongly, it took Arsenal a while to get going offensively. Wenger admitted his team were “edgy” at the start and that several of his players began sluggishly. The most impressive thing in the first half about Mesut Özil, in particular, was the uncanny exactness of his Invisible Man outfit.\n\nGarry Monk’s side, consisting of the same players who ended a six-game winless streak by beating Aston Villa last week, showed menace and devastating speed, with Jefferson Montero several times pulling off the improbable feat of making Bellerín seem slow.\n\n\n\nCampbell was the first to threaten for Arsenal, curling a respectable effort wide after the ball broke to him on the edge of the Swansea area. In the 22nd minute, however, the Costa Rican showed his unfamiliarity with the pace of the Premier League when his dawdling played Bafétimbi Gomis onside and allowed the striker to receive an excellent through-ball from Jonjo Shelvey, who had treated Özil’s poor imitation of a tackle with the disdain it deserved. Gomis now had only Cech to beat but he hoped the goalkeeper would tell him how: Cech, however, is far too wily for that and stood his ground, leaving the striker to confuse only himself as he belatedly tried to shimmy past his opponent. As Gomis fell desperately to the ground and the crowd howled for a penalty, Bellerín charged back to clear.\n\nGomis did better five minutes later but his powerful header from a cross by Montero was still not good enough to beat Cech.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Olivier Giroud celebrates scoring his side’s opening goal at the Liberty Stadium. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nAlexis Sánchez, almost as inconspicuous as Özil in the first half, came to the fore in the 29th minute, pinging an incisive pass to Giroud, who showed casual rather than killer instincts as he nonchalantly slotted the ball over the bar from 16 yards.\n\nMoments later Bellerín and Campbell teamed up to chop down Montero, seemingly the only way they could stop the winger. Per Mertesacker stopped the resultant free-kick by Gylfi Sigurdsson with his arm: no penalty, ruled the referee. “When you see the replay it’s clearly intentional,” said Monk.\n\nMonk was satisfied, at least, that his team had looked the more likely scorers. But a different Arsenal emerged for the second half. “Our first half was difficult but in the second we upped our tempo, our purpose and the pace in our combinations,” said Wenger.\n\nThe breakthrough came four minutes after the interval and the manner was surprisingly simple. Özil floated in a corner, Ashley Williams misread the flight and the unmarked Giroud headed into the net.\n\nSwansea tried to respond but Cech again had a better answer, plunging to his left to palm away a 20-yard shot from Sigurdsson. When André Ayew skipped around Cech in the 56th minute, Bellerín embodied Arsenal’s determination by racing back to clear the Ghanaian’s shot off the line.\n\nThe goal that secured the visitors’ victory angered the hosts. Williams should have dealt decisively with a cross by Bellerín but instead headed it backwards into the air. Giroud, Koscielny and Lukasz Fabianski all leapt to meet it. The goalkeeper got there first but fumbled it – due to a barge by Giroud, according to Swansea players. But the referee did not whistle and Koscielny picked himself up and tapped the ball into the net. Monk said: “Possibly Fabianski could have punched it rather than caught but he’s got a point, it could have been given as a foul.”\n\nThere was no debate about their third goal, five minutes later. Sánchez and Özil demonstrated their class with exquisite interplay before the German crossed for Campbell, who finished emphatically before being engulfed by team-mates delighted both for the player and for a victory that augurs well for the club.\n\nArsenal are level on points with the leaders, Manchester City, and 14 points ahead of the champions, Chelsea. “It’s better I don’t talk too much about other teams,” said Wenger with a knowing smile. “Let’s focus on the quality of our game and keep a good balance between hunger, humility and confidence.”"}, {"date": "31/10/2015", "arena":

punchbags of the newly promoted as they fell to a first away defeat of the season against a team who were better than them in the first half and, after Slaven Bilic made two substitutions at the interval, even more superior in the second.\n\nOdion Ighalo, a man Watford were ready to sell in the summer but who has now either scored or created every one of their last nine goals, sealed the fate of a terribly disappointing Hammers side and now has 23 goals in 29 league games this calendar year.\n\nQuique Sánchez Flores does not rule out Watford move for Emmanuel Adebayor Read more\n\nHe was also the subject of James Collins’s extremely hard and extraordinarily late challenge with six minutes of normal time remaining, as a result of which the visitors ended the match with 10 men.\n\n“I can’t have any complaints,” said Bilic of Keith Stroud’s decision to show the red card. “I have more complaints about how we played and how we helped them, with the greatest respect to them,” he said. “They have a good team but we gave them a hand. We helped them. In the Premier League you can lose games, of course you can, but you can live with defeats if your team gave everything. Today they didn’t.”\n\nWest Ham have taken maximum points from their games against Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea – and they remain a healthy fifth in the table – but they also have one of a possible nine against Bournemouth, Norwich and now Watford, who joined their opponents in the top 10 as a result of their finest performance of the season and a second successive 2-0 victory.\n\nIt was with only slight overstatement that Quique Sánchez Flores declared this “a match that we controlled the entire time”.\n\nWatford has been the ideal venue for the disorganised, late-arriving fan, Ighalo’s 39th-minute opener – one for the dubious goals panel, having perhaps come off a defender’s foot – being the first scored in the first half of any game. Those a little slow to take their seats again missed little, though they may have not have seen Dmitri Payet, initially stationed on the left but frequently roaming infield, pirouetting balletically past his marker in the fourth minute before shooting tamely.\n\nAndy Carroll spearheaded the West Ham attack on his first league start of the season, but though he sent a volley wide from Payet’s delicious second-half chipped cross he was more influential in his own penalty area than his opponents’. In the 10th minute Nathan Aké’s header from a corner was pushed away from goal by Adrián only to fall, after a few swings and scuffs, to Troy Deeney, whose shot hit Carroll first in the head and then the hand, leading to noisy but unsuccessful penalty appeals.\n\nCarroll’s part in Watford’s opener was humiliatingly hapless. Ben Watson, whose set-piece delivery was a threat throughout, chipped in a free-kick, and as it fell to the ground the striker swung his left foot at the ball, totally – and perhaps deliberately – missing it before, still in possession, he turned his back to play and stopped. Aké however did not, taking the ball off his toes and sliding it across goal, where it was poked over the line by a combination of Ighalo and Aaron Cresswell.\n\nThough Watford’s best first-half chances came from set pieces, they at least had some. Bilic perhaps felt forced into some kind of change at the break, but the arrival of Mauro Zárate and Enner Valencia prompted 10 minutes of total domination by the home team, and another goal.\n\nDeeney’s pass found Ikechi Anya running from right to left into the penalty area. Off balance, the Scottish winger’s pass towards Ighalo was weak and James Tomkins should have dealt with it. Instead he let it run between his feet and the Nigerian controlled before spearing the ball into the top corner.\n\nA minute later Ighalo was sent clear only for Adrián to save his shot and a minute after that Deeney blazed over the bar when given time and space on the edge of the area. To say that West Ham were shambolic during this period would be to do the concept of hopeless disorganisation a disservice.\n\nThey improved thereafter – it would have been difficult not to – but their best chance was gifted to them as Craig Cathcart’s blind back pass was intercepted by Valencia, whose shot crashed against the post before Carroll, somewhat summing up his afternoon, failed to control the rebound."}, {"date": "31/10/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24150, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds":

I wish all the best for him.\n\n“I have a very good feeling now, not only with the strikers or only with Vardy. I feel very good here at Leicester with the chairman, with the family of the chairman, with all my staff, with all our players, all our fans. It is fantastic, there is a good electricity.\n\n“It’s one of the best atmospheres I’ve had at any club. I am a very lucky man to be here.”\n\nRiyad Mahrez turned the game when two goals in the space of seven minutes made it 2-1 in the second half although the winger was offside for his second and it got worse for Albion with 13 minutes left when Vardy continued his remarkable record.\n\nWith West Brom pressing, Danny Drinkwater split them apart for Vardy to outpace the floundering defence and rifle past Myhill. Rickie Lambert then scored his first for the Baggies from the spot to make it 3-2 after Callum McManaman was felled by N’Golo Kanté with five minutes left.

I believe everything is possible with this team.\n\n“My stress levels are OK, when we lose it’s not so good. We know it’s difficult to win here.”\n\nBut the West Brom manager Tony Pulis felt decisions went against his side and that they should have had two more penalties after fouls on Jonny Evans and Darren Fletcher. He also confirmed he will speak to the referees’ chief, Mike Riley, about Anthony Taylor’s calls.\n\n“We are disappointed with the penalty decisions,” he said. “Everyone in the crowd would have said Fletcher’s was a penalty. With Jonny Evans the referee is only two yards away and he gets pulled back. You have to do well to miss it. Why he has not given those two I don’t know.\n\n“I will speak to Mike Riley. At this level the referee should be getting those decisions correct. They say for the second goal the lad [Mahrez] is offside.

Possession, suggested Sunderland’s new manager, can be overrated, not to mention a bit boring for fans.\n\nAs half-time beckoned, few Newcastle United supporters will have shared this view as they watched Steve McClaren’s side pass Allardyce’s team off the pitch. With the visitors hogging the ball for around 70% of that opening period, discussions about whether Sunderland were deliberately standing off them opened but it seemed more a case of the Wearsiders simply being unable to gain possession.\n\nAs Lee Cattermole and company attempted to press and their opponents repeatedly out-manoeuvred them things were becoming almost embarrassingly one-sided. Indeed, McClaren’s only possible gripe would have been regret that some of his side’s sharp midfield incision could have done with being replicated in the penalty area.\n\nThen, in one devastating cameo, came a reminder that, in one sense, Allardyce was right after all. In a game offering zero points for artistic and technical merit there are times when dominance counts for nothing. What matters is taking your chances and exploiting lucky breaks.\n\nOn another day, and possibly under another referee, Newcastle would have cantered to victory. Instead their world turned upside down in first-half stoppage time. In one of those self-destructive moments which have become this team’s hallmark, Fabricio Coloccini barged Steven Fletcher with a shoulder as the striker attempted to connect with Jermain Defoe’s pass. In reality the substitute’s ball was possibly a little long, Rob Elliot looked to have things covered anyway and it was a bit of a nothing challenge, but Coloccini got himself needlessly involved and paid a very big price.\n\nSunderland 3-0 Newcastle: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\nQuite apart from conceding a debatable penalty, as the “last man” the Argentinian centre-half found himself collecting a contentious red card for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity and his side were reduced to 10 men. It left a disbelieving McClaren incandescent as Adam Johnson stepped forward to beat Elliot – who, until that point, had not had a save to make – from the penalty spot. By way of celebration the winger extended his arms and, apparently pretending he was flying, raced the full length of the pitch.\n\nOn the sidelines Newcastle’s manager wagged a finger at Robert Madley, those of a black and white disposition began reminding everyone of the referee’s relative inexperience and a host of pundits disagreed as to whether the official had got things right or wrong.\n\nColoccini was a study in righteous indignation but even he may eventually come to realise his intervention represented a high-risk error of judgment. Equally, while Madley’s advocates claim that having pointed to the spot the laws dictate he had no option but to reach for his red card, the suspicion is another official might have interpreted things differently.\n\nAs if Newcastle’s wounds were not sufficiently raw the counterattack prefacing the penalty had been initiated in the aftermath of Cattermole being fortunate not to concede a penalty after appearing to block a Georginio Wijnaldum shot with his arm before apparently hauling the midfielder down.\n\nUnfortunately for McClaren, everything was suddenly going Sunderland’s way, a trend emphasised when Cattermole – who else? – wiped out Jack Colback with a blood-curdling tackle which ended his one time team-mate’s afternoon and was rather fortunate not to collect a slightly overdue yellow card.\n\nIf Allardyce was even more relieved to see Costel Pantilimon save smartly from Aleksandar Mitrovic – who should have scored from an opening created by Ayoze Pérez – Sunderland’s manager surely sensed victory when Yann M’Vila met a corner on the volley and Billy Jones hooked the ball in from two yards.\n\nSuitably encouraged, Johnson sent a shot crashing against the woodwork but it was not long before Elliot found himself retrieving the ball from the back of his net again. Defoe’s pass, Younès Kaboul’s fine chip and Fletcher’s excellent low volley combined to offer Allardyce the perfect start to life in the dugout. Small wonder his smile was, by now, as wide as the river Wear. A handful of chances created, three goals scored and his new public charmed by such extreme efficiency.\n\nAcross in the adjacent technical area, McClaren folded his arms tighter across his chest. Life as England’s manager may have inoculated him against many of management’s everyday pains, but this was different. This really hurt.\n\nMan of the match Steven Fletcher (Sunderland)"}, {"date": "25/10/2015", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11332, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name":

"report": "In the end, and cruel as it was, the most brutally accurate assessment of this game was inadvertently broadcast over the public address system about a minute from time. “It’s fucking unbelievable,” said a visiting supporter, whose technology had somehow logged on to the same frequency as the PA and unaware his comments were booming around the arena. “Men against boys.” It was hard to disagree.\n\nHarry Kane has been craving opponents as accommodating as Bournemouth since the spring. This was the afternoon everything finally clicked, when Spurs’ supply-line was irresistible and the rivals’ goalkeeper so obliging that the flurry of errors almost served to devalue the England striker’s contribution. Artur Boruc sank without trace, his late save from Clinton N’Jié exceptional only because everything that had preceded it had been so woeful. The Premier League is proving a brutal stage but one on which Tottenham, sixth and rising, are revelling again.\n\nKane needed this. The forward had been industrious but largely luckless up to this point and his hat-trick was reward for months of endeavour and, potentially, a springboard to another prolific run. He benefited from Christian Eriksen’s excellence, the Dane running riot in the space and time offered by wide-eyed opponents. “I never had any doubts about Harry but it was a very important hat-trick,” said Mauricio Pochettino when reflecting on Kane’s one goal in 13 club games before this visit to the south coast. “It’s important for him to learn from that period. It happens in football. I’m happy because he’ll become a much better player after such a tough run.”\n\nThis was far more straightforward, even for a player sporting heavy strapping on his right knee. For all that Bournemouth were accommodating, the balance of their side undone by the depressing swath of injuries that have denied Eddie Howe the spine of his first-choice team, Spurs were admirably clinical. Eriksen sparked their recovery from an early deficit with a nicely weighted pass beyond Steve Cook for Kane to chase down nine minutes in. Boruc charged manically out to upend him and concede the most predictable of penalties and Kane stroked in his second club goal of the season from the spot.\n\nBoruc’s discomfort had only just begun. Within minutes Glenn Murray was penalised for a foul and Eriksen squared the free-kick across the area for Danny Rose to collect. The full-back’s effort thumped into Simon Francis and dropped kindly for Mousa Dembélé to collect and convert as home defenders, wrong-footed by the deflection, failed to recover. Boruc did at least keep out Toby Alderweireld’s near-post flick from Eriksen’s free-kick but on the half-hour he was disconcerted by Sylvain Distin’s presence and Kane’s innocuous cross squirmed from his hands. Erik Lamela could not believe his luck and tapped the ball into the gaping net.\n\nThe Pole’s handling was greasy throughout, even if he was left exposed too often by his team’s porous midfield and the acres they allowed Eriksen. The playmaker struck the goal-frame from distance before the end with a sumptuously curled attempt and it was his whipped centre which was converted by Kane, the striker bursting easily beyond Distin to divert into the net on the stretch. The hat-trick came courtesy of another Boruc spill, the goalkeeper pushing out Alderweireld’s header at Eriksen’s corner to present a tap-in, and there might have been another penalty before the end as the panicked 35-year-old let slip another centre and tripped the Spurs striker in the goalmouth.\n\nHe was spared that concession by Roger East almost as a kindness. “The goals were all self-inflicted, that’s evident,” said Howe. “But we take collective responsibility. Artur has been excellent since he’s been here and played a huge part in our promotion. He’s not that kind of character [to be inconsolable]: he’s strong mentally and resolute when it comes to errors. He’s seen it and done it. But there is a need for the team to eradicate those mistakes and for our goalkeepers to recover their form.”\n\nAdam Federici had played at Manchester City the previous weekend when Boruc had succumbed to injury in the warm-up, and had also been on the end of a 5-1 thrashing. These are relatively unfamiliar problems for Howe, even if he and Bournemouth have recovered from far worse predicaments than being just outside the Premier League’s relegation zone. But striking the right emphasis between “resolute defence” and the attacking enterprise which led Matt Ritchie to volley the home side emphatically ahead after 49 seconds is proving a test.\n\nHowe’s side had led but ended scorched. Each week is proving an education.\n\nMan of the match Christian Eriksen (Tottenham Hotspur)"}, {"date": "25/10/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75329, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Antonio Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [89], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bastian Schweinsteiger", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Memphis Depay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sergio Romero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bacary Sagna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vincent Kompany", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nicolás Otamendi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Kolarov", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernandinho", "yellows": [15], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin De Bruyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yaya Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Raheem Sterling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Wilfried Bony", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}], "subs": [{"name": "Pablo Zabaleta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willy Caballero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesus Navas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eliaquim Mangala", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martín Demichelis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Roberts", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kelechi Iheanacho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was the first goalless draw in this famous fixture since November 2010 and given the disappointing quality on show, it was a fair result. Yet Manchester United came close to claiming the city’s 170th derby as the end neared.\n\nAnthony Martial was the best player on show and after 84 minutes he illustrated why. Stepping inside from the left-wing position Louis van Gaal had asked him to occupy again, he flipped a precise pass in to Jesse Lingard. The second-half substitute stuck out a leg to instinctively volley and was unlucky to see the ball rebound from Joe Hart’s crossbar.\n\nMoments later Chris Smalling struck a knockdown from Marouane Fellaini – another replacement – at Hart and he saved well.\n\nThis late action made the preceding dour fare seem all the more disappointing. Martial appears to be wasted when not operating as the No9. Wayne Rooney again played there and was as ineffective as he has been for a while, and this may have been why Van Gaal refused to answer post-match questions about the captain’s form.\n\nManchester United v Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nYet Manuel Pellegrini was also to blame for not seizing the initiative. With David Silva injured, Kevin De Bruyne is the natural No10 for City yet he was stuck out on the right and Yaya Touré, who is no quick-minded reader of games, played behind Wilfried Bony. “We must try to choose the starting 11 that is better for the team,” said Pellegrini when defending his selection.\n\nEleven minutes passed before there was a shot on goal. It came from Raheem Sterling and the pause-then-shoulder-drop inside United’s area was reminiscent of when he showed the composure that secured him a hat-trick against Bournemouth the previous weekend.\n\nNo goal followed but United had been given a warning. Moments later, City received the same. This time it was Martial. He also displayed youthful zest in skipping past Fernandinho, drawing the foul and the latter’s entry into Mark Clattenburg’s book for a yellow card. When the 19-year-old was felled again moments later Rooney sent in a dipping free-kick that was awkward though the City defence did enough to repel it.\n\nTouré’s position at No10 meant he was expected to join the attack as City roved forward. He did so when Sterling released the ball from around halfway. Here was a chance to launch a buccaneering run at David de Gea’s goal. The 32-year-old did just that but after Marcos Rojo raced across from left-back Touré lost conviction and the Argentinian cleared.\n\nThe hope for Van Gaal would be that faith in Rooney as the leader of the attack would be vindicated by the forward offering more than at CSKA Moscow in midweek. Yet the half hour came and went and beyond his free-kick Rooney’s only headline act was to have staples administered to a head wound.\n\nPhil Jones will not have been pleased with his standout contribution as the interval approached. A header that should have been a clearance or left for De Gea to collect was spooned out for a corner.\n\nFive minutes before the teams wandered off Touré aimed a free-kick at De Gea’s goal that was deflected for a corner, headed wide the subsequent cross and later banged a shot wide. For United, Rooney had punted a 45-yard pass straight out of play and that was about it for the home side.\n\nIt had not been a great match and the hope was that it would get better. Yet the suspicion remained that it could be the first goalless Manchester derby since that at the Etihad Stadium five years ago.\n\nNeither manager made a change at half-time. United’s starting XI had one adjustment from the draw at CSKA, Van Gaal reinstating Juan Mata for Lingard.\n\nPellegrini had provided the headline team news by selecting Vincent Kompany after omitting him from the previous two games due to disquiet at the captain’s appearance for Belgium in a Euro 2016 qualifier following a calf injury. The manager, who dropped Eliaquim Mangala, had also switched Aleksandar Kolarov for Pablo Zabaleta and Fernando for Jesús Navas.\n\nAs with the majority on show, none of these players made any material impact. Martial had done so, however, and now conjured more magic from which United might have scored. The forward’s clever footwork allowed him to offload the ball to Bastian Schweinsteiger. He passed to Mata who did the same to Ander Herrera and the latter pulled the trigger and won a corner.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Manchester United manager, Louis van Gaal, loses his patience when questioned again about the form of Wayne Rooney following the goalless derby against Manchester City\n\nFrom this United again threatened seriously. First Sterling might have conceded a penalty when tangling with Herrera – Van Gaal believed the winger had done so but Clattenburg was unmoved. Then, from a second corner, Mata’s delivery was headed by Smalling across Hart and the ball bounced to safety.\n\nCity were in siege mode. United had them pinned and defending desperately. Schweinsteiger can be laboured yet he still had enough about him to make a patsy of Kompany by selling him a dummy inside the area. The cross went for a corner and when this was cleared Rojo’s stabbed intervention rolled to Mata, who seemed clear until Hart punted the ball away.\n\nThe stalemate that seemed the certain result duly occurred on what was a good day for Arsenal. City move back to the top only on goal difference from them. United are two points back in fourth. City, United and the Gunners may make it a three-way fight for the title all the way until May.\n\nMan of the match Anthony Martial (Manchester United)"}, {"date": "25/10/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44171, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [77], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Bogdan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Connor Randall", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Virgil van Dijk", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bertrand", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordy Clasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [90], "reds": [90], "own_goals": [], "goals": [86], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juanmi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gaston Ramirez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Just to be clear, it is Liverpool who are the draw specialists, not their new manager. Jürgen Klopp is simply taking longer than expected to galvanise a side who have now drawn eight of their last nine games. The German thought he had overseen his first win here when Christian Benteke put Liverpool ahead with 13 minutes remaining but Sadio Mané levelled the scores nine minutes later before being sent off in stoppage time for a foul on Alberto Moreno that brought a second yellow.\n\n“Now I know not to celebrate too early,” Klopp said. “If I looked delighted when our goal went in it is because I was, I was really pleased. But then we give a free-kick away, the ball is in the air and we are not calm enough. These things happen and of course we are disappointed, but I saw some development. We all know it will take time and patience but opposing teams are not going to wait around for us.”\n\nIf that makes the game sound exciting, it was only the final quarter. A tedious first half had made the earlier anticlimax at Old Trafford look scintillating. “Where’s your famous atmosphere?” the Southampton fans chorused, and Klopp could have been forgiven for wondering the same thing. Anfield was so eerily quiet most of the time it was possible to make out all the insults Adam Lallana was receiving from his former public. There was certainly little happening on the pitch for anyone to get worked up about. With Daniel Sturridge still absent and Benteke on the bench there was no focus to the home attacks and slightly too much of Philippe Coutinho, James Milner and Lallana moving the ball around on the edge of the visitors’ area with no end result.\n\nSouthampton looked more purposeful when they came forward, holding the ball well and always threatening to find Graziano Pellè in a dangerous area, although it was Virgil van Dijk who came closer to scoring when the visitors ended the half with a sustained spell of pressure. The centre-half brought a save from Simon Mignolet when left unmarked at the far post from a free-kick, then won a header from the resulting corner to force Lucas Leiva to clear from under his own crossbar. Moreno fired high and wide from Lallana just before the interval, though perhaps the best chance of the half fell to Steven Davis when Mamadou Sakho misjudged a defensive header. The ball went straight to Davis near the penalty spot. But he was either too surprised or off balance to take advantage with a shot at goal.\n\nIt was no surprise to see Benteke replace Divock Origi for the second half and immediately he combined with Lallana to set up a half-chance and earn the first of a succession of corners. Nothing came of any of them but at least Liverpool brought the crowd to life with a promising flurry of attacks as Southampton were pinned back, culminating with Moreno sending a fierce shot across the face of goal from a narrow angle.\n\nLiverpool 1-1 Southampton: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\nMoreno’s next effort, from a more promising position after being found well by Lallana and Coutinho, ended up high in the Kop to audible groans, though the pacy full-back instantly made amends by racing from half way to dispossess Mané in the act of shooting.\n\nAs in the Europa League game against Rubin Kazan on Thursday Klopp also added Roberto Firmino to his attacking mix before the end, though it was Benteke, with an old-fashioned centre-forward’s header, who finally broke the deadlock. Milner retrieved a loose ball on the right wing, looked up and hit a measured cross. Benteke timed his run perfectly, climbed higher than José Fonte and placed a firm header into Maarten Stekelenburg’s top-left corner. Klopp, in danger of becoming a passive figure on the touchline by that point, leapt into the air in celebration, prematurely as it turned out.\n\nWhen James Ward-Prowse launched a free-kick into the Liverpool area four minutes from the end, Southampton won two successive aerial challenges, and when Gastón Ramírez headed across the face of goal from the second one, Mignolet could neither reach the ball nor prevent Mané hooking it in.\n\n“We were only worth a point. We can play better football than that,” Ronald Koeman said with disarming honesty. “It was a great goal from Benteke but a good reaction from us to come back so late.”\n\nMan of the match Victor

six minutes there was a chink of light for Tim Sherwood but hope disappeared almost as quickly as it arrived in a game that may come to mark the end of the Aston Villa manager’s reign. André Ayew’s winner, three minutes from time, condemned Villa to a sixth successive league defeat and leaves Sherwood on the brink.\n\nSecond from bottom in the table, without a victory since the opening day and with one point from a possible 27, Villa are sleepwalking towards the Championship and it is hard to see how Sherwood can cling on for much longer. His position was precarious before the game and it must have been a chastening walk for the manager when he turned on his heel at the final whistle and headed for the tunnel.\n\nThe Villa supporters never called for Sherwood’s head at any point, and apathy rather than anger seemed to be the overriding emotion among the home fans at the end, but there is no escaping the fact that the wider picture is desperately bleak. For the sixth successive season Villa are facing up to the reality of being in a relegation battle and the worry for the board is that Sherwood seems unable to find a way to arrest a dismal run of results.\n\nWith a trip to Tottenham next in the league, followed by the visit of Manchester City and a trip to Everton, things look set to get worse before they get better. The big question is whether Sherwood, who was appointed on a three-and-a-half-year contract in February and kept Villa up against the odds, will be around for any of those fixtures.\n\nMuch rests on the shoulders of Tom Fox, the Villa chief executive, who made the call to Randy Lerner, the club’s owner, when he felt it was time for Paul Lambert to be sacked. Villa made no attempt to publicly back Sherwood in the lead-up to the match and the manager said that he had not had any conversations with the board about his position. He also joked that he would turn his phone off over the next 24 hours.\n\nSherwood described this game as must-win and for a brief period it looked like he might get his wish, yet the all too familiar shortcomings that have plagued Villa this season resurfaced. Jordan Ayew’s goal in the 62nd minute ought to have given them a shot of confidence but in the blink of an eye Swansea levelled through Gylfi Sigurdsson’s sublime free-kick and it was left to the Villa forward’s brother to twist the knife.\n\nIt was a result that Garry Monk also needed after a week that he described as a circus. The Swansea manager had seen his odds on being the next Premier League manager to be sacked slashed on the back of Monday’s defeat against Stoke and stories of unrest behind the scenes, but this first win in six league matches put a smile back on his face.\n\nThe only downside for Monk could be the disciplinary action that Federico Fernández is likely to face after the Argentinian became embroiled in a feud with Micah Richards that continued after the final whistle. Richards reacted furiously after Fernández appeared to headbutt him, and Sherwood claimed that Neil Swarbrick, who did not seem to see the incident, should have dismissed the Swansea defender. The two players clashed again in the tunnel afterwards.\n\nThe game was a slow burner, but it came to life in the 62nd minute. Brad Guzan produced a superb save to deny Ayew, rushing off his line to smother a left-foot shot from six yards out, and 33 seconds later the Swansea forward’s brother had the ball in the net at the other end.\n\nJack Grealish ran from inside his own half and off-loaded to Bacuna, who fed the ball into Gabriel Agbonlahor’s path. Showing a rare moment of composure, Agbonlahor took a touch before picking out the unmarked Ayew, whose diving header from inside the six-yard box found the bottom corner.\n\nSo far, so good for Villa but Swansea were soon level. Richards fouled Sigurdsson 25 yards from goal and the Icelander showed why he is one of the best dead-ball specialists in the Premier League. His right-foot shot was perfectly struck and moving away from Guzan’s despairing dive as it arced into the top corner.\n\nSwansea, however, were not finished. Kyle Naughton delivered an inviting cross from the right that implored Ayew, who had stolen a yard on Alan Hutton, to tap home.\n\nMonk offered some sympathetic words for Sherwood. “You feel for Tim. I know the job he’s doing, he’s an excellent coach and an excellent manager, and no one will be working harder than him to put it right.”"}, {"date": "24/10/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31752, "home_team": {"name": "Leicester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Kasper Schmeichel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Simpson", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Morgan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Huth", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Christian Fuchs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Albrighton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Danny Drinkwater", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "N'Golo Kanté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeffrey Schlupp", "yellows": [67], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Riyad Mahrez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Jamie Vardy", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [59], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ritchie de Laet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrej Kramaric", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shinji Okazaki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Schwarzer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gökhan Inler", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}], "subs": [{"name": "Julian Speroni", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Patrick Bamford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mile Jedinak", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Jamie Vardy paused for just long enough as he celebrated scoring for the 10th time in the Premier League this season to count all his fingers. He is going to need a hand from his team-mates shortly because “England’s No9”, as the Leicester City fans hailed him, is in no mood to stop his prolific run any time soon.\n\nThe former Stocksbridge Park Steels striker joined an elite list of marksmen to have scored in seven successive Premier League games as he broke the deadlock between two of the division’s surprise packages just before the hour mark to keep Leicester fifth in the table.\n\nTo the names of Thierry Henry, Alan Shearer, Ian Wright, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Emmanuel Adebayor, Mark Stein and Daniel Sturridge can be added that of Vardy who is playing with such belief they should consider relaunching Roy of the Rovers with his face on the front.\n\nVardy’s hunger to help Leicester’s cause is set to be sated at least partially as Claudio Ranieri agreed to fulfil his promise to take the squad out for a pizza now they have managed a clean sheet. The 28-year-old was even charging back in the 90th minute to lunge into a tackle on Bakary Sako that earned him a yellow card but denied Palace the opportunity to break.\n\n“You saw how we defended at the end, great resilience,” Vardy said. “The pizzas are on the gaffer. He’s been saying he wants to buy us them so I’ll definitely make sure he does.”\n\nRanieri’s gravity-defying team did not even have to go behind for Vardy to extend his goalscoring habit. Only Arsenal have a better away record in 2015 than Crystal Palace since Alan Pardew took charge and yet Leicester snuffed out their threat bravely. “It was a tactical match, more Italian than English,” Ranieri said, “until the last 10 minutes when it was a big battle and they threw balls into the box.”\n\nAlan Pardew, the Crystal Palace manager, felt that Ranieri should have been offering him a handshake immediately after the match rather than going to fete his players on the pitch. “I thought [Claudio Ranieri] was goading our players [by not giving the ball back as Leicester took time to take a throw-in late on] and he didn’t shake my hand at full-time, which is disappointing. But it’s a long game and they’ve got to come to our place and we’ll remember that.”\n\nBrede Hangeland’s error changed the game. Scott Dann was unchallenged as he carefully headed Kasper Schmeichel’s long kick down towards his defensive partner, but when the Norwegian bungled his clearance straight to Riyad Mahrez, Vardy was off like a whippet. Mahrez’s pass into his path was instant and the Premier League’s leading scorer had the presence of mind to lift the ball over Wayne Hennessey before running round the goalkeeper to smack the ball high into the net with relish.\n\nThe striker’s feats are the icing on the remarkable cake that is the rise and rise of Leicester. Not many neutrals would have backed Ranieri to keep the ball rolling when Nigel Pearson’s achievement in leading them to an unlikely survival from relegation in May was followed by the manager’s dismissal. Yet here they are, defeated once this season, sitting level on points with Manchester United, two points off the summit of the Premier League. With 19 points from 10 games, Leicester are halfway to staying up even as we reach the season’s quarter mark.\n\nPalace have won nine out of their 13 away games under Pardew, but despite Leicester’s propensity for going behind before fighting back, they sat deep in the first half, Marc Albrighton hitting the foot of a post.\n\nEven after Vardy’s goal, when Leicester were forced back on to the back foot, Palace could not find the equaliser. Patrick Bamford’s header was brilliantly saved by Schmeichel then Christian Fuchs cleared Dann’s header off the line. But when Wilfried Zaha was rightly booked for diving three minutes from time, Leicester knew it was their day, and Vardy’s.

The 1-0 win came with another impressive rearguard display as the visitors soaked up plenty of pressure in the opening stages, with Rondón heading home less than a minute into the second half to secure the points.\n\nAlthough he admits goalkeeper Boaz Myhill and the defence deserve credit, Pulis was more impressed with his side going forward, even though the Baggies have only managed eight goals.\n\n“The defenders do a lot of work on the training ground, we work very hard on certain aspects,” said the Welshman.\n\n“We talk about it because of the record I have got but we also work hard going forward and we got our reward.\n\n“I like to play wide players and we had [Stéphane] Sessègnon on the right and James McClean was magnificent. I was really pleased. The back four and the goalkeeper are jumping up and down about another clean sheet but I was more pleased with the quality going forward.\n\n“We also thought we should have had a penalty and we had a couple of headers as well. The quality of our play going forward was very good at times.”\n\nThe defeat for Norwich comes after losses to Leicester and Newcastle, who beat Alex Neil’s side 6-2 at St James’ Park last weekend. Neil reacted by dropping his two full-backs but that did not stop his side again emerging with nothing, and it is a run of form that the former Hamilton player-manager has never previously had to deal with in his short managerial career. “I wouldn’t say it is worrying times,” he said.\n\n“It is not a nice time, I have never even lost two league games in a row, never mind three. Yes, you are concerned, I’m looking at what I can do to put it right. I’m trying to do everything I can and I’m working as hard as I can and it is about making sure when the lads are on the pitch they do as well as they can.”\n\nNorwich were on top for much of the opening 20 minutes but could not make their dominance pay, something Neil pointed to in his post-match analysis.\n\n“The bottom line is, the game for us boils down to two boxes,” he added.\n\n“Our box, we didn’t defend well enough and in the other box they defended it well. That is basically the game – we must have put about 40 crosses into their box and they put about seven into mine and scored a header and should have scored another.\n\n“I thought our intensity dropped a little as the half wore on. To try to maintain that for a full half is difficult but at this level when you have the ball in good areas it is about punishing teams, and we didn’t do that and there is always a danger they will threaten.\n\n“In the second half we didn’t stop a cross coming into our box and when it did we didn’t defend the header and conceded the goal.”"}, {"date": "24/10/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium",

that he had never been worried about the striker’s lack of goals this season.\n\nDeeney, the club captain, scored 21 times in the promotion campaign last term and finally found the net for the first time since then when he put his side ahead with a low shot from Odion Ighalo’s clever tee-up in the 43rd minute.\n\nFlores said afterwards of the man he describes as the “soul” of the Watford team: “I’m really happy [for Deeney] and I wasn’t worried about the situation. He has been working hard and is the soul of the team.\n\n“But it is better for him because we know, for strikers and their confidence, it is very important when they score.”\n\nDeeney and Ighalo caused problems throughout for Stoke, with both hitting the crossbar moments before the opener, and the latter subsequently provided another assist as he set up Almen Abdi to make it 2-0 in the 69th minute.\n\nFlores added: “Both Ighalo and Deeney played really well.\n\n“For us, it is very important how they keep the ball very well. They are always pushing the team. Their performances are always very important.”\n\nThe result adds to what has been a very creditable start to the season for Watford, who now have 13 points from 10 games and are up to 13th in the table, a place and a point clear of Stoke.\n\n“I’m really happy with the performance of the team,” Flores said.\n\n“We played really well today - with a lot of confidence. The balance of the team was amazing, and when we play like this it is very difficult for Stoke and for other teams also.”\n\nStoke were guilty of errors when both goals went in, the first seeing Philipp Wollscheid slip as Deeney shaped to shoot, and for the second Ighalo fed Abdi, having dispossessed Marc Wilson, who had come on early for the injured Geoff Cameron.\n\nStoke went into the contest on a three-match winning run in the Premier League and their manager, Mark Hughes, admitted he had been left mystified by the performance his players produced on his 100th game in charge at the club.\n\n“We were poor today, and credit to Watford,” Hughes said. “They came here with a good game plan and worked hard at it. They had a good threat up top with the two lads up front, who messed us around all day long to be honest.\n\n“We needed to be better and we did not really see that performance coming. We have been playing well of late and getting good results.\n\n“You have to put it down to individual errors, collective errors and the good play of the opposition.”\n\nRegarding Cameron, who limped off in the ninth minute, Hughes added: “It looks like he has pulled his thigh unfortunately.\n\n“I think it is fair to say that probably disrupted us, but we can’t hide behind that. There were good players on the pitch today and we should have done better.”"}, {"date": "24/10/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Dimitri Payet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andy Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Enner Valencia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angelo Ogbonna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [56], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [24], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [35], "reds": [44], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Baba Rahman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bertrand Traoré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marco Amelia", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "West Ham deserved to win. It is worth highlighting that fact lest it be obscured by the fallout to Chelsea’s disciplinary meltdown.\n\nThe champions had Nemanja Matic sent off in the first half, two players booked for protesting against that decision, their assistant first-team coach, Silvino Louro, dismissed for haranguing the fourth official and José Mourinho banished to the stands at half-time.\n\nThe Portuguese manager has recently taken to describing referees, whose performances displease him, as “weak and naive” – pointedly borrowing the term from Arsène Wenger – but this was a demonstration of strength by referee Jonathan Moss, who was not prepared to let Chelsea personnel tell him how to do his job. Chelsea did not do their own job as well as champions should. Defensively it is they who have been weak and naive this season. There were suggestions before this match that they were improving on that front – two consecutive clean sheets served as evidence – but West Ham ran a serious stress test and Chelsea failed it.\n\nPremier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read more\n\nEven amid a cagey opening there were signs that betrayed the principles that Mourinho teams have traditionally applied, with Cesc Fàbregas, deployed in an advanced midfield role, acting as the sort of luxury player that the Portuguese has never tolerated.\n\nThe Spaniard seemed sluggish at the start and his unconvincing tackle on Dimitri Payet in the 16th minute led to the home side’s opening goal. The Frenchman took the resultant 25-yard free-kick himself. He had fired over the bar from a similar distance earlier but this effort was more accurate and forced Asmir Begovic to improvise a save, the goalkeeper tipping the ball over the bar to concede a corner. Payet delivered the set piece and Diego Costa, one of Chelsea’s most energetic performers, botched an attempted clearance, allowing the ball to bobble out to the edge of the area, where Mauro Zárate arrived to lash a splendid low shot into the net.\n\n“You’re getting sacked in the morning!” crowed the home fans as Mourinho fumed in the dugout. The visiting manager knew that his team would now have to pierce hosts who could afford to play as they had when achieving memorable victories away to Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City this season. It was a while before Chelsea looked like rising to that task but eventually they did summon more intensity and creativity.\n\nKurt Zouma came within millimetres of equalising from a corner but Manuel Lanzini scrambled the right-back’s close-ranger header off the line.\n\nThe home side remained dangerous on the counterattack. Begovic blocked a James Collins header in the 36th minute. Moments later, Lanzini should have doubled the home side’s lead after being put through courtesy of a beautiful flick by Payet. Lanzini clipped the ball over the advancing Begovic but it flew over the bar, too.\n\nCosta put a proper clearance on a West Ham corner in the 44th minute and it led to a wonderful counterattacking chance, with four Chelsea players racing towards two West Ham defenders. Willian slipped a pass through to Fàbregas, who cracked a low shot into the net – but the Spaniard was ruled to have been offside. Within a minute Chelsea lost a player and the plot.\n\nMatic, on a booking for a previous foul on Lanzini, was adjudged to have tripped Diafra Sakho and was shown a second yellow by Moss. The visitors surrounded the official to vent their anger. That, at least, was like the old Chelsea.\n\nMoss showed two of the offenders, Fàbregas and John Terry, yellow cards and then sent Louro to the stands for berating the fourth official. Mourinho watched the second half from the directors’ box, having been ordered not to return to the sidelines.\n\nA man down on the pitch and two down in the dugout, Chelsea faced a stern character test now, on top of their footballing trial. Their initial response was decent. With Mikel John Obi introduced for Fàbregas during the break the visitors got a grip on the game despite their numerical disadvantage. Eleven minutes into the second period they drew level, Gary Cahill whacking a bouncing ball into the net from close range after Zouma flicked on a corner.\n\nWest Ham battled to regain the upper hand. Payet was a constant menace, probing and conniving relentlessly. But with Mikel joining Ramires in protecting the back four, Chelsea defended well.\n\nMourinho’s men retained their ambition to attack when they could. Ramires should have made Adrian work in the 77th minute after being teed up by Eden Hazard, but the Brazilian miskicked from 16 yards.\n\nThat proved costly, as two minutes later, Slaven Bilic’s decision to spring Andy Carroll from the bench paid off. The striker leapt to meet a fine cross from the left by Aaron Cresswell and sent a powerful header into the net from 10 yards.\n\nChelsea’s fifth league defeat of the season was complete, their

statements in recent weeks as they have injected momentum into their season, and they made the latest one here by clambering to the top of the Premier League table. The position will not last beyond Sunday’s Manchester derby if City get a draw or more at United, but it still felt like a moment for Arsène Wenger and his players to savour.\n\nFew teams spark such outpourings of angst in defeat as Arsenal but they have rolled with the punches this season, quietly finding a groove that was again in evidence in this slow-burning cracker. There were a few hairy moments for them towards the end, not least when Romelu Lukaku headed against the top of the crossbar and Gerard Deulofeu was denied by a vital Petr Cech block on 86 minutes, but, on balance, they were value for the points.\n\nThis was a victory sculpted by two memorable assists, the first by Mesut Özil for Olivier Giroud, who was rotated into the lineup ahead of Theo Walcott, and the second by Santi Cazorla for Laurent Koscielny. Giroud was excellent, leading the line with a mixture of muscle and finesse, and he was unlucky not to score more.\n\nHe worked Tim Howard with a side-on blast and curled a 70th minute shot from Özil’s pass against the crossbar but, when it was all over, he could reflect upon a picture perfect week.\n\nHe came off the bench last Saturday at Watford, and again in midweek against Bayern Munich in the Champions League, to score within minutes. The goal against Bayern had set up Arsenal for a famous win and, as the scalps pile up – that of Everton added to those of Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Bayern since late September – so the feeling that something is brewing at the Emirates has been reinforced.\n\n“We could be top for only 24 hours, although you don’t know,” Wenger said. “But after the first game of the season when we lost to West Ham, nobody could have predicted that. After 10 games, we are there. Would I have predicted that? Honestly, no. I thought it would take much longer because City started with five wins.”\n\nEverton finished with 10 men, after Gareth Barry’s frustration got the better of him in injury-time and he clattered into the substitute, Kieran Gibbs, to earn a second yellow card. They departed with regrets, chiefly the concessions, which came in the space of two minutes towards the end of the first half.\n\nRoberto Martínez noted the quality of the deliveries from Özil and Cazorla but he was unhappy with the defending, particularly on the Cazorla free-kick, which laid on what proved to be the winner for Koscielny. Arsenal, as Martínez pointed out, are hardly noted for their scoring prowess from set pieces, so this one stuck in his throat. “You go one down and then you shoot yourself in the foot,” Martínez said.\n\nThe biggest disappointment for him was the loss of the captain, Phil Jagielka, to a knee injury early in the second-half, following a challenge from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after the referee’s whistle had gone for a foul.\n\n“It will take 48 hours to find out the severity but it’s not good, clearly,” Martínez said. “It is the biggest negative to lose Phil in such a stupid challenge because the referee has already awarded a free-kick. It was needless from Oxlade-Chamberlain. He puts his foot up. It was not malicious but when it happens after the referee has given a free-kick, it is disappointing.”\n\nEverton were comfortable until Arsenal’s goals and they might have been in front on 28 minutes, when Cech could only parry Aaron Lennon’s cross and John Stones, from close to the penalty spot, sliced his volley.\n\nArsenal had flickered only from a few corners when the timing of Özil’s floated ball from the inside-right channel, in between the Everton centre-halves, was matched by that of Giroud’s run. When he jumped ahead of Howard, he needed only to apply the merest of touches.\n\nArsenal turned the screw when Cazorla drove in a free-kick from the left and Koscielny could not miss from point-blank range, but Everton showed character to rally. Ross Barkley, at the apex of a break, had three red shirts close to him and little on and, when he shot, it was more in hope than expectation. But it flicked off Gabriel Paulista – in for Per Mertesacker, who was ill – to wrongfoot Cech.\n\nThe finale was breathless. Lukaku’s 79th-minute header from Barry’s cross kissed the woodwork; the Arsenal substitute Mathieu Flamini headed straight at Howard; and Deulofeu was denied by Cech. There was even time for Özil to hit the post and Barry to see red. At full time, Arsenal could exhale."}, {"date": "19/10/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium", "attendance": 20044, "home_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski",

"This was a night for Ashley Williams and Swansea City to forget as their captain gave away the early penalty that deepened the sense of frustration enveloping these parts and allowed Stoke, courtesy of Bojan Krkic’s expertly taken spot-kick, to continue their climb up the Premier League table.\n\nSwansea City v Stoke City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWithout a win in six league and cup matches – a run that stretches back to when Manchester United were beaten here 2-1 at the end of August – Swansea are slipping in the opposite direction and their bright start to the season is turning into a distant memory.\n\nGarry Monk said he was “not overly concerned” with the team’s slump but the Swansea manager also admitted that they were going through a “difficult moment”, after a flat and toothless performance that was hard to reconcile with the sort of incisive attacking football that Swansea were producing earlier in the campaign.\n\n“We all know what this group is capable of and what we can produce but it is up to me to work with the players, to make sure we stick together and get back to the levels we know we can reach,” Monk said. “We are in a tough moment, there is no doubt about that, but we have been in tough moments before.\n\n“Last season we went five games without a win and we came out of that and went on to have a magnificent season. I have had these times before as a manager. It is about sticking together and turning in performances. But I am not overly concerned. It is just about finding that confidence. The effort and commitment is there but the crispness of our passing is not and I have to make sure we get back to where we were.”\n\nStoke have no such problems, with a third successive league win extending their unbeaten run to five matches and lifting them to 11th place, sandwiched between Liverpool and Chelsea. It is the first time Stoke have won consecutive top-flight away matches since December 2011 and in truth the outcome rarely looked in doubt on an evening when Jack Butland posed a bigger danger to Stoke than Bafétimbi Gomis, who contributed next to nothing for Swansea up front.\n\nIn the 17th minute Butland was caught in two minds with the ball at his feet on the edge of the Stoke area, got in a terrible tangle and made a desperate lunge to retrieve the situation. He won the ball but his studs were showing as he challenged André Ayew and Butland admitted afterwards that he was fortunate he “got off scot free”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bojan Krkic celebrates his goal. Photograph: BPI/Rex Shutterstock\n\nMark Hughes agreed but was also quick to express disappointment that the incident was replayed several times on the giant screens in the stadium. “I thought he got the ball,” the Stoke manager said. “It could have gone against us in fairness, but, if that’s a little bit of luck that has gone our way, then we’ll take it. But I didn’t appreciate the incident being shown on the videos around the stadium. I thought that was unnecessary. I wouldn’t like to think it was deliberate, because when those situations happen it causes a reaction in the crowd and we had to deal with that.”\n\nGood fortune was smiling on Butland in the second half as well, when Jonjo Shelvey held off a challenge from Philipp Wollscheid and drilled a low angled shot that went through the Stoke goalkeeper’s legs and came back off the far upright. Otherwise Swansea created precious little, and Stoke, resolute and well organised, looked comfortable.\n\nKrkic had set the tone for the visitors in the third minute, when he provided the defining moment of a banal game as he glided upfield, skipped around Federico Fernández and drew Williams into committing a clumsy foul. Sending Lukasz Fabianski the wrong way from the spot, the Spaniard registered his second goal of the season and for Swansea there was no way back."}, {"date": "18/10/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 47006, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Rob Elliot", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chancel Mbemba", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paul Dummett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [65]}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheick Tiote", "yellows": [6], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [14, 26, 66, 85], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [33], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamaal Lascelles", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [65], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Thauvin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Freddie Woodman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Whittaker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastien Bassong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Alexander Tettey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dieumerci Mbokani", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [20], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Hoolahan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Jarvis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When the final whistle blew Steve McClaren looked slightly stunned. A little reminiscent of a man who has finally passed his driving test after countless attempts and is too exhausted emotionally to celebrate, Newcastle United’s manager wandered on to the pitch in an apparent daze.\n\nAs the weeks have passed, the nights lengthened and results worsened there has been one constant on Tyneside: McClaren’s commendable calm and, outwardly at least, good humour.\n\nSteve McClaren: Newcastle rout of Norwich a reward for ‘staying calm’ Read more\n\nIt was underpinned by a stubborn belief his team would finally click and the club’s marquee, £14.5m summer signing, Georginio Wijnaldum, would eventually reveal the devastating talent that made the attacking midfielder such a hit at PSV Eindhoven last season.\n\nAt long last the former England coach’s patience was rewarded in the form of a dramatic first Premier League win of what has been threatening to turn into a gruelling grind of a season. If the end of an afternoon featuring a brilliant performance from not only Wijnaldum but Moussa Sissoko prompted a sense of utter relief, McClaren could barely raise a half-smile, let alone a fist-pump.\n\nNewcastle United 6-2 Norwich City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nJubilation was centred primarily on the Gallowgate End where the triumphant strains of Blaydon Races served as a reminder that Wijnaldum had scored four goals, Sissoko created four and Aleksandar Mitrovic, who contributed a fabulous volleyed goal of his own, looked to have nailed the part of a proper Newcastle United centre-forward.\n\nIt would, though, be wrong to reduce Norwich City to the role of mere extras in what increasingly became the Wijnaldum and Sissoko show. If the way those two midfielders switched flanks frequently wrongfooted Alex Neil’s players – not to mention heightening their vulnerability to counterattacks – the visitors did not surrender their hitherto excellent away record lightly. Indeed for brief spells Norwich looked potential winners, with Nathan Redmond a prospective man of the match.\n\nEven so they began as they finished – very much on the back foot. A promising Newcastle attack had looked like evaporating when Mitrovic found his path to goal blocked, but then in surged Sissoko to salvage the situation. When the Frenchman shaped to shoot Norwich were duped, but instead Sissoko slipped the ball to Wijnaldum who showed commendable composure and subtlety to place his shot in the bottom corner.\n\nSo far, so good for Newcastle but a reminder of their enduring fallibility arrived as Robbie Brady sent a 30-yard shot crashing against a post. That warning was swiftly followed by an equaliser. When Martin Olsson crossed with menace Dieumerci Mbokani, borrowed from Dynamo Kyiv, volleyed beyond Rob Elliot – deputising manfully for the injured Tim Krul – from close range. It was a good goal but its origins were rooted in slapdash defending on a day when, unusually, Daryl Janmaat struggled.\n\nMaybe the right-back’s travails had something to do with Sissoko and Wijnaldum’s flank-swapping but whatever the reason – and Brady was part of the equation – Newcastle wobbled. With Mbokani impressing as a physically imposing and highly mobile centre-forward, it took another intervention from Sissoko to settle Newcastle nerves.\n\nSo often an underachiever in recent months, he shone and his wonderfully whipped-in cross soon created Newcastle’s second goal. Once again the scorer was Wijnaldum who took advantage of slack marking – Steven Whittaker will not relish watching replays – to steal in front of his supposed minder and dispatch a glancing header beyond John Ruddy.\n\nTemporarily in the ascendant Newcastle extended their lead. Created by Sissoko – this was becoming quite a theme – the goal owed much to the persistence of Ayoze Pérez. With Mitrovic’s decoy run having deceived Neil’s defence the Spanish striker advanced only to find his initial shot blocked by Olsson. Regaining possession Pérez made no mistake at the second attempt.\n\nAt times Norwich’s penchant for passing the ball around at the back seemed self-destructive but going forward it was a different matter entirely. Appropriately enough a seven-man passing move coinciding with a home concentration lapse concluded with Redmond finding himself unmarked and connecting with Olsson’s cross before directing a cushioned volley beyond the helpless Elliot. It was Redmond’s fourth goal in nine Premier League games this season and reinforced the feeling he is close to becoming a very special player.\n\nRedmond was presumably one of the reasons why, early in the second half, McClaren’s team dropped alarmingly deep as Norwich appeared to deploy every single item in an often highly technical armoury in pursuit of an equaliser.\n\nThen came the watershed. As Newcastle broke forward on the counterattack Sissoko’s chip played in Mitrovic. Having chested the ball down the Serbia striker defied Ruddy courtesy of that glorious volley. Down in the visiting technical area Neil, ever intense, cursed before folding his arms a little tighter.\n\nA measure of atonement soon followed for Janmaat, his excellent cross being headed home by Wijnaldum at the far post. As the Dutchman celebrated becoming the first Newcastle player to score a Premier League hat-trick since Demba Ba four years ago the tension visibly ebbed from McClaren.\n\nRedmond subsequently hit a post but it was Wijnaldum’s day, goal No4 arriving when his long-range shot struck Whittaker’s shin before looping over poor Ruddy.\n\nMan of the match Georginio Wijnaldum (Newcastle United)"},

fluttering in the away end was Mein Held – My Hero. Liverpool, as their new manager promised, had a different look. They chased and harried and could not really have given much more to try to get the Jürgen Klopp era off to a winning start but, ultimately, there was not enough inspiration to go with all the perspiration.\n\nLiverpool were quick to the ball, full of energy and ran so hard that when a Tottenham man went down midway through the second half every single one of Klopp’s players came to the touchline for a drinks break. They looked worn out, yet they still roused themselves for one last effort. It has been a long time since Adam Lallana has covered this much ground in one game. Emre Can sprinted when once he might have strolled. Liverpool became a team of one goalkeeper and 10 James Milners and Klopp must have been encouraged by the speed at which his changes have been implemented.\n\nTottenham Hotspur v Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWhat they could not do, deprived of some of their better players, was match all their effort with a touch more refinement. Daniel Sturridge’s latest injury setback left them with Divock Origi, ordinarily their fourth-choice striker, in attack and though the Belgium international worked hard he did look slightly raw for the position. As such, Liverpool were unable to extend their winning sequence against Tottenham to six matches, having scored 18 times and conceded four in the previous five encounters. They did, however, register their first clean sheet in nine matches and, in the process, they largely subdued Spurs, even if Mauricio Pochettino could justifiably reflect that his team created the better chances.\n\nOn those occasions, Simon Mignolet’s goalkeeping ensured a reasonable start for Klopp, particularly when Harry Kane had a chance to win the match five minutes from the end of normal time. Mignolet made an even better save earlier to keep out Clinton N’Jie, who had replaced the injured Nacer Chadli, but Spurs managed only one 15-minute spell in the first half when they put their opponents under sustained pressure. They had a tendency to play the ball long and high in the second half and more might have been expected of the home side, especially thinking back to the way they had dismantled Manchester City in their previous home game.\n\nThis was the first time this season that Spurs have been outrun by their opponents and the statistics confirmed what Liverpool’s supporters can expect from now on: a team that tries to run the opposition off their feet. The difficulty when teams play with that kind of intensity is that mistakes can follow. At times, Liverpool needed someone to put their foot on the ball and pick the decisive pass, rather than it always being football at full throttle.\n\n“The problem was when we had the ball we were not good enough,” Klopp said. “We didn’t use our skills. We were a little too hectic, maybe too eager. We didn’t see the right options.”\n\nKlopp had set up his team in a new 4-3-2-1 system, with Lallana and Philippe Coutinho patrolling the area behind Origi, and they moved the ball with great purpose during the opening exchanges. “The start was brilliant,” he said.\n\nThe new Liverpool looked like they could not wait to get started and the tall bespectacled guy on the touchline, wearing the dark tracksuit and occasionally delivering a shrill whistle to get his players’ attention, was hopping around agonisingly after 10 minutes when Milner swung over a corner, Can had the first header and Origi came next, diverting the ball against the crossbar and unable to get to the rebound when it ricocheted down.\n\nAt that stage the home crowd might have recalled the way Liverpool had won their last two games here with an aggregate 8-0 score. Instead, Spurs gradually began to emerge as a threat of their own and Klopp saw for the first time his team’s habit of making life difficult for themselves. Lallana was indebted to Mignolet’s one-handed save after losing the ball deep inside his own half, giving Kane the chance to set up N’Jie. Later, N’Jie flashed a diagonal effort just over the crossbar after more hesitancy in the defence. Martin Skrtel was involved both times and, in between, Mignolet’s feet kept out Kane, with Mamadou Sakho blocking the follow-up effort from Dele Alli.\n\nThe game became increasingly error-strewn after the interval and Milner, having already been shown a yellow card, was fortunate the referee, Craig Pawson, gave him the benefit of the doubt after a collision with Danny Rose.\n\nThose were the moments when Tottenham’s fans were reminded that the current team does not have the same finesse on the ball as previous sides. In the absence of the suspended Eric Dier, Mousa Dembélé acquitted himself well in the holding midfield role but Kane was often isolated in attack and Pochettino was being generous with his praise of the performance.\n\nKlopp’s conclusion was that it was a “first good step”, pointing out the amount of injuries and his lack of time to work with his players in training. A new team is taking shape and, overall, he could reflect he had seen more good than bad."}, {"date": "17/10/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41596, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baba Rahman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [83]}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [34], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [83], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamal Blackman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [54], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Micah Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran  Richardson", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carles Gil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Rudy Gestede", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Amavi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Bunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Ángel Crespo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chelsea’s players have been queueing up of late to pledge themselves to José Mourinho, doing their level best to douse suggestions mutiny is rife within the ranks, though this was the show of faith the manager really required. Business-like successes are to be savoured after an unfathomably shoddy start to the Premier League defence and a dismissal of a poor Aston Villa team can be cherished. The champions sacrificed their most creative talent here, ground out a performance and, at last, have some respite.\n\nJosé Mourinho welcomes win that puts brakes on Chelsea rumour mill | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nThere were flashes of their former selves offered up en route. Most of them were fleeting, admittedly, but flurries of quality were still more than enough to condemn Villa to a fifth league defeat in succession.\n\nDiego Costa, by his own admission overweight in pre-season after a summer back in Brazil, was more mobile and threatening for the right reasons as he returned from domestic suspension. This was him close to his authoritative best with indications, too, that Cesc Fàbregas’s radar is clicking back in. That combination had been key to this team’s lightning start to last term. Their telepathy appears restored.\n\nThrow in the energy of Ramires and a more comfortable display from Nemanja Matic following his introduction at the break and there was cause for optimism even if it took the exclusion of Eden Hazard to deliver the required stability. There was better balance to this lineup, central midfielders not venturing out of position to cover team-mates’ deficiencies on the flanks where Willian and Pedro worked feverishly and effectively. Hazard’s own quest for form has left him prone to defensive slackness. By sacrificing last season’s player of the year, Mourinho banked on a more functional side prevailing.\n\n“I left him out because we were conceding lots of goals and needed to defend better,” said Mourinho. “We need our midfielders to be concentrating on central areas, not worrying about compensating on the left or right. It’s like a blanket. If you pull one side, your feet are in the cold.”\n\nQuite how long Hazard – who did manage seven minutes off the bench – is shivering out in the wilderness remains to be seen but Chelsea’s predicament requires a creative talent who signed a new five-and-a-half-year contract in February to emulate Willian and Pedro, allying discipline to those mind-boggling flashes of skill.\n\nThe collective has to be put first at present. Ruben Loftus-Cheek discovered that much when his bright attacking display was checked at the break with the manager citing naivety out of possession as reason enough to prompt his replacement. It was a harsh lesson to be learned with this win merely a start.\n\n“Not a brilliant performance, but a solid performance,” said Mourinho, whose side had been presented with a first-half lead and benefited from a rare slice of luck when Costa’s second-half shot flicked from Alan Hutton’s calf and drifted inside Brad Guzan’s near-post with the goalkeeper wrong-footed and distraught.\n\nThe sense of crisis that lingered after the match swirled more intensely around the visitors whose manager, Tim Sherwood, had cut a helpless figure on the touchline. Chelsea always looked like a side who would eventually click into gear. There is simply too much quality in their ranks to anchor them in the bottom half for long. The same cannot be said of Villa.\n\nThis was by no means their slackest performance of term but, for all their use of the ball in midfield, they lacked bite up front to make any real impact. The visitors knew Baba Rahman was a weak link, but could not properly exploit the left-back on league debut.\n\nChelsea had conceded at least twice in all their top-flight games, with the exception of the home victory over Arsenal, but Villa had no weapons to wound them. Their best opportunity came when the contest was goalless, Jordan Ayew ambling easily away from Fàbregas and César Azpilicueta and squaring into the penalty area. Rudy Gestede had eked out a yard of space in front of John Terry, yet the striker was stretching when he poked at the ball with the outside of his right foot, his effort looping over the bar.\n\nWithin minutes they had self‑destructed. Guzan, under vague pressure from Pedro, scuffed a clearance awkwardly towards Joleon Lescott who was too startled to control the ball properly. Willian anticipated the error and stole away possession, darting free of the centre-half and into the area where he centred unselfishly for Costa to convert into an empty net. The sense of utter deflation on the visitors’ bench was palpable.\n\n“It was a poor one to give away, but mistakes are made and we have to stick together,” said Sherwood. “We carried the ball well, our full-backs got forward at the right times, we were a threat between the lines, and had good possession. We were in control of the football.”\n\nHe may not be in control of his own destiny. Had Villa been humiliated here then the axe may have swung. As it is, he staggers on hoping he will be able to generate form in time. “It’s a young group in transition,” he said. “I can’t rest my hat on them and say I’ve seen them having done it before in the Premier League, because they haven’t. But we’re upbeat in there. We are in a perilous position, but there were positives from that performance. I’ve had no indication that the clock’s ticking. But, as a manager, you need to win matches and, if you don’t, you’ll invariably lose your job somewhere along the line.”"}, {"date": "17/10/2015", "arena": "Selhurst Park", "attendance": 24812,

Lanzini and Dimitri Payet helped add another scalp to an already impressive high-profile collection. Here they enjoyed the luxury of an extra man for the entire second half after the referee, Mark Clattenburg, dismissed Dwight Gayle just before the interval. “Don’t ask me about the ref,” said the Crystal Palace manager, Alan Pardew.\n\nPredicting the outcome of a superb ding-dong between two in-form sides may have been a tough ask, but Gayle’s dismissal was not difficult to see coming. The Palace striker was in curiously spiky form, repeatedly moaning at Clattenburg, getting in pointless tussles and generally making a nuisance of himself in ways that only sometimes benefited his team. Once he had received his first yellow card, for flying in on Payet, it seemed a matter of when, rather than if, the second would come.\n\nThis contest began rich with the promise of intriguing sub-plots: Pardew hosting a club that had sacked him and Payet going toe to toe with Yohan Cabaye in what promised to be a fascinating battle of Gallic flair. One of Europe’s current stand-out creators, Payet was distraught at being overlooked by the France manager, Didier Deschamps, during the recent international break, and arrived here fully rested and eager to add to his staggering tally of goals and assists. He could have done so in the opening minute, stretching every sinew but coming up just short to poke a low cross from Lanzini wide.\n\nPalace dominated the early stages, but it was West Ham who drew first blood, Payet again at the heart of matters as he expertly found Victor Moses outside the penalty area. Spotting Carl Jenkinson steal in around Wilfried Zaha in the left-back position, the winger’s pass was inch-perfect and the full-back dispatched a low drive into the corner of the net.\n\nHis celebrations were abruptly curtailed as Palace restored parity almost from the kick-off, Jenkinson again in the spotlight as he took out Gayle just inside the Palace area. Cabaye’s retake to the top corner was nerveless after his first effort was disallowed for encroachment by the young man whose ongoing silliness would soon lead to an early exit.\n\nGayle’s second booking duly arrived just before the break, his impetuousness again getting the better of him as he fractionally mistimed a lunge on Cheikhou Kouyaté. This weird, ongoing aggression ruined an otherwise good performance from a player who can have no real grumbles about his fate.\n\n“Maybe the penalty incident was compounded on the second challenge,” said Pardew, who felt Clattenburg could have been more lenient. “Maybe the referee was frustrated with him. Maybe. That’s something I’ll look at and maybe speak to Dwight about.”\n\nAfter an action and incident-packed first half, the second was open but comparatively mundane, bringing with it Bakary Sako – on in place of Zaha in Pardew’s half-time reshuffle – and the ongoing reintegration into football society of West Ham striker Andy Carroll. In the 88th minute, it was he who climbed highest at the far post to expertly knock down a cross from Mauro Zárate and, when the pair’s fellow substitute Nikica Jelavic failed to scramble the ball home from six yards out, Lanzini popped up with a bullet from close range.\n\nGame almost over, but as ever-resilient Palace piled forward in search of an unlikely equaliser, it was not hugely surprising that the last word went to Payet. His deft chip over the onrushing Wayne Hennessey was worthy of the self-congratulatory salute that followed it at the corner flag."}, {"date": "17/10/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39553, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [22], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyias Browning", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Manchester United", "lineup": [{"name": "David De Gea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matteo Darmian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Smalling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marcos Rojo", "yellows": [52], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Morgan Schneiderlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [18], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bastian Schweinsteiger", "yellows": [50], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Juan Mata", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Ander Herrera", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [22], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Anthony Martial", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Rooney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [62], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Memphis Depay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michael Carrick", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daley Blind", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marouane Fellaini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jesse Lingard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andreas Pereira", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sam Johnstone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Wayne Rooney scored his first goal at his old Goodison Park stamping ground since 2007 as Manchester United brought an emphatic end to Everton’s run of success in this fixture. For the last three seasons, dating back to the defeat that opened Sir Alex Ferguson’s last campaign, United had lost here without even scoring a goal.\n\nThat a repeat was unlikely was obvious almost from the start. Everton were far below their best and United took a commanding lead before even a quarter of the game had passed. Roberto Martínez said in advance that United should not be underestimated just because of their setback at Arsenal and he was right. This was one of their most convincing performances of the season, although it must be said that an uncharacteristically lethargic Everton contributed to their own downfall.\n\n“We lost in a horrible way at Arsenal and we had to hold a lot of team meetings before this game,” Louis van Gaal said. “It was more than the response I was looking for, we controlled the game and played one of our best matches. We could have scored more goals in the second half.”\n\nMartínez did not disagree, though to his credit he declined to use the sadness within the club over the death of Howard Kendall as an excuse. “It would have been nice to turn it into a day of celebration,” he said. “But right from the start we were slow, and conceding the first goal affected us too much. We couldn’t see a pass forward, we became negative, we were not ourselves.”\n\nVan Gaal’s latest rethink on the United forward line involved sticking Anthony Martial out on the left, with Rooney up front and Ander Herrera tucked in behind in the No10 position. Rooney could not manage to get on the end of an inviting Matteo Darmian cross in the opening minutes but otherwise the system looked solid and United moved the ball around neatly in setting up some early attacks. Herrera came up with the game’s first shot on target, helping set up the opening goal when Tim Howard tipped his shot away for a corner. United played it short, and when Juan Mata eventually crossed Everton could not clear and Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo helped the ball on to an unmarked Morgan Schneiderlin at the far post. The French midfielder supplied an assured close-range finish for his first United goal.\n\nIf that was careless of Everton the situation worsened four minutes later when an incisive United break cut them wide open. Séamus Coleman was too busy fouling Martial to prevent Rojo galloping into space on the left wing, and when his measured cross came in there was no Everton defender within hailing distance as Herrera beat Howard with a firm header from near the penalty spot.\n\nTo be two goals to the good by the mid-point of the first half was almost an exact reversal of what happened to United last time out and Van Gaal could take some credit for his team selection. The returning Rojo and Herrera brought a freshness and drive United have sometimes missed. Neither was Martial wasted on the wing, where he provided a useful outlet and kept Everton stretched, while Schneiderlin’s influence in midfield suggested it might have been a mistake to leave him out at the Emirates.\n\nNot that Everton resemble Arsenal. On the evidence of this sluggish, laboured performance they do not even resemble the side that so confidently accounted for Chelsea last month. They created almost nothing, struggled even to retain possession at times, and only managed a serious attempt on goal right at the end of the first half, when David de Gea had to punch away Ross Barkley’s shot following a corner. By that stage United could have been three in front, for Martial should have scored when Rooney broke clear and unselfishly squared for his better-placed team-mate, only to see the teenager scuff his attempt at a tap-in and allow John Stones to get in the way.\n\nEverton brought on Arouna Koné for the ineffective Steven Naismith for the second half and he was quick to show he could be a better foil alongside Romelu Lukaku in attack. Aaron Lennon began to get more involved too, supplying a chance for Lukaku that De Gea saved with his feet as Everton attempted to get back into the game. A Barkley free-kick almost crept through until De Gea managed to reach it at the last moment, though had Everton pulled a goal back at that juncture it would have been controversial, the home side having gained possession by being awarded what was so clearly a United throw it brought Van Gaal to his feet with rage in the technical area.\n\nJust as Everton’s bid to snap out of their torpor was gaining momentum, however, it was curtailed by a third United goal that killed the contest. Everton had only themselves to blame. Phil Jagielka passed straight to Schneiderlin on halfway, Schneiderlin found Herrera in space, and with the Everton defence struggling to regain position Rooney indicated where he wanted the next pass played and stayed onside to receive it and stride into the area to beat Howard. With that strike Rooney drew level with Andy Cole in the Premier League scoring list, leaving only Alan Shearer out in front. He is more than 70 goals ahead though, and on the basis of Rooney’s attempts to add a second when he again found himself with only Howard to beat, Shearer should not be too worried.\n\nLike most with an Everton connection, Rooney had other things than goal records on his mind. “Of course I was happy to score, but this is a sad day for Everton,” the United captain said. “I would like to offer my condolences to Howard Kendall’s family.”"}, {"date": "17/10/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54502, "home_team": {"name": "Manchester City", "lineup": [{"name": "Joe Hart", "yellows":

was a day when Raheem Sterling offered a sweet answer to those who believe his finishing is powder-puff. By the break, the Manchester City forward had three goals to become the 11th player under 21 to net a hat-trick in the Premier League era.\n\nManuel Pellegrini said: “He is improving and I’m sure he will score more goals than when he played for Liverpool.”\n\nWith City’s big three of David Silva, Sergio Agüero and Vincent Kompany missing, Sterling showed precisely why he was purchased and the depth of quality the Sky Blues possess.\n\nWith Silva and Agüero already out having suffered injuries while playing for Spain and Argentina respectively, Kompany joined them as an absentee from the starting XI. The captain played for Belgium in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Israel despite a recent calf injury and his training was restricted on his return; a critical Pellegrini said: “Kompany was on the bench having only worked one day.”\n\nCity required only 11 minutes, though, to suggest the gilded trio would not be missed. They were 2-0 ahead, Sterling had his third for the club and Wilfried Bony a first of the campaign.\n\nSterling’s opener came when Fernandinho swept a diagonal ball on to Pablo Zabaleta’s head. He nodded the ball back into the danger area, Bony stuck a foot in and Sterling, hanging near Adam Federici’s right post, slotted the finish.\n\nBournemouth were trying to steady themselves when Pellegrini’s team doubled the lead. This was an untidy affair for Eddie Howe’s side. Bacary Sagna, operating at left-back due to Aleksandar Kolarov’s hamstring injury, pinged over a cross. Federici, fatally, spilt this, and Bony was ruthless. Federici was in the XI only because Artur Boruc felt “discomfort in a thigh” during the warm-up, Howe said, though he did not offer this as an excuse.\n\nWas this now to be the proverbial duck shoot for City? The answer, on the evidence thus far, seemed in the affirmative. But the defensive frailties that are often the corollary of Kompany’s absence cost the home team. Glenn Murray was the lone forward in Howe’s 4-5-1. He had seen close to nothing of the ball yet when possession came to him he ran at Eliaquim Mangala, the defender stood too far away, and he fired a 25-yard shot past Joe Hart.\n\nThat was 2-1 and only 22 minutes had gone. The game’s fourth goal arrived before the half-hour. This time all from Sterling was supreme. Kevin De Bruyne placed a lovely pass into the England man, who proceeded to skate past Steve Cook and Sylvain Distin, before shooting beyond Federici.\n\nGoing forward City were smooth operators; when the Cherries took the contest to them they could be disjointed. Nicolás Otamendi offered an illustration when up-ending Charlie Daniels. The Argentinian was booked and Matt Ritchie swung a free-kick at the home rearguard that dropped into the area and was awkward to repel.\n\nSterling’s first-half parade was about to be completed. The referee, Mike Dean, was in look-at-his-watch territory with half-time approaching when Hart hoofed a ball downfield. As Federici hesitated Jesús Navas received the ball and, after creating space, took aim. The rebound came off Federici to Sterling. With one of those feints defenders hate, he bought a fraction and banged the ball in for the hat-trick.\n\nSterling said: “It’s my first and I’m delighted. I get quite a lot of chances and it’s something I’ll keep working on and hopefully get better at.”\n\nFor the second period City lined up without Yaya Touré, who was replaced by Fernando. “It was not with Sevilla [in the Champions League] in mind, it was with Yaya in mind – to give him a rest,” Pellegrini said.\n\nIt made scant material difference to them when moving forward. Bony should have added a fifth when shooting at Federici but found the keeper’s gloves. Sterling also spurned a golden chance. Bony threaded the ball to him and the attempted rolled finish went wide.\n\nBony, did, finally, make it 5-1, to follow the 6-1 here against Newcastle. It meant City confirmed their status as leaders and Sterling could depart smiling broadly."}, {"date": "17/10/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30966, "home_team": {"name":

He ran a lot, pressed a lot, but also at the right moment was very, very clear to choose the best solution.\n\n“ I think only of Leicester. If Roy Hodgson wants him [at Euro 2016)] it’s good for him, good for Jamie, good for Leicester, good for everybody.\n\n“We have a good spirit, fantastic. To go down 2-0 is not easy, to recover. I have a very fantastic group. They believed everything could be possible.\n\n“We were desperate [in the second half]. I told the players: ‘If we lose 2-0, 3-0, 4-0, it’s the same, we’re still losing.’ They believe, our fans believe, and this is very important.”\n\nSouthampton had comfortably controlled the opening 45 minutes – Victor Wanyama was particularly effective in nullifying Leicester’s first-half threat – before struggling to react to the visitors’ intensity and eventual goals.\n\nRonald Koeman could be seen shaking his head at Leicester’s second goal, and was critical of Southampton’s game management.\n\n“You’re 2-0 up, it’s a good performance so far, and great goals from set pieces, but I have to recognise it was difficult,” the manager said.\n\n“Leicester showed great spirit, great belief, still after going two goals down.\n\n“We had best chance to kill the game from Sadio [Mané] but at 2-1 it was more difficult. Maybe [Leicester] were a little bit more fresh.\n\n“ Maybe they need to understand when you can build up [play], play the long ball. If you watch the second half we didn’t have good possession.\n\n“ We spoke about how we have to manage the second half, and we didn’t have the feeling that it’s over. We know they have unbelievable spirit and they’ve made it always difficult.”"}, {"date": "17/10/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24225, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [9], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Stéphane Sessegnon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum McManaman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [55], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Younes Kaboul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yann M'Vila", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [61]}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}], "subs": [{"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Liam Bridcutt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [61], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Graham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "That, Sam Allardyce, is the fine mess into which you have walked. This was a relatively tidy Sunderland performance and for a while they even looked like marking their new manager’s debut with their first clean sheet of the campaign, but then that costly hapless streak resurfaced and they found themselves in the familiar position of ending a match with no points.\n\nWhether Costel Pantilimon dropped the ball at the feet of Saido Berahino in the 54th minute because he was fouled by the striker – as Allardyce claimed – or because of his own clumsiness while attempting to reach around his opponent to cut out a cross, the challenge allowed Berahino to score a winning goal that Albion had not looked capable of scoring otherwise. And from which Sunderland never looked like recovering.\n\n“We’ll probably get a ticking off for surrounding the referee [Martin Atkinson] after the goal went in because you’re not supposed to confront the referee, but I can hardly blame them for that because the referee has made such an error,” said Allardyce. “It was not our fault that we lost the game, I thought it was his.”\n\nSunderland fans’ cheery endorsement of Allardyce’s appointment made the release of his autobiography happily timed, especially as, for now, the 60-year-old can still boast of never being relegated from the Premier League. Maintaining that record beyond this season could prove the stiffest challenge of a managerial career that began more than 25 years ago.\n\nSunderland, clad in green and hoping to see shoots of recovery, did at least make a bright start and the manager was pleased that a previously porous defence looked tight throughout, with Younès Kaboul performing competently on his return to the side, one of three changes that Allardyce made to the lineup that began the last match before Dick Advocaat stood down, a 2-2 draw with West Ham.\n\n“I was happy that I’ve stopped one of the biggest problems and that’s conceding 18 goals in eight games [before the trip to West Brom],” said Allardyce. “They never looked like conceding for the whole 90 minutes, which is a great platform for them to build on. The disappointment, though, was the lack of penetration in the second half with the possession we had.”\n\nIt was the home crowd who were disappointed at half-time, booing their team off after 45 minutes when only the visitors rose above bleakness. Sunderland were compact and coherent and, in Jordi Gómez – another brought back into the side by Allardyce – they had the game’s classiest midfielder.\n\nAlbion began less promisingly, with Berahino giving away possession in the first minute to allow Sunderland to send Fabio Borini racing free. The Italian put a dangerous low ball across the face of goal. Albion cleared that cross well enough but were far less assured 10 minutes later when shots from Lee Cattermole and Steven Fletcher brought desperate blocks. Boaz Myhill then had to make an excellent one-handed save to tip over a close-range diving header from Billy Jones after a corner by Gómez provoked an unseemly scramble in the penalty area. That, as it turned out, was as close as Sunderland got to scoring all day.\n\nAlbion had come into the game eager to show signs of improvement, too, as Pulis was castigated for the team’s meek showing at Crystal Palace in their last outing. Perhaps in an effort to refute accusations of negativity, the manager brought Stéphane Sessègnon back in for his first league start since early April. “I just fancied Stephane because he was playing against his old club,” said Pulis. “And he’s come in and done brilliantly.”\n\nTrue enough, the Benin international was one of Albion’s best performers and came closest to scoring for them before the breakthrough, firing wide from the edge of the area in the 21st minute.\n\nAfter falling behind Allardyce needed to introduce more incisiveness to his team, so replaced Larsson with Adam Johnson. But Albion, now infused with confidence, threatened to score again, Salomón Rondón poking another cross by Brunt wide at the near post.\n\nSunderland’s inability to muster any kind of forward momentum convinced Allardyce to replace Gómez with Jermain Defoe and try a slightly more direct approach. But Myhill was not bothered again."}, {"date": "17/10/2015", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20721, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [63],

season with an eight-match barren run and has now scored 10 in his last six games, a transformation from rut to glut that has assisted Arsenal’s rise to second in the league and offers some encouragement as they approach a daunting home game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League.\n\nThe Chilean, who has been troubled of late with a minor hip injury, spent the final 10 minutes of this game cossetted on the bench alongside Mesut Özil, creator of the first two goals, with the game won and thoughts turning to Tuesday. But though the match started with a 10-minute burst of attacking pressure by the away side and ended with them in total control, what came in between was not always so comfortable.\n\nWatford approached their four previous home games with such caution that a combined total of two goals were scored in what became a 360-minute improvised symphony of sterility. They played a different tune here and Vicarage Road duly witnessed more attacking action in the opening half-hour than in the previous two months combined. Aaron Ramsey, who clipped the bar after running on to Sánchez’s sublime chipped pass, came closest to scoring but the home side had their chances, with the previously deadeye Odion Ighalo, scorer of their last five Premier League goals, missing the most glaring after half an hour when he was played in by Ikechi Anya. But, having been so conservative against some less daunting opponents, this seemed like a dangerous occasion to start taking risks.\n\nWatford v Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nEtienne Capoue has enjoyed an outstanding start to his time in Hertfordshire following a club-record summer move from Tottenham, tasked with patrolling the space in front of his defence, breaking up opponents’ attacks and starting some of his own. In the 62nd minute he abandoned his position to surge forward, running towards Arsenal’s penalty area before throwing himself to the floor as Francis Coquelin challenged. He beat the turf in frustration when the referee waved play on, while Arsenal roared into the space he was no longer protecting. Moments later they were ahead.\n\nSanti Cazorla found Özil in the penalty area with a nice reverse pass and Nathan Aké’s desperate challenge could have brought a penalty had the ball not rolled to Sánchez, who scored. Twelve minutes later it was 3-0 and the contest was over.\n\n“It was very difficult to accept what happened after an hour, for before then we were in the right way,” said the Watford manager, Quique Sánchez Flores. “For a big part of the match we had chances, options to do something good. Arsenal won in 10 minutes. In these 10 minutes they killed us. Maybe we are a team that depends a lot on physical, because we have to make up a lot of quality. They have an amazing team, they challenge to win the league, and our class is different, our target is completely different.”\n\nFive minutes after the opening goal Aaron Ramsey’s weak shot deflected to Özil, whose low centre was turned in by Olivier Giroud, who had been on the pitch for barely three minutes after replacing Theo Walcott. And seven minutes after that Héctor Bellerín, who repeatedly troubled Aké, cut in from the right, hurdled the challenge from the on-loan Chelsea left-back and passed to Ramsey, whose shot deflected in off Anya.\n\nWatford might depend a lot on physical, to borrow from Sánchez Flores, but clearly their resources are only so deep: they have conceded one goal this season in the first half of matches, and nine now in the second.\n\nArsène Wenger said: “We started a little bit hesitant and Watford showed us that if we want to win the game we need to be completely committed. In the second half, with fatigue setting in, they were a little bit less in the challenges and we found we could attack.”\n\nThe Frenchman admitted he had been tempted to rest Sánchez after his efforts for Chile in South American World Cup qualifiers, only for his mind to be changed by a “very sharp” performance in training on Friday. “There are periods when a player is in a scoring moment,” he added. “To interrupt sometimes the flow can disturb this. And for us the best way to prepare for Tuesday is to win the game today.”"}, {"date": "04/10/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 39598, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyias Browning", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bryan Oviedo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mason Holgate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [35], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [41], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Bogdan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Rossiter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Goodison Park proved to be Brendan Rodgers’ last stand, as it was for Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea and David Moyes at Manchester United before him, though Everton could take no credit for Liverpool’s official recognition of failure. This was a sacking several months in the making.\n\nThe 225th Merseyside derby had been consigned to the growing file of the instantly forgettable when it was given a status it never merited by the announcement Rodgers had been sacked. A game low on incident, quality and purpose – from both sides – was rendered significant by the departure of the manager who came closer than anyone in the last quarter of a century to ending Liverpool’s desperate wait for a 19th league title. Ultimately, however, it was an appropriate finale for a coach who prided himself on developing a clear direction at Anfield but whose team have lost their way for several months.\n\nBrendan Rodgers sacked as Liverpool manager Read more\n\nIt was Rodgers’ performance in the post-match press conference that indicated he knew the end was nigh, rather than Liverpool’s display against a supposedly confident Everton. This was not a Liverpool team refusing to play for their manager but one short of confidence, cohesion, sharpness and the ability to leave their local rivals cowering. Just over an hour later, away from Goodison, Rodgers took a call from the president of Fenway Sports Group, Mike Gordon, informing him it was over. Ian Ayre, Liverpool’s chief executive, then arrived to explain the decision in person.\n\nHe must have known it was coming. “If we are to replicate what we did two years ago, we will have to build something. Unfortunately that will take time,” Rodgers said after the game. “That is frustrating for supporters but there are new players to come in. That will take time, whether that is me or someone else in the job.”\n\nLiverpool’s owners must take responsibility for the millions squandered replacing top talent with mediocrity but having seen the assistant manager Colin Pascoe and first-team coach Mike Marsh fall first in the summer, Rodgers knew he was on delicate ground after a miserable start to this season. Realistically he had to demonstrate clear signs of progress in the run of four consecutive home games against Norwich, Carlisle, Aston Villa and FC Sion. Three of the four ended with boos from the Kop.\n\nIt encapsulated the paucity of Rodgers’ final match that Martin Atkinson’s refusal to dismiss Lucas Leiva for a merited second booking was the main source of contention. “I don’t understand that decision,” said Roberto Martínez, whose side finished the stronger but were unable to punish Liverpool’s insecurities. Everton’s poor derby record now stands at one win in the last 18 contests.\n\n“Lucas was very clever. His technical fouls were clever but the second one was from behind and he should have been given a yellow card. We should have played against 10 men for the last 15 minutes.”\n\nDanny Ings marked his first derby appearance with a third goal in five appearances. The impressive Romelu Lukaku levelled quickly from the latest in a long line of Liverpool defensive errors, although Simon Mignolet was faultless on this occasion. The Belgium goalkeeper produced superb saves from Steven Naismith and James McCarthy, while in the opposition defence Phil Jagielka excelled in leading the inexperienced but talented trio of Ramiro Funes Mori, Brendan Galloway and Tyias Browning. All were making their first starts in a Merseyside derby, all impressed and Everton were indebted to Funes Mori for a vital interception on Daniel Sturridge with seconds remaining.\n\nLiverpool created five openings before Everton overcome their latest sluggish start. None were clear-cut but Tim Howard’s sliding tackle on James Milner, Jagielka’s well-timed challenges on Sturridge and Ings, Martin Skrtel’s free header over and Ings’ half volley reflected the flow of the opening exchanges. Howard also denied Milner at his near post following a neat one-two between the England midfielder and Philippe Coutinho.\n\nEverton exploded into life midway through the half. Mignolet produced a brilliant fingertip save to prevent Naismith burying Ross Barkley’s free-kick with a powerful header from 12 yards. Moments later he turned away McCarthy’s drive from the edge of the area after good approach work from the hosts.\n\nGoodison cranked into life when Emre Can and Barkley became embroiled in a daft spat over the ball and were the first players booked as a consequence. The derby finally had the atmosphere it deserved. Its opening goal arrived shortly afterwards when Barkley lost Ings at a Milner corner and, with Howard not dominating his six-yard area, the former Burnley striker was free to head home his third goal in five games from close range.\n\nEverton v Liverpool: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nLiverpool’s corner came after Gerard Deulofeu had needlessly lost possession in his opponent’s half, one of countless errors by the mercurial Spanish winger who did well to survive his substitution for 59 minutes. Yet his one positive contribution resulted in the tireless Lukaku equalising for Everton on the stroke of half-time. Deulofeu’s cross from the right wing was dangerous but should have been routine for Can once it sailed over Lukaku’s head. Instead, his clearance cannoned off Skrtel and the Everton forward did not waste the opportunity to find the bottom corner from eight yards out.\n\nThe timing of Lukaku’s seventh goal of the season tilted the momentum towards Everton in the second half but they failed to capitalise on several promising counterattacks. Barkley shot wide from distance, Lukaku tested Mignolet from a tight angle while Coutinho and Milner went close for Liverpool.\n\nMan of the match Phil Jagielka (Everton)"}, {"date": "04/10/2015",

picky and try to find one lingering complaint about the way Arsenal handed Manchester United this sobering reality check, it can be only that Arsène Wenger’s team should remind us of their brilliance more often. They chose a good time to produce their most exhilarating football this season and when Arsenal play this stylishly it just makes it all the more bewildering that they can exasperate so often and that considerable numbers of their supporters think the manager should be cut free.\n\nChristian Eriksen spurs Tottenham twice in 2-2 draw against Swansea Read more\n\nA team that were on their knees after the ordeal against Olympiakos last week delivered what Gary Neville once described as a “put-your-pens-down” kind of performance. At the same time, Arsenal turned down the volume on the fans who have been making the most noise about Wenger. In the Premier League years, no side has ever taken a 3-0 lead against United with such devastating speed. Arsenal managed it in a 20-minute blur of one-touch speed, penetration and movement when Alexis Sánchez, Theo Walcott and Mesut Özil seemed to take turns tormenting their opponents.\n\nThose three played in a way that made it feel as though they were immune to the pressures of the past week and Wenger must be congratulated for the way his players seemed free of any self-doubt. Sánchez’s improvisational brilliance to open the scoring was reminiscent of the airborne flick with which Gianfranco Zola once famously scored for Chelsea, darting to the far post and connecting with the instep of his trailing boot.\n\nHis flick in the build-up to Arsenal’s second goal was not too shabby either and the ovation for Walcott and Özil when they were substituted late in the match told its own story. Sánchez followed shortly afterwards and in those moments Wenger stood on the touchline and joined in the applause.\n\nLouis van Gaal, in stark contrast, was so disturbed by his team’s inaction he removed two of his summer signings, Memphis Depay and Matteo Darmian, at half-time. United’s manager also shunted Wayne Rooney out to the left for the second half in what could easily be perceived as the first clear sign of dissatisfaction with his captain’s diminished form. Marouane Fellaini was brought on to take the attacking role just behind Anthony Martial and, though there was an improvement, it never left even a remote sense a comeback might be plausible.\n\nInstead, Arsenal had enough of a lead to operate with restraint and try to pick off their opponents on the counterattack. They had set off like a team in a hurry and when they attack with this kind of fluency it is a reminder of everything that is attractive about Wenger’s ethos. Van Gaal’s oft-mentioned philosophy was made to look bland and colourless in comparison. No team can expect to defend this generously and get away with it. They were outworked as well as outpassed and the impression it left was United’s recent ascent to the peaks of the Premier League was deceptive in the extreme.\n\nThis was the first time they had encountered a top-four team and Van Gaal was as critical afterwards as any time as United manager, complaining there was “no aggression” and “no will to win”. The third goal was a case in point. Sánchez beat Darmian far too easily and the punishment for Juan Mata and Michael Carrick standing off was considerable. It needs something special to beat David de Gea from 25 yards and Sánchez, United’s tormentor-in-chief, duly provided it with a shot that was still rising as it flew into the top corner.\n\nUnited’s lethargy was almost bewildering given the potential early on for exploring whether their opponents might be of fragile mind. At one point Walcott chased back into midfield, dispossessing Bastian Schweinsteiger with a sliding tackle, and was then quickest to his feet to win the second challenge. Schweinsteiger might have a quick football brain but these are the occasions when his legs cannot keep up. Later, Walcott did something similar to the maladroit Rooney. Arsenal were quicker and sharper in everything.\n\nEven before scoring, they should have been awarded a penalty for Schweinsteiger grappling Gabriel to the floor and, before half-time, Sánchez’s perfectly weighted cross deserved a better finish than Aaron Ramsey managed when the Welshman had the chance to make it four. Martial’s neat spin and shot was thwarted by a sprawling Petr Cech save just before the interval but Rooney’s decline was evident again, Ashley Young was just as vulnerable as Darmian in defence and Depay can have few complaints about his early withdrawal.\n\nArsenal 3-0 Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\nSánchez’s first goal arrived after four minutes via Özil’s cutback and the replays on the big screen sent a second wave of appreciation around the stadium from those supporters who had not quite fathomed the fancy footwork on the first viewing. Sánchez pulled it off with the expertise of a man at the peak of his profession and it was another delicate touch that caught out United three minutes later. Sánchez’s flick left Walcott running at Darmian and Özil was waiting for the pass, side-footing a precise shot past De Gea from close to the penalty spot.\n\nUnited had not been three goals down this quickly since the opening day of the 1995-96 season at Aston Villa, when the goals all came in the first 37 minutes and Alan Hansen came out with his immortal line that you win nothing with kids. Twenty years on, it was almost a surprise Arsenal did not add more goals, the substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain coming the closest in stoppage time with a shot off the crossbar.\n\nArsenal had shown all their best traits and, just as pleasingly for Wenger, withheld all the worst ones.\n\nMan of the match Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal)"}, {"date": "04/10/2015", "arena": "The Liberty Stadium",

was on a personal quest for the match ball, but there was no mistaking the importance of the two that counted. Tottenham’s Denmark playmaker had not completed 90 minutes since 15 August, a knee injury hampering his early-season form, but two free-kick equalisers blew away the cobwebs here and ensured deserved parity for his team in a vibrant game characterised by swagger on the ball and defensive jitters off it.\n\nIt is a return to prominence that might take further weight off Harry Kane, who seemed to take a step backwards after breaking his league duck last weekend and compounded a tentative display by slicing a Jonjo Shelvey corner into his own net for Swansea’s second goal.\n\nIf Eriksen’s first, which levelled the match after André Ayew’s early header, owed a little to iffy positioning from Lukasz Fabianski, his second was a marvellously clean shot that arrowed inside the post beyond the goalkeeper’s dive. Had one of three efforts from open play that all flew inches wide also found the corner, it would have crowned one of this Premier League season’s better individual performances.\n\n“We know the quality he has in his shooting from free-kicks,” said Mauricio Pochettino of Eriksen, who scored a late winner in this fixture last season. “He’s a very professional player and I am very happy with him – not only because he scored the goals, but because of his commitment in attack and defence. He is a very important player for us.”\n\nSwansea had not defeated Tottenham in eight attempts since their promotion in 2011 but, stung by a winless September that saw their irrepressible early form tail off while their opponents’ gained speed, took the lead. Gylfi Sigurdsson had space to drive forwards and direct the ball left to Jefferson Montero, who was similarly unhindered in checking inside and chipping over a cross that Ayew leapt to head neatly across Hugo Lloris. Jan Vertonghen, jumping too late with Ayew, was slow to react and while the goal’s conception had been elegant its simplicity would have infuriated Pochettino.\n\nParity arrived 11 minutes later after Federico Fernández fouled the excellent Dele Alli just outside the penalty area. Eriksen’s free-kick was an unusual effort – a flat, wobbling strike that found a gap to the left of the wall and seemed to deceive Fabianski as he moved to his right – but had the desired result, nestling centrally in the net.\n\nWith Tottenham on the front foot a goal from Kane should have raised few eyebrows but the manner of his intervention, four minutes afterwards, was more in keeping with his afternoon. Shelvey’s left-wing corner was low and seemingly underhit although perhaps Kane, manning the near post, could sense Ashley Williams prowling behind him. The striker’s attempt to clear resulted only in shin meeting ball, which torpedoed into the roof of Lloris’s net from a matter of feet.\n\nThis was an absorbing spectacle, Tottenham probing away and Swansea generally content to wait their moment before countering through the busy Montero. Bafétimbi Gomis should have done better than head a mishit Sigurdsson shot into the side netting after the interval and was made to pay when Eriksen, after Alli had been fouled again in an identical area, cracked in his coruscating second goal.\n\nBoth sides could have won it in the remaining 25 minutes, Fabianski saving from Alli and the substitute Andros Townsend before, deep into injury time, Lloris arced to touch a looping Fernández header on to the bar. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the managers were at odds over the fairness of the outcome.\n\n“Maybe we dropped two points,” said Pochettino. “In the first half I was disappointed with the score – not the performance or effort, which were brilliant. But I think we played much better than Swansea and the only reason we didn’t win the game is that we lacked killer instinct in front of goal.”\n\nIt prompted Monk’s eyebrows to raise a notch. “They were never in the lead so I don’t know how you drop two points from that position,” he said. “Had we not conceded those two free-kicks we would probably have won the game.\n\nIt was a much better performance today, much more like ourselves.You could see that the passion and desire to win the game were massive.”\n\nMan of the match Christian Eriksen (Tottenham)"}, {"date": "03/10/2015",

They know better than most how effective Tony Pulis can be at nullifying opponents, their former manager having already done so expertly on his first return to Selhurst Park last season. Pulis was intent on reprising that performance, with Saido Berahino initially stationed out wide as part of a five-man midfield with instructions to protect a defence that was bolstered by the return to fitness of Gareth McAuley. That boon was somewhat offset in the 24th minute when McAuley’s international team-mate, Jonny Evans, had to limp off injured. Michael O’Neill, the Northern Ireland manager, who was watching from the stands, will find out on Monday whether Evans will recover in time for his country’s critical forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers with Greece and Finland and also has worries over McAuley, with a tight calf at the end of this match.\n\nEvans’ departure forced Pulis into another defensive rejig, introducing James Chester at right-back and shifting Craig Dawson to the middle. For a long time it looked like Albion might succeed in smothering their hosts, who hogged possession but found chances difficult to create.\n\nZaha always looked the player most likely to foil the visitors’ sabotage plot. He might have opened the scoring in the eighth minute, when he bypassed Brunt thanks to a one-two with Jason Puncheon but then skewed a shot into the sidenetting from 14 yards. Berahino was not enjoying trying to contain Zaha any more than Brunt was. He was flummoxed by one turn by the winger in the 21st minute, before Zaha pulled the ball back for Yannick Bolasie, who shot weakly at Boaz Myhill. Zaha made the goalkeeper work harder before the break, twice forcing him to repel fierce shots after runs past Brunt.\n\nApart from Zaha’s incursions, Albion were watertight. Pulis sought to plug the one leak and give Brunt better back-up by replacing Berahino with Craig Gardner at half-time. Zaha carried on regardless. Others began to join in more.\n\nPalace finally reaped the fruit of their creative labours in the 68th minute. Jason Puncheon did well to recycle the ball to Yohan Cabaye after Albion cleared a corner and the Frenchman floated a dainty cross over Dawson towards the back post. Bolasie crowned the move with a powerful header into the net. The Congo internationallooked to the heavens as he celebrated. “It was his father’s funeral on Thursday and maybe he was looking down on him”said Pardew. “He dedicated his goal to his father and it was a lovely moment.”\n\nAlbion’s challenge now was to be more adventurous but they never looked like rising to it. Two minutes from time the inevitable happened, as Brunt chopped down Zaha to concede a penalty. Cabaye converted.\n\nPardew hailed Cabaye’s influence and basked in the vindication of the player’s £12.8m summer move from Paris Saint-Germain. “He wasn’t getting a fair opportunity at PSG in my opinion,”says Pardew. “He wants to be a big part of his national side so the sell to him was easy because he knew I would give him big faith in terms of a platform. I hope everyone in France was watching him because he was excellent. I think the French manager told him ‘it’s very difficult to watch you when you’re not playing for PSG’ – he hasn’t got that excuse now.”\n\nPalace are also well worth watching. Albion at the moment?

The sense of drift and decay that stalks this proud club these days was deepened by a performance that began with a show of confused timidity before veering into insipid aimlessness and a frenetic but fruitless search for an equaliser against Stoke City, who pulled away from the bottom three thanks to a solitary goal from Marko Arnautovic, the game’s outstanding player.\n\nVilla’s increasingly disgruntled supporters seethed, booing when a corner was wasted in stoppage time, and Villa Park was verging on mutiny after the final whistle, Tim Sherwood and his players forced to endure a torrent of abuse as they disappeared down the tunnel. Sherwood’s team have picked up one point since winning at Bournemouth on the opening day and their fourth successive defeat leaves them in the relegation zone, four points below West Bromwich Albion in 17th place.\n\nSherwood is searching for inspiration and solutions, chopping and changing again in an attempt to locate the magic formula that will eradicate Villa’s many problems, but he admitted that he does not know his best team after a scattergun summer in which he signed 13 players and his questionable use of an awkward 5-3-2 system only lasted until half-time, Jack Grealish replacing Joleon Lescott.\n\nVilla’s manager wanted his wing-backs, Alan Hutton and Jordan Amavi, to provide ammunition for Rudy Gestede. Yet Gestede waited in vain for a decent cross and it was impossible to detect any coherent plan during a first half in which Villa’s only shot was a wayward effort from 25 yards by Idrissa Gana in the 39th minute. “They never opened us up to any great extent,” Mark Hughes said. The only worry for the Stoke manager was losing Mame Biram Diouf to a hip injury in the second half.\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, this was City’s second successive victory. They dominated and should have scored after four minutes, a slick combination between Bojan Krkic and Jonathan Walters releasing Diouf. Micah Richards saved Villa with a brilliant tackle.\n\nArnautovic caused problems for Villa with his wily runs away from Hutton and the winger was justifiably aggrieved when he had a goal incorrectly ruled out for offside shortly before the break. Replays showed that Arnautovic was level when he guided Bojan’s cross past Brad Guzan.\n\nSherwood bemoaned the absence of a player with “that maverick ingredient”, someone who can create chances and open up stubborn defences with a dash of class. He reverted to four at the back at half-time but Stoke remained in control despite Grealish’s introduction.\n\nThe visitors had more space to exploit and when Glen Johnson spotted a huge gap between Richards and José Ángel Crespo in the 55th minute, Stoke’s right-back slid an accurate pass through to Arnautovic, who turned and slipped a shot past Guzan, the ball hitting the inside of the left post and rolling over the line. Stoke deserved to be in front but the jolt of going behind stirred Villa from their torpor and they created their best chance moments later, only for Richards to send a header wide from close range.\n\nVilla’s effort could not be faulted. They battled furiously in the final 30 minutes and Sherwood took heart from their fight. Yet their desperation, not to mention their searing lack of quality, was encapsulated by a comical attempt by Richards to con Mike Jones into giving him a penalty near the end."}, {"date": "03/10/2015", "arena": "Vitality Stadium", "attendance": 11187, "home_team": {"name": "Bournemouth", "lineup": [{"name": "Artur Boruc", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Simon Francis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steve Cook", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sylvain Distin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Daniels", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Ritchie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dan Gosling", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Andrew Surman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Pugh", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Joshua King", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Glenn Murray", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [28], "missed_pens": [85], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adam Smith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yann Kermorgant", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Federici", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lee Tomlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eunan O'Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baily Cargill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Almen Abdi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juan Carlos Paredes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Víctor Ibarbo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alessandro Diamanti", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lloyd Dyer", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Giedrius Arlauskis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Eddie Howe was left frustrated as goalkeepers from both sides combined to ensure Bournemouth were held to a 1-1 draw at home.

A record scoring feat was all the more remarkable for being impossible to predict at half-time, when City were jeered off the field by their supporters.\n\nFor poor old Newcastle, still searching for their first win and in front for much of the first half, this outcome was even more cruel than Chelsea’s late comeback last week. At least they salvaged a point from that match.\n\nManchester City 6-1 Newcastle United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nHere, despite more than holding their own in a first half they shaded, they were blown away by a second-half explosion that came without warning. Four other players – Dimitar Berbatov, Andy Cole, Jermain Defoe and Alan Shearer – have scored five goals in Premier League matches and Agüero was quickest of the quintet by a distance. “We made mistakes and Agüero is a world-class finisher,” a disconsolate Steve McClaren said. “We showed some of our strengths but also some of our weaknesses. We have to toughen up, but City are probably going to win the league this year.”\n\nCity could have gone ahead in the first few minutes when Tim Krul could not quite hold a Kevin De Bruyne free-kick at the foot of a post. An almighty goalline scramble ensued but somehow Newcastle survived. A couple of minutes later Kevin Mbabu got in the way of a close-range Agüero header and that was all the home side managed to create in the first half-hour, despite fielding their first-choice attacking quartet for the first time in the Premier League. Considering the amount of money involved in bringing in De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling, City’s lack of penetration was a worry, particularly as Newcastle appeared capable of opening up their opponents with ease. Mbabu set up a chance for Aleksandar Mitrovic that Joe Hart had to be alert to foil, though the concern for City was that one decent ball into the area had left the Newcastle striker with only the goalkeeper to beat. That happened on a number of occasions in the first half.\n\nA couple of times City were reprieved by borderline offside decisions and Hart came to the rescue again by sticking out a leg when Mitrovic should have scored, so there was no question that Newcastle deserved the lead they took through exposing the uncertainty that afflicts this defence whenever Vincent Kompany is missing. First, Mbabu knocked the ball past Pablo Zabaleta on the left and confidently beat him for speed. Eliaquim Mangala managed to cut out the cross but only succeeded in setting up Georginio Wijnaldum to have another go and this time a better delivery allowed Mitrovic to beat Hart with a free header.\n\nThe only good news for City was that Newcastle did not add to their lead in the period when they were on top. As half-time approached the home side gradually clawed their way back, with first Agüero and then Fernandinho sending shots narrowly wide.\n\nAn equaliser finally arrived three minutes before the break, Fernandinho heading David Silva’s cross back across goal for Agüero to finish, yet there were still half-hearted boos as the players left the field. Not full-throated, angry dissent, just a low-level expression of disappointment. City are supposed to be better than this.\n\nNewcastle are winless at the bottom of the table yet they played the best football. It was no surprise when the ineffective Sterling was replaced by Jesús Navas for the second half, because it was exactly what some of the home fans had been demanding. It does not necessarily follow that the substitution changed the course of the game, for Navas was not immediately involved, and Newcastle contributed to their own downfall by dozily surrendering possession in their own half to invite Agüero to score a quick second. Nevertheless, a mere five minutes after the restart City were 3-1 in front and Newcastle were back on duty as cannon fodder. Silva, especially, seemed to come into his own once City had reorganised. “It was not a good day for Raheem,” Manuel Pellegrini said. “We needed a different way to try to penetrate, and David found more room in the second half.”\n\nManchester City’s Raheem Sterling: I did not say I was too tired to play for England Read more\n\nWhile there was a touch of good fortune about Agüero’s second, a deflection off Yoan Gouffran making life difficult for Krul when the goalkeeper might otherwise have had the shot covered, there was nothing streaky about the rest. The Argentine’s third goal came eight minutes after the first when he latched on to De Bruyne’s through-ball and instinctively lifted a shot over Krul.\n\nOn the hour the defence unwisely stood off the striker to allow a shot from the angle of the area with wholly predictable results before Agüero turned up on the end of a neat passing triangle involving Silva and De Bruyne to steer in a fifth.\n\nThe Agüero-fest was only interrupted when De Bruyne scored City’s fourth, arguably the best of the afternoon, meeting a Navas cross from the right with a perfectly executed volley.\n\nThere were more grumbles from the home fans when spoilsport Pellegrini withdrew City’s hero shortly after his fifth, though this time they were clearly intended in jest. Had he remained on the field against a dispirited Newcastle a Premier League record, if not double figures, might have been within reach. Wilfried Bony must have had decidedly mixed feelings about coming on as the follow-up act.\n\n“Kun is amazing, a player who can always make a difference,” Pellegrini said, before revealing Agüero had received treatment for a sore thigh during the interval. “It must have been a good treatment, yes?”"}, {"date": "03/10/2015", "arena": "Carrow Road", "attendance": 27067, "home_team": {"name":

The plaudits will go to Jamie Vardy, who scored for the fifth match in succession and took his personal haul to seven for the season, but the pacy England striker was by no means the only individual to impress as – having dominated for an hour – Claudio Ranieri’s side held off a late Norwich City fightback to take all three points.\n\nRanieri, who continues to give the impression of a man enjoying himself hugely, was full of praise for his players for the manner in which they put last week’s first defeat of the season, by Arsenal, behind them.\n\n“We were very, very determined to try and win the match, and we created a lot of chances, seven or eight, I think,” said the Italian. “We scored two, and had one that wasn’t good [disallowed], they scored one and, at the end, it was a big battle, a good English period – I love this kind of period. Every match in England, never it’s finished, you have to fight until the 96th minute.”\n\nOn the back of four games unbeaten, it was no surprise that Norwich manager Alex Neil’s only change was to recall on-loan winger Matt Jarvis, ineligible to play against parent club West Ham United last week.\n\nLeicester City’s Riyad Mahrez is fast fulfilling his late father’s dreams Read more\n\nSlightly more surprising, at least to those who did not watch the entire game against Arsenal last week, was Ranieri leaving the Algeria international Riyad Mahrez on the bench.\n\n“I knew very well how Norwich play, push a lot up the flanks, and I said OK, we start with a solid team,” was the explanation, and judging by a first half in which his goalkeeper, Kasper Schmeichel, was not required to make a save, the tinkering was spot on.\n\nIt was not long before Leicester’s pressing brought results, Marc Albrighton dispossessing Alex Tettey before crossing low. Shinji Okazaki, leaning back, headed over, but in a characteristically swift counterattack Vardy comprehensively beat Russell Martin before his attempt to slide the ball inside John Ruddy’s near post from a narrow angle was turned behind.\n\nLeicester should have taken the lead when Vardy flicked on a long Christian Fuchs throw soon afterwards, but Marc Albrighton miskicked and Danny Drinkwater’s shot was well saved by Ruddy. Minutes later, however, the visitors did get the goal their control of the game deserved, albeit in controversial circumstances. Vardy looked to have miscontrolled before going down in the penalty area under pressure from Sébastien Bassong, but the referee, Mark Clattenburg, decided the defender had clipped his heels first, and Vardy sent Ruddy the wrong way from the spot.\n\nLeicester’s only concern at half-time was not being further ahead, but they put that right immediately after the break. Jonny Howson, not for the first time, lost the ball in the Leicester half, N’Golo Kanté slipped Jeff Schlupp clear into the penalty area on the Norwich left, and the Ghana international had all the time he needed to roll a shot inside Ruddy’s far post.\n\nNeil made changes, as he had to, and the introduction of Dieumerci Mbokani alongside Jerome up front quickly paid off. The strongly built DR Congo striker, on season-long loan from Dynamo Kiev, first headed against the bar and then met Howson’s cross with a clever flick to register his first goal for the Canaries.\n\nLeo Ulloa, on for the ineffective Okazaki, saw a header ruled out for a shove, but Norwich, inspired by the dynamism of Mbokani, also went close in a frantic finale, leaving Neil frustrated with their first half showing.\n\n“Everything that happened today we spoke about and worked on in training,” said the Scot. “The players let themselves down in that first 45 minutes. Our use of the ball was poor, too predictable. I’d set us up to take advantage of them being a counter-attacking team, but we didn’t have their levels, and they punished us.”"}, {"date": "03/10/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 42932, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Costel Pantilimon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "DeAndre Yedlin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastián Coates", "yellows": [74], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John O'Shea", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Billy Jones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yann M'Vila", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Lee Cattermole", "yellows": [43], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jeremain Lens", "yellows": [32], "reds": [57], "own_goals": [], "goals": [22], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ola Toivonen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Fabio Borini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [10], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Patrick van Aanholt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Brown", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Larsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rodwell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordi Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jermain Defoe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vito Mannone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Adrián", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carl Jenkinson", "yellows": [72], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Tomkins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Winston Reid", "yellows": [24], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Aaron Cresswell", "yellows": [36], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheikhou Kouyaté", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Noble", "yellows": [2], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Manuel Lanzini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dimitri Payet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [60], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [58]}, {"name": "Diafra Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Darren Randolph", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mauro Zárate", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro Obiang", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Collins", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nikica Jelavic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [58], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michail Antonio", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Reece Oxford", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "When the final whistle blew, Slaven Bilic stepped straight over to Dick Advocaat and hugged Sunderland’s manager unusually long and hard. Then the Dutchman took a fleeting look around the four corners of the stadium, issued a brief wave and promptly turned on his heel before heading down the tunnel.\n\nHad he been an actor playing the part of a departing head coach, Advocaat would have absolutely nailed it. In reality the 68-year-old is set to walk into retirement after apparently resolving to leave the task of masterminding Sunderland’s latest relegation battle to someone else – he went so far as to bid his farewells to the squad in the dressing room after the game.\n\nSunderland in chaos as sporting director set to quit alongside Dick Advocaat Read more\n\nWhy else was he fighting back the tears after Jeremain Lens (later sent off) put Sunderland two up? “I’m always emotional after goals – we don’t score many,” he joked during a light-hearted press conference that had the air of a farewell briefing.\n\n“Yes, I have made a decision on my future,” he teased. “I don’t want to discuss my future now. Let’s wait and see.” In an earlier television interview he had described one of his team’s best performances of a generally wretched season as boding well for “the club in the future” but at other moments Advocaat used the word “we”. So was it still his team then? “It’s still my team today,” he replied. “And tomorrow.” Did that mean he might stay on longer? “No, I can’t say that.”\n\nHis West Ham counterpart is hoping for a U-turn. “I told him to stay,” said Bilic. “I would really like him to stay, he’s a man of knowledge and experience. It would be a pity and shame if he goes. I really hope he stays.”\n\nAny change of heart seems unlikely, with a scheduled training session for already cancelled.\n\nWith Advocaat doing nothing to contradict the impression he was preparing to bid Wearside goodbye, his players, initially at least, appeared to be mounting an 11th-hour attempt to win him back.\n\nSharper, slicker, hungrier and consistently half a yard quicker than West Ham during the first 45 minutes, Sunderland appeared to have undergone a most extraordinary makeover. Virtually un-recognisable from their underachieving recent selves, they reduced Bilic to a study in quiet technical area fury as they strove to secure a first Premier League win of the season.\n\nAdvocaat’s decision to leave Jermain Defoe on the bench and deploy Steven Fletcher as his lone striker in a new look 4-2-3-1 formation swiftly paid dividends. When Carl Jenkinson conceded a silly free-kick for a needless shove on Fabio Borini, Yann M’Vila slid it low towards Fletcher who had made a late dash into the danger area. With West Ham confused by John O’Shea’s decoy run the Scotland striker used his left foot to sweep the ball beyond Adrián.\n\nAcross in the dugout Advocaat remained impassive, standing in arms-folded mode as the stadium erupted in celebration. Finally, he unfurled his hands and gave a gentle clap. By the time Lens doubled Sunderland’s advantage though, the Dutchman looked tearful.\n\nThis time Dimitri Payet’s slapdash pass sold James Tomkins horribly short an Lens nipped in to assume possession. All that remained was for the winger to spot Adrián slightly off his line and produce a delicate lob which went in off the underside of the bar. Choruses of “Dick, Dick Advocaat” echoed around the ground.\n\nWith Adrián saving well from O’Shea and Borini directing a couple of decent chances agonisingly wide his side could have been four up by half-time but, instead, West Ham rallied. Spotting the home defence’s failure to cut out Victor Moses’s cross, Jenkinson steamed, unimpeded, into the area, his left-footed 12-yard shot proving too good for Costel Pantilimon.\n\nUndermining as that goal threatened to be, Sunderland – with Lee Cattermole impressing once again in a defensive midfield role alongside M’Vila – remained awkward opponents. Or at least they did until Lens saw red. A sly kick at the rear of Winston Reid’s legs prompted the winger’s second yellow card – and an early wallow in the Radox. “It totally changed the game,” said Advocaat.\n\nSure enough, Payet soon equalised. When Pantilimon could only parry a Manuel Lanzini shot he should have held, Payet was first to the rebound, his crisp dispatch redirecting it into the back of the net. Suddenly nerves corroded Sunderland’s reflexes. Yet if Nikica Jelavic spurned an inviting opening to win it for West Ham, Mark Noble was lucky to escape a second yellow card after obstructing Borini.\n\n“I was surprised by the way we played,” said Advocaat. “I’m very proud.”"}, {"date": "03/10/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41642, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

He has offered no answers out on the pitch as yet, with no formula struck to rekindle last season’s swagger. This team feel broken, none of which will have escaped Roman Abramovich, peering down from his box up in the Gods in the west stand.\n\nHis manager’s post-match challenge will not have gone unnoticed, either.\n\n“This is a crucial moment in the history of this club because, if they sack me, they sack the best manager this club has had,” he offered. “And the message again is that if there are bad results, the manager is guilty.” Yet Mourinho suddenly feels vulnerable, the memory of last season’s triumph fading fast.\n\nThat much is evident when two of last year’s stalwarts, Terry and Branislav Ivanovic, did not win a single tackle between them here. Self-doubt has infected even the most seasoned winners this club has ever had.\n\nThey were embarrassed here by a wonderful Southampton performance, the early lead enjoyed when Willian’s free-kick flew in off the woodwork nothing but a mirage. It took the visitors some time to find proper rhythm, but Ivanovic’s pull on Van Dijk could have earned them an immediate penalty, Ramires might have conceded another when he stepped on Mané’s foot, and Asmir Begovic did well to deny Ryan Bertrand. The hosts were eventually prised apart: José Fonte’s lofted pass was chested down by Pellè, free of Gary Cahill, and Davis tore on to the loose ball to crunch home a volley from distance. The Northern Ireland international had been ignored by Chelsea’s midfield shield, with Willian and Cesc Fàbregas dawdling. The error felt familiar.\n\nMatic’s introduction did little to stem the flow, with Mané such a menace and the home side constantly on edge. They cracked again on the hour mark while Mourinho was still chuckling in livid disbelief that Falcao had been booked for a dive as Maarten Stekelenburg slid in and made contact. When Cahill surrendered possession at the other end, Pellè eventually slipped a pass into space which Terry, stretching out his left leg awkwardly, failed to intercept. Mané rolled away from the centre-half and on to the ball, his finish flicking from Begovic’s glove to dribble into the net. Terry, crestfallen, buried his head in his shirt, a saviour no more.\n\nMourinho’s disgust at the non-award of the penalty was an acknowledgement of his own team’s vulnerability. “They are in such a low moment that they collapse,” he explained, with Hazard’s poor touch duly allowing Pellè to seal possession and liberate Mané. The Senegalese galloped upfield and had options both ways, but his clipped return pass to the Italian was ideal, Pellè thumping home his finish across Begovic to shatter what hopes remained.\n\n“We were the better team, had the better chances, and totally deserved the win,” added Ronald Koeman. That was an understatement even if the majesty of this win was rather buried beneath Chelsea’s utter mediocrity. Their title defence has endured a new nadir. The ramifications for the management could yet be grim."}, {"date": "28/09/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24240, "home_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [54], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [28]}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [41], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [28], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum McManaman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Gnabry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyias Browning", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [64], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [55, 84], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Darron Gibson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aiden McGeady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bryan Oviedo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [75], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Romelu Lukaku was greeted with warm applause by the West Bromwich Albion supporters before kick-off in recognition of his prolific service when on loan from Chelsea. He returned the compliment by prising a first home league win of the season from the grasp of Tony Pulis’s side and inspiring Everton to a remarkable victory.\n\nThere are no favours in the Premier League.\n\nJosé Mourinho questions Chelsea’s desire and wants answers at Porto Read more\n\nEverton were two goals down and second best when Lukaku scored 27 seconds after Craig Dawson had appeared to put the contest beyond them. It proved a turning point. The Belgium international followed with an assist for Arouna Koné before completing Everton’s first victory from a two-goal deficit away from home since 1985.\n\nBoth Lukaku goals stemmed from superb crosses from Gerard Deulofeu on the right while, in an inexperienced and makeshift Everton defence, the 19-year-old Brendan Galloway excelled. The positives and the performance were thoroughly unexpected after a flat opening from Roberto Martínez’s team.\n\n“Rom was a completely different player in the second half,” said the Everton manager. “The overall performance of the team in the first half was a little bit off. We were sloppy and sluggish. We didn’t react quick enough. But we reset at half-time and Rom, like every player, had a different intensity in the second half. Rom has the unique strength of being the man the team needs. He has an elite brain. When he puts his mind to it he can achieve anything.”\n\nWith Lukaku’s mind on taking his tally to six goals in all competitions this season Everton delivered a win that will massage confidence before Sunday’s Merseyside derby. It also demonstrated the improved resources at Martínez’s disposal with Koné and Darron Gibson impressing off the bench and several youngsters producing mature displays.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Video: Roberto Martínez praises Romelu Lukaku’s ‘elite brain’\n\nFor Pulis, however, his first managerial defeat from a two-goal lead was hard to take. Saido Berahino’s clinical opener was the only quality on show before the interval. Dawson’s header should have been the cue for victory but his team switched off and threw Everton a lifeline. “We were still celebrating without concentrating,” he said of Lukaku’s swift response.\n\nPulis added sourly: “We had good chances before our second goal but after that we switched off. It didn’t help that we lost Gareth McAuley to injury yesterday and Jonas Olsson after about 15 minutes. Their second goal was offside. Marginal but off, and I’m told Lukaku handled the ball in the build-up to their third. They’ve had the fortune and we haven’t.”\n\nAlbion’s confidence was high following last Saturday’s cherished win at Aston Villa, where Berahino had reintegrated himself in the best way possible with the winning goal, and they were offered encouragement by an inexperienced Everton defence. John Stones’s failure to recover from a knee injury sustained in the Capital One Cup victory at Reading meant a full Premier League debut for Ramiro Funes Mori, the £9.5m signing from River Plate.\n\nIt was the first time Martínez had started without his dependable axis of Stones and Phil Jagielka since a 5-2 defeat at Dynamo Kyiv in March and, with Seamus Coleman also failing to recover from a hamstring problem, Tyias Browning made only the second league start of his Everton career. “Only Phil Jagielka and Tim Howard were the two left to give any direction to the youngsters,” said Martínez. “It was incredible the way they coped. Brendan Galloway made a tackle in the second half [on Berahino] that was the difference between losing and winning this game.”\n\nFunes Mori started well only for the Argentinian’s composure to desert him during a careless spell before half-time. After embarking on a long run out of defence the 24-year-old lost possession to Dawson and Gareth Barry compounded Everton’s problems with a loose ball inside that picked out James Morrison. The Scotland international threaded a perfect pass into Berahino’s darting run into the Everton area and Howard was powerless to prevent a first-time shot finding the net.\n\nMore slack defending presented Albion with a second goal shortly after the restart. Both Jonny Evans and Darren Fletcher were granted free headers from a Berahino corner and, though the latter’s diving effort was heading harmlessly wide, the visitors’ defence cleared for another corner from the right. This time Chris Brunt delivered an inswinger, Dawson lost the over-employed Jagielka at the back post and steered a textbook header down and beyond Howard.\n\nAlbion celebrations were still in full flow when Lukaku hauled Everton back into the game with a towering header. The centre-forward had been on the margins on his return to the club where he scored 17 goals in the 2012-13 season but rose above the substitute James Chester to steer an excellent Deulofeu delivery past Boaz Myhill.\n\nLukaku created what should have been a decent opening for James McCarthy when he threaded a pass into the midfielder’s run into the box. The Republic of Ireland international took possession but also a pathetic dive over a non-existent challenge from Craig Gardner to earn a booking. The thoughts of the watching Ireland management team of Martin O’Neill and Roy Keane would have been illuminating. Martínez said: “I think James was expecting a challenge that didn’t happen. I don’t encourage my players to do that but mistakes happen. The referee handled it well.”\n\nBy now Lukaku had become the game’s dominant force. Turning away from two Albion defenders, the Belgian picked out Koné with another perfectly weighted pass into the area. This time the Everton player elected to stay on his feet and gave Myhill no chance with a powerful finish from close range. With six minutes remaining Deulofeu sent over another tempting cross and Lukaku stole in ahead of Chester again to beat Myhill at the second attempt. Rickie Lambert should have levelled in the dying moments but the former Liverpool striker shot wide from 12 yards. The comeback could not be contained."}, {"date": "27/09/2015", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20168, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [75]}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Almen Abdi", "yellows": [39], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [64]}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "José Manuel Jurado", "yellows": [70], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Juan Carlos Paredes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Aké", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [75], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adlene Guedioura", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Víctor Ibarbo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Berghuis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [64], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alessandro Diamanti", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Giedrius Arlauskis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Kelly", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brede Hangeland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [76], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [71], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [81], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [62]}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fraizer Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [62], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jake Gray", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Luke Croll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "“It’s just like Wembley again!” roared the away fans in the moments after the only goal, and they certainly had a point. When the teams last met, in the 2013 Championship play-off final, Palace had the better of the chances but scored only once, after Wilfried Zaha was tripped in the area by the Watford right-back, winning a penalty that was thumped into the top-left corner. This time, though the Hornets played better than at Wembley, the key moment was uncannily similar.\n\nAllan Nyom was the culprit on this occasion, the only question being whether Zaha was inside the box when contact was made. “It was a penalty,” insisted the Palace manager, Alan Pardew. “The ball was travelling just outside the line, I thought, but the point of impact was inside the box.”\n\nFrom the spot Yohan Cabaye went the same way as Kevin Phillips had at Wembley, with an identical result. Palace have now lost only one of their last 10 matches at Vicarage Road and sit sixth in the Premier League table, borne upon a tide of victories on the road. Pardew now has 11 wins in 14 away games as Palace manager, and three from four this season.\n\n“We’ve got good players for an away team because we’ve got pace,” he said. “I said to the guys today: ‘Let’s not retreat in any way today. Let’s take the game to Watford.’ It made the game very even in the first half, though not great entertainment. That made us grow in confidence and in the end we found some hot pockets, which we exploited.”\n\nThey had to work hard to find those hot pockets, rotating their attacking players with dizzying regularity. Jason Puncheon played on the right in the first half and as a centre-forward in the second; Bakary Sako started on the right, moved to the left, then to the middle and finally settled on the left; Yannick Bolasie spent most of the first half on the left and much of the second on the right.\n\nOnly Dwight Gayle, making his first league start of the season at centre-forward in the absence through injury of Marouane Chamakh and Connor Wickham, stayed in the same role, and his pockets were often the hottest of all. He had three excellent chances to score, all in the second half.\n\nThe first and finest came from Sako’s low cross from the left which Gayle reached only to somehow prod the ball on to the angle of bar and right-hand post. Heurelho Gomes truly knew his luck was in when the ball rebounded straight into his gloves.\n\nThen in the 78th minute Zaha – who had come on for Sako with half an hour to play – crossed deep from the left, Bolasie headed back to the near post and Gayle sidefooted narrowly wide.\n\nFinally, with six minutes remaining, Puncheon found him running clear on the left but Craig Cathcart got back in time to complicate matters, the eventual shot rolling wide. Palace had also created the finest chance of the first half, Sako winning a free-kick on the left with a comically over-dramatic reaction to Nyom’s touch, Cabaye sending it into the area and Gomes saving spectacularly from Brede Hangeland’s point-blank header.\n\nAs Watford’s supporters wonder where to calibrate their expectations for this season, one thing is becoming abundantly clear: they won’t be scoring an enormous number of home goals. The first four home games of their first season in the top flight, 1982-83, finished with an aggregate score of 15-1; this season it is 1-1.\n\nThey manufactured little more than half-chances here, with Palace’s centre-back pairing of Scott Dann and Hangeland expertly snuffing them out, and Joe Ledley protecting them from midfield where necessary. As Quique Sánchez Flores put it, when asked about the incident that led to the penalty: “We didn’t lose today because Nyom gave away a penalty, we lost because we didn’t play well and Palace were better than us”.\n\nWatford went close with two near-identical free-kicks either side of half-time, the first, from Almen Abdi, clipping the wall when apparently goalbound, the second from José Manuel Jurado thudding against the bar. The otherwise subdued Troy Deeney stretched to head the rebound over an empty net.\n\nTheir finest flurry of attacking play came after 54 minutes when Deeney headed to Odion Ighalo, who laid off to Abdi, whose low shot was well saved by Wayne Hennessey.\n\nBeyond that they did little but give Palace’s defenders opportunities to demonstrate their excellence. Hangeland stretched to clear the impressive Ikechi Anya’s low cross in the first half with Ighalo preparing to tap in, Dann intervened to prevent a certain goal after Ighalo spun on to Deeney’s knockdown moments after the goal and Ledley flung himself at Jurado’s 20-yard drive in stoppage time.\n\nThe game petered out amid a flurry of clumsy challenges and yellow cards, seven of which were shown in the last 20 minutes, with the visitors, to Watford’s familiar frustration, dictating the pattern of play.\n\nMan of the match Yannick Bolasie (Crystal Palace)"}, {"date": "26/09/2015",

season is beginning to feel suspiciously like it might have been a deception. It was easy to be reeled in after five straight wins but back-to-back defeats have changed the landscape at the top of the Premier League and, having begun the new campaign so exhilaratingly, their supporters must be startled about the speed at which everything has started to unravel and the shortcomings from last season have resurfaced.\n\nIt is certainly difficult to recall too many occasions since the Abu Dhabi money started to flood in that the modern-day City have defended so chaotically or looked so vulnerable. Manuel Pellegrini made a mistake entrusting Willy Caballero ahead of a new, experimental defence that was missing its usual centre-halves, and Tottenham gratefully took advantage once they had established their opponents had a soft underbelly.\n\nKevin De Bruyne and lavish Manchester City left chasing Tottenham’s shadows | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nIn the process, Harry Kane returned to the business of scoring goals for Tottenham, breaking a run that had gone over 12 hours and hopefully dispelling some of the more unfair scrutiny of his performances. City were obliging opponents for a player in the midst of a goal drought and Kane’s confidence should be soothed by that moment, on the hour, when Christian Eriksen’s free-kick came back off the crossbar and the England striker scored with an instinctive shot that was still rising as it hit the net.\n\nKane was actually offside when he struck the ball and it was a nice touch from Pellegrini to wait for the officials at the end and, showing great sportsmanship, shake everyone’s hand when many other managers might have been tempted to spread some blame. City were certainly entitled to be aggrieved because Tottenham’s equaliser, driven in by Eric Dier, featured one of the more obvious offside decisions that will be seen all season. Pellegrini, nonetheless, was correct not to heap all the responsibility on the assistant referees, acknowledging that his team had played “very badly” after the interval.\n\nThe only mitigation was that they were missing Vincent Kompany and David Silva, with Yaya Touré suffering a hamstring injury during the match. Sergio Agüero was not fit enough to last the full match and Pablo Zabaleta, another sturdy campaigner, has not played this season. Joe Hart could have started the match but was among the substitutes because of a minor injury and, in hindsight, Pellegrini will probably reflect the England international would have been a safer bet than his replacement. Caballero had a wretched afternoon, culpable in part for three of the goals, and clearly demonstrating why he has little chance of displacing Hart more regularly.\n\nPellegrini seemed bemused afterwards about what had gone wrong, offering little insight into his team’s deterioration and pointing out, justifiably, that they had looked bright and sharp during the opening period of the game. City had won eight of their previous nine league meetings with Spurs, with 27 goals scored and only eight conceded. They were also chasing a new club record of six successive away wins in the league and it looked entirely feasible when Kyle Walker lost the ball after 25 minutes, Touré surged 60 yards upfield and Kevin De Bruyne rifled a right-shot past Hugo Lloris to open the scoring.\n\nDe Bruyne was a fraction offside but it was nothing like as clear as the assistant referee’s error in the buildup to Tottenham’s equaliser, when it was barely plausible that the flag was not raised against Walker. The protests continued after the half-time whistle, when Martín Demichelis was shown a yellow card for his complaints, but the goal was still avoidable. De Bruyne, of all people, gave Dier the ball within shooting range. Caballero had just made a decent block to keep out Son Heung-min but he was slow to get back to his feet and never set himself for the possibility of a follow-up effort. De Bruyne’s pass to Fernandinho was misplaced and Dier was quick and decisive, his shot skidding across the surface and going in off the post.\n\nIt was strange to see a player of De Bruyne’s refinement make such an error but that kind of carelessness became a recurring theme for City in the second half, when it was difficult to believe they had not conceded a goal in their first five matches. Kompany was meant to be a substitute but had suffered another recurrence of his calf injury during the warm-up and, with Eliaquim Mangala also missing, the new centre-back partnership of Demichelis and Nicolás Otamendi lacked control and coordination.\n\nTottenham v Manchester City: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nAs for Caballero, he was stranded in no man’s land when Érik Lamela floated over a free-kick and Toby Alderweireld flashed in the header that gave Tottenham the lead five minutes into the second half.\n\nLater, when Lamela ran clear to score the home side’s fourth goal, almost in slow motion, there was the sight of Caballero stumbling at his feet, with Demichelis falling over in close proximity. City had conceded more goals in one half than their previous six league matches altogether and there might have been another if Son had not added another touch, from an offside position, to the substitute Nacer Chadli’s goal-bound header.\n\nKane did not look like a striker gripped by personal crisis – “If you want to stop asking about him now in every press conference” the Spurs manager, Mauricio Pochettino, politely suggested afterwards – and Lamela had possibly his best game in Tottenham’s colours. Spurs are still a work in progress but Pochettino noted afterwards they were also the youngest team in the league. “The potential is massive,” he said.\n\nFor City, Hart should return when they play Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Champions League on Wednesday but Pellegrini said Kompany would probably miss out and Touré is clearly doubtful. That must fill them with foreboding because, on this evidence, they are heavily reliant on a small nucleus of players and the back-up options are a considerable downgrade."}, {"date": "26/09/2015",

team to complete a Premier League season without defeat, perhaps Arsenal saw it as some kind of duty to tick off the division’s final unbeaten record. Leicester’s run fell when they came up against a team who matched their willingness for attacks at the highest velocity and added a layer of sophistication.\n\nHarry Kane off mark as Tottenham’s second-half surge stuns Manchester City Read more\n\nArsenal also had Alexis Sánchez back to his best. The Chilean has, understandably, been tired and flatter than his most exuberant self after spending the summer winning the Copa América. But here the full sparkle was back. His first hat-trick for the club, at a stadium where visiting players are not used to profiting, was emphatic proof of that. His performance blended energy and imagination to such effect even Claudio Ranieri felt compelled to purr afterwards. He slipped into his native Italian for the right compliment. “Meraviglia,” A wonder. “The ball and him are born together.”\n\nSánchez had been searching for a goal since his FA Cup final special. Wenger was delighted to see that element of his game return, having seen the signs of improving sharpness in training. “He won a big competition with Chile. Mentally to adjust again to a competitive level when you come back takes some time.” At the end of a week when the definition of world class was in the news, Wenger has no doubts that Sánchez qualifies.\n\nIn seeking the right word to sum up the Leicester style recently Ranieri simply went: “Whoosh,” and this match was played by both teams in the spirit of whoosh football. But for all the verve that Leicester could offer, Arsenal found more. It made for a compelling spectacle.\n\nThe essence of what makes this Leicester team tick flourished in all its glory. Bloody-minded defending was switched to a rapier attack in the blink of an eye. It was fast, committed, exciting and – most crucially of all – superbly efficient. N’Golo Kanté dispossessed Aaron Ramsey, who seem to feel the challenge, and the ball was manoeuvred forward brilliantly by Danny Drinkwater. Jamie Vardy, oozing belief, headed the ball smartly to set it into his path before sweeping sweetly past Cech. The happy souls in the King Power Stadium erupted.\n\nIt could have become worse for Arsenal before it became much better. Vardy threw his hands to his head in disbelief when a super chance to double the lead bounced off the frame of the goal.\n\nArsenal replied with a break of their own. Santi Cazorla, Sánchez and Mesut Özil were all involved, and when the ball came back to Cazorla he made a fine threaded pass to Walcott. The left-foot finish faded beautifully into the far corner.\n\nThe feeling persists that the England man needs a run of games to really show his credentials as a central striker. There were other chances that did not quite work out but his movement was excellent and Arsenal feel like a faster counterattacking team all round with him as the focus of such efforts.\n\nChelsea rescue a point against Newcastle with late comeback Read more\n\nAnother high velocity break took Arsenal ahead. They regained possession in their own area (leaving Vardy unimpressed as he tumbled over Laurent Koscielny) and were away. Özil’s reverse pass for Héctor Bellerín opened Leicester up. Although Walcott could not get a clean contact on the cross, the ball fell kindly for Sánchez to slide in his first of the season.\n\nSánchez looked desperate to score more, constantly making a nuisance of himself with his darting runs. He was rewarded with his second, designed by a peach of a lobbed pass – signature Özil – and finished with a dinked header. Wenger enthused about the German’s contribution but also offered an interesting aside: “The little frustration I have today is he couldn’t score. He is really upset, he needs a goal as well.”\n\nSánchez’s hat-trick was sealed in sensational style. A shrewd touch took him into position to lash early in at Schmeichel’s near post.\n\nCech was commanding to ensure there was not enough of a grandstand finish. But such is Leicester’s desire to be comeback kings, they did throw plenty at Arsenal late on, and Vardy manufactured another excellent finish.\n\nThe visitors threw back more, and the substitute Olivier Giroud coolly struck Arsenal’s fifth, the endnote to a remarkable game.\n\nRanieri was phlegmatic. “We are sad because we wanted to continue to be unbeaten. But when you play against Arsenal, United, Chelsea, City, it’s extra. It is important to learn something. What is very important is the reaction in the next match. We are down. But our spirit must be very high.”"}, {"date": "26/09/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44228, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [2], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daniel Sturridge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [59, 67], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kolo Touré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Lallana", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Allen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Bogdan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Micah Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Amavi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [60]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Idrissa Gueye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rudy Gestede", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [66, 71], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Veretout", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [60], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adama Traore", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carles Gil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Bunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The magnitude of his 164th game as Liverpool manager did not show in Brendan Rodgers’ reaction to a precious victory over Aston Villa.\n\nA handshake for Tim Sherwood, a pat on the back for Gary McAllister, a thumbs-up to the directors’ box and he was gone. Reprieved and relieved by the much-missed class of Daniel Sturridge.\n\nLiverpool’s Brendan Rodgers hits out at ‘campaign’ to get him sacked Read more\n\nRodgers has waited a damaging length of time for Sturridge to regain fitness and the clinical touch his team has desperately lacked this year. He was repaid when it mattered most, the England international scoring twice to seal a first win in five league matches after James Milner had driven Liverpool into a swift lead.\n\nOf course it could never run smoothly for a manager in Rodgers’s predicament. He endured unnecessarily nervous moments after poor defending allowed Rudy Gestede to score twice and give Villa hope their naive and careless play scarcely deserved. But Liverpool, sharper in all facets than of late and showing the obvious benefit of a proven marksman in their ranks, held firm to release some of the pressure on Rodgers.\n\n“It is not rocket science,” said the Liverpool manager. “The last time we scored three goals was when Daniel started against Tottenham [in February].\n\n“If you want to compete at the top you need quality. Daniel has shown in his time here that he is a real top talent. He’s probably disappointed he didn’t get a hat-trick but his overall game and touch were outstanding. He also showed a great combination with Danny Ings in the first time they have started together.”\n\nRodgers went on to suggest he is victim of a conspiracy by people “outside of here” who want him removed from his job.\n\nWhen the emotions had faded, it was Sherwood who was left with the greater problems given the paucity of his team’s performance. A young Villa side have not won in the Premier League since the opening day.\n\nThe Villa manager said: “We will always score goals and if you score two at Anfield you expect to take something from the game but we didn’t do that. It was the same against Leicester. That is a major disappointment but it is something I expected. It is a young group of players we acquired. The club decided it was the best way to go forward. I am very privileged to have the chance to work with them but it comes with its ups and downs and you can see that now.”\n\nYou’ll Never Walk Alone may have started on a bum note – because of a problem with the pre-match music – but mercifully for Rodgers his Liverpool team did not. A goal on 66 seconds from Milner, the stand-in captain’s first for his new club and the quickest in the Premier League this season, provided the perfect release for a besieged manager and frustrated crowd.\n\nLiverpool found the precision and space that eluded them in midweek against the League Two side Carlisle United in their opening attack. Two Aston Villa midfielders, Carlos Sánchez and Idrissa Gana, abandoned their station – and Milner – to charge at Philippe Coutinho when he took possession in central midfield. The Brazilian threaded a pass through to the former Villa player and, with no one near him, Milner controlled before driving a low shot inside Brad Guzan’s left-hand post from 18 yards. The sense of relief around Anfield was palpable. “The last thing I told the players as they left the dressing room was to keep it tight,” said Sherwood.\n\nGestede headed wide from Jordan Amavi’s cross but otherwise Villa’s brightest moments in the first half stemmed from Liverpool errors. Emre Can cleared a routine cross from Alan Hutton back into the danger area and to Gestede on the edge of the penalty area. The former Blackburn forward lacked composure and lashed wide. Ashley Westwood went close after Simon Mignolet tamely palmed another Hutton cross into his path.\n\nArsenal’s Alexis Sánchez hits treble in destruction of Leicester City Read more\n\nThe Kop did not disguise its displeasure at Mignolet but their worries appeared to ease when Sturridge scored his first goal since March. Milner operated in a more advanced role against his old club, often at the expense of the deeper Coutinho, and created the second when he received Sturridge’s lay-off and flicked the return over the Villa defence. The England international had continued his run and swept a fine left-footed volley beyond the stranded Guzan. It was the first time Liverpool had scored more than once in a game since May.\n\nVilla were gifted unlikely hope when Mamadou Sakho, Martin Skrtel and Mignolet all left Hutton’s cross from the right and Gestede arrived to convert at the back post. Sakho raged at his goalkeeper, leaving no doubt over where he felt the fault rested, while Rodgers despaired in his technical area. Seconds later Sturridge restored Liverpool’s two-goal lead.\n\nThis time he played a one-two with Coutinho on the edge of the Villa area before stroking a confident finish into Guzan’s left-hand corner.\n\nThat should have sufficed for Liverpool but a fourth goal in 13 minutes, from Gestede once again, set up a nervous finale for the Anfield crowd. The Benin international headed for goal the instant Amavi shaped to cross from wide on the left and was first to the full-back’s delivery when it arrived in the area, towering above Sakho to steer a powerful header beyond Mignolet.\n\nCoutinho, Sturridge and Ings all missed decent chances in the dying moments but Liverpool deservedly secured victory and Rodgers a lifeline."}, {"date":

current Premier League round top for the first time since Six Alex Ferguson left the team as champions in May 2013 following this stroll of a victory. United have led the competition three times since Ferguson retired, but only due to playing before other sides and were subsequently overtaken. Now, Louis van Gaal’s team will spend at least a week as the leaders and as Wayne Rooney ended his league drought on 999 minutes with United’s second this was a satisfying day all round.\n\nLiverpool see off Aston Villa as Daniel Sturridge hits double Read more\n\nGiven Manchester City’s September capitulation – they are to close the month with one league victory – and Chelsea’s struggles, United deserve to be at the summit and to be taken seriously as contenders to claim a 21st title.\n\nThis was a game Van Gaal’s men might have claimed by a larger margin given their near-total domination. In Daley Blind and the ever-convincing Anthony Martial the men in red had the contest’s outstanding players.\n\nMartial’s first contribution was some dazzling footwork that drew a free-kick to the right of the visitors’ penalty area. Juan Mata swung this in but failed to clear the first man and the ball was hit away.\n\nWhen Memphis Depay took possession near Costel Pantilimon’s goal moments later he had a chance to display the balletic touch of Martial but failed and another opportunity was spurned.\n\nSunderland began like a team who were bottom and winless and who would end the afternoon with these facts unchanged. As the quarter-hour passed Dick Advocaat’s side had barely kept United out of their half. Younès Kaboul perhaps offered a snapshot of why Sunderland are in peril on 21 minutes. From the left, with no pressure on him, the French centre-back whacked the ball straight out.\n\nAt this point, carelessness seemed contagious. Matteo Darmian, operating at left-back for the day, sprayed what should have been a simple cross out. At the other end, United’s defence slumbered and Jeremain Lens was allowed to hit a shot at goal that David de Gea saved well.\n\nAs the clock ticked to 31 minutes gone Rooney was less than a quarter of an hour from reaching the 1,000-minute mark with no Premier League goal. In addition to this unwanted run the captain had thus far been becalmed. An illustration came when he could have turned the defence but the pass was overhit.\n\nThere was only precision in the sublime way Blind created United’s opener. The Dutchman sliced Sunderland open with a dipping 35-yard pass that was akin to a quarterback finding a wide receiver as it anticipated Mata’s path. The Spaniard squared the ball first-time and Depay finished for his maiden league strike in United colours.\n\nThis came deep into added time at the close of the half and Van Gaal said: “I was very happy with the goal in extra time because they punished themselves. They were always wasting time and the referee was not reacting to that.”\n\nArsenal’s Alexis Sánchez hits treble in destruction of Leicester City Read more\n\nInside the first minute of the second half came a moment Rooney should recall when his career his long over. A 235th goal in United colours came thanks to Martial who bounced a couple of defenders off him and crashed the ball across the six-yard box. Rooney’s knee did the rest and the drought clock was stopped.\n\nNow came an instant reminder to United to remain focused. Yann M’Vila dropped a free-kick into a melee near De Gea and the latter was forced to save sharply. Further evidence that the Spaniard is unaffected by the Real Madrid transfer farrago came when Patrick van Anholt raced clear. De Gea stayed calm and, when the attempt came, he saved comfortably.\n\nPerhaps what impresses most about Martial are his choices. Just as the teenaged Rooney knew when to shoot and when to pass, so, too, does the Frenchman. On 66 minutes he raced clear with the ball and Depay alongside him. The No9 might have continued the run but instead found the Dutchman and he should have done better than shoot into Pantilimon’s midriff.\n\nJuan Mata sealed the victory, and United’s status as frontrunners, with a late third.\n\nOf a fifth loss from their seven outings Advocaat said: “The problem was they scored one minute before half-time and one minute after half-time. It’s a shame we gave that goal away in the first half because it made things different in the second half. United were the better side but they didn’t create a lot of chances.”\n\nVan Gaal’s men now have 16 points, one more than City."}, {"date": "26/09/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance":

appointed as Swansea’s first-team coach, is to sharpen the strike force of Garry Monk’s side. The former England forward has had his work cut out for him in recent weeks, as Swansea arrived at St Mary’s on the back of three games without a goal. Gylfi Sigurdsson did finally find the net for them here, but only from the penalty spot after the match was all but lost.\n\nCheikhou Kouyaté denies Norwich City with late equaliser for West Ham United Read more\n\nA team that is blunt up front better be robust at the back but in the 11th minute here, Swansea were infiltrated in the most basic fashion. After another returning ex-Saint, Jack Cork, failed to keep track of Virgil van Dijk from a corner, the Dutch centre-back headed James Ward-Prowse’s delivery into the net at the near post.\n\nThe goal was fair reward for a bright start from the home side, although the clearest chance before then had fallen to the visitors after Maarten Stekelenburg parried a long-range shot by Jonjo Shelvey into the path of Ki Sung-yueng. The Korean sent his subsequent shot way over the bar, in the process probably booking himself into extra finishing lessons with Beattie next week. Mind you, Ki did threaten to score in the 23rd minute when a better long-range effort almost squirmed under Stekelenburg.\n\nSouthampton’s finishing could also do with some polishing. Graziano Pellè and Sadio Mané both miskicked when in promising positions early on. Last week Saints were eventually punished for missing chances to go two up after taking the lead against Manchester United and the agitation of Ronald Koeman on the sideline suggested the manager dreaded a repeat here. He need not have worried.\n\nAfter a first half in which Southampton were well on top, thanks in particular to the midfield dominance of Victor Wanyama, Monk made two substitutions seemingly intended to give his team more width and punch. But it did not work. Éder, introduced at centre-forward instead of the ineffective Bafétimbi Gomis, gave an early indication that his sights might not be finely aligned by whacking a 25-yard shot over by about the same distance.\n\nLiverpool see off Aston Villa as Daniel Sturridge hits double Read more\n\nNo one at Swansea will appreciate the irony of what happened in the 54th minute, when Ki finally helped the ball into the net, inadvertently deviating a cross by Dusan Tadic into his own goal after a flowing move featuring a fine looped pass by Pellè.\n\nThings quickly got worse for Swansea and much better for Southampton, who had the pleasure of watching Ryan Bertrand play a key role in their third goal on his first start of the season after injury. The left-back led a counterattack just after the hour mark before playing a low pass to Pellè, whose weak shot was deflected by Ashley Williams to Mané. “I thought he was the best player on the pitch,” said Koeman of Bertrand. “He had no pre-season, was out for three months, then to play like that was great.”\n\nKoeman was less pleased with his team’s overall display, saying: “Maybe it was the best game of the season clinically wise, as we didn’t create a lot of chances but we scored three times, but the performance was not very good. But maybe I’m too critical.”\n\nMonk was more so. “That’s not good enough from us,” he said. “There was uncharacteristic decision-making and errors that we never do and that’s costly at this level. Southampton deserved to win the game for sure but they didn’t play us off the park, it was more down to us not being at the right levels. I take responsibility for that and will ensure we put it right.”"}, {"date": "26/09/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27742, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack

They look unbeatable away from home in the league but here their record reads one win, two defeats, and now one draw – even if this point garnered at the death felt like a victory. It was a game that could have gone either way, with a plethora of chances for both sides, but after Nathan Redmond’s 83rd-minute goal had looked like giving the visitors three points Cheikhou Kouyaté responded in the third minute of injury time to ensure a share of the spoils.\n\nCanary saves pigeon: Norwich’s Jonny Howson rescues stricken bird Read more\n\nFor Norwich City it was another decent result on the road, added to last Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Liverpool. Though they have won one of their past 15 trips in the top flight, the Canaries have lost once away from Carrow Road since Alex Neil took charge last season. “It was a great game, both teams wanted to attack,” he said. “I was really pleased with the lads but when you concede with a minute and 30 seconds left you’re going to be disappointed. That’s the overwhelming feeling in the dressing room.”\n\nIt is increasingly difficult to put your finger on what Slaven Bilic’s West Ham are exactly about. Becoming the fourth team in the Premier League to win away at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City in the same season brings an inevitable and perhaps uncomfortable level of expectancy. Again they appeared listless for the opening half-hour of a home game before getting their act together.\n\n“It was a fair result,” the former Croatia manager said. “We are never happy when we don’t win at home but this point makes me proud. The players showed character and quality.”\n\nRobbie Brady’s opening goal can be filed under needless concession after Mark Noble passed across his defence instead of clearing from a throw-in. His ball towards James Tomkins was too soft. Brady nipped in and with Tomkins sliding desperately in an attempt to retrieve possession the Norwich player advanced, sending a low finish past Adrián.\n\nWest Ham looked sluggish and allowed Norwich to control the tempo but profligacy stopped the visitors from extending their lead. Jonny Howson volleyed narrowly over having wandered into the box unnoticed and Cameron Jerome found the side-netting after Brady cut the defence open.\n\n“They were disappointing [misses] but when you look at the game as a whole, I’m really pleased,” Neil said.\n\nThe home supporters were growing restless, but their side levelled after 33 minutes. Diafra Sakho spotted Dimitri Payet free to his right and hooked a pass to the Premier League’s new king of assists. Payet strode down the flank before sending a low cross in. Sakho’s run was timed to perfection and he coolly slotted home.\n\nHarry Kane off mark as Tottenham’s second-half surge stuns Manchester City Read more\n\nWith their tails up, Manuel Lanzini went inches from putting West Ham in front with a 25-yard free-kick and he had a pot shot that almost deflected in off Russell Martin.\n\nNorwich remained a live danger and Howson was denied from 25 yards by Adrián’s fingertips early in the second-half. Adrián also made a brave save with his face to deny a point-blank strike from Jerome, described by Bilic as “unbelievable”.\n\nAt the opposite end Sakho went close with two headers and Payet and Kouyaté missed the target, but with the clock ticking it was time to shuffle the pack. Andy Carroll was flung on in place of Lanzini and joined Sakho up front.\n\nBut it was a Norwich substitute who made an instant impact. Redmond’s low effort taking one hop en route to the bottom right corner after Wes Hoolahan’s pass allowed him the chance to dribble into the box and pick his spot.\n\nWest Ham went close twice in the final minute of normal time but just as hope began to fade, Kouyaté was on hand to bundle home with his right foot after a scramble following a Payet free-kick where Carroll got in the way of

Chelsea one was nearly back on again here. Steve McClaren started this game as arguably the Premier League manager under most pressure following the reaction of Newcastle supporters to the tamest of exits from the first cup of the season. He came within 10 minutes of passing much of that burden on to José Mourinho, whose Chelsea side once again looked pallid and likely to slump to a fourth league defeat, before a remarkable late recovery left the home side hanging on just to earn a point.\n\nJosé Mourinho slates Chelsea for awful performances in Newcastle draw Read more\n\nMourinho deserves some credit for his substitutions, for Ramires came on to pull the first goal back and was crucially involved in the equaliser, even if he failed to get anything on the Willian free kick that ended up in the back of Tim Krul’s net. Eden Hazard was the real spark of Chelsea’s fightback, however, and the travelling fans must have made their way home wondering why he, and their team in general, only showed any spark in the final few minutes.\n\nPerhaps it was the shock of finding themselves two goals down to Newcastle that spurred Chelsea into action, and the slightly depressing news for the home side was that once the visitors began to mean business they could not live with them. A draw was a fair result in the end and, if Newcastle were left deflated at the final whistle after coming so close to picking up their first league win, at least they showed some of the fight and application their manager had demanded. If they can keep playing like this, they should be climbing the table before long.\n\nMcClaren made five changes to the side beaten by Sheffield Wednesday’s reserves in the Capital One Cup in midweek, and asked the inexperienced Kevin Mbabu, a right-footed central defender, to play at left-back against the defending champions.\n\nMbabu only made his Newcastle debut in the cup game in midweek and, on his first Premier League start, he found himself marking Pedro. In fairness, he kept the former Barcelona player quiet for most of the game. Chelsea stuck with the side that beat Arsenal last week apart from the one enforced alteration, replacing the suspended Diego Costa with Loïc Rémy, booed from the start after his period on loan here two seasons ago.\n\nHarry Kane off mark as Tottenham’s second-half surge stuns Manchester City Read more\n\nRémy might have put his team ahead with the first real chance of the game after Branislav Ivanovic fought his way to the byline and crossed from the right, but the ball came to him quickly and his stabbed shot from the six-yard line flew harmlessly wide. McClaren had made an impassioned plea for fight from his players after the Wednesday horror-show and, in the first part of the game, the home side showed it. Georginio Wijnaldum took on and beat Ivanovic down the left to send over a cross that Aleksandar Mitrovic reached with his head but could not keep on target, then on Newcastle’s next attack Moussa Sissoko advanced to the edge of the penalty area and rolled a shot narrowly wide of Asmir Begovic’s goal. McClaren’s players deserved the vocal backing they were now getting from the crowd, for they were putting up a decent show.\n\nMbabu incensed Mourinho by upending Pedro right in front of the dugout, but otherwise Newcastle were matching their opponents fairly, with Jack Colback and Vurnon Anita winning most of the midfield contests. From a move that Colback started, Ayoze Pérez brought the first save of the game from Begovic, quickly followed by another stop by the goalkeeper when Daryl Janmaat carried the ball into the area. It took a last-ditch block by Gary Cahill to halt another Janmaat run and, as the interval approached, it was possible to argue Newcastle had enjoyed the better of the game. There was no real end product though, and Chelsea almost made their hosts pay for over-adventurousness in attack when Chancel Mbemba was caught in possession much too far up the pitch, creating a hole in central defence into which Cesc Fàbregas strode to bring a diving save from Krul.\n\nWith Chelsea obviously so dangerous on the counter, Newcastle were probably thinking they needed to cash in on their overall supremacy with a goal before half time, when one arrived from nowhere with three minutes to spare.\n\nActually it arrived from Anita’s long, diagonal ball into the Chelsea area, but there seemed no obvious danger until Ivanovic and Kurt Zouma left it to each other and allowed Ayoze a free shot at goal. He took one right foot touch to bring the ball down then a second to beat Begovic via the inside of an upright, with the two Chelsea defenders practically standing back and applauding\n\nWayne Rooney ends drought against Sunderland as Manchester United go top Read more\n\nIf that soured Mourinho’s mood at half time it would not have improved when Newcastle increased their lead from a set piece on the hour, again taking advantage of hesitant Chelsea defending. It is hard to believe a defence featuring John Terry would have allowed Wijnaldum to score with a soft header from a corner but, when Ayoze’s cross came over, the Dutch forward met little resistance when guiding a stooping header into the bottom corner.\n\nMourinho sent on all his substitutes and Ramires pulled a goal back with an unstoppable drive after Hazard had finally managed to impose himself on the game by deftly cutting in from the left.\n\nThe Belgian came to life after that and was Chelsea’s best hope in the closing minutes, but Mbemba threw himself in the way of Hazard’s best chance of an equaliser.\n\nYet Chelsea kept coming, and Newcastle were finding it hard to repel the blue tide. Two substitutes combined for the final goal, when Newcastle gave away a free kick on the edge of their area, with Ramires distracting Krul and Willian claiming the goal.\n\nIt saved Chelsea from embarrassment, though the harsh truth for Newcastle is that had the match lasted another 10 minutes there might not even have been the consolation of a point."}, {"date": "20/09/2015", "arena": "White

a new one. The South Korean forward, signed from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer for £22m, followed up his two goals in the Europa League with the winner in this scrappy derby as Mauricio Pochettino’s side recorded their first home win of the season in the Premier League.\n\nSouthampton v Manchester United: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nThe Spurs manager must have known this victory was just as much down to the heroics of Hugo Lloris. The France goalkeeper produced an early contender for save of the season to deny Sako less than three minutes before Tottenham’s goal, having earlier saved the Palace winger’s first-half free-kick. But as a sea of fans sporting Son’s No7 shirt thronged outside the car park to celebrate their victory, Pochettino revealed the extent to which their new signing had gone to ingratiate himself with his new team-mates.\n\n“You can see that Son’s a very friendly boy and this week he brought some Korean food into the training ground. It’s very good – like Chinese or Japanese. I like a lot. I had a big dish,” said the manager. “He was fantastic. The energy that he showed was amazing and for that I think the supporters were very happy with him. Son is a player that we have followed for a long time. He can play No9, No10, No7 or No11 – all the different positions up front. When a new player arrives the expectation is always very big but he has settled in very well.”\n\nJust as the Tottenham squad were tucking into their lunch on Friday, Palace’s hopes of recording a ninth win in 11 Premier League away games under Alan Pardew suffered a blow when the defender Scott Dann picked up a calf strain in training. The partnership of Brede Hangeland and Damien Delaney coped manfully with the initial onslaught, with Harry Kane still struggling to replicate last season’s blistering form as he wasted a couple of decent opportunities on the rebound.\n\nPalace could have found themselves in front in the 37th minute had Lloris not been on hand to turn away Sako’s accurate free-kick, while Yohan Cabaye was desperately unlucky to have a shot cannon off the post on the stroke of half-time. Yet it was another miraculous save from the Spurs captain that proved to be the turning point in a week when Pochettino had praised Lloris’s loyalty after interest from Manchester United in the summer.\n\n“Going forward we weren’t as good as we usually are but the goalkeeper was probably man of the match to deny us with two saves which probably changed the course of the match,” Pardew said. “I could argue that we should have done better in certain things but they are the margins that you’re dealing with in this division. We’ve won three and lost three of our first six and, if you look at the fixtures, I don’t think that’s a bad return really. But it could have been so much better. We must lean on that part of it and, with a little bit of improvement, we could find ourselves competing at the top of the division. I don’t want to be in the mid-table – I told the players after the game – it’s not for me. I don’t want to be there. We’re better than that.”\n\nPardew had riled some Tottenham supporters in the buildup by suggesting that they “will definitely finish in the top 10” this season. Palace achieved that feat themselves last season and the challenge for the former Newcastle manager now is to pick up his players from successive defeats, starting with a Capital One Cup derby against Charlton on Wednesday.\n\nFor Pochettino, there was the satisfaction of ending a run of one win in five at home in the Premier League as his side moved level on points with Palace in the table. The manager dispensed with his usual matchday attire of tracksuit and trainers and instead donned a smart suit in the home dugout – a move he attributed to the fact that his parents were due to be watching the game on television at home in Argentina.\n\nBut with Eric Dier and Dele Alli – the summer signing from MK Dons – outclassing Palace’s experienced duo of Cabaye and James McArthur in central midfield, there is now plenty of cause for optimism among the Spurs supporters after a slow start to the season.\n\n“I’m not surprised by his progress. It’s in his character and personality,” Pochettino said of Alli. “We need to take it step by step because he is young and the Premier league is not easy. But he is very mature.”\n\nMan of the match Son Heung-min (Tottenham Hotspur)"}, {"date": "20/09/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44072, "home_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name":

"report": "Russell Martin had driven through the night to attend the birth of his son in Norfolk, caught a plane back to Merseyside with Delia Smith and other Norwich City directors shortly before kick-off and then, after a sleepless 24 hours, scored to give Alex Neil’s team a merited point at Anfield. Yet it was Liverpool who laboured and their supporters who were taken to the point of exhaustion.\n\nManchester United’s Anthony Martial sparks comeback win at Southampton Read more\n\nHalf-hearted boos rang from the Kop on the final whistle after Brendan Rodgers’ desperate wait for a victory extended to a fifth game. Familiar failings undermined a display that was an improvement on recent offerings, a low benchmark admittedly. Weak goalkeeping from Simon Mignolet and a lack of concentration at a set piece enabled the Norwich captain to equalise Danny Ings’ first goal for his new club, while poor finishing and fine goalkeeping prevented Liverpool adding a second for the 18th time in their past 20 outings. Anfield’s patience is being stretched.\n\nIngs’ tireless, aggressive contribution as a second-half substitute was the main plus for Rodgers but, despite changing personnel and formation, and the return of Daniel Sturridge, his wait for the return of Liverpool’s identity goes on. Norwich were composed, well-drilled and, though indebted to John Ruddy on occasions, well worth their point on the road.\n\n“We created enough chances to win the game,” the Liverpool manager lamented. “That disappoints but the most disappointing factor was the goal.\n\n“That was their first corner. We lost concentration and Russell Martin hooks it in. That shouldn’t happen but there were a lot more positives from the game. Today was a step forward for us in terms of the creativity and hopefully progress will come from that.”\n\nAnfield was flat, the opening half-hour especially so, but it would have been much worse for Rodgers had the referee, Anthony Taylor, applied the strict letter of the law and dismissed James Milner after four minutes.\n\nLiverpool’s captain in the absence of the injured Jordan Henderson received an early booking for a foul on Cameron Jerome and then tumbled theatrically inside the Norwich area having evaded a challenge from Robbie Brady. Taylor did not fall for Milner’s attempt to win a penalty nor did he book the midfielder for a dive that prompted a furious response from Brady. The polite interpretation was that Taylor adjudged Brady’s tackle to have affected Milner’s balance and gave the England international the benefit of the doubt. Or he just avoided making a huge call.\n\nNeil said: “If you are going by the letter of the law, then it may have been the case [for a second yellow card] but I would be really disappointed if my player had been sent off for that. It would have been harsh.”\n\nSturridge’s first start since 8 April and the overdue selection of Mamadou Sakho in place of Dejan Lovren enthused the home crowd more than Liverpool’s first-half display. Despite his touch being inevitably rusty after so long out, Sturridge’s pace and movement brought more intent to Liverpool’s game, although Philippe Coutinho was often strangely overlooked in the No10 role. Sakho followed his performance in Bordeaux with another accomplished outing as Norwich enjoyed sustained spells in the final third without seriously testing Mignolet until their equaliser.\n\nLiverpool were slow in possession until the introduction of Ings for Christian Benteke, nursing a tight hamstring, sparked some urgency. Ings’ running and alertness suited the home side’s approach better than their £32.5m summer signing from Aston Villa and, within three minutes of entering the fray, the former Burnley forward had his first Liverpool goal.\n\nSon Heung-min scores only goal in Tottenham win over Crystal Palace Read more\n\nMartin played his team into trouble with a careless pass to Alberto Moreno, who swept a first-time ball over the top. Ings had read the Spaniard’s intentions perfectly; taking the ball on his chest, the 23-year-old ran clear of Sébastien Bassong and rolled a fine finish under the otherwise commanding Ruddy.\n\nIt should have been the platform that Liverpool craved. Instead they handed Norwich an equaliser when Mignolet made a hash of dealing with a Brady corner and allowed Martin to atone for his earlier error. The Liverpool keeper came for the cross but punched weakly to the visiting defender who lofted a cool shot over the stranded Belgian. Matt Jarvis should have edged Neil’s men ahead but shot straight at Mignolet from close range and Coutinho squandered a glorious chance when sent clear by Emre Can. The Brazilian was caught in two minds as Bassong backed off to cover Ings and ultimately he sent a poor shot straight at the Norwich keeper.\n\nNeil said: “I am pleased not just with the result but with the performance too. We were brave, we tried to put our foot on the ball and play out from the back. You need to ride your luck at a place like this and rely on your goalkeeper who made some great saves, but we could have nicked it at the end when Matt Jarvis had his chance. I thought we deserved the draw.”\n\nMan of the match John Ruddy (Norwich City)"}, {"date": "20/09/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 31588, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup":

as a pair of predatory goals from Anthony Martial, one from Juan Mata and several fine saves by David de Gea earned a victory that sent Louis van Gaal’s side up to second in the Premier League table.\n\nThere is no precedent for any teenager trying to justify an initial investment of £36m in his talent but Martial is going about it in expert fashion, his two sharp finishes on his first Premier League start taking his tally to three goals in two league appearances since his record transfer from Monaco. The French youngster radiated elegant menace whenever United could bring him into the reckoning, which was not quite as often as they would have liked. If Martial’s signing seems shrewder by the week, hanging on to De Gea in the face of ardent wooing by Real Madrid looks equally crucial.\n\nOn a bright afternoon on the south coast Van Gaal spent most of this match using his left hand as a sun visor but he may have been tempted to drop it down to cover his eyes completely during the first half-hour as events on the pitch made for grim viewing from a United perspective. Southampton were dominant in every department.\n\nSouthampton’s Sadio Mané shows what Manchester United lack in No10 role Read more\n\nRonald Koeman had suggested that Graziano Pellè’s power could prove particularly useful against Daley Blind, whom Van Gaal chose to deploy at centre-back, with Marcos Rojo replacing the injured Luke Shaw at left-back. As per the Southampton manager’s prediction, Pellè bullied Blind from the start but that was not the only duel that the hosts were winning: Matteo Darmian could not contain the tricky Dusan Tadic and was replaced by Antonio Valencia at half-time while all of United’s defenders, especially Rojo, were flummoxed by the elusive movement and deft trickery of Sadio Mané.\n\nPellè outmuscled Blind wide on the right in the 10th minute before crossing for Tadic, who exchanged passes with Mané and then drilled a low shot wide from the edge of the area. One minute later Tadic bypassed Darmian and delivered a cross from the left that Rojo diverted behind before the impressive James Ward-Prowse could convert from close range. Van Gaal claimed afterwards that his side had defended well from the outset but that seemed a disingenuously blue-sky assessment. It was no surprise when United fell behind in the 13th minute.\n\nMané began the move from deep, flipping a pass out wide to Ward-Prowse before dashing into the box and getting on the end of the winger’s cross. De Gea saved the shot from the Senegalese but Pellè stroked the rebound into the net.\n\nFragile at the back United were flat and ineffective going forward. Wayne Rooney, deployed just behind Martial on his return from hamstring injury, was presumably supposed to be playing a role similar to the one that Mané was fulfilling for Southampton but England’s record goalscorer was barely visible throughout the match.\n\nSouthampton nearly made it 2-0 two minutes after opening the scoring. Mané again personified the difference in the teams by harassing the sluggish Chris Smalling into surrendering possession. Oriol Romeu slipped a pass through to Pellè, who turned past Blind and fired a low shot past De Gea but against the outside of the post.\n\nWith United looking meek, there was an air of desperation to the visiting supporters cries of “Attack! Attack!”‚ which were aired as early as the 22nd minute. Martial strained to head a cross from Mata over the bar in the 24th minute but United were generally showing little sign of being able to placate their fans until, suddenly, they drew level in the 33rd minute.\n\nSouthampton allowed an innocuous ball into the box to run to Mata, who, possibly from an offside position, helped it on to Martial. The striker duped Virgil van Djik with a feint and slotted into the net from eight yards.\n\nThat goal transformed the match. Southampton’s vim waned, United gained poise and assertiveness. They took control in the deliberate, possession-based manner their manager demands.\n\nLiverpool let lead slip to Norwich as Martin cancels Danny Ings’ opener Read more\n\nFive minutes into the second half Maya Yoshida turned inadvertent assister to Martial, playing a casual back pass into the striker’s path. The teenager finished like an ace marksman, wrong-footing the goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg as he rolled the ball in from 10 yards. United won this fixture last season after José Fonte had made a similar blunder and the recidivism angered Koeman. “We have to learn,” he fumed.\n\nSouthampton were not entirely deflated. Mané, who was showing why Van Gaal had been keen in the summer to add him to his list of expensive recruits, pressured Blind into conceding a corner in the 59th minute and from Tadic’s delivery Fonte powered a header that would have brought an equaliser but for a magnificent save by De Gea, who clawed the ball off the line.\n\nThis United is not inclined to pummel opponents. Rather they seek to oppress them gradually. Occasionally they produce incisive flourishes, however, and one led to them increasing their advantage in the 68th minute. After 43 passes Bastian Schweinsteiger slipped the ball through to Memphis Depay, who twisted wickedly past Fonte and fired a low shot off the post. The rebound came to Mata, who finished from 14 yards.\n\nFour minutes from time Southampton served a reminder of their qualities – and United’s frailties – when Mané crossed from the right and the unmarked Pellè headed into the net from eight yards. But De Gea preserved United’s lead with two more high-class stops.\n\nMan of the match Anthony Martial (Manchester United)"}, {"date": "19/09/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41584,

Yet the more serious repercussions came in the form of the goal from Kurt Zouma that gave Chelsea their lead and, from that point, everything quickly unravelled for Wenger’s team.\n\nDiego Costa should have been sent off himself, says Arsène Wenger Read more\n\nArsenal were down to nine men when Eden Hazard’s deflected shot sealed the victory in stoppage time and there was certainly no debate about the validity of the two yellow cards for Santi Cazorla – one on Pedro just after the half-hour and another for clattering Cesc Fàbregas after 79 minutes – that meant the away side finished in disarray. With 10 men, Arsenal had barely threatened to find a way back into the match. With nine, their chances were somewhere between minimal and nonexistent.\n\nHazard’s late effort took a lucky ricochet off Calum Chambers and this felt like the day Chelsea shook their heads clear after their worst start to a top-division season since 1986. Mourinho’s decision to leave out Chelsea’s captain, John Terry, in favour of Zouma was justified by the younger man’s display. The champions kept their first clean sheet of the league season and, presumably, they will like to think they can still clamber back into the reckoning for another title. It is just a pity, perhaps, that the origins of this victory were so unsatisfactory and, by now, we should know enough about Costa to suspect he will reflect on that unpleasant little exchange with Gabriel as accomplished centre-forward play.\n\nCosta spends so long trying to pick fights and disturb the opposition there was always going to be someone who took the bait. More fool Gabriel that he was the one. Yet there was not a great deal to admire about Costa’s behaviour and, unless Mourinho can tell us otherwise, there seems to be absolutely no desire within the club for him to change.\n\nIt was a squalid incident laced with cunning and Gabriel, as Wenger admitted, was daft in the extreme to be drawn in. Costa’s initial intention was to get under the skin of Laurent Koscielny, swiping him across the face with the accidental-on-purpose style that forms part of a well-rehearsed routine. Koscielny swung him to the ground and, from that point onwards, it was an exercise in calculated skulduggery. Costa chest-bumped Koscielny with enough force to put the defender on his backside and, though Gabriel’s initial role was to get between the two and act as peacemaker, it quickly descended into a separate argument.\n\nBoth players were shown a yellow card but continued chuntering at one another all the way back to the centre circle until Gabriel, with his back to his opponent, flicked out his leg in a way to signal his irritation rather than actually hurt Costa. Gabriel was on his feet but the way he brought back his boot was reminiscent of David Beckham’s sending-off against Diego Simeone in the 1998 World Cup. It was a straight red card and Costa’s plan had worked.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gabriel is restrained by his Arsenal team-mates after his red card, with Diego Costa in the foreground. Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images\n\nWenger decided to remove Francis Coquelin at half-time because the player was suffering a knee injury. Arsenal were suddenly without their one naturally defensive midfielder as well as being a man down. Calum Chambers replaced Coquelin and went into Gabriel’s position in defence but it was probably inevitable that the reorganisation would leave Arsenal vulnerable.\n\nNewcastle hopes of getting back on track sunk by Watford’s Odion Ighalo Read more\n\nEight minutes into the second half, Chelsea had a free-kick 30 yards from goal. Fàbregas, who showed glimpses of his old self, clipped the ball into the penalty area, Zouma lost Nacho Monreal at the far post and Petr Cech, on his return to Stamford Bridge, could not keep out the downward header.\n\nArsenal could be forgiven for linking everything back to the red card but it is also true that Wenger’s men had lost their momentum after an encouraging start during which Alexis Sánchez was a difficult opponent for Branislav Ivanovic and Theo Walcott’s speed and directness posed problems. Arsenal began like a team that quickly wanted to explore whether Chelsea’s confidence might be a little brittle. The passing was crisp and the movement was good but they lacked real presence in attack and, though Chelsea took a while to get going, the home side had the greater threat in attack.\n\nCosta created all sorts of legitimate problems – “man of the match” Mourinho announced – and Hazard put in an improved performance, even if he was still somewhere short of last season’s exhilarating standards. His shot flew in off Chambers and Wenger, having reluctantly shaken Mourinho’s hand at the start, was straight down the tunnel at the end."}, {"date": "19/09/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 36321, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alan Hutton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Micah Richards", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Amavi", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carles Gil", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Ashley Westwood", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Carlos Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Jack Grealish", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Sinclair", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Gabriel Agbonlahor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Ciaran Clark", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leandro Bacuna", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Cole", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Veretout", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mark Bunn", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rudy Gestede", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Evans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chris Brunt", "yellows": [21], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [78], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [34], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Saido Berahino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [39], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [67]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [90]}], "subs": [{"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Chester", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [67], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [90], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum McManaman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Anders Lindegaard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Gnabry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Scoring goals is the best way to make supporters forgive and forget. West Brom fans sang Saido Berahino’s name with gusto after their man claimed the goal, 17 days after threatening to go on strike, that accelerates his rehabilitation with supporters who know their place in football’s hierarchy.\n\nAlbion fans – “We know who we are” – are not too proud to embrace a talented young striker who reverted to the more positive meaning of the word on his recall to the side, having being in the wrong frame of mind to play during Tottenham’s pursuit at the end of the transfer window.\n\nIn the fixture that ignited Tim Sherwood’s reign at Villa Park last season, now it was Berahino’s turn to glimpse renaissance, leaving Villa to reflect on their worst start to a season since 1986-87 – the last time they were relegated from the top flight – three days before their next derby, against Birmingham in the Capital One Cup.\n\nSaido Berahino goes from villain to hero as West Brom sink Aston Villa Read more\n\nSherwood enjoyed his first victories as Villa manager in successive games against Albion six months ago, in the Premier League and then an FA Cup quarter-final, but after losing to Leicester last Sunday and now West Brom, losing a third consecutive Midlands clash in nine days hardly bears contemplating.\n\n“I’ve said from the start, we need to be patient,” the manager said. “But if you lose derby games, obviously patience wears thin. But Tim Sherwood is at his best when he is backed into a corner.”\n\nWith four points from six games and no win in the Premier League since the opening day, Villa have misplaced the feelgood factor that peaked at Wembley with their FA Cup semi-final demolition of Liverpool. With only Micah Richards of the newcomers excelling thus far, Birmingham will visit for their first second-city derby since January 2011 with cause for optimism.\n\nBy contrast, West Brom appear primed for upward mobility. Always hard to beat under Tony Pulis, this was their fifth clean sheet in seven games this season, and their 14th in 24 league games since he took charge in January.\n\nPulis put their best performance of the season “by an absolute mile” down to finally having a clear week to work with the players on set plays and team shape. They also played with greater zest.\n\nPulis held team meetings to clear the air between Berahino and his team-mates and the 22-year-old certainly played with commitment, putting a shift in wide on the left as Pulis won the tactical battle with Sherwood by reverting to a 4-2-3-1 formation.\n\n“I am sure Saido regrets the way he has handled it,” Pulis said of the player’s petulant reaction to being denied a transfer. “He got crucified for it and in some respects he deserves it but he is a young lad and he deserves help, for people to back him and work with him. The players have been wonderful with him and you have seen that today with his goal.”\n\nAlbion started the game with steam-train tempo and Salomón Rondón might have scored after 70 seconds when his bullet header from Chris Brunt’s cross was parried superbly by Brad Guzan.\n\nVilla came back well in the middle of the half, with Gabriel Agbonlahor brilliantly setting up Carles Gil only for Claudio Yacob to bravely block the shot, but still Albion countered with menace.\n\nSix minutes before the interval came the pivotal moment Albion fans were waiting for. After a patient buildup, in which Jordan Amavi subsided in a tackle with Craig Dawson and so allowed James McClean to cross, Rondón laid the ball back for James Morrison to shoot from 20 yards and Berahino diverted the ball home. He was then mobbed by his team-mates as he ran back to the halfway line to hear the Albion fans singing his trademark song with unashamed delight.\n\nVilla were much more dominant in the second half, but West Brom are masters at sitting back and soaking up pressure and Rondón could have put the result beyond doubt.\n\nAt the end Berahino celebrated with the delighted Albion fans by throwing his shirt into the crowd.

It was a fitting effort to match Bournemouth’s most convincing display yet in the Premier League. They are, it is fair to say, beginning to enjoy life in the top flight. Callum Wilson scored his fifth in six games, there were assured performances all over the pitch and a first clean sheet to boot.\n\nJamie Vardy secures point for Leicester after Stoke blow two-goal lead Read more\n\nThe damage was done inside nine minutes, Ritchie’s volley coming five minutes after Wilson’s opener, and by the time Sunderland started fighting back in the second half, having blundered their way through the opening 45 minutes, it was already too late. They remain winless and their problems in both defence and attack show no sign of improving. “I am very, very angry with the players,” said manager Dick Advocaat. “And it’s not the first time. I will think about myself and what I did wrong but I also said to them that they need to, too. All my respect to Bournemouth, but there is no need to lose a game like this, in my opinion.”\n\nIt took only 210 seconds for the first crack to appear and Bournemouth ruthlessly punished them. Dan Gosling collected possession from a throw-in and, gliding forward, picked out Wilson on the edge of the area. The striker shook off Younès Kaboul, who was later sent off in a nightmare performance, with consummate ease before guiding a low finish past Costel Pantilimon. It was so simple from the hosts, so ragged from Sunderland.\n\nWhile that could have been prevented, there was nothing that could have been done to stop Ritchie’s magic. Charlie Daniels’ corner was headed clear by Yann M’Vila but only to the winger 25 yards from goal. He chested the ball down and, in one fluid movement, unleashed a left-foot pearler that curled in to Pantilimon’s top-right corner, leaving the 6ft 8in keeper with no chance of reaching an impeccably placed attempt.\n\nThe Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, was not surprised, recalling a similar effort against Sheffield Wednesday last season. “He’s got an outstanding left foot and hits the ball so hard and cleanly,” Howe said. “Hopefully he gets the credit he deserves.”\n\nSunderland did grow into the game but the constant positional switches were baffling. Jermain Defoe was stationed on the right, left and up front at various points in the opening 25 minutes. He saw precious little of the ball in all three but when you are badly in need of a goal, it seems quite odd to have the player most likely to find the net stationed on the flank. When Defoe did get a sniff six minutes before half-time, capitalising on a Sylvain Distin slip, he was denied by Artur Boruc’s leg. A minute later Lee Tomlin drove straight at Pantilimon from 25 yards after M’Vila lost possession in midfield.\n\nKaboul’s nightmare continued and he was perhaps lucky to get away with only a yellow card after cynically dragging Wilson to the ground as the striker headed towards the area. He was the third of the back four to be booked before the break, following earlier fouls by Sebastián Coates and Billy Jones.\n\nThere were signs of encouragement early in the second half from Sunderland, and they should have pulled one back only for a terrible call from the assistant referee Eddie Smart. Jack Rodwell, on at half-time for Jordi Gómez, had a shot deflected from the cornerand Jeremain Lens turned in at the back post. Up went the flag but Lens was well onside. Sometimes it is just not your day. “It would have changed the game and maybe we needed a little luck with that but we have to look at ourselves, not the referee,” Advocaat said.\n\nFabio Borini attempted to mirror Ritchie’s volley on the hour but it flew over and as the clock ticked by Bournemouth re-established their control. The effervescent Marc Pugh close and Ritchie drove a free-kick over. Sunderland’s misery was compounded when Kaboul saw red for a lazy kick at Wilson, whose pace eventually proved too much, 15 minutes from time.

Newcastle United players would safely negotiate the hazards strewn across the road by Watford.\n\nChelsea leave nine-man Arsenal seeing red after vital Premier League win Read more\n\nThe former England coach had clearly not bargained for his team again forgetting to keep checking those all important wing and rear-view mirrors. It left the excellent Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney free to enjoy themselves as Quique Sánchez Flores’s side continued their promising start to Premier League life.\n\nNewcastle, meanwhile, ended the afternoon stuck in a metaphorical ditch. Forced, embarrassingly, off the road by newly promoted visitors, they are still to win a league game this term, have scored only three goals and are being kept off the bottom of the table only by virtue of having a marginally better goal difference than Sunderland.\n\nFollowing a first-half surrender, they performed appreciably better in the second period with little cameos hinting at better days to come – eventually. With Newcastle’s next two League games against Chelsea and Manchester City, the immediate horizon looks less than sunny.\n\n“It’s not a crisis, it’s not a time to panic,” said McClaren, remaining commendably calm. “It’s a long way off a crisis – we just need to find a way to win. Everyone knew this was a hard job – and now we’ve got the proof. It’s a huge club and turning it round isn’t going to be easy.\n\n“There’s a lot to work on but as a backroom staff we’ve got the experience to turn it round. It’s early, we’ve a long way to go, a lot of points to play for. But we’re going to get a lot of criticism so that dressing room has to stay tight, stay calm and stick together.”\n\nExhilarating to watch throughout, Ighalo had dragged two extremely inviting chances wide before enjoying a little more luck with his third attempt. When Massadio Haïdara forfeited possession to Almen Abdi, Watford manoeuvred the ball intelligently into the area where, this time, Ighalo made no mistake with a shot squeezed just inside an upright. It was the Nigerian striker’s third goal of the season and 19th in 24 League games during 2015.\n\nIf Ighalo is on a hot streak, Papisse Cissé continues to endure a distinctly chilly one. McClaren’s Senegal striker missed three excellent first-half openings, the most notable created by Moussa Sissoko’s fine through ball.\n\nWhile both defences contained vulnerable spots, Newcastle’s looked much the wobblier in the face of Ighalo and Deeney as Flores’s decision to switch to good old 4-4-2 looked increasingly inspired.\n\nVery quick and extremely athletic, Watford revelled in finding the flaws in McClaren’s remodelled 4-1-4-1 system featuring Jack Colback in a semi-sweeping, anchoring midfield role. It is a job the undoubtedly talented midfielder is arguably unsuited to. Colback, though, could have done without Gini Wijnaldum, the team’s marquee £14.5m summer midfield signing, drifting through prolonged first-half periods without even touching the ball.\n\nFurther back, Fabricio Coloccini was not having one of his better days and watched horror-struck as Ighalo rounded Tim Krul before directing a right-foot shot into the unguarded net. Watford’s speed of thought and foot was such that Newcastle’s fading centre-half played like a man wearing blinkers.\n\nIghalo’s second was created by Deeney who displayed impressive control in chesting down Sebastian Prödl’s long ball before seamlessly cueing up his partner for another goal. Once again, Newcastle had been pulled out of shape and, down in the home dugout, McClaren began talking urgently into a telephone.\n\nThe interval beckoned when Heurelho Gomes made his first save, Watford’s goalkeeper repelling Florian Thauvin’s stinging first-time shot. Few were surprised to see Cissé replaced by Siem de Jong for the second 45 minutes in a reshuffle featuring Ayoze Pérez’s re-location to a central striking role and De Jong assuming the No10 position.\n\nAnother Dutchman, Daryl Janmaat is one of McClaren’s better performers and, appropriately, the right-back got Newcastle back into things. Overlapping, he picked out Sissoko before running beyond him, collecting his cross and shooting past Gomes. It was the first league goal that Newcastle had scored since the season’s opening day.\n\nWatford nearly restored their two-goal advantage when Ighalo and Deeney combined adroitly but Chancel Mbemba’s splendid late intervention denied Deeney. Suitably spurred, Janmaat forced Gomes into a good save, the goalkeeper reacting well to tip his left-foot, 25-yard shot round a post, thereby confirming it was Ighalo’s day. “Ighalo is a very important player,” said Flores, with considerable understatement. “We’re very happy. To win here is amazing.”\n\nMcClaren opted to seek positives. “We came up short again,” he said. “But we won the second half.”"}, {"date": "19/09/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 27642,

three points after falling two goals behind, the fact of their being away from home, and some way from their best, made the salvaging of a draw against Stoke City almost as impressive as their beating of Aston Villa last Sunday.\n\nNot, said Claudio Ranieri, that they can keep putting themselves under that sort of pressure and expect a return. “It’s not possible all the time,” acknowledged Leicester’s Italian manager said. “We started well, but then we lost a lot of ball in the middle of the pitch and gave [Stoke] the spirit to attack us.\n\n“But we said in the dressing room at half-time, if we get the next goal, everything is possible. It is important to show good spirit, good character and a good reaction.”\n\nThat, once again, they did, though the Potters played a big part in allowing them back into the game. After a first-half in which Bojan Krkic, making his first start for eight months, was inspirational, a penalty clumsily conceded by Marko Arnautovic gave the visitors hope, before Jamie Vardy, with his third goal in as many games, opportunistically secured the draw.\n\nMark Hughes was not happy, though given he was convinced Jon Walters had been fouled at least twice in the passage of play just preceding Vardy’s goal, his ire was, in part, directed at the referee, Andre Marriner.\n\n“First it looks like Arnautovic actually catches [Danny Drinkwater’s] heel just outside the box, but given the performance of the officials today it was always likely it was going to be given as a penalty,” the Stoke manager said.\n\n“Then in the buildup to the second we maybe got a bit distracted by the referee not officiating as well as he should have done, Walters was impeded two or three times, it wasn’t given, they cleared their lines and we don’t defend the long ball correctly. The referee said he was trying to play an advantage, but it certainly wasn’t an advantage to us.”\n\nThe ease with which Riyad Mahrez turned Erik Pieters in the first few minutes raised eyebrows, and it was the Algerian who drew the first save of the game from Jack Butland, but the response from Stoke was outstanding.\n\nA superb run down the left by Arnautovic, during which he twice left Ritchie De Laet trailing, concluded with a fine pass into the area for Krkic, running in behind the Leicester back four, to hit the ball first time past the exposed Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nIt was only another seven minutes before poor Schmeichel was again facing a one-on-one situation. This time it was Walters who had the goalkeeper to beat after Wes Morgan’s mis-kicked back-pass. Like Krkic before him, Walters gave the goalkeeper no chance with a composed finish.\n\nMatt Ritchie hits rocket for Bournemouth as Sunderland are blown away Read more\n\nMarc Albrighton replaced Gokhan Inler at half-time, but it was Arnautovic who, inadvertently but clumsily, pulled the Foxes back into the game by bringing down Drinkwater inside the penalty area five minutes after the break. Mahrez, whose pass Drinkwater had been running on to, converted the penalty.\n\nRanieri then replaced the ineffectual Shinji Okazaki with the more robust Leo Ulloa, who flicked on the long ball which saw Vardy hold off the challenge off Marc Wilson and poke the ball past Butland.\n\nNeither side could find a winner, though Stoke came closest as Geoff Cameron’s header bounced just past Schmeichel’s left-hand post, and the goalkeeper had to punch away Krcic’s curling free-kick.“In the first half we were good value, but we needed to close down key moments, which we didn’t,” said Hughes. “You have to give the opposition credit – they play to the strengths of their players, and if you give them any inclination they might still be in the game, they’ll keep going.”"}, {"date": "19/09/2015",

swinging at each other like two drunks slugging it out in an alley. This was an enthralling stalemate both managers felt they could have won, but each seemed content with a point earned largely through excellent performances from defenders prepared time and again to throw their bodies on the line. For Roberto Martínez, it was satisfying, considering that in Brendan Galloway, John Stones and Tyias Browning he had three defenders aged 21 or under in an all-English back four.\n\n“The first half was very level, I thought we cancelled each other out,” said Martínez, who after half an hour could be seen on the edge of his technical area a few yards along from his opposite number, Garry Monk, as the pair quietly surveyed the action unfolding before them. A dapper duo, both looked a picture of louche serenity as, without comment or gesticulation, they looked on like a pair of racehorse trainers admiring thoroughbreds being put through their paces on an afternoon gallop. Each had every right to feel pleased with what they saw.\n\nEverton probably should have edged it, failing to capitalise on a period of almost total dominance 15 minutes after the interval when Jonjo Shelvey and Jack Cork appeared to lose their foothold in a midfield dominated by Ross Barkley. He was not Swansea’s only tormentor, with Gareth Barry teeing up Romelu Lukaku only for the Belgian to balloon a close-range effort over the bar before having a more finessed effort blunder-bussed off the line by Ashley Williams. Everton’s Galloway also went close, performing a nimble soft-shoe shuffle to turn his man and drill wide. Later, he too would blast over.\n\nIn a more evenly matched first half, James McCarthy’s cross from the right after nine minutes was just a little too high for Arouna Koné, while Stones had Everton hearts in mouths as he misjudged the flight of a Kyle Naughton cross that allowed Bafétimbi Gomis to unleash an acrobatic scissor kick straight at Tim Howard. Moments later, the French striker, on a fruitless search for his fifth goal in six matches, sent a diagonal drive fizzing just past the upright.\n\nUndroppable following his hat-trick against Chelsea last weekend, Steven Naismith was put through on goal after neat link-up play by Koné and Lukaku, only to be denied by a splendid tackle by Neil Taylor. A constant menace, the Scot was later foiled by Lukasz Fabianski after firing through a thicket of legs from outside the area, after Swansea had failed to clear a free-kick. As the second half progressed, Swansea continued to play their way back into contention but were unable to break the deadlock. On for Wayne Routledge, Jefferson Montero forced a fine close-range save from Howard with a viciously whipped effort after twisting Browning’s blood on the edge of the penalty area.\n\nGylfi Sigurdsson also went close, hitting the side-netting with a free-kick from the edge of the penalty area before Gerard Deulofeu, on for Koné, squared tantalisingly across the edge of the Swansea six-yard box only for the ball to evade Naismith. Swansea struck again: Gomis shooting straight at Howard from distance only for Everton to retaliate rat-a-tat style with Galloway shooting over and Lukaku forcing another lunge from Taylor either side of Jack Cork shipping a surface-to-air screamer in the crown jewels from a visibly grinning McCarthy.\n\nAs the sides continued to trade blows, the last word went to Kevin Mirallas, whose challenge on his fellow substitute Modou Barrow resulted in a straight red card less than five minutes after taking to the field.\n\n“It was his first challenge and I felt it required a little common sense,” said Martínez, who appeared to think it was the referee, Stuart Attwell, who was over-zealous, rather than the player who leapt in on a rival’s shin with his studs showing in all their glory.\n\nJamie

Three of their four victories this season have been on their travels, and as the wins have come at the Emirates, Anfield and now the Etihad, no one could accuse them of going about it the easy way.\n\nChelsea leave nine-man Arsenal seeing red after vital Premier League win Read more\n\nThis was not quite as gobsmacking as the first two, except that Manchester City did happen to be top of the league with a 100% record before kick-off, and did not actually play that badly. West Ham spent much of the second half penned back defending their penalty area doughtily while their opponents played pinball around them. On another day, perhaps with David Silva, City might have managed to salvage something.\n\nThey certainly had enough possession in inviting areas, but the visitors held out to take the points thanks to the lead they took in the first half, before the league leaders had fully awoken to the danger.\n\n“We didn’t nick it,” Slaven Bilic said. “If City had managed an equaliser I would be the first to admit they deserved it, but we had our goal chances too. This was different to our other wins. We knew we would have to score here, because with all respect to Liverpool and Arsenal, this is the best team in the league.”\n\nWest Ham are up to second but Bilic is not setting any targets. “Only the big clubs have targets,” he said. “We are just going to try to play good football and win all our games. Where it will take us I don’t know, but it should be a good journey.”\n\nCity’s perfect start to the Premier League season included five clean sheets in their opening five wins, yet it took West Ham just a fraction over five minutes to put a dent in that record. Taking a pass from Dimitri Payet and turning towards goal, Victor Moses was allowed to size up his options from 25 yards before beating Joe Hart with a low drive. It was not the start City would have been hoping for after losing in the Champions League here in midweek, especially as they had already lost Silva to a calf injury sustained in the warm-up. Jesús Navas was hastily promoted to the right wing before kick-off and Kevin De Bruyne made his first City start in the centre of the advanced midfield trio behind Sergio Agüero.\n\nThe Argentina striker had missed most of the Juventus game with a knee problem but started here and could have put his side back on level terms just three minutes after West Ham took the lead. Agüero seemed to have done all the hard work in pouncing on Aaron Cresswell’s mistake and reaching the ball before Adrián, who had raced out of his area in an attempt to intercept, yet with the goalkeeper stranded and only a couple of defenders guarding the line the City forward still contrived to miss the target.\n\nCity responded as they knew they must, with Yaya Touré beginning to exert himself in midfield and De Bruyne showing up well under close pressure, though little was created and West Ham extended their lead just past the half hour when the home side were unable to defend a corner. Winston Reid met Moses’s cross from the right with his head, Pedro Obiang did well to turn the ball back across the face of the goal, and with the defence ball-watching, Diafra Sakho seized his chance to poke in from close range.\n\nCity were adamant that the ball had not fully crossed the line when the corner was given in the first place, though that could hardly be offered as an excuse. “We conceded two easy goals,” was Manuel Pellegrini’s terse verdict.\n\nAgüero was having something of an off-day, falling over when De Bruyne found him in space, shooting wastefully high on a couple and finding only Adrián’s arms when Bacary Sagna set him up with a cross to the near post from the right. He made some amends on the stroke of the interval, however, striding purposefully forward before squeezing out the pass from which De Bruyne scored his first City goal. The £55m Belgian did not hang about, beating Adrián with a crisp shot from just outside the area to reduce the interval deficit to a single goal.\n\nCity could count themselves slightly fortunate that Sakho had not widened West Ham’s lead moments earlier. He evaded Aleksandar Kolarov’s challenge to leave himself with only Hart to beat, then waited a fraction of a second too long and allowed Eliaquim Mangala the chance to get back and rescue the situation.\n\nThat turned out to be Mangala’s last involvement, for he failed to appear for the second half, with Martin Demichelis taking the field to join his compatriot Nicolás Otamendi in central defence. City looked sharper after the break, with Touré rolling an early shot just wide and Adrián preventing what would have been an own goal from Reid, under pressure from Agüero.\n\nNewcastle hopes of getting back on track sunk by Watford’s Odion Ighalo Read more\n\nRaheem Sterling, almost anonymous in the first half, looked livelier in the second period but kept being caught in possession.\n\nAlthough Sakho had a brief chance after staying onside and sliding a shot wide of the target, West Ham were living dangerously by the hour mark. When Touré turned a tired looking defence he seemed certain to score, yet with the whole of the goal to aim at he drilled his shot past a post. De Bruyne was practically running the game by this stage, showing marvellous touch and vision, generally to find Navas in particular incapable of delivering a decent final ball.\n\nLacking any other wing options Pellegrini sent on Wilfried Bony for Sterling for the final quarter, doubling the central threat but increasing the reliance on Navas to produce a telling cross. He did not manage it. Agüero and Bony were becalmed in the middle, so it fell to Otamendi to produce a late fingertip save from Adrián, and West Ham had their win. They deserved it too, for a committed all round display.\n\nCity have effectively done a Chelsea in reverse. José Mourinho now has the back-to-back wins he demanded last week to steady a lurching ship. Pellegrini and his players, after a month of plain sailing, are suddenly looking at back-to-back defeats. While Pellegrini claimed De Bruyne’s outstanding debut “didn’t matter, because winning was more important”, supporters are unlikely to judge the matter quite as harshly. City crowds like their heroes, and the Belgian looks to be made of the right stuff."}, {"date": "14/09/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34907, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United",

confronted a side overseen by Slaven Bilic, so the brolly was never required. His players still sunk without trace, utterly incapable of nullifying a West Ham side bristling with pace and inspired by a player over whom the Premier League is already drooling. While the locals departed fifth and chorusing Dimitri Payet’s contribution, Newcastle are propping up the division.\n\nThese are still early days but some traits remain from last year’s toils. Their dismal form away from Tyneside has yet to be allayed by McClaren’s summer appointment, or the lavish spending of the close season, with this latest loss ensuring it is one win in 11 top-flight games on their travels, and three altogether, this calendar year. Aspects of this feeble defeat were troubling, the manager an agitated figure slamming down his water bottle in frustration and burying his head in his hands when his team’s inadequacies were exposed. If previous outings had seen his team labouring with 10 men, and emerging with credit for their industry, here their full complement were outclassed.\n\nThe tone for McClaren’s night had arguably been set when the team coach ground to a halt in the gridlock on the Barking Road around an hour before kick-off. His players eventually disembarked amid the roadworks and walked the last mile to the stadium, a request to have the start put back having been rejected, and everything about them was flustered from then on. “Whether it was the journey, late getting here, a 10-minute warm-up … I don’t know,” said the Newcastle manager. “We said there were no excuses but we didn’t deal with it, turning up at 7.35pm. But in terms of organisation, discipline, defending well as a team and being hard to beat … we lacked all that.\n\n“We didn’t match West Ham. We’ve got talented players out there but we didn’t do the basics tonight. It’s a process, this is normal. We don’t like going through these types of nights and games. It’s painful. But we have to learn about individuals and the team. We’ve got ability, we’ve got quality. They’ve shown that in the last four games. They didn’t tonight. They’ve been told that was disappointing and they are disappointed. Now they have to dust themselves down and look forward.” Few of a Newcastle persuasion will want to reflect.\n\nAs an attacking unit they were powder puff – they have not scored since the opening weekend – with Papiss Cissé isolated and neither Florian Thauvin nor Georginio Wijnaldum, big-money summer arrivals, offering any bite or drive. But where they were listless, Payet simply ran riot. At £10.7m from Marseille, the France international already looks like one of the campaign’s bargains, a playmaker boasting that delicious blend of flair, physique and frightening pace. He combined superbly here with Victor Moses, who was making his home debut, and was irrepressible throughout. “He was a player I tried to sign at Besiktas last season and one I really wanted from the start here,” said Bilic. “When it was done in five days I couldn’t believe it.” There will be covetous glances cast towards Upton Park this season.\n\nPayet scorched Newcastle early. The hosts’ first goal was slickly constructed, Mark Noble stealing back possession from Wijnaldum and exchanging passes with Diafra Sakho, whose smart backheeled return for his captain wrong-footed Newcastle’s players. Their rearguard was pulled horribly out of shape, Jack Colback and Vernon Anita tearing back in an attempt to recover the situation, but Wijnaldum still dawdled. He might have intervened when Noble slid a pass back to the edge of the penalty area but, instead, was caught on his heels. Payet was sharper, the first-time finish from just outside the box curled accurately and emphatically into the top corner with Tim Krul helpless.\n\nThereafter West Ham could seek to prosper on the break, emerging unscathed from slight Newcastle pressure just before the interval – Daryl Janmaat forced Darren Randolph to save at the near post – to settle the contest while the visitors were still summoning some rhythm after half-time. Daryl Janmaat had actually won a promising free-kick from Winston Reid’s challenge but the delivery was wayward, the ball headed towards the halfway line where Moses nodded down, outpaced Anita and held off Massadio Haidara as he tore into enemy territory.\n\nThe left-back was dumped on the turf as the Chelsea loanee cut back inside and lifted his shot beyond Krul only for the ball to cannon back from the crossbar. While the Nigerian was cursing his luck, Payet composed himself just inside the box and lashed in the loose ball.\n\nAttempts at recovery were only fitful, a team radically reinforced over the summer lacking any real cohesion and forced even to endure Andy Carroll’s first-team return after a seven-month absence for the final few moments. The visitors might have welcomed their former forward’s brawn leading their own line, their best attempt being a Siem de Jong shot which was deflected goalwards by Pedro Obiang. “We’ll need a reaction,” added McClaren, with Watford playing at St James’ Park on Saturday. “But we’ve learned a lot tonight.”"}, {"date": "13/09/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 40303,

team who had been required to complete the Great North Run before kick-off.\n\nTravelling fans could have been forgiven for feeling they had endured a mental half-marathon of their own by the 76th minute when Eric Dier’s header forced Costel Pantilimon into a save. It was his side’s first effort on target.\n\nA switch belatedly flicked, Ryan Mason then scored an excellent winner, rather out of sync with what had gone before, to earn Tottenham a first Premier League win of the season.\n\nSlightly unlucky here, Sunderland are still waiting for theirs but, despite this latest setback, a refreshingly attractive display from Dick Advocaat’s radically remodelled side was much improved on previous weeks. Indeed it contained cause for cautious optimism that relegation can be avoided after all.\n\nRemarkably, no one at Spurs had realised that on Sunday was Great North Run day and they unwisely spent Saturday night at a hotel in Newcastle before arriving at the ground later than planned after being forced to take a lengthy diversion.\n\n“We got there in the end,” said Pochettino. “The goal showed our philosophy, how we want to play. It was fantastic.” His side – who have parted company with Emmanuel Adebayor by “mutual consent” – improved considerably after the introduction of Andros Townsend and Érik Lamela but the need for such changes can be construed as a compliment to Sunderland.\n\n“Disappointing but I’m not disappointed in how we played, I think we could see a very big difference,” said Advocaat. “If we keep going this way, we’ll pick up points.”\n\nOut went the Dutchman’s previously preferred 4-3-3 formation to be replaced by a 4-4-1-1 system featuring Jermain Defoe in the central striking role supported by Ola Toivonen. This represented quite a volte-face, Sunderland’s manager having previously insisted Defoe belonged in a wide role these days.\n\nWhile Fabio Borini played his first game back on Wearside after a £7m move from Liverpool wide on the left, Advocaat’s team-sheet proved politically freighted with Lee Catttermole dropped to the bench along with his fellow “old guard” members Jack Rodwell and Sebastian Larsson. Deployed in Cattermole’s place, Yann M’Vila more than vindicated his manager’s faith.\n\nPochettino refrained from similarly bold statement making. His principal change involved introducing Son Heung-min, Tottenham’s £22m signing from Bayer Leverkusen, in a right sided attacking capacity.\n\nSpurs might have had a second-minute penalty but Patrick van Aanholt escaped unpunished after a clumsy challenge on Kyle Walker. Yet if Sunderland were sporadically troubled by the wonderfully talented Dele Alli – the moment when he confounded the backtracking Borini courtesy of a back heel and a nutmeg proved particularly memorable – the best first-half chance fell to Defoe.\n\nConnecting with a fabulous through-ball from Jeremain Lens, the former Spurs striker accelerated beyond the visiting defence and, having taken a steadying touch, unleashed a low shot which confounded Hugo Lloris before coming back off a post.\n\nClearly relishing playing off Toivonen, Defoe was enjoying himself and the moment he turned Toby Alderweireld with consummate ease before shooting off target, albeit while having his shirt pulled, emphasised his enduring suitability for a central brief.\n\nNot that locals were entirely optimistic. The protracted spells when Pochettino’s players passed the ball around Sunderland for fun could not be ignored. The Londoners’ problem was that they came over all stodgy when it mattered. Fears that they were incapable of finishing what they had started merely intensified when neat work from Nacer Chadli created a most inviting close-range chance for Son. Embarrassingly the new boy got his feet in an awful tangle and miscued.\n\nThe overall lack of visiting invention when it came to the final ball was such that John O’Shea and the Spurs old boy Younès Kaboul, at times appeared Champions League class – well, almost.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ryan Mason is carried off during after scoring Tottenham Hotspur’s winner at Sunderland Photograph: Mark Runnacles/Getty Images\n\nThey were out-foxed when Alli’s skill prefaced a splendid cross but Harry Kane failed to react fast enough and could not quite get there. If it was not Kane’s day, Townsend, on for Son, caused Van Aanholt all sorts of problems but, still, Spurs could not break the impasse.\n\nAt least that was the case until a gorgeously geometric passing sequence ended with Mason and Lamela combining cleverly to bisect Sunderland’s defence. Smartly defying an offside flag, Mason advanced to chip the on-rushing Pantilimon, injuring a knee in the process.\n\nThe scorer left on a stretcher and Rodwell struck wood before time ran out. “We didn’t get the point we deserved,” said Advocaat. “But I think we’ve found an attractive way of playing.”\n\nMan of the match Yann M’Vila (Sunderland)"}, {"date": "13/09/2015", "arena": "The King

Carles Gil made it 2-0 midway through the second half but instead that goal turned out to be the catalyst to another extraordinary Leicester comeback. The club may have changed manager during the summer but they retain the jolting dynamism and enterprise that fuelled last season’s spectacular late surge out of the relegation zone and, contrary to most pre-season predictions, they now stand second in the Premier League.\n\nKeen not to get carried away by the rising feelgood factor around the King Power Stadium, Claudio Ranieri insisted survival remains this season’s priority. “We have to stay focused, the goal is to stay in the Premier League,” he said. “It’s not March or April, only September. Afterwards we can dream but not now.” Ranieri said before this match that he was curious to see how his players would resume club action after the international break but if there was one thing that he must have known he could take for granted from this squad, then it was brio. Villa should have anticipated that, too, but the hosts’ early vivacity seemed to take the visitors by surprise. As did the late fightback.\n\nJoleon Lescott, who endured a torrid debut for Villa, and Micah Richards were pestered into errors in the opening minutes and the latter was especially relieved that Danny Drinkwater’s shot from 25 yards flew over the bar.\n\nOnce they got to grips with Leicester’s zeal, Villa began to demonstrate the greater guile. Tim Sherwood’s side may be in the early stages of reconstruction – Jack Grealish and Ashley Westwood were the only two starters here who had begun May’s FA Cup final – but they showed encouraging cohesion and forced Leicester backwards. Soon it was the home team who looked anxious at the back.\n\nA blunder by Robert Huth should have led to the opening score in the eighth minute but Gabriel Agbonlahor’s pass across the face of goal was too long for Scott Sinclair. A delightful Villa move six minutes later came to a similar end when Grealish overhit a cross from the byline. Grealish was then guilty of underhitting a shot from 16 yards.\n\nLeicester were still dangerous on the break but Villa struck six minutes before half-time. A corner from Westwood triggered chaos around the home goal, with a header from Richards and a shot from Carlos Sánchez repelled before Grealish curled the ball beyond Kasper Schmeichel from the edge of the area. This was turning into an accomplished away performance. Or so it seemed.\n\nIf Leicester made a bright start to the first period, their start to the second was near to dazzling. Again Villa seemed caught in the headlights. Jeff Schlupp dashed past Leandro Bacuna and Gil in the 48th minute before crossing for Jamie Vardy, who fired into the side-netting. Brad Guzan then saved a 20-yard shot from Marc Albrighton. Moments later Richards made an excellent tackle to thwart Vardy after Leicester’s renewed pressing forced Villa to cough up possession.\n\nRiyad Mahrez started producing the dribbles that have made him one of the outstanding players of the season so far. But Leicester were foxed by a textbook counterattack in the 63rd minute. Agbonlahor charged down the left and crossed for Gil, who executed the perfect finish from 18 yards.\n\nLeicester hurtled forward anew. Vardy demanded a penalty after hitting the ground under a challenge from Bacuna. The pair squared up to each other as they debated the issue but Bacuna was not so lively from the following corner, allowing Ritchie De Laet to get the jump on him at the near post and divert the ball just over the line.\n\nIn the 82nd minute Mahrez served Drinkwater, who fizzed in a low cross. Vardy darted between two defenders to score from close range. Leicester did not settle for a point. Amid the raucous exhortations of the home crowd, Nathan Dyer showed he shares the boundless courage of his new team-mates by hurling himself at a Mahrez cross in the 89th minute, beating Guzan to it and catching the goalkeeper’s fist in his face as the ball rolled over the line.\n\n“I’m devastated at the way it’s panned out‚” said Sherwood. “To get ourselves in the position where we are controlling the football match, for the momentum to swing away so dramatically is really disappointing for me. The only way you can stop momentum is by keeping the ball off the opposition and we gave it back to them so easily in the last half an hour. We need to improve.”\n\nMan of the match: Jamie Vardy (Leicester City)"}, {"date": "12/09/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38311, "home_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [87], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [9]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Lennon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [17, 22, 82], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [9], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramiro Funes Mori", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [88], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [36], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [74]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [74], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jamal Blackman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Chelsea have made an unexpectedly terrible start to the season but credit to their supporters for maintaining a sense of humour. “We are staying up,” they chanted as their side slumped to a third defeat in five games. Things are probably not quite that bad, though as with José Mourinho being reminded to check his employment status in the morning or the league table that reveals Chelsea to be the first team to concede a dozen goals this season, this is not a situation anyone anticipated a few weeks ago.\n\nA sizzling hat-trick by Steven Naismith, who was not even on the pitch at the start of the game, earned Everton a deserved victory in a fixture they lost 6-3 last season. Everton were excellent without being scintillating; it was the sluggishness and passivity of their opponents that was the most surprising feature of the game.\n\nThe side that hit six here last season appears to have disappeared. Despite the wealth of attacking talent at Mourinho’s disposal Chelsea might not have got on to the scoresheet at all but for an opportunist strike from considerable distance by a defensive midfielder.\n\nEverton v Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nThe game came crackling to life a quarter of an hour in when John Stones overhit a back-pass to Tim Howard. The goalkeeper dealt with it comfortably enough but it resembled a shot and a Stones own goal against Chelsea would have been some story.\n\nWithin a minute Everton had taken the lead at the other end through a delightful combination of two of their squad players. Brendan Galloway, enjoying a run at left-back through injury to Leighton Baines, whipped in the most inviting of crosses that Naismith could hardly miss. The substitute, on after eight minutes when Muhamed Besic pulled up with a hamstring problem, met the ball perfectly on the six-yard line for a header that flew past the Chelsea No2 goalkeeper, Asmir Begovic.\n\nIf that was a bright start the afternoon got steadily better for the home side in the next few minutes. Begovic had to be alert to keep out a header from Arouna Koné after Séamus Coleman crossed from the left, then the goalkeeper saved again when James McCarthy sent in a shot from distance.\n\nWithin five minutes of the opening goal Naismith and Everton had a second. Good work by Koné and Romelu Lukaku by the right touchline led to Ross Barkley finding Naismith in space in the centre of the pitch, and spotting an opportunity the Scot beat Begovic with a cleanly struck left-foot shot that found the goalkeeper’s bottom-left corner.\n\nWith Coleman winning his sometimes physical duel with Diego Costa, Stones exuding grace under pressure as he calmly took on and beat opponents in his own penalty area and Mourinho subjected to chants of “You’re getting sacked in the morning”, Everton fans probably suspected it was too good to last.\n\nSo it was. After a largely unproductive first half-hour that had seen Costa living off scraps of possession and neither Eden Hazard nor Pedro making any impression on the game, Chelsea suddenly pulled a goal back with a bolt from the blue from Nemanja Matic. Everton could have closed the midfielder down more quickly, but as he was at least 30 yards out there seemed no immediate danger. Matic changed that perception with one imperious swing of his left boot, sending the ball arrowing into Howard’s top corner with a shot that was still rising as it crossed the line.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Everton fans with a banner taunting manager José Mourinho in the stands during the game. Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA\n\nFrom a position of complete dominance, Everton spent the remainder of the first half on the back foot, defending too deep and inviting Chelsea to come at them. They made it to the interval without further mishap, though Chelsea went close on a couple of occasions, notably when John Terry headed narrowly over the bar and Hazard sent a shot through a crowded penalty area.\n\nLukaku had a chance to restore a two-goal cushion early in the second half but shot straight at Begovic, who needed two attempts to claim the ball and was aided by a surreptitious touch from Terry that the officials generously chose not to interpret as a back pass. Everton were duly incensed, though it would have been academic had Lukaku done better with the shot or looked across to see Koné arriving in support.\n\nIt turned out not to matter, Chelsea had by now misplaced the energy and goal threat that they managed to demonstrate in the period before half-time and with Stones treating his London admirers to a masterclass of defending with and without the ball Everton held out quite comfortably.\n\nThey were even able to bring on Aaron Lennon and Ramiro Funes Mori towards the end, before Naismith had made the game safe with his third goal, slotted home from a narrow angle from a pass by Barkley. A right-foot shot made it a perfect hat-trick and completed a perfect Everton afternoon, and Roberto Martínez still believes his side can play better. That remains to be seen – Chelsea are at present making all their opponents look good."}, {"date": "12/09/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 59963, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal",

predators, and then lost Danny Welbeck to the injury black hole for months, Arsène Wenger watched Theo Walcott and Olivier Giroud do the business.\n\nWhether either (or both) can lead a Premier League title challenge remains head-scratchingly central to the Arsenal narrative these days. But they did what was needed against an uninspiring Stoke.\n\nBoth forwards endured the odd excruciating miss, yet persevered to finish off in the contrasting styles that makes the either/or such a bewildering question. Walcott’s goal was all about profiting from a pacy move. Giroud’s was a show of aerial strength from a set piece. Fuse them together and Arsenal might just have Wenger’s ideal for a leading man up front, but in the current formation he tends to choose one or the other. Decisions, decisions ...\n\nWhile Giroud started Arsenal’s first three Premier League matches this season, Walcott has been selected for the two most recent. Wenger is not shy in predicting something special for the England forward. “I believe he can be a prolific goalscorer,” the manager said. “You come out of the game and think how many chances he had? The bigger belief he will have to score, the more he will score.”\n\nWith the team desperate to get back to scoring ways, he was certainly involved early on, with two fine chances falling his way in the first eight minutes as Arsenal tore into Stoke with serious intent. The first chance, a rebound screwed wide after Alexis Sánchez’s header was clawed on to the post, was not one for the scrapbook. The second, invited by Héctor Bellerín’s tantalising cross, was steered over.\n\nStoke looked utterly bamboozled early on. Sánchez was in the shooting mood, and it was only the excellence of Jack Butland that denied the Chilean the chance to add his name to the scoresheet. The Stoke goalkeeper was also in fine form to repel Laurent Koscielny and Santi Cazorla as shots assailed him from all angles.\n\nArsenal’s moment arrived in the 31st minute. They were set in motion by Francis Coquelin, whose tackle to dispossess Mato Joselu had a hint of Patrick Vieira about it. Mesut Özil picked up the ball and suddenly Wenger’s team were all about pace: Özil’s lobbed pass moved the ball forward quickly and Walcott showed the strength to hold off Marc Muniesa before jabbing in the opening goal.\n\nIn its execution it vindicated the logic behind Wenger’s choice of Walcott over Giroud. “I knew we would face Stoke who are a compact and organised team and Theo could find little pockets to get in there,” said the manager. “You get two or three chances to get a counterattack at home and we used that. He scored a great goal. If I had bought a striker Walcott would not have played so it is always a vicious circle. At some stage you have to believe in your players.” Statistically, an 11th goal from 11 Premier League starts outlines a strong case.\n\nSteven Naismith hat-trick gives Everton victory and piles pressure on Chelsea Read more\n\nStoke, whose only meaningful chance in the opening half saw Petr Cech parry from Joselu, were flattered by a scoreline of only 1-0 by half-time. They emerged after the break looking as if Mark Hughes had politely reminded them that cruising through a Premier League game in a bit of a daze was not on. “We were not right in our defensive play. We didn’t get anywhere near what we had talked about in terms of closing down the ball,” he said.\n\nThat improved in the second half, although Stoke were still indebted to Butland for keeping the scoreline presentable. “As the season progresses our aim is for him not to be man of the match so often,” Hughes added. The visitors did perk up enough for Xherdan Shaqiri to summon a few shots, but overall it was a day for them to forget.\n\nGiroud was brought on for the last 15 minutes and his first touch of the ball was to drag horribly wide when presented with a one on one by some equally horrible Stoke defending. But, like Walcott, he kept at it and was rewarded with the goal that made the points safe.

This bruising contest had lurched into stoppage time when Samir Nasri eked out rare space in the Crystal Palace penalty area and spat away a shot which Alex McCarthy could not hold. From the confusion within the six-yard box emerged Kelechi Iheanacho, a teenager introduced as a substitute seconds earlier, to clip home his first senior goal and establish this club’s best start to a top-flight campaign in more than a century.\n\nAt the final whistle Iheanacho flung his No72 shirt into the joyous away support, the lucky beneficiary perhaps glancing at the name emblazoned across the back just to check who had pilfered his team’s winning goal. The 18-year‑old Nigerian had previously featured for a few minutes as a late replacement for Raheem Sterling against Watford in August. Having been signed from Taye Academy in Owerri in 2014, he does not even qualify for the B list for City’s Champions League campaign, which begins against Juventus on Tuesday. “He’s a very important player for the future for us,” said Manuel Pellegrini. “He’s one of the reasons I didn’t bring in another striker when we sold Edin Dzeko.”\n\nPalace might have thought the worst had passed when Iheanacho, the star of his country’s victorious involvement in the Fifa U17s World Cup two years ago, had replaced Wilfried Bony, particularly given Sergio Agüero had long since departed with a knee injury.\n\n“I had to look at his shirt to check who he was,” said Alan Pardew. “But then City have so many players. It’s a problem going forward. People forget that not only are they building a very strong first XI, but they’re snapping up a lot of young players from around the globe making it very difficult for everyone else.”\n\nIheanacho was sharpest to react here, his finish dispatched beyond a dismayed McCarthy and City had their victory.\n\nIt came at a cost. Agüero had not seen out the opening quarter, felled by Scott Dann near the halfway line as City sprang on the counter and Palace bemoaned the non-award of a penalty for Fernandinho’s trip on Yohan Cabaye. There was contact to the Argentinian’s right knee and he landed awkwardly on the same limb. It took him five minutes before he opted to hobble off to sit, scowling, in the dugout with his involvement against Juve in doubt.\n\nSterling was loitering a few rows further back and David Silva absent altogether. Those are Pellegrini’s immediate concerns, though he was impressed by the debut of Kevin de Bruyne, the leaders’ £54m record signing. The Belgian was tidy enough. He will click back into the rhythm of this frenetic division in the weeks to come.\n\nThat strength in depth will alarm those who aspire to claim this title. This is the first time City have won their first five top-flight games of a season since 1913 – they have won 11 in a row stretching back to the last campaign – and the gulf from the champions gapes at 11 points five games into Chelsea’s slapdash defence.\n\nCity had to grind out this latest success, initially scorched by the pace of Yannick Bolasie, Wilfried Zaha and Bakary Sako and grateful to Joe Hart’s flying save to deny Jason Puncheon after the interval. Palace had started the day in second place and with Cabaye imperious and James McArthur just as impressive at the Frenchman’s side they are no longer pushovers.\n\nYet once Yaya Touré’s lunge at McArthur had prompted a spat between Pardew and Pellegrini on the touchline – the home manager subsequently offered a handshake to acknowledge he had encroached into his opposite number’s technical area – City steadily imposed some order. They were much improved after the interval when Palace’s lack of a natural target man was exposed and should have led when Cabaye lost possession to Nasri following a period of home pressure. He found De Bruyne who darted down the line and swept a pass in-field for the galloping Jesús Navas, outpacing Puncheon and Martin Kelly, to collect through the centre. The winger rounded McCarthy but presented with an open goal could only scuff a left-foot shot into the side-netting.\n\nPalace were relieved when Mike Jones did not spot Cabaye’s trip on Nasri in the penalty area, only for the 18-year-old from Nigeria’s Imo State to claim the spoils.\n\n“Everybody in the league will look at City and say that was a great result for them given the way we’ve been playing,” said Pardew, whose side had triumphed at Stamford Bridge just before the international break. “They’ve put themselves in a great position. Chelsea and the others have it all to do now to make up the gap, but this will be a very unpredictable year in this division.”\n\nTherein lies the chasing pack’s hope but, already, City boast breathing space.\n\nTheo Walcott and Olivier Giroud send striking message as Arsenal tame Stoke Read more"}, {"date": "12/09/2015", "arena": "Carrow Road", "attendance": 27018, "home_team": {"name":

The Norwich manager enjoyed victory against the same opponents in his first game in charge and repeated the feat with a 3-1 success, which lifts his side into the top half of the Premier League.\n\nHoolahan created the opening goal for Cameron Jerome before scoring the second himself seven minutes into the second half. The game was wrapped up when Matt Jarvis struck on his debut, with Steve Cook grabbing a consolation for the visitors.\n\nThe win gave Neil his first home Premier League victory but it was the performance of Hoolahan that left Neil delighted. “Fantastic,” he said when asked to sum up the 33-year-old’s contribution. “He isn’t going to always have days when he has that much influence, but when he does he is a joy to watch. He is a special player and he has been excellent since I came here.\n\n“His performance was terrific, he has been a key figure in my team, I like creative players – Nathan Redmond has probably played his best football over the last six months, that type of player has a place in my team but they have to put the work-rate in as well.”\n\nThis was the second win of the Premier League season for Norwich and Neil was keen to stress that the suggestions of a slow start to the campaign for the Canaries were wide of the mark. “Football is funny,” he said. “Whatever spin you can put on things, people buy into it. We have played four games before today and three of them we played well in, the last one we didn’t and we’re told we have started the season badly. We went and won the game and the story is completely different but that is just the circus that goes on in the Premier League.\n\n“If anybody is a Norwich fan, we have played four games where we have performed really well, one where we have not, if we can average that over the rest of the season it’ll be fine. People in football don’t get carried away with it.”\n\nThe Bournemouth manager, Eddie Howe, bemoaned his side’s poorest performance in 18 months and pointed to a poor defensive display as the cause of the defeat. “Without a shadow of a doubt,” he said when asked if it was their worst performance in their short Premier League history. “Definitely this season and I don’t think we performed like that at all throughout the season.\n\n“It is part of the learning curve for us, the development of the squad, when we have moments like this we have to show our strengths. It was always going to be like that this season.\n\n“From our perspective we defended very poorly. At 0-0 right in the game there was not a lot between the teams, the first goal was really poor to give away. From that moment on until the second went in we lost our way for 10 minutes totally, before finding ourselves.

At the end, Depeche Mode’s 1981 hit Just Can’t Get Enough blared out over the PA. A bare-chested Troy Deeney, their captain, saluted the ecstatic fans from the touchline in front of the Sir Elton John Stand. And the 12-year-old twin sons of Quique Sánchez Flores, the Watford manager, ran on to the pitch to give dad a hug on their first visit to a Watford match.\n\nVicarage Road was rocking. It was, though, more out of a huge sense of relief. Watford had secured their first victory of the season – deservedly so, too – and extinguished that gnawing feeling that they were not up to scratch in the top flight – and might never be.\n\nYet it could have all gone so badly wrong after they had taken the lead in the 59th minute against a strangely subdued Swansea City, when Deeney set up Odion Ighalo to decisively slot home past Lukasz Fabianski in the Swansea goal.\n\nFive minutes later, the midfielder Valon Behrami launched into a fierce challenge on André Ayew and appeared to stamp on him. Bobby Madley issued an immediate red card.\n\n“It was the right decision,” Garry Monk, the Swansea manager, said. “It was a nasty stamp.”\n\nFlores needs a review. “I prefer to have a look first,” the Spaniard said. “It is very difficult, it was so quick.”\n\nBehrami’s recklessness could have proved costly yet such was Watford’s overall superiority, they held on reasonably comfortably against a side lacking any of their usual spark and imagination.\n\nFederico Fernández could still have spoiled the party but, five minutes into added time, the centre-back headed wildly over at the far post. An equaliser would have been an injustice. Swansea, unbeaten all season and earning plaudits all over the country, rarely threatened. “It was a poor afternoon for us,” Monk said. “It was down to a lack of focus. We were sluggish on the ball and didn’t use it in the right areas.\n\n“I’m disappointed that we lost and the worst was the manner in which we lost. We didn’t perform as a team, any of us. But we always bounce back and react well.”\n\nSwansea did not react well in the first half. One fierce effort from Bafétimbi Gomis, smartly saved by Heurelho Gomes, was about it.\n\nWatford dominated the play only to squander a series of half-chances that fell to Sebastian Prödl, Deeney and Almen Abdi. They were on top again, too, before going ahead in the second half and still solid when down to 10 men, apart from Fernández’s late miss.\n\n“We are happy with our first win,” Flores said. “We have worked hard over the past two months but that win wouldn’t come.

A lot has happened since Saido Berahino said he would not play for West Bromwich Albion again on 2 September having been denied a transfer to Tottenham. Yet he made his comeback as a second-half substitute in this otherwise dull affair and he was met by a mixed reception.\n\nHis introduction was the only lasting memory from a forgettable scoreless draw. Although his 35-minute cameo was unspectacular, he offered more than the man he replaced, Rickie Lambert, whose performance could hardly have been more muted. How Tony Pulis, who said everybody should take some blame for the fallout from the non-transfer, could do with Berahino’s goals – this was their third blank from five games.\n\nDespite a definite smattering of boos directed at the 22-year-old, Pulis praised the home support’s welcome. “I’m pleased Saido had such a great reception, it’s wonderful and shows the quality of our supporters. He is a young boy who has made mistakes. The important thing now is that he learns from them. He is a talent and when we brought him we saw glimpses of what he can give us.”\n\nAction wise, attention surrounded an early penalty claim that the managers took widely differing views of, with both critical of their own player. Callum McManaman went down at the feet of Matt Targett after 16 minutes, the teenage left-back sliding in recklessly to take man and ball. Stuart Attwell, in charge of his first top-flight game of the season, dismissed the firm appeals but Ronald Koeman thought luck was on Targett’s side. “Matty takes a lot of risk to slide in,” the Saints manager said. “He is lucky that the referee didn’t whistle. I say always to defenders to keep on your feet, don’t go down because it gives the ref an opportunity.”\n\nPulis, on the other hand, said he would speak to McManaman on Monday, believing he made a meal of the challenge. “I have to say the referee and the linesman on that side have made an excellent call.”\n\nThat apart, a Craig Dawson header over from a teasing Chris Brunt corner and, at the opposite end, Jay Rodriguez turning a Dusan Tadic corner off target were the only noteworthy moments of a dour opening half. Koeman said that was his team’s best chance. “It was not good enough in the final part, not clinical enough,” he said. “We were making too many difficult choices with the final pass but if you can’t win, don’t lose.”\n\nWest Brom were evidently lacking in ideas up top. Lambert and Salomón Rondón are much of a muchness and, when combined, key components of any successful strike partnership are absent. Their limitations meant Virgil van Dijk, freshly arrived from Celtic, enjoyed a comfortable start to life as a Southampton defender, while Albion’s own debutant centre-half, Jonny Evans, was not too bothered by an isolated Graziano Pellè.\n\nRondón should have threatened Maarten Stekelenburg 54 minutes in when fed from the right. Although his footing gave way there were disappointed groans when he blasted over. The re-integration of Berahino followed immediately. It will take some time for him to win everybody over but few could argue he is their best attacker.\n\nTerritorial advantage belonged marginally to Southampton, however, many of their moves orchestrated by a typically neat performance from Victor Wanyama, but they, too, created precious little to bother Boaz Myhill.\n\nThe visitors did have a counterattack that should have yielded more than a James Ward-Prowse hack over entering the final 15 minutes after Tadic’s lay-off, but they could have been there until sunset fruitlessly chasing a goal and it may still not have arrived."},

on his first appearance at Old Trafford and some way to introduce himself to a crowd who, if they are anything like Wayne Rooney, will probably admit they did not know a great deal about the athletic, high-kneed attacker Manchester United have turned into the most expensive teenager on the planet.\n\nThe money is astronomical enough that even Louis van Gaal has described it as “ridiculous” but there are not too many better ways to repay some of the transfer fee than scoring the goal that sealed victory against the club United want to beat more than any other team.\n\nThere were four minutes of normal time to go when Martial collected the ball on the left and, for the first time, United were suddenly looking vulnerable. They were leading 2-1 but Christian Benteke had scored with a scissor-kick that was executed with such stunning quality as to lift the entire Liverpool team.\n\nInstead, the ball reached Martial in the kind of position where a teenage Cristiano Ronaldo danced and showboated his way into Old Trafford’s affections on an equally memorable debut against Bolton Wanderers 12 years ago. Martial saw a gap between Martin Skrtel and Nathaniel Clyne, cut inside and trusted himself to get there. It needed tenacity as well as skill and the teenager’s perseverance took him where he wanted to be. His shot was dispatched with the calmness of a player who seemed at complete ease with his new surroundings and in that moment Old Trafford was given a better idea why the club had recruited the 19-year-old for an initial £36m, with another £22m in potential add-ons.\n\nManchester United spring to life as Louis van Gaal gets half his message across Read more\n\nIt was a wonderful way to mark his debut, coming on as a 65th-minute substitute on a day when David de Gea’s return to the team added to the sense that at least United are gradually heading in the right direction. This was Van Gaal’s 51st match in charge and his tally of 28 wins is only one better than David Moyes’s total over the same period. The team do not always thrill in the way of old and the first half was another reminder that Van Gaal’s “process” – the buzzword that seems to have taken over from “philosophy” in his football lexicon – can jar with what many Old Trafford match-goers traditionally expect. All the same, there was a clear imbalance of talent throughout the game and United did find a penetrative edge in the second half. Liverpool, in contrast, were slightly directionless for long spells and took an age before examining whether De Gea might be slightly rusty after his time out.\n\nThe irony was that Van Gaal, with his love of rhythmic control, commented afterwards that he had preferred the first-half performance, regardless of the lack of excitement. Others would surely contest that a side featuring the creative sparks of Juan Mata, Memphis Depay and Ander Herrera should be capable of getting behind the opposition defence with greater frequency. Instead, they often fell into the trap of aiming crosses towards Marouane Fellaini and hoping to capitalise on the aerial ability of the player who was deputising for the injured Rooney. It was a bland 45 minutes and Liverpool’s only serious problem came when Simon Mignolet’s throw struck Mata and left Fellaini with a chance he wasted.\n\nThe breakthrough came four minutes into the second half when Mata played a clever free-kick to Daley Blind and the Dutchman scored with a controlled, rising shot. Liverpool’s defence had been waiting for a cross that never came. Mata squared the ball to Blind, who was loitering behind the main pack of players, and the deception worked perfectly.\n\nLiverpool can reflect on a couple of chances to equalise, with some excellent defending from Blind to thwart Skrtel and Danny Ings in quick succession. De Gea briefly created some problems for himself with a poor throw and kick but United looked a more rounded team with him back in goal and the one-handed save to keep out Ings’s bouncing effort was a reminder of his qualities.\n\nLouis van Gaal urges patience over Manchester United Anthony Martial Read more\n\nLater, there was another splendid save to turn away the substitute Jordon Ibe’s rising shot but it would be misleading to dwell too much on these chances because the truth for Liverpool, as Brendan Rodgers acknowledged afterwards, was that they did not use the ball well and left Benteke too isolated.\n\nHerrera doubled the lead from the penalty spot after Joe Gomez misjudged his sliding tackle on the Spaniard and United were relatively comfortable until Benteke sent a brilliant, twisting volley past De Gea. Briefly, there was the possibility of a comeback, but Rodgers did not try to spin the narrative afterwards. Liverpool’s manager conceded it had been a dishevelled performance and, apart from Benteke, the game’s outstanding performers all wore United’s colours, most notably Blind and Luke Shaw. Bastian Schweinsteiger had his best game since moving to Manchester and, as the crowd headed away, there was the clear sense that Martial’s tour de force will linger long in the memory."}, {"date": "30/08/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 29573, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [64, 67], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cuco Martina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juanmi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Whittaker", "yellows": [27], "reds": [31], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastien Bassong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}, {"name": "Alexander Tettey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wes Hoolahan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [32]}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}], "subs": [{"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [32], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bradley Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Hooper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ricky van Wolfswinkel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Southampton needed this. After the disappointment of their Europa League exit and the general sense that they were fighting both for form and to retain their star players, they freed themselves from the shackles to put Norwich City to the sword.\n\nSadio Mané, who has been targeted by Manchester United, returned from the hip problem that had seen him miss the Europa League play-off loss to Midtjylland on Thursday, to set up the opening two goals while Dusan Tadic, who was also back in the lineup after recent difficulties, pepped his confidence with two goals.\n\nSouthampton 3-0 Norwich City: Premier League – as it happened! Read more\n\nSouthampton have their first Premier League win of the season and the club’s support could even temporarily forget the ongoing saga of Victor Wanyama’s desire to leave them before evening’s transfer deadline. The midfielder, who wants to force a move to Tottenham Hotspur, was omitted from the matchday squad, with Ronald Koeman, the Southampton manager, saying Wanyama had told him he was not in the right frame of mind to play.\n\nKoeman made it abundantly clear that the Kenyan would stay, whether he liked it or not. He also suggested Wanyama could earn a bigger move than one to Tottenham, if he stayed and excelled, much as his former team-mate, Morgan Schneiderlin has done. Schneiderlin, who saw a move to White Hart Lane blocked last summer, is now a Manchester United player.\n\nNorwich were second best in all areas but the game slipped away from them after Steven Whittaker’s sending-off after 30 minutes. If the right-back’s first booking was cheap – he was punished in the 27th minute for preventing Matt Targett from taking a quick throw-in – then the second was also underpinned by foolishness.\n\nJames Ward-Prowse chipped a ball over the top and Whittaker got himself into a tangle with Tadic, clearly impeding him. When the referee Jon Moss rushed over, everybody knew what was coming next, including the Norwich manager, Alex Neil. “I think he tried to tug him back,” Neil said. “He didn’t need to do it.”\n\nNorwich had travelled with confidence and why not, given their eye-catching sequence under Neil. They had not previously lost a league fixture away from home since his appointment last January while their early steps in the top flight, after their promotion from the Championship, had been encouraging.\n\nSouthampton were a little nervy at the outset, mixing some nice moments with loose passing and crossing. When José Fonte sent a wayward backpass towards Maarten Stekelenburg in the 17th minute and the goalkeeper then cleared poorly, the home crowd howled. Norwich might have taken the lead when Graham Dorrans hooked back from the right and Cameron Jerome could not stretch enough to make decisive contact on the header.\n\nThe red card, though, changed the game’s complexion. Southampton could point to Ward-Prowse’s early free-kick, which drew a save at full-stretch from John Ruddy and Tadic’s 29th minute shot, which fizzed past the far post. But they pressed on to the front foot with more conviction after Whittaker’s dismissal while Norwich came apart at the seams.\n\nThe visitors did not move the ball well, giving it away too often and losing too many duels and second balls. “It was the manner in which we lost our away record that was disappointing,” Neil said. “We didn’t play well and we didn’t deserve anything.”\n\nSouthampton’s breakthrough arrived just before half-time and the celebrations mixed delight and relief. Ward-Prowse won possession and he found Mané, who slipped a ball in for Graziano Pellè. The Italian striker had bought a yard of space from Russell Martin with his run towards the near post and he rammed his finish low past Ruddy. Neil could rue the way in which his team had squandered possession and how cold they were subsequently caught.\n\nKoeman made an attacking change at half-time, replacing Steven Davis with Jay Rodriguez, and his team called the tune thereafter. Norwich were pinned back and they could not escape. Mané, Rodriguez and Pellè had each gone close before Southampton made the points safe.\n\nMané’s cross from the right was low and pulled back, and it invited Tadic to run on to it and curl home with the inside of his right foot. It was a smart finish and Tadic’s second followed minutes later, after Ruddy had pushed out Pellè’s header from Cédric Soares’ cross. He could not miss from point-blank range.\n\nKoeman had appeared in the technical area, leaning on his crutches as he recovers from achilles surgery and the crowd responded to him while they also afforded Mané a standing ovation when he was substituted late on.

The Dutchman has been managing in the Premier League for little more than a year but he has now suffered three straight defeats at the hands of the Welsh club, with the latest chastening experience bringing home what a terrible mess Manchester United have got into with their goalkeeping situation.\n\nGarry Monk’s smart change of Swansea formation outwits Louis van Gaal | Michael Cox Read more\n\nIt was not much of a way for Van Gaal to celebrate his 50th game in charge of United as Sergio Romero, who was an accident waiting to happen whenever he had the ball at his feet, allowed Bafétimbi Gomis’s low shot to slip past him at the near post. Romero could arguably have done better with Swansea’s equaliser five minutes earlier, when the irrepressible André Ayew – who already looks like one of the signings of the summer – beat him with a downward header. A penny for David de Gea’s thoughts.\n\nUnited’s problems, however, do not start and end with their goalkeeper, no matter how badly the whole episode has been handled. After his midweek hat-trick against Club Brugge, Wayne Rooney took two steps back here.\n\nThe United striker gave away possession in the lead-up to Swansea’s equaliser and, running as if he had lead in his boots, then squandered the sort of opportunities that the Rooney of old would have buried in the blink of an eye.\n\nThe chance he failed to take in the 88th minute was a case in point. Everyone in the stadium was waiting for Rooney to pull the trigger but it was almost as if he lacked the conviction to shoot. He waited too long and, not for the first time in the game, Ashley Williams recovered and nicked the ball off his toe.\n\nRooney has now gone 10 Premier League games without scoring – the last time he went through such a barren run was at Everton in 2003 – and there must come a point when Van Gaal needs to rethink the attacking strategy of his team and consider if someone else should be given the task of leading the line. The big problem for Van Gaal is who that could be.\n\nSo much about Van Gaal’s United team feels disjointed at the moment, whether it is the sight of Daley Blind playing at centre-back – Gomis turned him far too easily before hitting the upright in the first half – or Juan Mata being deployed wide on the right.\n\nVan Gaal continues to bang the drum about possession – he claimed United controlled 95% of this game – but for a team with so much of the ball there is precious little attacking threat. The sobering truth for United is that they have scored only three times in four league games and one of those was an own goal.\n\nBut enough of United’s woes. Credit Swansea and in particular Garry Monk for making the tactical change just before the hour mark that turned the game on its head and prompted Van Gaal to admit his players “could not cope”. Wayne Routledge made way and Ki Sung-yueng came on as Monk reconfigured his 4-2-3-1 system into a midfield diamond, enabling Ayew to play further forward.\n\nThree minutes later the Swansea manager had his reward. Williams carried the ball forward from deep inside his own half and picked out Gylfi Sigurdsson wide on the right. The Icelander – who should have put Swansea ahead in the first half when he dragged wide from eight yards – delivered an inviting cross that Ayew, unmarked after running off the back of Morgan Schneiderlin, headed into the ground and past Romero for his third goal in four games.\n\nSwansea City v Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nIt was a swift response to Mata’s goal at the start of the second half, when Luke Shaw capitalised on some poor Swansea defending. Shaw rode Kyle Naughton’s weak challenge, accepted the invitation to eat up ground on the flank and delivered a floating cross that appeared to carry little threat until it eluded everyone, including Rooney, and found its way to Mata at the far post. With Williams caught sleeping, Mata ghosted in to sweep United ahead.\n\nAyew’s equaliser, however, shifted the momentum of the game. Swansea, who had spent much of the opening 25 minutes chasing the ball (albeit without being opened up by United on many occasions), were now playing with renewed confidence and the visitors looked vulnerable.\n\nA neat buildup involving Jonjo Shelvey and Sigurdsson culminated in Ayew picking up possession in the inside left channel, where the Ghanaian curled a gorgeous pass with the outside of his left boot, behind Chris Smalling and into the path of Gomis. The angle was against the Frenchman but he took the shot early and Romero was too slow to get down to prevent the ball from squeezing inside his near upright. Gomis has now scored in all four of Swansea’s league matches this season and has nine in his last 10 appearances.\n\nOn came the United cavalry as Van Gaal introduced Michael Carrick and Ashley Young and, in one final act of desperation, Marouane Fellaini. The damage, however, was done and United’s manager was left nursing a depressing sense of deja vu.\n\nMan of the match André Ayew (Swansea City)"}, {"date": "29/08/2015", "arena": "St James' Park, Newcastle", "attendance": 50388, "home_team": {"name": "Newcastle United", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Krul", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Daryl Janmaat", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chancel Mbemba", "yellows": [19], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fabricio Coloccini", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [52], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Massadio Haidara", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Vurnon Anita", "yellows": [48], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Jack Colback", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Moussa Sissoko", "yellows": [3], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [78]}, {"name": "Georginio Wijnaldum", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Florian Thauvin", "yellows": [26], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [87]}, {"name": "Aleksandar Mitrovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [16], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Papiss Cisse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [78], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Siem de Jong", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [87], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Obertan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ayoze Pérez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cheick Tiote", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Karl Darlow", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Laurent Koscielny", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [70]}], "subs": [{"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mikel Arteta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [70], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Campbell", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "The old joke about lies, damn lies and statistics has rarely seemed more apposite. By the end of a thoroughly contradictory afternoon, Newcastle had collected seven cards, six yellow and one red, yet the game was distinguished by a lack of gruesome fouls.\n\nA similar disconnect applied to Arsenal’s attacking play – despite creating around 20 chances Arsène Wenger’s side rarely looked like scoring and, ultimately, had to rely on a somewhat fortunate own goal from Fabricio Coloccini for their three points. Moreover they played against 10 men for most of a match shaped by Alexsandar Mitrovic’s controversial 16th minute sending off.\n\nDespite hardly troubling Petr Cech, Newcastle’s commitment and defensive cohesion was sufficient to earn Steve McClaren and his players warm applause at the final whistle. In previous years two points from four games would probably have heralded a mini-crisis on Tyneside but there is a recognition that Newcastle are already much improved from last term and require time to gel.\n\nIf the Gallowgate End has good reason to be satisfied with the prospect of jam tomorrow, Arsenal fans seem to have been waiting for another realistic title challenge for what feels an eternity.\n\nThis could still be their season but right now something is not quite adding up for Wenger. With Tim Krul rarely stretched to the limit, visiting fans were left pining for the absent Mesut Özil and Jack Wilshere as Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and company failed to justify the hype which haunts their every step.\n\nMitrovic is gaining a rather less enviable reputation. After acquiring two yellow cards within two minutes of stepping off the bench in his first two appearances, the Serbia striker swiftly saw red here.\n\nHaving started in preference to Papiss Cissé at the apex of McClaren’s 4-2-3-1 formation, the £13m buy from Anderlecht had barely broken sweat before Andre Marriner felt compelled to send him off.\n\nThe offence in question was a stamp. It left Francis Coquelin writhing in agony, clutching a shin which could have done without such a brutal introduction to Mitrovic’s studs. In mitigation, the challenge was mistimed rather than malicious and a booking might have been a more appropriate sanction. Marriner though clearly thought intent was irrelevant and the contact with the shin bone both reckless and dangerous.\n\nAdamant that the referee had spoilt the game by slipping into pedantic zealot mode McClaren disagreed. “There’s no intent, no malice,” said Newcastle’s manager. “It was definitely not dangerous. It was clumsy. Football’s a contact sport, it’s a physical sport and we can’t take that away. It wasn’t a dirty game, we haven’t kicked them off the park. The cards were all fouls but I think the ref has reacted too harshly, too rashly with every one of them.”\n\nDespite seeing the game through a radically different prism. Wenger offered qualified sympathy. “Mitrovic went a bit overboard,” said Arsenal’s manager. “It was a red card, he didn’t try to play the ball as well but it was maybe a bit unlucky as well. But Newcastle wanted to stop us from playing, from moving the ball quickly. They decided from the start to make the game quite physical so we had to keep our nerve and not become a little bit aggressive as well.”\n\nHis players succeeded in maintaining such serenity when, shortly before the sending off, they were denied a clear cut penalty. An impulsive moment on Florian Thauvin’s part emphasised that tracking back is not really the former Marseille winger’s forte before resulting in a blatant trip on Héctor Bellerín inside the area.\n\nCreditably McClaren’s players made the very most of it of that reprieve. Reduced to 10 men they worked incredibly hard with Jack Colback and Daryl Janmaat prominent among those doing their utmost to deprive Santi Cazorla, Alexis Sánchez and company the time and space they craved.\n\nIn between all this industry, Moussa Sissoko, who regularly fazed Nacho Monreal, and Georginio Wijnaldum found time to sporadically ruffle Arsenal on the counter-attack. Wenger later admitted to having been “a little nervous,” although his mood would surely have been much lighter had Theo Walcott not missed a most inviting first half chance after Krul parried Sanchez’s shot.\n\nOverall Walcott, preferred to Olivier Giroud in the lone striker role, did little to deconstruct theories that Wenger is one top class centre-forward away from a serious title challenge.\n\nIt was left to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to create the winner when Krul parried Aaron Ramsey’s shot and, connecting with the rebound, he unleashed an angled first time effort. It seemed to be sailing harmlessly wide before deflecting off Coloccini and diverting into the back of the net.\n\n“Newcastle defended well,” said Wenger. “They showed why they didn’t concede at Manchester United last week. We didn’t find the space. We’re happy to win.”"}, {"date": "29/08/2015", "arena": "Villa Park", "attendance": 35399, "home_team": {"name": "Aston Villa", "lineup": [{"name": "Brad Guzan", "yellows": [], "reds": [],

lower-division opposition in midweek illustrated why they will be residing in the lower reaches of the Premier League as they head into the first international break of the season.\n\nThat Aston Villa, having needed five goals to overcome Notts County in their Capital One Cup tie on Tuesday, failed to put away a Sunderland team low on confidence and coming off the back of a nine-goal thriller against Exeter City says much about the growing pains Tim Sherwood’s new-look team may have to go through before they can be properly judged.\n\nScott Sinclair followed up his midweek hat-trick with the goals that seemed to put Aston Villa in control of this game. That’s more goals than he had managed in the previous three seasons.\n\nWith both teams having resorted to high-scoring escape acts to avoid cup humiliation, it was no surprise to see them quickly trading goals. Sunderland had eventually put six goals past Exeter in their second-round win but that was barely much of a confidence booster considering the three goals they conceded and the fact they had mustered only one point from their opening three league games.\n\nStill, the quality of Yann M’Vila’s finish from a free-kick 20 yards out, just wide of centre, could not be questioned, as the Frenchman curled his shot in at the near post for his first goal in the Premier League. That was Sunderland’s first goal against these opponents in five meetings, and the first time they had managed to score in the first half of a league game this season.\n\nVilla were not perturbed and within three minutes Sinclair, recalled to Tim Sherwood’s league line-up with Jack Grealish injured and Gabby Agbonlahor ill, had won and scored an equalising penalty. Lee Cattermole should have known better than to climb on the winger’s back and Sinclair was not going to think twice about going down. He dispatched his penalty with confidence, sending Costel Pantilimon the wrong way.\n\nThe home side, so poor in recent years at Villa Park, played some neat and enterprising football going forwards. Ashley Westwood, invited in as Younès Kaboul inexplicably backed off, blasted one shot just wide before Carlos Sánchez shot over when Sinclair and Micah Richards had both failed to connect with Leandro Bacuna’s free-kick.\n\nBut the lead Villa deserved arrived four minutes before the interval. Idrissa Gana – such as he has asked to be known having been signed under the surname Gueye – played a delightful through ball in behind Billy Jones that was matched by Jordan Amavi’s exquisite cross into the corridor of uncertainty from where Sinclair could not – and did not – miss.\n\nDick Advocaat had bemoaned his defenders’ ability to stay awake in training earlier in the week but it seemed his exasperation with his players had spread further up the field as he took decisive action during the interval. Cattermole and Danny Graham, both rather sluggish in the first half, were withdrawn and within minutes Steven Fletcher and Ola Toivonen, their replacements, had contributed more.\n\nFletcher had a header from Jones’s cross brilliantly tipped over before Toivonen, signed on Friday on loan from Rennes, set up the equaliser. The Swedish midfielder took the ball off Sánchez and slid a pass down the inside-right channel for Jeremain Lens to turn inside Ciaran Clark with ease. Although the Dutchman’s shot was on target, Brad Guzan may well have saved it if the ball had not deflected above his reach off Micah Richards.\n\nRichards was also responsible for Villa failing to retake the lead just before the hour mark. Gana played the ball out for Sinclair to cut in and dispatch a devilish cross-shot that the former England defender managed to head backwards rather than into the goal. If Villa fans were wondering why he was so high up the pitch, they were even more bemused by his defenders’ header.

Uninspired for long periods against Bournemouth, the relentlessness that saved Leicester last season kept their points tally ticking over thanks to Jamie Vardy’s late penalty and ensured that only Chelsea have found a way to get the better of them since they lost 4-3 to Tottenham Hotspur on 21 March. Beating Claudio Ranieri’s team is no mean feat at the moment, even when they are below their best, and it should be a source of pride for Bournemouth that they almost managed it.\n\nCallum Wilson’s fourth goal of the season placed Leicester’s unbeaten start under serious threat, the striker’s wonderful overhead kick a rare flash of class in a bruising encounter, and in the end Bournemouth were left to reflect on a couple of debatable refereeing decisions and not making the most of their dominance in the first half. One moment of sloppiness cost them, Eunan O’Kane’s loss of the ball in his own half culminating in Steve Cook illegally ending Vardy’s surge four minutes from time.\n\n“You can lose but you have to fight in every moment,” Ranieri said. “It’s not important if Bournemouth score the second or third. It’s important how you leave the pitch at the end of the match.”\n\nAlthough Bournemouth can take solace from earning four points from four matches, a respectable haul for a small side who are novices at this level, their disappointment was intensified by losing Charlie Daniels, Max Gradel and Tyrone Mings to knee injuries. Mings replaced the stricken Daniels at left-back during the interval, but his Premier League debut lasted only 12 minutes before he was taken off on a stretcher following a heavy collision with Danny Drinkwater.\n\nIt looked nasty and resulted in eight minutes of stoppage time. “Tyrone didn’t look good,” Howe said. “Seeing him in that much pain, it’s not nice to see. Max knew early it was serious. Knee injuries are not good to see. Tyrone was in the treatment room afterwards.” The injuries may force Howe to strengthen his squad before the transfer window shuts on Tuesday, although Bournemouth do have that most precious of commodities, a striker in scintillating form.\n\nBristling with confidence after his breakthrough hat-trick against West Ham United last weekend, the instinctive quality of Wilson’s goal in the 24th minute was a brilliant exhibition of his potential.\n\nLeicester’s right-back, Ritchie De Laet, picked up an early booking for fouling Gradel and Bournemouth launched attack after attack down the left.\n\nIt did not take long for Leicester to crack. Daniels exchanged passes with Lee Tomlin, his deflected cross spun towards Gradel and Robert Huth’s block diverted the ball to Wilson, who athletically cracked it past Leicester’s goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nBournemouth should have had a penalty when Tomlin was caught by N’Golo Kanté just inside the Leicester area but Neil Swarbrick awarded a free-kick and Schmeichel pushed Gradel’s effort away.\n\nLeicester lacked their usual vibrancy during the first half and Ranieri’s decision to strengthen his midfield by starting Kanté instead of Shinji Okazaki isolated Vardy up front. Mahrez’s influence was limited because of a clumsy foul by Gradel and the winger was replaced by Okazaki at half-time.\n\nBournemouth’s crisp passing and organisation was unsettling Leicester and Huth was lucky he was only booked for pushing Mings.\n\nHowever Bournemouth’s injuries disrupted their rhythm and Leicester asserted themselves. Jeff Schlupp stung Artur Boruc’s palms and a free-kick from Drinkwater caused confusion in the home defence.\n\nThe pressure was incessant and Bournemouth were punished when Vardy seized on O’Kane’s error and charged into the area. Cook’s lunge was desperate and Vardy made no mistake from the spot to level the scores."}, {"date": "29/08/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41581, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [71], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}, {"name": "Pedro", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [66]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Baba Rahman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [79], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [66], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ruben Loftus-Cheek", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robert Kenedy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Crystal Palace", "lineup": [{"name": "Alex McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joel Ward", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [81], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Scott Dann", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Damien Delaney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Pape Souaré", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McArthur", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yohan Cabaye", "yellows": [73], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Jason Puncheon", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bakary Sako", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [65], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Wilfried Zaha", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [55]}, {"name": "Connor Wickham", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Adrian Mariappa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Yannick Bolasie", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [55], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Hennessey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Chung-Yong Lee", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dwight Gayle", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Mutch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Ledley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was a surprise result in more ways than one. More often than not a defeat for the Premier League champions at home to one of the division’s middleweights tends to go a certain way: a chance taken on the break, a defensive rearguard, a little luck. Here though Crystal Palace were victors entirely on merit, a composed, skilful, physically dominant visiting team who executed their game plan – pressing Chelsea in the centre, outrunning them on the flanks – to perfection in a well deserved victory. It will be tempting to riff on the poverty of Chelsea’s performance, and they were undoubtedly both uninspired and tentative. But Palace’s strength is a story in itself, further evidence of the levelling out of the division, and the Premier League’s finest point, its shared competitive edge. On this form these particular champions are likely to struggle a few more times this season.\n\nChelsea did look to have saved a point with a 79th minute equalising goal via Radamel Falcao’s diving header that was both brilliantly executed and entirely out of keeping with their performance up to that point. That Palace should still end up inflicting a second defeat in four matches for the champions thanks to Joel Ward’s winning goal, stabbed in after more good work by Bakary Sako, was both fair reward and a fair reflection of the poverty of Chelsea’s performance at a muggy, uncomfortably close Stamford Bridge.\n\nChelsea started the day in 10th place and with a sense of having spent the early weeks of the season crunching around in the high gears. Defeat here is hardly disastrous, but the nature of the performance from a Chelsea team lacking not just leadership, but energy and precision in too many positions will trouble José Mourinho. After the final whistle here Chelsea’s manager made a point of refusing to concede the Premier League title. Which, given that it’s still August, perhaps tells its own story.\n\nPalace were excellent however, a team of muscular, pacey ball-players, well-drilled in deep defence and brisk in their counterattacks down both flanks. Jason Puncheon is a lovely, careful passer of the ball and here he out-Cesc’ed Chelsea’s own midfield creator for long periods of the game, strolling about to great effect in his central playmaker role.\n\nFor Chelsea Kurt Zouma, as expected, filled the hole left by John Terry’s suspension and Pedro started his first home match on the opposite flank to Eden Hazard with Willian deployed as one of elite level football’s more blue collar No10s, a source of hustle and pressure but little in the way of poise and vision.\n\nFor Palace Yannick Bolasie returned to the bench, with Connor Wickham starting up front and Sako, Wilfried Zaha and Puncheon interchanging fluidly behind. They started well, forcing a series of corners on the left and harrying Chelsea in possession. Wickham and Sako may not go down in history as one of the great goalscoring duos, but they could undoubtedly moonlight successfully in the piano lifting trade.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chelsea manager José Mourinho criticises his players after defeat to Palace.\n\nWith 18 minutes gone Pedro cut inside and curled a shot just wide of the far corner, almost but not quite Chelsea’s first effort on target. Otherwise Chelsea simply dithered harmlessly. The need for muscle, bark, and sergeant-majorly instruction is often a little overstated in English football. On the other hand, all the best teams have dominant personalities in key positions and here a Chelsea side without a single vertebrae from that famous 10-year spine of Cech-Terry-Lampard-Drogba seemed to lack something in the way of bite and leadership. Hazard did his best to create a spark among the kindling. Diego Costa did his best to pick a fight. But this was still a mannered, polite, neat, unimposing Chelsea in a goalless first half.\n\nAfter the break Costa tried to rouse the champions, at one point picking up the ball in the centre circle and charging past Scott Dann before laying the ball off to Hazard, who shot wide. But it was Palace who took the lead on 64 minutes with the goal they had been threatening to score all game. It came from the left flank, Pape Souaré playing a sharp pass to Bolasie, just on the pitch for Zaha. His low cross was allowed to travel all the way across the Chelsea area to Sako, who had time to set himself and slot the ball past Thibaut Courtois at the second attempt.\n\nBolasie might have added a second on 73 minutes, ballooning a bobbling ball over from five yards after Sako had seized on another loose moment in the Chelsea defence, as again their midfield had begun to sag a little, offering some great wide open spaces when Palace attacked. Nemanja Matic has been criticised for a tailing off in his form, and it has been a while since he resembled the telescopically dominating presence of the first half of last season.\n\nBut his declining influence mirrors that of Cesc Fàbregas. There are only so many times a single willing Serb can be asked to police single-handedly the space both in front of and behind his back four. Here again Matic could be seen frantically gumming up leaks and holes, whirling about to cover two or three breaking attackers while Fàbregas chugged back in his general direction.\n\nChelsea roused themselves to equalise through Falcao after an excellent cross by Pedro from the right. But this always looked likely to be Palace’s afternoon against champions who now find themselves eight points behind City, and five behind the visitors in second place."}, {"date": "29/08/2015",

Forty-two times since that 2-1 win in September 1963 their supporters have traipsed back to east London without tangible reward. No longer. Fifty-two years on, it finally came wrapped in an emphatic victory for Slaven Bilic’s side.\n\nWest Ham’s Dimitri Payet: ‘One day I might be at the level of Eric Cantona’ Read more\n\n“Super Slav” sang the travelling support as their manager savoured his second win in the Premier League. The first came at Arsenal, the second at Anfield with goals from the excellent Manuel Lanzini, Mark Noble and Diafra Sakho polishing a supremely well-organised away display. Following consecutive home defeats by Leicester City and Bournemouth, it appears West Ham are thriving away from the Boleyn Ground a season before they leave their historic home for good.\n\nNot even Noble’s harsh dismissal could dampen an afternoon to savour for the visitors. For Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool, however, this was a galling, dispiriting defeat capped by a red card for Philippe Coutinho that means he will miss the trip to Manchester United after the international break. All the encouragement from a spirited start to the campaign disappeared in tandem with their new-found defensive prowess. West Ham shattered Liverpool’s aim of a fourth successive clean sheet after merely 148 seconds and their momentous victory was rarely jeopardised thereafter.\n\n“Our confidence has been really high until today but a lot of this defeat was self-inflicted,” bemoaned Rodgers, who found no answer to West Ham’s deep defensive block. “The overall performance was disappointing from the off. Once we conceded the early goal we just couldn’t get back into the game again. With and without the ball we have to be much better in the future.”\n\nLiverpool had opened with intent but they granted the hugely impressive Dimitri Payet too much space at the visitors’ first attack and compounded the problem when Martin Skrtel headed his right wing cross to Aaron Cresswell on the edge of the Liverpool area. The former Anfield trainee drilled a low delivery into the six-yard area where Lanzini ghosted in ahead of Joe Gomez to score from close range.\n\nA soft, simple way for Liverpool to spoil their clean sheet. The home team almost levelled when Roberto Firmino, making his first start at Anfield, cut inside Noble 25 yards out and unleashed a powerful left-foot strike that struck a post with Darren Randolph beaten in the West Ham goal. For all the probing of their Brazilian pairing, Coutinho and Firmino, that was as close as Liverpool came in the first half as the visitors’ powerful, composed defence limited the space and supply available to Christian Benteke.\n\nBy contrast, Payet and Lanzini were a potent force on the counterattack for Bilic’s team, who should have doubled their lead when Cresswell met Sakho’s deflected shot inside the area but scooped his effort over the bar.\n\nWest Ham were gifted their second courtesy of a dreadful error by Dejan Lovren. Rodgers had hailed the Croatia international for his early season improvement before the game but was left cursing that public vote of confidence when the £20m central defender lost out to Lanzini near the corner flag. Lovren shook off the attentions of the on-loan Argentinian on the touchline, then inexplicably turned the ball into Lanzini’s path on the by-line. The former River Plate midfielder strolled into the Liverpool area unopposed and, though Nathaniel Clyne intercepted a cross intended for Sakho, the ball broke for the in-coming Noble to slide a measured finish into the bottom corner from the edge of the penalty box.\n\nBoos rang out from the Kop for Liverpool’s aimless display at half-time and the home supporters were incensed when Coutinho was sent off for a second bookable offence seven minutes after the restart. Coutinho, already booked for dissent, invited trouble from the referee, Kevin Friend, when he sent Payet tumbling while lying flat on the ground. Soft but foolish. “It was extremely harsh,” said the Liverpool manager. “Kevin must have really good ears if he could hear what Philippe was saying for the first yellow card.”\n\nRodgers replaced Emre Can with Alberto Moreno at half-time and reverted to a 3-4-2-1 formation. He gave Danny Ings a first Liverpool appearance in place of Firmino and introduced Jordon Ibe for Gomez.\n\nThe pattern remained the same. Winston Reid and Angelo Ogbonna continued to dominate Benteke in the air while Noble and Pedro Obiang worked tirelessly in central midfield to protest their defence.\n\nNoble received the second red card of the game for a supposed foul on Ings committed after Friend had blown for a West Ham free-kick. The visiting captain protested long and hard over the straight red having appeared to win the ball from the former Burnley striker. It mattered not. Sakho sealed a fine away win with a low shot through the legs of the back-tracking Skrtel and inside Simon Mignolet’s near post in stoppage time.\n\nBilic said: “It is three points but it is one of those games for the club and especially the fans when it is more than three points. 52 years without winning at this special kind of stadium and we did it in style. We didn’t nick it, it was a great performance in 90% of the aspects of the modern game. It was one of those victories that will be written about in books in years to come.

Four wins, four clean sheets, 10 goals scored, a club record 10th consecutive league win, and 12 points accrued is one story of their start. The other is a ripping yarn of sublime football in all departments, from defence, midfield and attack, which is shredding teams at will and is particularly entertaining to watch.\n\nRaheem Sterling has made a telling difference to this Manuel Pellegrini side. Yet he is the sole summer recruit to have started any of the team’s matches. So what the manager has done to a band of elite yet seasoned footballers who appeared short of ideas and steam in the second half of last season must be applauded.\n\nKevin De Bruyne close to £51m transfer after medical at Manchester City Read more\n\nThe XI who started on Saturday were unchanged for a third consecutive outing. Pellegrini has so far made only one change, standing down Wilfried Bony for Sergio Agüero following the opening match, a 3-0 victory at West Bromwich Albion.\n\nKevin De Bruyne will become City’s fifth major signing imminently. He will complete a highly successful window of trading for Pellegrini. Yet the Belgian may struggle for a place given how City are performing. Fabian Delph, who cost £8m and made his debut as a late replacement, may also wonder how he will establish himself in the team.\n\nIn last Sunday’s 2-0 victory at Everton, City required an hour before scoring, via Aleksandar Kolarov. This time, 47 minutes had ticked by. The player who did the trick was Sterling. This maiden strike for his new club was also his first since Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Newcastle United on 13 April.\n\nCity had been the dominant side and deserved the lead. A string of passes led to Bacary Sagna down the right. Along with the rest of his team-mates, the Frenchman has begun the campaign as if reborn, and the cross he put in was a delight, landing plum on Sterling’s right boot. Delightful, too, was the run that took the forward into space near Heurelho Gomes’s goal.\n\nA light and clinically directed volley followed that gave the Brazilian no chance and the sense was that a goal glut may ensue.\n\nAt the break Pellegrini brought on Samir Nasri for Jesús Navas and afterwards the manager indicated he had been in a patient mood. “It was not frustrating in the first half,” he said. “You can’t expect to win the game inside 45 minutes against a team who defend well.”\n\nOf the strike from Sterling, who cost £49m, Pellegrini said: “Raheem played very well. He worked very hard and I’m sure he’ll score more goals. He’s not just a scoring player, he works a lot in the game and is good at one-v-ones which is something we perhaps needed to improve on. He’s demonstrating that he’s not an expensive player, he’s a good player.”\n\nNine minutes after that finish City had their second. Yaya Touré had thus far been quietly efficient, turning up the gears at will. From around 25 yards the midfielder pummelled a free-kick into the Watford wall. This rebounded to David Silva and on the half-turn he rolled a slick pass to Fernandinho.\n\nIt removed the Watford rearguard, it gave the midfielder a clear shooting chance. This was on the angle, to the right of goal. What followed was a rocket that zoomed past Gomes and City were two ahead.\n\nThose Watford fans who arrived hoping for a damage limitation exercise at the Etihad Stadium would have been heartened by the start to the match. City hogged possession as was to be expected, yet when Quique Flores’ team had the ball there was a zip and confidence to the promoted side’s one-touch, pass-and-move style of football that convinced.\n\nIn José Holebas, José Manuel Jurado, Étienne Capoue and Valon Behrami, Flores has a quartet of players from the continent whose experience and technical excellence meant they nor their team were intimidated at a venue where Chelsea had been beaten 3-0 in the home side’s previous outing.\n\nOn 22 minutes City moved on to the differing plane they can occupy. Touré took charge, barrelling at the heart of Watford. He was stopped, though it required two Watford players to repel him. The ball squirted to Navas and when Fernandinho received possession he swept a majestic pass out to the left. The move broke down but Watford were warned.\n\nThey may have wanted to take heed but they could not materially do so. It is proving tough for all opposition against this City incarnation. In the ensuing minutes Sterling twice cursed his luck at not opening his account.\n\nEach time he was in on Gomes and a corner was the result. The goalkeeper made a particularly impressive save from the second chance, smothering the shot to turn the ball out.\n\nAt the close Kelechi Iheanacho made a first City appearance, the 18-year-old coming on for Sterling. As with all of his colleagues, the latter had been supreme. And with Chelsea losing to Crystal Palace – the champions now trailing by eight points – this was close to a perfect day for City."}, {"date": "29/08/2015", "arena": "Bet365 Stadium", "attendance": 26747, "home_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marco van Ginkel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [68]}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [31], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [25], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [81]}], "subs": [{"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [81], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [68], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bojan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "West Bromwich Albion", "lineup": [{"name": "Boaz Myhill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Dawson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth McAuley", "yellows": [84], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonas Olsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joleon Lescott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Gardner", "yellows": [25], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Darren Fletcher", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Claudio Yacob", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [35]}, {"name": "James Morrison", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McClean", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Salomón Rondón", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Brown Ideye", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Anichebe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cristian Gamboa", "yellows": [69], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Rickie Lambert", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [35], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Callum McManaman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Serge Gnabry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "At least one man with a permanent place in the Stoke City family could savour a surreal occasion. Tony Pulis, their manager for 464 games, was afforded a rapturous reception on his first return to Britannia Stadium and then watched his West Bromwich Albion side elevate themselves from the foot of the table thanks to a maiden goal from his, and their, record signing Salomón Rondón. With a rapid rethink, Pulis helped engineer Albion’s first victory of the season. Yet while the opportunistic Welshman profited, his triumph owed rather more to his former club’s indiscipline.\n\nStoke remain winless after sabotaging their chances with twin instances of needless petulance. Two midfielders were sent off within the first 31 minutes and their manager, Mark Hughes, could not recall being reduced to nine men as quickly in his long career. He blamed the referee, Michael Oliver, but Ibrahim Afellay and Charlie Adam were the architects of their undoing. “We are devastated we have lost to a team we think, 11 versus 11, we would have beaten them quite comfortably,” said Hughes. Stoke still seemed the more progressive with 10. They stood little chance with nine.\n\nWest Bromwich Albion sign Jonny Evans for £6m from Manchester United Read more\n\nSupposedly constructive players showed their self-destructive streaks. Xherdan Shaqiri’s home debut seemed to herald another stage in Stoke’s progress but, with barely half an hour remaining, he was the sole survivor of their creative contingent. Three attacking midfielders had become one.\n\nAfellay departed first. He was fouled and goaded by Craig Gardner but responded by slapping the Albion midfielder’s face. “By the letter of the law, if you raise your hands, you have to go,” said Hughes. “Gardner has scraped his face so if he is sending Afellay off, he has to send Gardner off.”\n\nSix minutes later, Adam beat another ignominious exit. As he was tackled by Craig Dawson, the West Brom right-back went to ground. Amid a tangle of legs, the Scot stamped on Dawson’s thigh. The observant Oliver duly expelled Adam. “You will have to ask Charlie if it is deliberate,” said Hughes, who is considering whether to appeal against the red card. “At that point, common sense should have prevailed.”\n\nStoke’s immediate response to going down to 10 men had been positive. Mame Biram Diouf lobbed Boaz Myhill but, with Gareth McAuley putting him under pressure, he headed over the unguarded goal.\n\nWhen they were down to nine, however, Albion took the initiative. If Pulis’ initial 4-1-4-1 formation seemed unambitious, he was now confronted by a Stoke side playing 4-4-0. Off came defensive midfielder Claudio Yacob, rendered surplus to requirements by the dismissals of Afellay and Adam, and on went forward Rickie Lambert.\n\nThe merits of a strike pairing soon became clear. Lambert picked out Rondón and the Venezuelan angled his header back across goal to find the far corner of the net. Jack Butland, who had saved superbly from James Morrison earlier, was given no chance. “Salomon’s movement was first class,” said Pulis. “Lambert’s pass and his finish were very good.”\n\nIt was the first repayment on the £12 million investment Albion made in their biggest buy. The travelling Baggies launched into a rendition of “Da Doo Rondon”, the Crystals-inspired addition to their songbook and the Stoke supporters concentrated on booing Oliver but their team rallied.\n\n“If we hadn’t shown great desire and drive, we would have gone under very quickly,” said Hughes, whose nine remaining men sporadically threatened an equaliser. Yet Pulis had greater cause for satisfaction. He has won 1-0 in each of his three meetings with Stoke since his 2013 sacking and added: “The respect I got today is special. It was a wonderful reception. They are a special lot.”"}, {"date": "29/08/2015", "arena": "White Hart Lane", "attendance": 35865, "home_team": {"name": "Tottenham Hotspur", "lineup": [{"name": "Hugo Lloris", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Walker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Toby Alderweireld", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jan Vertonghen", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Rose", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eric Dier", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nabil Bentaleb", "yellows": [59], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mousa Dembélé", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [53]}, {"name": "Ryan Mason", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [85]}, {"name": "Nacer Chadli", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harry Kane", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Erik Lamela", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Michel Vorm", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Trippier", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dele Alli", "yellows": [56], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [53], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Pritchard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [85], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Carroll", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Davies", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bryan Oviedo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [69]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [69], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyias Browning", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matthew Pennington", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "It is, perhaps, a microcosm of the zanily intense world we have constructed around young English footballers that powerful spotlights homed in on two of the most promising talents to emerge over the last season or so.

We don’t need to talk too much. We need to be calm and not put too much pressure on his shoulders. Maybe it will do him good to go away with England.”\n\nSuch is the cyclical life of goalscorers, there are times when those fractions that can be the difference between a ball ending up nestled in the net, or agonisingly wide, or foiled by a goalkeeper that probably seems 10 feet tall, loom large. So it is for Kane.\n\nTottenham Hotspur 0-0 Everton: Premier League - as it happened | Barry Glendenning Read more\n\nTim Howard produced a superb instinctive save to deny Kane in one of the game’s defining moments. That helped to deliver a well earned point to extend Everton’s positive start to the season. Martínez was delighted with the efforts, acknowledging that character was required to overcome a touch of fatigue after a demanding cup tie in midweek at Barnsley while Tottenham were able to prepare more restfully.\n\nThis goalless draw left Tottenham mulling over a frustrating period. There were a few boos at the end as the home crowd digested a fourth game without a win. The last time they started a season like that Juande Ramos was the manager and he did not last all that much longer.\n\nThere is no such edge surrounding Pochettino, who is looking forward to having some of his other attacking options at his disposal. Christian Eriksen, plus the new signings Clinton Njie and Son Heung-min, will be ready to take part soon enough.\n\nTottenham had by far the best of the chances but either their own tension in front of goal or the marvels of Howard intervened. Pochettino tried Ryan Mason as an attacking point in a free role behind Kane, and he too had a number of opportunities. Nacer Chadli was another who might have won it for the home team but this was not a day for ruthlessness.\n\nHoward was so influential. In the 22nd minute the lead gaped for Tottenham. Every pair of eyes in the ground homed in on Kane, waiting for that first goal of the season, as he raced on to Mason’s clever through ball. There seemed to be a split second of hesitation as the striker glanced to see what was around him. He shimmied, then shot, but was denied by some evergreen Howard excellence. The American thrust out a leg to deflect what would have been a certain goal.\n\nHoward produced a variety of saves, a mini-masterclass of sorts, to see off Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Toby Alderweireld. Martinez said his keeper was “immense”.\n\nThere were worrying injuries for Tom Cleverley, with damaged ligaments an early prognosis, and Mousa Dembélé, who hurt his foot. Both managers departed with some food for thought. Pochettino regretted that Tottenham do not have the points he feels they merit from the first four games. Martínez was buzzing about the potential in his team.\n\nThe Stones experience has reaffirmed something in the way he feels about his club. The player, he reckons, has changed too, become stronger. “Take things like this the right way and you can mature, the wrong way they can really affect you,” he said. “He has become mature. The sign of this performance was of a man who has the potential to be an England captain. John is a big part of our project and it was great to see our football club show a really strong face.\n\n“Let’s protect our young players and not put them under massive pressure.” Wishful thinking, maybe, but an admirable sentiment."}, {"date": "24/08/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium", "attendance": 60080, "home_team": {"name": "Arsenal", "lineup": [{"name": "Petr Cech", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Hector Bellerin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Calum Chambers", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gabriel Paulista", "yellows": [65], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nacho Monreal", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Francis Coquelin", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [82]}, {"name": "Santi Cazorla", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Aaron Ramsey", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mesut Özil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexis Sánchez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Olivier Giroud", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [73]}], "subs": [{"name": "Mathieu Debuchy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kieran Gibbs", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mikel Arteta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "David Ospina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Theo Walcott", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [73], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [82], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Mathieu Flamini", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Liverpool", "lineup": [{"name": "Simon Mignolet", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathaniel Clyne", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Martin Skrtel", "yellows": [61], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dejan Lovren", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joe Gomez", "yellows": [79], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Milner", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lucas Leiva", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Emre Can", "yellows": [66], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Roberto Firmino", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [63]}, {"name": "Christian Benteke", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philippe Coutinho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}], "subs": [{"name": "Mamadou Sakho", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alberto Moreno", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Divock Origi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Danny Ings", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordon Ibe", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [63], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Adam Bogdan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jordan Rossiter", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "This was Arsenal at their most bewildering. They were startlingly poor for so long Liverpool will have to consider this result a source of regret. Arsène Wenger’s men demonstrated some familiar flaws before shaking their heads clear and cannot expect to win the league by playing so chaotically. Yet they could also claim, legitimately, they would have won but for a trigger-happy linesman. It was a perplexing, error-strewn match, full of missed chances and misplaced passes, and neither team can be fully satisfied with the outcome.\n\nFor Liverpool there were so many opportunities inside the first half they really ought to have punished Wenger’s team for being so vulnerable. Petr Cech made amends in those moments for his errors against West Ham on the opening weekend and, ultimately, his goalkeeping was the key factor during the spells when Arsenal looked as if they might lose their opening two league games at home for the first time since 1949.\n\nArsène Wenger rejects Gary Neville attack after Arsenal-Liverpool 0-0 Read more\n\nOn the flipside a case can also be made that Arsenal, for all their shortcomings, could conceivably have pulled off a perplexing and eccentric victory. They will reflect on the first-half goal that was wrongly disallowed for Aaron Ramsey, as well as the chance Olivier Giroud aimed too close to Simon Mignolet during their late onslaught, and it finished, almost implausibly, with their first clean sheet of the season. As goalless draws go, it was wild and entertaining but maybe not such a bad result for Arsenal given how fragile they look, with Laurent Koscielny suffering a back injury and Per Mertesacker having a virus.\n\nArsenal had not started a Premier League game with both their regular centre-halves missing for 1,225 days and perhaps it was inevitable there would be times when their new-look defence looked susceptible. Even so, it must have been alarming for Wenger to see how dishevelled they were in the first half, when Calum Chambers was a danger to his own team. Chambers passed the ball straight to Philippe Coutinho, inside Arsenal’s penalty area, at one point and there were plenty of other moments when the home side looked raw and accident-prone.\n\nIt was rare to see any side, let alone one with title credentials, give the ball away so frequently inside their own half and, even allowing for their absentees, their supporters must have found it jarring to see their lack of organisation, carelessness in defence and tendency to make life difficult for themselves. Wenger admitted later he was “always tempted” to take off Chambers at half-time.\n\nHis team did, though, take much better care of the ball in the second half, when their opponents operated on the counterattack rather than flooding forward as they had done earlier. Liverpool, with James Milner excelling, still looked dangerous on the break but Arsenal at least reminded everyone in that period they were supposed to be the home side. Alexis Sánchez struck the outside of the post and it needed a brilliant saving tackle from Martin Skrtel to prevent the substitute Theo Walcott going clear on goal in the final exchanges.\n\nLiverpool were pinned back and it was all in stark contrast to the first half when, for Chambers, it was a personal ordeal. Coutinho had struck the crossbar inside the opening three minutes. Another peach of a shot from the Brazilian came off the post, via Cech’s fingertips, and only Francis Coquelin’s saving tackle denied Coutinho after the early Chambers mistake. The pressure on Arsenal’s goal was almost relentless and yet, for all Liverpool’s superiority, Wenger was entitled to think the game would have taken a different pattern had the linesman Simon Bennett not ruled out what was, in reality, a perfectly legitimate and brilliantly executed goal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsenal wrongly denied match-winning goal, says Arsène Wenger.\n\nAt this level it was a wretched piece of officiating. Ramsey was in line with Liverpool’s defence and the through-ball from Santi Cazorla was weighted to perfection. Ramsey beat Mignolet with a low shot and Liverpool, for a second consecutive week, were the grateful recipients of an inaccurate offside decision.\n\nReprieved, Liverpool returned to the business of exploring the holes in Arsenal’s defence. Christian Benteke had his best game for his new club but Liverpool must have been hugely exasperated not to make their first-half superiority count. For that Arsenal were indebted to Cech and, in particular, one moment when he kept out Benteke with the kind of save that only the elite goalkeepers can pull off.\n\nHéctor Bellerín had given the ball away this time. Roberto Firmino crossed from the left and Benteke was inside the six-yard area when he drew back his foot. Cech’s reflexes and anticipation were staggering. His left hand jutted out and that touch was enough to take the ball away from the goal.\n\nThe pressure on Liverpool’s goal was considerable during the final stages but Skrtel held firm and there were impressive performances from their new full-backs, Nathaniel Clyne and Joe Gomez,.

The bad news for José Mourinho to digest is that the champions continue to look like an accident waiting to happen at the back, with John Terry following his humiliating half-time substitution at Manchester City last Sunday with a straight red card here.\n\nQuite what Mourinho screamed into the pitchside microphone at the final whistle is unclear – the Portuguese claimed that he was singing – but there is no escaping the fact that Chelsea made hard work of what could have been a routine win and that there is a vulnerability about them defensively that is hard to reconcile with the team that strangled the life out of opponents last season. Three games into the season and Chelsea have already conceded seven times and picked up two red cards.\n\nPedro’s brilliance cannot blind José Mourinho to the case against his defence Read more\n\nThe spotlight, inevitably, will shine on Terry. Mourinho chose his words carefully when asked about the dismissal of the Chelsea captain but it was plain to see that he was deeply frustrated with Mark Clattenburg’s decision. Tony Pulis, Albion’s manager, also felt that it was a little harsh.\n\nTerry, however, was exposed by Chris Brunt’s long ball and he was tugging at Salomón Rondón with his left hand as he tried to make up ground on the powerful Albion striker, who was bearing down on goal. From the moment that Clattenburg decided it was a foul there was only going to be one outcome.\n\nWhen James Morrison scored his second of the afternoon five minutes later to bring the score back to 3-2 it was tempting to wonder whether The Hawthorns, which has proved to be such a graveyard for Chelsea managers in recent years – Roberto di Matteo and André Villas-Boas both lost their jobs after defeats here – was about to witness another famous Albion result.\n\nCallum McManaman, who was lively throughout, came within inches of equalising after sitting Branislav Ivanovic on his backside and curling narrowly wide of Thibaut Courtois’s far post, yet there were also plenty of chances for Chelsea to put an absorbing game to bed at the other end.\n\nPedro was often the architect on a day when he introduced himself to the Chelsea supporters with a sparkling performance that included a goal and an assist on his debut. He was, in short, a joy to watch and in the process highlighted what a shrewd piece of business it was on Chelsea’s part to sign the 28-year-old from Barcelona from under Manchester United’s nose.\n\nNot everyone in a Chelsea shirt looked quite so comfortable on a miserable afternoon in the Black Country. Nemanja Matic was guilty of a clumsy challenge on McManaman that ended with Clattenburg pointing to the spot and Morrison striking a kick straight down the middle that Courtois saved with a trailing leg. Matic was later booked for a foul on McManaman and Morrison beat him to the ball to glance home Albion’s second.\n\nSaido Berahino would normally have had the responsibility of taking the penalty that Morrison missed but Pulis felt that the striker, who scored from the spot against Chelsea in the corresponding game last season, was not in the right frame of mind to play because of Tottenham Hotspur’s pursuit of him.\n\nAlthough Berahino was missed, Albion’s problems were at the other end of the pitch as Chelsea carved them open with alarming ease in the first half. The opening goal arrived following a lovely exchange between Eden Hazard and Pedro, who started from deep and continued his run before sweeping a left-footed shot into the corner via a slight deflection off Jonas Olsson.\n\nCosta, with his first goal of the season, got Chelsea’s second after sliding in Pedro’s diagonal shot to finish off a wonderful counterattacking move that owed much to César Azpilicueta’s superb cross-field pass to Willian. “Chelsea are back‚” was the chant from the travelling supporters.\n\nMorrison, atoning for his earlier miss, drilled home Rondón’s acrobatic cutback to pull a goal back for Albion but within seven minutes Chelsea had a third. Costa, holding off a challenge from Gareth McAuley with his back to goal, expertly steered the ball into the path of Azpilicueta, who lost his marker McManaman and beat Myhill at the near post to register his first Premier League goal. Chelsea appeared to be coasting at that point but the drama was still to come.\n\nMan of the match Pedro (Chelsea)"}, {"date": "23/08/2015", "arena": "Goodison Park", "attendance": 38523, "home_team":

The hosts also worked tirelessly to contain David Silva’s influence and prevent Sergio Agüero devastating their defence as he did John Terry and co the previous weekend.\n\nManchester City are working to get even better, says Manuel Pellegrini Read more\n\nAgain City’s class told with Raheem Sterling and Yaya Touré producing superb assists for the goals. Crucially, given last term’s indifferent title defence, their appetite to fight for every second ball, every challenge and every point was equally impressive. Agüero typified the industry by dispossessing Gareth Barry in central midfieldto the delight of the travelling support. It is very early days, of course, but City already appear a level apart. Sterling has settled in a manner few who witnessed his final months at Liverpool would have anticipated while Mangala looks more assured than at any point in his brief Premier League career. The prospect of more to come is an ominous signal to their rivals.\n\nThis was an absorbing affair that demonstrated the early-season promise of both sides, although only the visitors could sustain it. Everton were pinned back frequently and had to be patient without the ball as City, through the mesmerising double act of Silva and Agüero, wove their intricate patterns on the edge of the home penalty area. Yet Tim Howard, Phil Jagielka and the focused John Stones held firm for an hour and, as in the 3-0 win at Southampton last weekend, Martínez’s side carried a potent threat on the counterattack. Tom Cleverley’s quick feet and thinking allied to Aroune Koné’s tireless running ensured Lukaku was not the only preoccupation for City’s diligent defence.\n\nAgüero began in the same menacing fashion that broke Chelsea last Sunday. Only 80 seconds had elapsed when he forced Howard to save with his legs with a blistering shot from a tight angle. He was again denied by the Everton goalkeeper after peeling away from Jagielka to meet an inviting cross from Jesús Navas with another low drive. Howard also saved from Silva and saw Sterling just miss the Spaniard’s pass across the face of goal, and all before Everton had orchestrated an attack of their own.\n\nBarkley posed the first test to Joe Hart and was instrumental in carrying the game to City whenever Everton broke. The England international’s confidence appears visibly improved after two goals in the opening two games of the season and it was his pass that led to Lukaku sidestepping Hart and converting past two City defenders on the goal line. Unfortunately for the Belgium international, an eagle-eyed assistant referee spotted he was fractionally offside. Seamus Coleman went close, Barkley wastefully skied a dangerous free-kick from 20 yards and Lukaku shaved the crossbar with another set-piece attempt with Hart rooted to the spot.\n\nPellegrini’s team controlled much of the contest despite Touré being in evident discomfort. The Ivory Coast international required lengthy treatment to his groin in the warm-up and was restricted in his movement – though not his touch – throughout. But in Navas and particularly Sterling, afforded the inevitable Liverpool-ex reception by the Everton faithful, City had the pace to penetrate and force the home defence deep.\n\nThe former Anfield man made an influential mark on his Merseyside return. With an hour gone City turned the tables on Everton and hit on the counter. Agüero released Sterling down the left and the winger waited for Stones to commit himself in the area before rolling a perfectly weighted pass into the overlapping Kolarov on his blind side. The left-back, played onside by Jagielka, shaped to cross but steered a fine finish inside Howard’s near post instead. The USA international was beaten far too easily for both City goals.\n\nBut for a brief flurry, when Vincent Kompany cleared off the line from a Barry header, Everton failed to produce a convincing response. The game was settled with two minutes remaining when the substitute Nasri played a neat one-two with Touré and, with the struggling James McCarthy guilty of ball watching, raced on to the midfielder’s glorious flick to loft the ball over Howard. It was another impressive statement of intent by the men from the Etihad Stadium.\n\nMan of the match David Silva (Manchester City)"}, {"date": "23/08/2015", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20166, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho Gomes", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Allan Nyom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastian Prödl", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Craig Cathcart", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Holebas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Etienne Capoue", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Valon Behrami", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Ikechi Anya", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Odion Ighalo", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Manuel Jurado", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Troy Deeney", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Alessandro Diamanti", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Britos", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Fernando Forestieri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Miguel Layún", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Almen Abdi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ben Watson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Giedrius Arlauskis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Caulker", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [57], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [28], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [25]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kelvin Davis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [25], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cuco Martina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juanmi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "There are some afternoons that you never get back. This was one of them. Étienne Capoue, however, will be happy to forget it. In a game that had 0-0 written all over it, Watford’s record signing had the opportunity to tear up the script.\n\nEverton 0-2 Manchester City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe clock had creaked to the 66th minute when Troy Deeney flicked on from a corner and there was Capoue, three yards out and with the goal gaping. The ball came to him quickly and it was slightly behind him but jaws dropped to the floor around the ground when he headed up and over the crossbar. The attempt appeared to come off his shoulder.\n\nWatford remain unbeaten and their Premier League tenure is still at the stage where any point feels as though it is one gained. But the manager, Quique Flores, has to hope that his radically remodelled squad will find greater cohesion in the weeks ahead. He could also lament a bad miss from Odion Ighalo. His team had no shots on target.\n\nFor Southampton, there was little to cheer – apart from the clean sheet, after the defensive wobbles from their opening matches – and the negatives included a hip injury that forced off Sadio Mané in the 25th minute. Ronald Koeman, the manager, said that the damage did not look too bad and he hopes to have the forward, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United, available for Thursday’s Europa League play-off second leg at Midtjylland.\n\nKoeman has given the impression that he is groping for the right tactical blend, as he incorporates the club’s latest influx of new signings – there were four of them in his starting lineup here – and he switched to a three-man defence, with the wing-backs asked to provide the width. After the concession of five goals in the first two league fixtures, Koeman could, at least, be happy that Watford were stymied. Further forward, though, Southampton were error-strewn and lacking incision.\n\nThis team is a work in slow progress and so are Watford, after the churn of the summer transfer window. So far, 11 new players have arrived and there is the prospect of more to come. Flores started with six of the new boys and he introduced a seventh – Alessandro Diamanti – as a half-time substitute for his debut.\n\nFlores was grilled over why he omitted Matej Vydra from the squad – the striker starred for the club last season and he has now made his loan move from Udinese permanent – but the manager said that he was working with 30 players, and he could only include so many. There will have to be cuts before he submits his squad after the deadline.\n\nWest Brom 2-3 Chelsea | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe entertainment value was non-existent, with Allan Nyom’s ninth-minute shot which almost hit the corner flag setting the tone. José Holebas made a sweet connection with a drive but it whacked into his team-mate, Deeney, while the Southampton substitute Shane Long jinked through but he could not muster power in his shot. Ikechi Anya was willing and he fizzed a low centre across goal on 41 minutes but the ball went through Ighalo’s legs at the far post.\n\nGraziano Pellè worked Heurelho Gomes at the near post on 50 minutes and Long headed over from the ensuing corner while there was the detail of Oriol Romeu collecting his third booking in three games for Southampton. Romeu cut through the back of Capoue, and it looked extremely painful. Worse, though, was to follow for the Watford midfielder.\n\nMan of the match José Fonte (Southampton)"}, {"date": "22/08/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75354, "home_team": {"name":

conceded a goal even with David de Gea sitting in the stands, wishing for the day presumably when Old Trafford did not feel like a five-star prison and he could finally wear Real Madrid’s colours. Yet this was a difficult and exasperating afternoon for Louis van Gaal’s team and their shortcomings will only add to the theory that they lack the firepower to be authentic title challengers.\n\nThose flaws have become a recurring theme on Van Gaal’s watch and – an easy line, perhaps – they could certainly have done with Pedro’s penetrative qualities as they desperately sought to unlock Newcastle’s obstinate defence. Van Gaal’s men played every pass apart from the killer one. Their lack of incision must have been startling for a crowd imploring “attack, attack, attack” and if Kyle Walker’s own goal on the opening weekend were excluded, Adnan Januzaj’s winning strike at Aston Villa is the only time they have beaten the opposition goalkeeper.\n\nLouis van Gaal insists Manchester United do not need a new striker Read more\n\nFor a club with their traditions, it is a bland way to lead life. Van Gaal denied it was a problem but there are times when the crowd must pine for Sir Alex Ferguson’s chance-taking, the late moments of drama and “football, bloody hell” moments. There have not been so many since he left but Van Gaal shook his head when he was asked whether their goals output was a concern. “No,” he said. “Because we were three times the better team.”\n\nAs for questions about Wayne Rooney’s listless form, Van Gaal insisted his captain had scored a perfectly legitimate goal, arguing that there should be more technology available for the referee and his assistants. The strangest part was that his analysis came after watching the slow-motion replays. The freeze-frame pictures demonstrated the offside decision was marginal, yet correct.\n\nRooney had little joy against Newcastle’s centre-halves, Fabricio Colocinni and Steven Taylor, both of whom were excellent, and was eventually moved back into his old No 10 role so Javier Hernández could take over as the principal point of attack. Newcastle defended with great togetherness once they had recovered from an opening 20-minute blitz and, in the process, they ended their run of seven successive away defeats. Their improvement under Steve McClaren – or, to put it another way, without John Carver – already looks considerable and, having survived the early onslaught, they maybe deserved the touch of fortune when Chris Smalling’s header came back off the post in stoppage time.\n\n“Surviving the first 20 minutes was the key,” McClaren said. “We survived that and grew into the game, to the point where we might have nicked it. The attitude, organisation and discipline – everything you need to get a result here – was there. After that, you need a bit of luck, and we had that, too.”\n\nThey also had a goalkeeper, Tim Krul, who was on top of his form, particularly with his first-half save to keep out Juan Mata’s low drive and late on when he charged off his goalline to smother Hernández’s shot, in their most inviting opportunity of the second half.\n\nYet there were pockets of the match when Newcastle emerged as an attacking threat in their own right. Georginio Wijnaldum excelled in midfield, always wanting the ball and distributing it with great accuracy, and the away team will reflect on the moment midway through the first half when Aleksandar Mitrovic’s towering header came back off the crossbar from Chancel Mbemba’s cross.\n\nMemphis Depay, Wijnaldum’s former team-mate at PSV Eindhoven, made it a difficult day for Mbemba, who was deputising for the suspended Daryl Janmaat on the right of Newcastle’s defence, but his performance did not entirely please his manager. Depay’s two goals against Club Brugge in midweek had, according to Van Gaal, given him “maybe too much” self-belief. “Today he didn’t always make the best choice,” he said. “But that is the characteristic of a young player and the Premier League is not easy.”\n\nDepay still created lots of issues for Newcastle’s back four whereas it is tempting to wonder whether, deep down, Van Gaal is more troubled by Rooney’s lack of dynamism than he lets on. Januzaj did not create a great deal either and a lot of the home side’s most effective attacks came when Luke Shaw burst forward from the left-back position. Shaw has started the season superbly in a defence that, for the most part, has prevented opponents from examining Sergio Romero’s credentials more closely.\n\nSmalling’s header came from a corner but, incredibly, in the next attack Newcastle had a splendid chance to win the match, breaking three-on-one, only for the substitute Papiss Cissé to drag his shot wide.\n\nA goal at that stage would have been incredibly harsh on the home side bearing in mind the spells of almost relentless pressure on Krul’s goal and the fact they accumulated more shots on target inside the opening 20 minutes than their first two games against Spurs and Villa combined.

So it proved at Selhurst Park as Bakary Sako crowned his Crystal Palace debut with the winning goal three minutes from time in a match he was not even supposed to be playing in.\n\nA late call-up to replace Yannick Bolasie, after the death of the Democratic Republic of Congo winger’s father on Friday, the free signing had fluffed his lines badly on two occasions before finally finding his shooting boots when it mattered most to end Villa’s hopes of leaving with a point.\n\nIt was, as Alan Pardew admitted afterwards, the dream debut, even if the Palace manager freely admitted he had reservations about signing the 27-year-old after his contract with Wolves had expired at the end of last season.\n\n“The chairman deserves a little bit of credit because he kept pushing for him,” Pardew said. “I was saying we needed a left-back – I’d love Sako but perhaps we just need a bit more cover. But we got him so the chairman deserves a little pat on the back.\n\n“Ironically he wasn’t going to start today because Yala would have started for sure,” he added. “Yala was in a great space and, bless his heart, he had some terrible news about his father so that win was for him and his family and hopefully that gives him a lift.”\n\nHaving lost seven of their 12 games at Selhurst Park since Pardew’s arrival in January, you could sense the relief among the home support at the final whistle. Villa had dominated the first half thanks to a vibrant display from Jack Grealish, who was making his first start of the season having recovered from a hamstring problem. And after Palace took the lead through Scott Dann, the visitors quickly drew level courtesy of a mesmerising cameo from Adama Traoré.\n\nSigned from Barcelona for an initial £7m, the Spain youth international forced Pape Souaré to stick out a leg that diverted the ball past Alex McCarthy. But Tim Sherwood’s delight turned to anger as a mistake from the young French left-back Jordan Amavi allowed Dann to set up Sako for the game’s defining moment.\n\n“What you see is what you get with young players – you saw Traoré light it up and he’s got no fear,” said the Villa manager. “But on the flip side you see a young boy and outstanding player in Amavi make the wrong decision at the wrong time to take someone on that late in the game, and unfortunately we came away with nothing.”\n\nPardew had rung the changes at half-time as Palace struggled to find their rhythm and looked like a team with too many players in unfamiliar roles.\n\nThe introduction of Dwight Gayle and Jordon Mutch for Wilfried Zaha and Glenn Murray had the desired effect, with the home side improving and Sako soon wasting a gilt-edged opportunity to give his side the lead.\n\nThen came a moment of controversy. James McArthur appeared to check his run as Gayle took aim at goal but there was no doubt he was offside as the ball touched his chest on the way through, even if at first the assistant referee Peter Kirkup did not raise his flag and the goal was initially given, only to subsequently be disallowed. Incensed by the perceived injustice, Palace went on the attack and Sako should have made amends for his earlier miss but smashed his shot wide of the post after more good work from McArthur.\n\nThey did not have to wait long to take the lead as Dann rose highest to meet Jason Puncheon’s corner. Traoré’s intervention looked like being the last critical action until Amavi’s rush of blood gave Sako the final word.\n\n“Once he got it on to that left foot I was actually quite confident that he would find the corner because in training he’s been hitting that with real venom,” reflected Pardew on his match-winner. “He will be a real asset for us.”\n\nFor the dejected Sherwood, there was still plenty of encouragement. “I thought we played well, we quietened this crowd in the first half. We created chances and unfortunately we were unable to take them. Palace came out a better side in the second half. They scored, we managed to wrestle our way back in, so to lose with three minutes to go was devastating.”"}, {"date": "22/08/2015", "arena": "The King Power Stadium", "attendance": 31971, "home_team":

spirit and their penchant for dramatic fightbacks.\n\nDele Alli’s headed goal for Tottenham Hotspur nine minutes from time turned out to be the trigger for an onslaught by Leicester that brought an almost instant equaliser from the irrepressible Riyad Mahrez and very nearly a winning goal for the hosts, as Hugo Lloris made a late save to thwart Wes Morgan.\n\nLeicester remain unbeaten and, unbelievably to the many tipsters who pegged them pre-season as relegation certainties, they also remain top of the league at this early stage of the campaign. Spurs, meanwhile, were again left lamenting their tendency to concede late goals, Mahrez’s strike following the two that Stoke struck at White Hart Lane last week.\n\nThere had been little early indication that this match would reach such a hectic conclusion. Indeed, when the referee ordered drinks breaks midway through each half due to the intense heat, there were mutterings that the players seemed in need of some sort of legal stimulus. The first such break was followed by the game’s first shot on target, Kasper Schmeichel being forced to push away a low drive by Mousa Dembélé in the 28th minute.\n\nThe Tinkerman tag may stick to Claudio Ranieri but the Italian saw no reason to alter a team that had won their opening two matches and he deployed the same lineup for the third successive match. The home side’s roster of substitutes, meanwhile, offered evidence of a club intent on pursuing an impressive gradual makeover, with this week’s latest recruit, the Swiss international Gokhan Inler, taking his place on a bench that featured £30m worth of talent. For all that, the first half was poor.\n\nRanieri said the heat sapped the energy from his normally effervescent side, while Spurs seemed to be suffering from the loss of Christian Eriksen, ruled out by a minor knee injury in the buildup.\n\nThe Dane’s absence meant the service to Harry Kane was patchy. The striker toiled alone for much of the match and even though Mauricio Pochettino insisted afterwards that there is no reason for Kane to be unable to continue carrying such a burden for the entire season, it is easy to see why Spurs are interested in signing another striker, notably West Bromwich Albion’s Saido Berahino.\n\nMahrez and Marc Albrighton launched several raids in the first half but were repelled with relative ease, although Leicester fans protested that their team should have been given a penalty, when Mahrez went down under a challenge from Jan Vertonghen in the 42nd minute. Mahrez went closer in the 69th minute, when his 10-yard shot bounced out off the bottom of the post.\n\nThat effort came against the run of play, as Spurs improved in the second half and took charge of midfield. Kyle Walker presented Nacer Chadli with a chance to open the scoring after 48 minutes but the Belgian sent his shot skywards from 12 yards. Érik Lamela again contributed little after being drafted in to deputise for Eriksen and was replaced by Alli in the 65th minute. The 19-year-old made a much stronger impression and crowned a positive performance with a goal, stooping to head in Chadli’s cross from close range.\n\nLast season’s great escape from relegation should have forewarned the visitors of Leicester’s capacity to come back from adversity but Spurs celebrated so hard that they lost concentration. Within 25 seconds of the restart Leicester were level, Mahrez dashing into the box to fire past Lloris after collecting a knock-down from Jamie Vardy. “All managers want players like Vardy, he is a warrior, he never gives up,” said Ranieri. The watching Roy Hodgson may have made a similar note.\n\nAs if fuelled by an elixir Leicester went for the kill, the King Power Stadium heaving with now-familiar fanatical support. Having thought they were on the verge of their first win of the season, Spurs found themselves clinging to a point. Lloris parried a close-range header from Morgan with his chest to keep the scores level.\n\n“Until we scored we deserved to win,” said Pochettino. “But then we made some mistakes and we conceded chances and they scored and then in a few minutes we conceded some more chances. It’s a little bit of a shame because I think we dominated the second half. We need to compete better because we conceded two goals in the last few minutes against Stoke and have now done so again so that will be my focus next week.”"}, {"date": "22/08/2015", "arena": "Carrow Road", "attendance": 26771, "home_team": {"name": "Norwich City", "lineup": [{"name": "John Ruddy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Whittaker", "yellows": [82], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Russell Martin", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [28], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sebastien Bassong", "yellows": [47], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Robbie Brady", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Nathan Redmond", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Graham Dorrans", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Alexander Tettey", "yellows": [62], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonny Howson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [86]}, {"name": "Wes Hoolahan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [77]}, {"name": "Cameron Jerome", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Andre Wisdom", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Bradley Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [77], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Lewis Grabban", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Hooper", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Declan Rudd", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ryan Bennett", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary O'Neil", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [86], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Stoke City", "lineup": [{"name": "Jack Butland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Glen Johnson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Geoff Cameron", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Muniesa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Erik Pieters", "yellows": [85], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marco van Ginkel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Glenn Whelan", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Xherdan Shaqiri", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ibrahim Afellay", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Marko Arnautovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [57]}, {"name": "Mame Biram Diouf", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [11], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Stephen Ireland", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Joselu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [57], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Marc Wilson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Charlie Adam", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shay Given", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Peter Crouch", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Philipp Wollscheid", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "A tale of two cities ended all square as Norwich City squandered enough good chances to win several football matches. On a day when Xherdan Shaqiri made his eagerly anticipated Premier League debut, the unlikely sight of the Swiss international in a Stoke shirt was one of several highlights of a match that finished with many players on their knees suffering exhaustion. Both sets of supporters were warmly appreciative of their efforts.\n\nA record-breaking £12m acquisition from Internazionale, Shaqiri began and ended the game on the right flank, worked judiciously in attack and defence and took just over 10 minutes to make his mark. A dim-witted handball from Robbie Brady, who was attempting to control a cross-field pass, gifted Stoke a free-kick. Shaqiri pinged the ball towards the far post where, having given Alex Tettey the slip, Mame Biram Diouf enjoyed the freedom of Carrow Road to steer his header into the bottom corner.\n\n“I really enjoyed the weather,” joked an understandably rusty Shaqiri, who could be seen blowing out of his proverbial as early as the 70th minute. “I’m excited to be here. It was my first game for 90 minutes, it was good for me and for my fitness. Game by game it will be better. I am happy that I gave my first assist in my first game.”\n\nThe sweltering conditions prompted the referee Mike Dean to call an impromptu drinks reception near the technical areas after 26 minutes. Duly rehydrated, Norwich’s players restored parity as soon as play resumed. Their elixir-fuelled equaliser came from Russell Martin, who hooked a Nathan Redmond pass beyond Jack Butland after Stoke had repeatedly failed to clear the ball.\n\nTheir defenders could not argue they had not been warned: Martin and Redmond had combined seconds previously only for Butland, playing with a freshly broken index finger, to save splendidly from the central defender’s right-footed drive. Soon after, Diouf had another effort ruled out for offside, after sprinting on to a deft Marco Van Ginkel through ball to poke the ball past Ruddy from close range.\n\nWhatever Norwich are putting in the drinks of their players appears to be working. The home side came roaring out of the traps after half-time and could feasibly have scored three goals within five minutes of the restart. Put through on goal with only Butland to beat, Cameron Jerome side-footed his diagonal effort horribly wide and promptly sank his head into his hands.\n\nIt was a pose aped by Wes Hoolahan soon after, the diminutive playmaker heading wide of the upright from close range when scoring looked easier. Next up to the plate was Graham Dorrans, whose right-foot drive from distance towards the bottom corner at least forced the man of the match, Butland, to make one of several excellent second-half saves. The Stoke goalkeeper was called into action again on the hour mark, stretching every sinew to tip a goal-bound Redmond daisy-cutter around his post for a corner as Norwich ratcheted up the pressure.\n\nNorwich ended the second half as they had begun it, forcing another two marvellous saves from Butland. Jonny Howson’s low drive from distance was tipped out for a corner, from which the goalkeeper reacted well to keep out a Jerome effort from point-blank range.\n\nDespite the constant menacing threat of Diouf up front, Stoke will feel they got out of jail. With a little more finesse up front, Norwich could have won at a canter. Those predicting relegation for Alex Neil’s side may need to revisit their crystal balls. On Shaqiri’s unpredictable journey, it is next stop Luton Town."}, {"date": "22/08/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 39198, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name":

mild applause but it would be an exaggeration to suggest a corner has been turned.\n\nAlthough real encouragement was contained in promising individual performances on the part of the recent signings Jeremain Lens and Yann M’Vila, not to mention Jermain Defoe’s fine equaliser, there is a caveat. Sunderland only ended up with a point – their first of the season – and the way in which they were forced to strain every sinew to achieve it, hints at a long relegation struggle ahead.\n\nSeeing as Advocaat’s team are unlikely to be able to conjure similar foot-flat-to-the-floor performances on a weekly basis, the Championship surely beckons unless the squad is further reinforced within the coming week.\n\nAdmittedly Sunderland could conceivably have won had they been awarded a penalty after Jack Rodwell’s shot appeared to strike Ashley Williams’s arm but, at the other end, Pantilimon ran through a repertoire of stunning saves, perhaps the most notable repelling a Bafétimbi Gomis header.\n\nPlaying slightly within themselves, Swansea were not quite the vibrant ensemble who rocked José Mourinho’s world a couple of weeks ago, leaving Garry Monk torn between disappointment and a certain relief.\n\nAfter Sunderland’s comprehensive surrenders against Leicester and Norwich this represented a potential tripwire for his side. With a crowd of close on 40,000 giving Advocaat’s team the benefit of the doubt, Monk’s players swiftly realised they were in a game.\n\n“We knew there’d be a reaction from Sunderland but the crowd were incredible, they inspired them,” he said. “Towards the end of the first half we got control, we scored the goal and then in the second half we were so dominant, we created chance after chance. If it hadn’t been for some unbelievable goalkeeping from Costel Pantilimon, and one individual mistake, we’d have won.”\n\nAdvocaat did not demur. “It’s a much better feeling, I’m very happy with the team,” he said. “But it took a lot of energy, you could see Swansea has a little bit the better players. Swansea are a very good side but you could see our spirit will get results. And it was a penalty.”\n\nMonk’s side broke the impasse on the brink of half time. Kyle Naughton’s slick pass played in Gomis who held off Sebastián Coates before defying Pantilimon courtesy of a low, angled, right-foot shot from 12 yards.\n\nUntil then, Patrick van Aanholt, a liability at left back in Sunderland’s previous two games, had been much improved but, by allowing himself to be distracted by André Ayew he consequently afforded Naughton ample room to advance. As the right back celebrated Gomis’s third goal in as many games Van Aanholt, Coates and company stared fixedly at the ground.\n\nIt had been a rare concentration lapse on a day when – Lens and M’Vila excepted – Sunderland’s penchant for making blindingly obvious passes invariably lapped up by Swansea’s defence was offset by some radically upgraded defending.\n\nIf Coates again lived dangerously when he felled Jefferson Montero right on the edge of the penalty area at the outset of the second half, John O’Shea’s restoration to central defence in the place of the injured Younès Kaboul afforded the Wearsiders increased stability and organisation.\n\nAfter his demolition of Chelsea’s and then Newcastle United’s defence in the past couple of weeks, Montero seemed a little jaded, although much of the credit for his subdued state should go to Billy Jones, the home right back.\n\nLike Montero, Defoe had been a bit quiet in his less-than-preferred wide role in Advocaat’s front three but cutting in, he read Lens’s through pass to perfection before evading Lukasz Fabianski with a perfectly weighted low, right-foot shot dispatched into the bottom corner.\n\nThat equaliser came at the end of a counterattack initiated by the uber-industrious Danny Graham and faciliated by Federico Fernández’s untypical error. Driven on by a furious Jack Cork, Swansea responded by creating chance after chance. Time after time, though, Pantilimon thwarted them.\n\n“After the criticism they’d had this week Sunderland were never going to roll over,” said Monk. “The crowd inspired them to fight and, as you saw by the fouls they gave away, they fought quite hard.”"}, {"date": "22/08/2015", "arena": "Upton Park", "attendance": 34977, "home_team": {"name": "West Ham United", "lineup": [{"name": "Darren

"They have been winning friends and admiring glances, but the time had come for Bournemouth to prove that they belong at this level and Eddie Howe’s players wanted something more substantial to show for their unstinting efforts than generous pats on the head that followed narrow defeats in their first two matches. Howe’s side did not disappoint at Upton Park and heightened West Ham United’s air of vulnerability by scoring their first goals of the season and earning their first victory in the top flight of English football.\n\nThe Premier League will be a more enjoyable place for Bournemouth’s presence if they attack with this much adventure and imagination every week. Callum Wilson scored a hat-trick and although Bournemouth’s chaotic defending made the contest closer than it should have been, they were steadied by the composure of Marc Pugh after squandering their 2-0 lead at the start of the second half and deserved their 4-3 win.\n\nWest Ham’s gamble on Slaven Bilic under fire after Bournemouth debacle Read more\n\nWest Ham should learn from the way that Bournemouth steeled themselves. The move to the Olympic Stadium next summer means that relegation is unthinkable this season and they had better hope that the gamble of replacing Sam Allardyce with Slaven Bilic does not backfire. They lost for the second successive week at home, Bilic once again bemoaned his players’ inability to do the basics properly and the systematic frailties that were exposed by Leicester City last weekend were present against Bournemouth. Can this really be the same team who won at Arsenal two weeks ago?\n\nThis was an ordeal for Aaron Cresswell in particular and West Ham’s indiscipline was encapsulated by Carl Jenkinson picking up the fifth red card of Bilic’s short reign, while the sight of Kevin Nolan starting up front alongside Diafra Sakho because of injuries to Andy Carroll, Enner Valencia and Mauro Zárate highlighted the need for them to sign a striker.\n\nCharlie Austin might have had a chuckle when he heard about this defeat, bearing in mind what the club’s co-owner, David Sullivan, has had to say about paying £15m for the Queens Park Rangers striker, and West Ham should not kid themselves about Modibo Maïga coming off the bench to score moments after Wilson made it 4-2 to Bournemouth. They are crying out for attacking reinforcements and Dimitri Payet cannot create chances on his own.\n\nBournemouth arrived in east London goalless but it was not long before they reminded Darren Randolph of the torture they subjected him to when he was at Birmingham City. Deputising for the suspended Adrían, Randolph was not favoured by recent history given these were the same opponents who stuck 12 goals past him in two matches last season.\n\nNot that any blame could be attached to Randolph for any of Bournemouth’s four goals here. There was nothing he could have done to prevent them from breaking their Premier League duck in the 11th minute and West Ham were in trouble once Simon Francis had won his tussle with Cresswell on the right. Wilson’s sharp movement across Winston Reid allowed him to batter Francis’s cut-back past Randolph at the near post.\n\nBoos rang around Upton Park once Bournemouth’s superior competence became painfully apparent and there were times when it felt like a trick of the mind that Bilic was standing in the technical area instead of Allardyce.\n\nThe damage was already severe by the time James Tomkins replaced Angelo Ogbonna in central defence after 35 minutes. Cresswell had a nightmare and the left-back was culpable when Bournemouth scored again, Wilson punishing his errant pass.\n\nWest Ham were a collective shambles and their diamond system afforded their full-backs no protection. While Cresswell struggled to contain Matt Ritchie on the left, Jenkinson was tormented throughout by Max Gradel on the opposite flank and was sent off for pulling the winger back and conceding the penalty that presented Wilson with the opportunity to complete his hat-trick in the 79th minute.\n\nBournemouth should have led 3-0 at the break. Instead West Ham still had hope. Bilic brought on Matt Jarvis for Nolan and West Ham grabbed a lifeline when Joshua King tripped Mark Noble in the area in the 48th minute.\n\nNoble scored the penalty and West Ham equalised five minutes later, Cheikhou Kouyaté smashing the ball into of the roof of the net after Boruc palmed out Sakho’s shot.\n\nBournemouth could have crumbled, yet they had won the game once and they could win it again. Gradel found Pugh in space on the left and he sent Jenkinson skidding off into the distance before bending a sumptuous curler past Randolph.\n\nThere was one more scare for Bournemouth to survive, Eunan O’Kane clearing the ball off the line from Payet’s corner in the final minute of stoppage time, but they are out of the blocks."}, {"date": "17/08/2015", "arena": "Anfield", "attendance": 44102,

Two matches into the experience and Eddie Howe knows exactly what he means after a goal that never was and a goal that should never have stood condemned Bournemouth to a second successive defeat. Liverpool were relieved beneficiaries.\n\nChristian Benteke marked his Anfield debut with a winning goal that will massage his confidence and that of a Liverpool team understandably lacking fluidity, with four new faces in the starting line-up and a recently acquired, powerful centre-forward to integrate into the side. But his close-range conversion from Jordan Henderson’s inviting cross should have been disallowed with Philippe Coutinho clearly infringing every aspect of the latest offside rule.\n\nThe Brazilian is known as the “little magician” in these parts and his disappearing act in the eyes of the referee, Craig Pawson, and his assistants proved the defining moment. Bournemouth’s captain, Tommy Elphick, also had a goal harshly ruled out during a vibrant start from the visitors.\n\nArgument over Pawson’s two crucial decisions flowed back and forth but all that matters to Rodgers at the start of a crucial season in his Anfield tenure is a 100% record matched only by the two Manchester clubs and Leicester City. Two goals, two clean sheets and two victories suggest a Liverpool side that is both economical and efficient. Dominance of the ball and a genuine goal threat, Rodgers insists, will arrive in time.\n\nThe encouragement for Bournemouth, by contrast, was laced with frustration. Howe headed on to the pitch to shake hands with all the match officials after the final whistle, went to have a word and thought better of it. The Bournemouth manager went for the more diplomatic option and applauded the travelling support from the south coast instead. They had seen evidence of the big calls favouring the big clubs at first hand.\n\nJohn W Henry and Tom Werner, Liverpool’s principal owner and chairman respectively, were at Anfield to check on the redevelopment of the colossal £114m main stand and Rodgers’ more expensively assembled team. It would not have taken them long to realise both remain a work in progress as Liverpool initially struggled to match Bournemouth’s vibrancy and accuracy on the ball, before improving in time for their contentious winner.\n\nRodgers picked the same side and bench as opened the season at Stoke City last weekend, which meant summer signing Roberto Firmino biding his time among the substitutes again and no place in the match-day squad for Lucas Leiva or Mamadou Sakho. The Brazilian midfielder and France international defender, who could both exit before the close of the transfer window, were to be found sat with fellow outcasts Mario Balotelli, Fabio Borini and Jose Enrique in the back row of the directors box. They would have noted the murmurs prompted by Liverpool’s display inside ten minutes.\n\nHowe refused to be over-critical of his side’s Premier League debut last weekend, a home defeat by Aston Villa, and had fewer complaints here. Max Gradel and Matt Ritchie offered energy and invention down either flank while Callum Wilson’s movement and strength proved a constant distraction to Dejan Lovren.\n\nBournemouth thought they had the lead after five minutes when Elphick climbed above Lovren and headed Ritchie’s corner beyond the suspect grasp of Simon Mignolet. Their celebrations were curtailed when Pawson decided the central defender had leaned on the Croatia international as the pair closed in on the corner.\n\nEddie Howe’s Bournemouth need to find the missing link in attack | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nLiverpool had begun to stifle the visitors’ counter-attacks and offer more invention, inevitably through Coutinho, when the breakthrough arrived.\n\nHenderson caught out the Bournemouth defence with a corner played back to Nathaniel Clyne, then swept the full-back’s return pass into the box with a right-footed, in-swinging delivery.

Embarrassed by West Ham on the opening weekend, Arsène Wenger’s side vaulted an awkward hurdle here to kick-start their campaign proper and restore some early season equilibrium to their approach. “To come away with three points is already a little bit of a turning point for us,” offered the Frenchman post-match, his relief all too obvious. “Losing would have been a big blow mentally.”\n\nThis was a gloriously open London derby against a Crystal Palace side whose attack-minded approach should thrill in the season ahead, particularly when their own creative talents have clicked properly into gear. But such an open, free-flowing contest was always likely to have Arsenal’s juices flowing. Allowed to play, Alan Pardew having opted against recalling the out-of-favour Mile Jedinak to anchor his midfield, the visitors rejoiced.\n\nMesut Özil, Santi Cazorla and Alexis Sánchez, restored after his exertions at the Copa América, all revelled where they had been so rusty at the Emirates Stadium the previous week as Arsenal whipped up the kind of upbeat tempo they had enjoyed in the spring, when, albeit in a game of catch-up, they had been the Premier League’s resurgent force. Pardew had watched their slack display against West Ham and had spied an opportunity. “But they were a lot more intelligent and sharp here than they were last week,” he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was pleased with the ‘strong response’ on his side in their 2-1 victory against Crystal Palace\n\nThat was to Palace’s cost. The home side’s back-line was permanently stretched, their own creative talents taking too many risks in areas of the pitch where they might have been better advised to be more agricultural. Such is the risk of a bold selection against potential title challengers. The game should have been settled in the opening quarter, so rampant were Arsenal as they poured through their opponents’ porous defence. By then they led by Olivier Giroud’s first goal in more than 10 hours of top-flight football, but should have been out of sight.\n\nThe tone had been set early when Yohan Cabaye’s volley at a corner was blocked on the edge of the Arsenal penalty area, with Cazorla, Özil and Sánchez subsequently sprinting downfield against backtracking opponents. Joel Ward dived in to block the Chilean’s first attempt, with James McArthur handily placed to clear the second from the goal-line.\n\nAlex McCarthy saved smartly from Sánchez and Aaron Ramsey – he would repeat that trick late on to deny Cazorla – but was helpless for the visitors’ opener. Ward was culpable on that occasion, a heavy first touch presenting possession back to Sánchez who liberated Özil down the left. His cross was volleyed in acrobatically by the Frenchman.\n\nWenger would have been forgiven for assuming that would prove the prelude to a thrashing but Palace boast bite of their own these days. In spurning a central holding player, Pardew had urged Yannick Bolasie, Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Zaha to purr, that trio fed by the excellent McArthur and Cabaye in midfield.\n\nJust before the half-hour mark Puncheon was permitted to drift infield from the left and float a pass beyond Nacho Monreal for Bolasie to chest down to McArthur. The Scot laid the ball off for Ward, seeking to atone for his earlier error, to fizz a glorious low finish across Petr Cech and into the far corner.\n\nArsenal 0-2 West Ham | Premier League match report Read more\n\nMomentum might have been theirs thereafter had the referee, Lee Mason, considered the petty foul committed by Francis Coquelin in first-half stoppage time worthy of a second booking in four minutes. Pardew, who had considered that offence “debatable”, made a beeline for the official at the break to insist the Arsenal midfielder could not escape a third offence, only for the Frenchman to avoid another caution having been penalised for a foul on McArthur. “I’d said [to Mason at the interval] that’s Coquelin’s last chance, he can’t afford to make another challenge, and he did,” said the Palace manager. “But [Mason] didn’t make the call. He should have been sent off. Our bench thought he should have gone. Their bench did too because they took him off.”\n\nAgainst depleted opponents Palace might have thrived but, once Connor Wickham had thumped a close-range attempt from Zaha’s centre on to a post, Arsenal re-established their advantage. Héctor Bellerín ambled to the byline to clip over a centre for Sánchez, leaping above Ward, and the Chilean’s header down was inadvertently converted by Damien Delaney, stretching desperately to intercept.\n\n“We have shown our strongest points, and different aspects of our game that are vital in this league,” said Wenger. “We had a good flowing game in the first half, and had to dig in and fight in the second part.” After last week’s traumas, the improvement was timely.\n\nMan of the match Mesut Özil (Arsenal)"}, {"date": "16/08/2015", "arena": "Etihad Stadium", "attendance": 54331,

Well, apart from the two physiotherapists in Chelsea colours who came on during the first half, dropped some of their equipment, missed the fact there were two injured players rather than one and gave Manchester City’s gloating supporters the chance to add to José Mourinho’s discomfort.\n\nBy the end, Mourinho’s players looked just as confused and his medics might have to understand if the loud cries of “sacked in the morning”, followed by chants in favour of Dr Eva Carneiro, become a regular soundtrack wherever Chelsea play this season. Nothing, however, will have irritated their manager more than the way his players crumpled. They have seldom been beaten so comprehensively and, on top of everything else that has happened in the embryonic stages of the new season, Chelsea could hardly have imagined their defence of the title would get off to a more harrowing start.\n\nManuel Pellegrini rejects José Mourinho’s ‘fake result’ taunt Read more\n\nThey have shown their staying power before and it would be daft to write them off but it must be disturbing, nonetheless, for Mourinho that his team are five points behind already and locked in a game of catch-up against the side that has just subjected them to a rare, old-fashioned beating. City look stronger, fitter and more motivated than last season and even at this early stage the gap feels like a sizeable advantage. Yes, it is way too early to make snap judgments about the impact on the title race. It has, however, been long enough to ascertain that Manuel Pellegrini’s team are going to make a much better fist of it this time.\n\nCity have started the new campaign in a way that makes it feel perplexing they could not have challenged Chelsea more tenaciously last year. It was rare to see Mourinho’s team look so vulnerable and even ignoring, for one moment, the goals from Sergio Agüero, Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho, there were so many other chances for City it felt slightly preposterous for Chelsea’s manager to call it a “fake result”.\n\nMourinho’s argument was that Chelsea were the better side in the second half and, perhaps for 25 minutes, they were. Yet the rest of the match leant heavily in City’s favour and the bumper crowd of 54,331 – on the day City opened the new, vertiginous South Stand – could also reflect on four presentable chances, all falling to Agüero, before the scoring started and John Terry’s afternoon turned into a personal ordeal.\n\nManchester City 3-0 Chelsea: five talking points | Jamie Jackson Read more\n\nTerry played every single minute for Chelsea in the league last season. He had not been substituted in 177 games and his withdrawal at half-time, looking like a player in need of smelling salts, probably epitomised how the afternoon went for the champions.\n\nAgüero had given him the runaround and seemed locked in a personal duel with Asmir Begovic, deputising for Thibaut Courtois in the Chelsea goal, before his perseverance finally paid off just after the half-hour, when he turned away from Gary Cahill and expertly rolled a left-foot shot in off the post. Agüero was a constant menace and if he can avoid the injury issues that have affected him over the previous two years there can be no doubt City have the most accomplished striker in the league.\n\nChelsea have a formidable one of their own in Diego Costa but the difference between the two was laid bare here. Agüero spent the match trying to find a legitimate way past the Chelsea defence, always looking for space and an opportunity to draw back his shooting foot. Costa, on the other hand, seemed entirely preoccupied with winning free-kicks, throwing his hands in the air in barely plausible outrage and trying to pick fights that, for the most part, were only in his imagination.\n\nHe was entitled to be aggrieved by the clattering elbow that left him with a bandaged head towards the end of the first half and could easily have resulted in a red card for Fernandinho. Yet there has been a change in Costa since his hamstring problem flared up last season. His aggression can be a useful trait but it is reaching the point when it is his first tactic, and threatening only sporadically in more orthodox ways.\n\nManchester City 3-0 Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nWhat Costa could not do was make any lasting impression on a City defence where Kompany looks more like his old self and Eliaquim Mangala seems far more comfortable than before. Yaya Touré looks rejuvenated and Raheem Sterling has given City a new way to penetrate defences on the left side of attack.\n\nKompany’s goal came directly from David Silva’s corner, emulating what happened at West Bromwich last Monday, and precisely the kind of straightforward header-at-set-piece goal that a fully functioning Chelsea do not usually concede.\n\nLikewise, the shot from Fernandinho to finish off the scoring after 85 minutes was beautifully taken, lashed past Begovic from 20 yards with great power and control, but Mourinho must have noted the poor defending from Branislav Ivanovic that allowed Silva to divert the ball into the Brazilian’s path. Terry’s withdrawal might generate headlines but the truth is the Chelsea defence looked strangely susceptible. No team can expect to defend like that against these opponents and get away with it and City, with back-to-back 3-0 wins, look like they will take some stopping.\n\nMan of the match Fernandinho (Manchester City)"}, {"date": "15/08/2015", "arena": " Mary's Stadium", "attendance": 30966, "home_team": {"name": "Southampton", "lineup": [{"name": "Maarten Stekelenburg", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cédric Soares", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "José Fonte", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Maya Yoshida", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Matt Targett", "yellows": [6], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Davis", "yellows": [77], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}, {"name": "Victor Wanyama", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Dusan Tadic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [45]}, {"name": "Sadio Mané", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Shane Long", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [72]}, {"name": "Graziano Pellè", "yellows": [38], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Oriol Romeu", "yellows": [49], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [45], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jay Rodriguez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [72], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cuco Martina", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "James Ward-Prowse", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Harrison Reed", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Juanmi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Paulo Gazzaniga", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Everton", "lineup": [{"name": "Tim Howard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Seamus Coleman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Stones", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Phil Jagielka", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Brendan Galloway", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [88]}, {"name": "James McCarthy", "yellows": [75], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gareth Barry", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Arouna Kone", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [80]}, {"name": "Ross Barkley", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [84], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tom Cleverley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Romelu Lukaku", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [22, 45], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [89]}], "subs": [{"name": "Joel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kevin Mirallas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Steven Naismith", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [80], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Muhamed Besic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gerard Deulofeu", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [89], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Leon Osman", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Tyias Browning", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [88], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "Romelu Lukaku, when in his rampaging pomp, is not known as The Beast for nothing. And at St Mary’s Stadium, against a strangely subdued Southampton, the Everton striker was at his bullish best.\n\nThis was particularly the case in the first half, when he plundered two goals. And he was not too bad in the second half, either. Yet inside that huge frame beats a heart of gold – and there was no greater illustration than when he struck a female fan with a powerful shot during the pre-match warm-up. The Belgium striker jumped straight into the crowd, gave her a hug and presented her with his shirt.\n\nThen he went on to terrify Southampton.\n\n“If that’s the case,” Roberto Martínez, the Everton manager, said, “then perhaps he’ll have to hit a woman before every game. I’ll make sure that happens in his finishing routine.”\n\nLukaku, scorer of 20 goals last season but with only four in his previous 23 league outings, soon showed that he was in the mood. He bulldozed past the Southampton full-back Cédric Soares only to be brought crashing to the ground by Matt Targett. It looked inside the area but the referee, Michael Oliver, ruled otherwise.\n\nLukaku was not to be denied, heading home an Arouna Koné cross in the 22nd minute and tucking in Ross Barkley’s exquisite pass on the stroke of half-time. “When Romelu gets in situations like that, he’s a pleasure to watch,” Martínez said.\n\n“All in all, it was a very good day at the office. That’s a good way to put it. From the first second, we were outstanding in every department. And I don’t think that you will see many teams keep a clean sheet here. Sometimes, away scorelines don’t show the real truth, but this was the truth today. We took all our goals really well.\n\n“We have a lot of young players in the team but their performance was one of incredible maturity.”\n\nIt had not started too promisingly for Everton, with Lukaku launching a potentially lethal missile and the visiting fans unfurling a banner suggesting that the chairman, Bill Kenwright, should resign because of a perceived lack of spending on new players this summer. But Southampton were meek hosts, allowing Barkley to dictate the midfield and Lukaku to run amok up front – supplied mostly by the non-stop Koné.\n\n“What went wrong?” Ronald Koeman, the Southampton manager, said. “Too much, especially in that first half. We gave them too much space to play in and if you give that to Everton, you get difficulties. The whole team wasn’t aggressive enough. We won’t get points just because of what we did last season. This has to be a wake-up call.”\n\nSouthampton appeared better after the half-time break, when Koeman – still walking with the aid of crutches after achilles tendon surgery – brought on his new £5m signing Oriol Romeu. The former Chelsea and Barcelona midfielder made his mark immediately, a late challenge on James McCarthy earning him a booking.\n\nRomeu at least added a touch of physicality that had been sorely missing. Graziano Pellè, scorer in his three previous matches this season, nodded wastefully over from a Steven Davis corner. Then the Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard had to make a spectacular save to tip over a thunderous 30-yard drive from Sadio Mané. Everton soaked it up, shrugged off the danger and, after intricate approach work, made the game safe in the 84th minute. The imperious Barkley cut in from the left, looked up and curled a delightful effort past the home keeper Maarten Stekelenburg. “When Ross is running with the ball, when he’s in that mode, there’s not many better than him,” Martínez said.\n\nSouthampton, after the heroics of a seventh-place finish last season and with a European campaign ahead, now have to digest a few unpalatable truths. They must regroup and prepare for the first leg of their Europa League play-off tie against Midtjylland at St Mary’s on Thursday.\n\nEverton can be encouraged that Barkley and his young team-mates appear to possess a growing sense of unity. And it’s good that The Beast is back on top form."}, {"date": "15/08/2015", "arena": "Stadium of Light", "attendance": 41379, "home_team": {"name": "Sunderland", "lineup": [{"name": "Costel

saving Sunderland from what had seemed certain relegation last spring, she had urged him to retire. Initially he agreed – only to perform a volte-face. The reward for this U-turn? Watching the Wearsiders concede seven goals while losing their opening two games of the season to Leicester and, now, Norwich.\n\nWhen the fixture list came out Advocaat would have fancied Sunderland’s chances of having six points by now but something looks seriously amiss within a side requiring a radical rebuild.\n\nIt could have been worse. Jeremain Lens, signed from Dynamo Kyiv, was fortunate to escape dismissal for a second yellow card, while Yann M’Vila, on loan from Rubin Kazan, followed his headbutt in the reserves by raising arms to Graham Dorrans during an unpunished, but unwise, bout of push ’n’ shove.\n\nIf the refereeing was sometimes lenient, there was nothing remotely relaxed about an impressive Norwich. Alex Neil’s side belied their newly promoted status with a calm, poised assurance and incision, epitomised by Robbie Brady and the excellent Nathan Redmond. They are unlikely to meet many opponents as poor as Sunderland but, even so, Neil should be extremely proud.\n\nInitially tentative, their passing gradually became a little sharper, a little more ambitious. When, at the end of a move stemming from Lee Cattermole’s concession of possession, Brady’s delicate lay-off found Jonny Howson, the midfielder unleashed the crispest of shots which a stretching Costel Pantilimon did well to turn away.\n\nAfter initiating the ensuing short corner routine, Brady attempted a shot of his own which Pantilimon could merely parry. The ball cannoned into Russell Martin before ricocheting off his leg and on into the back of the net. Granted Pantilimon might have done better but he received no assistance from an alarmingly immobile defence.\n\nLeicester City’s Claudio Ranieri continues dream start against West Ham Read more\n\nNo matter that Martin cannot have known much about his goal, the lead was merited. Courtesy of some hospitable defending on the part of Patrick van Aanholt and the, once again, wretched Younès Kaboul, Norwich swiftly doubled it.\n\nSteven Whittaker had advanced from right back with real purpose but even he cannot have expected to sashay beyond Advocaat’s left back and left-sided central defender with such consummate ease before shooting unerringly into the bottom corner. Kaboul and Van Aanholt were far from the only guilty men. Although M’Vila showed glimpses of real quality, he also contributed some other less convincing cameos alongside an unusually insipid Cattermole in central midfield.\n\nIn the wake of more atrocious defending, Sunderland were lucky not to fall further behind when Cameron Jerome’s connection with a Redmond cross resulted in the forward shooting fractionally over the bar. Yet another Sunderland scare arrived as, shortly before half time, Redmond’s clever nutmeg wrong-footed Advocaat’s backline and permitted Dorrans to extend his left boot and send a shot whizzing narrowly wide.\n\nThe interval was greeted by an all-too familiar soundtrack from last season here: wholesale booing. Admittedly, minutes earlier Steven Fletcher’s header from a Lens cross had flown only marginally off target but it represented a rare shaft of sunlight.\n\nAdvocaat’s response was to replace a midfielder with a forward, sending Danny Graham out for the second half in place of Sebastian Larsson. Unfazed, Neil’s side responded by extending their lead and leaving Sunderland falling three goals behind for a second Saturday in succession.\n\nAn exercise in “playing between the lines” – something Sunderland cannot seem to master – it was a slick, subtle, skilful goal featuring a delightful exchange of passes between Wes Hoolahan and Redmond on the edge of the box before Redmond’s shot eluded Pantilimon.\n\nWith hope well and truly extinguished, quite a few fans rose from their seats and headed for the exits. Those Sunderland supporters that remained dropped a hint to the club’s owner. “Are you watching, Ellis Short?” they chorused, urging the American financier to loosen the purse strings.\n\nThe mood music softened momentarily when the debutant Duncan Watmore reduced the deficit with a half-volley following a free-kick but, by then, the contest was long since over."}, {"date": "15/08/2015",

were exemplary when it came to combining good housekeeping with classy football, and Newcastle United’s new manager is unlikely to change his mind after his team’s deserved defeat in south Wales.\n\nSwansea continued where they left off last season, or one could say last week, with Bafetimbi Gomis scoring his seventh goal in his past eight Premier League appearances and André Ayew scoring again after finding the net on his debut at Chelsea on the opening day.\n\nMcClaren pointed to the fact that Newcastle were down to 10 men for most of the match after Daryl Janmaat’s senseless sending off, and said the game was “even” until that point, but the fact is, Lukasz Fabianski was tested only once.\n\nThese clubs were on divergent paths last season, when Swansea were never out of the top 10 and ended up eighth – their best finish in the Premier League. Newcastle, in contrast, trailed in 15th after losing nine of their last 11 matches under John Carver, who, inevitably, was sacked. His successor, McClaren, has spent the thick end of £40m in search of the improvement that is needed if he is not to go the same way, but there was not much sign of it here.\n\nNewcastle were unchanged from their 2-2 draw at home to Southampton; Swansea made one enforced alteration to the starting lineup used in gaining a more impressive point at Stamford Bridge – Jack Cork replacing the injured Ki Sung-yueng in midfield.\n\nJonjo Shelvey and Jefferson Montero were outstanding throughout and Swansea had already tested Tim Krul, with a shot from Gylfi Sigurdsson, before they took the lead in the ninth minute with a goal that typified their delightful philosophy. The move was 20 passes old when Shelvey picked out Gomis, unattended on the 18-yard line, from where the French striker rounded the goalkeeper in expert fashion before slotting the ball into the empty net.\n\nRomelu Lukaku double propels Everton to 3-0 win at Southampton Read more\n\nNewcastle responded with a meaty drive from Gabriel Obertan - their first and last strike of note. Swansea did lose momentum for a spell midway through the first half, but the complexion of the game took a decisive change in the 41st minute, when Janmaat – who had already been booked – received his second yellow card and was sent off for pulling back Montero by his arm and shirt.\n\nGarry Monk described Montero as the most dangerous player in the league in one-on-one situations, after the Ecuador winger had left Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic resembling a tailor’s dummy.\n\nMcClaren said his team had prepared to combat the threat, “but Montero did the same to us”, and when he cut in from the left, past two defenders, he was unlucky when his shot caused Krul’s right-hand upright to shiver, with the goalkeeper beaten.\n\nSwansea were always in control against 10 men and, early in the second half, Sigurdsson went close to doubling their advantage when the Icelander rattled the Newcastle crossbar from the edge of the D.\n\nThe second goal was delayed only until the 52nd minute, when Montero skinned Fabricio Coloccini before delivering an inviting cross to the near post where Ayew rose to head firmly past Krul. McClaren immediately took off his sole striker, Papiss Cissé, and went into damage-limitation mode.\n\nMonk said: “I thought Jefferson was exceptional again. He was always a threat. Their tactic was basically to kick him, but the referee spotted that.\n\n“We dominated the game from start to finish which was very pleasing. I spoke to the players before the game about the need to build on their performance at Chelsea.

They were 2-0 up at half-time, not cruising but largely in control. By the end, their manager, Mauricio Pochettino, was reduced to shaking his head ruefully while a section of their supporters booed in frustration. He and they have seen this all before.\n\nTottenham v Stoke City: Premier League – live! Read more\n\nSpurs failed to win nine of their 19 fixtures during the previous campaign, with six of those ending in defeats. It was a major failing for a team with Champions League aspirations and the signs are that it could be again. They did not lose but it sure felt like they did.\n\nNot so for Stoke, who deserve credit for the manner in which they got themselves back into the contest. Many teams would have given up at 2-0 down but they continued to search for a way back and ultimately got their first point of the season when Mame Biram Diouf equalised with seven minutes remaining. The forward’s near-post header was less than emphatic but it had enough power and direction to beat Hugo Lloris, who twice earlier had denied the 27-year-old with superb point-blank saves in his first appearance since recovering from a wrist injury and being named Tottenham’s new captain.\n\n“It’s the one he didn’t quite connect with that went in,” was the Stoke manager, Mark Hughes’s, assessment of Diouf’s afternoon. “I’m delighted for him, not only for the goal but also because of his workrate. He kept on plugging away and got his reward.”\n\nFor Spurs the equaliser was not only a kick in a teeth but also a poor reflection of their defending, which was suspect for most of this match. Too many crosses were allowed into their area and at the end of both halves the entire team found themselves playing far too deep inside their half. That could be put down to early-season rustiness and tiredness on the part of the players, who regularly looked to press their opponents whenever they had possession.\n\nThat tactic allowed Spurs to gain control early on and they took a deserved lead on 18 minutes when Eric Dier glanced Christian Eriksen’s in-swinging corner past Jack Butland.\n\nStoke would have made it 1-1 just before half-time had Lloris not been on hand to make the first of his eye-catching saves from Diouf, clutching the ball after the forward had headed it at the Frenchman from inside the six-yard box, and shortly afterwards the hosts doubled their lead through Nacer Chadli’s far-post volley.\n\nSpurs looked on course for their first win of the season having lost their opening fixture to Manchester United and would have made it 3-0 through Harry Kane shortly after the break only for Butland to deny him with an excellent point-blank save. Having survived that scare, Stoke then cranked up the pressure.\n\nKey to the swing in fortune were the 59th-minute arrivals of Stephen Ireland and, for his Stoke debut, the Spanish forward Joselu, with the pair playing key roles in the visitors’ goals. Joselu, a £5.75m arrival from Hannover, was tugged back by Toby Alderweireld on 78 minutes for the penalty from which Marko Arnautovic made it 2-1 and Ireland, five minutes later, delivered the cross that allowed the unmarked Diouf to send an already raucous away support into bedlam.\n\nIt had been from an Ireland cross on 62 minutes that Diouf had seen Lloris spectacularly deny him for a second time and make clear why he is a rumoured target for Manchester United.\n\nAnother Spurs player who has been linked with United is Kane and this appearance, his 50th in the Premier League, is not one he will remember particularly fondly. There was that chance to make it 3-0 that went begging and a somewhat leggy performance, which led to him being substituted on 64 minutes.\n\n“He was tired,” said Pochettino, putting that down to the forward having arrived late into the pre-season programme having represented his country at the Under-21 Championship. There was also an acceptance from him that the 22-year-old cannot be expected to carry the team’s attacking burden and that after the arrival of the Cameroon international Clinton Njie from Lyon for £10m, he will be looking to add another forward before the close of the transfer window.\n\nThe Argentinian also needs to look for the answer to why Spurs keep letting themselves down at home. “I am disappointed,” he said. “We must become more consistent.”"}, {"date": "15/08/2015", "arena": "Vicarage Road", "attendance": 20011, "home_team": {"name": "Watford", "lineup": [{"name": "Heurelho

It was scarcely more effective on this occasion, and West Bromwich Albion were grateful that Watford lack City’s fearsome cutting edge as they clung on to a goalless draw.\n\nThere were even a couple of moments in the second half when it looked like West Brom might nick all three points, with their newly arrived record signing Salomón Rondón, having come off the bench to make his debut with an hour played, shooting high within seconds of taking the field and Saido Berahino heading just wide in the 80th minute when presented with the game’s single finest opening.\n\nThis was not a match for any striker to cherish, play being condensed for long periods into the space between the edge of West Brom’s penalty area and the start of the home half. Watford were excellent in every area except in attack, with the defensive midfield pairing of Étienne Capoue and Valon Behrami providing the foundations for a high-octane, high-quality performance that coursed through the side only to peter out when the ball got near the opposition goal.\n\n“Watford didn’t surprise me but they surprised our players‚“ Tony Pulis said. “We talked about Watford starting at a high pace but in the first half they caused us problems, without creating any real chances. They were certainly the better team but Berahino had the best chance of the game.”\n\nThe game could be split approximately into four stages. In the first, Watford had the majority of possession and tried to pass their way through the Baggies’ defence. In the second, they still had the majority of the possession and tried to get in behind the defence. In the third they started taking shots from long range, and finally, in the final 10 minutes, their intensity dipped as it dawned on them that they still had not created any chances and were unlikely now to do so.\n\nNevertheless, the statistics – Watford enjoyed 64.8% of possession and completed 411 passes to their opponents’ 182 – tell a tale of superiority that has not been witnessed from the home side in a top-flight game here for many a year.\n\n“If I have to make a reflection about the match maybe the quality of the crosses is not always the best I saw in my life,” Sánchez Flores said. “But we are happy. We are in balance as a team, we have control of the situation, we have control of the play, and we are going the right way, no doubt about it.”\n\nJosé Manuel Jurado was the outstanding attacking player, an effervescent presence on the left flank for Watford, and he missed perhaps his side’s two best chances, sending a scissor-kick high in the 20th minute and curling a free-kick just wide after half an hour. Their misfortune was that their next best opportunity fell to a full-back, the all-action Allan Nyom, who led a three-on-two break from a West Brom corner but chose to shoot at Boaz Myhill rather than

[]}]}, "report": "The sense of foreboding that surrounded Leicester City after they sent eyebrows everywhere skywards by replacing Nigel Pearson with Claudio Ranieri during a difficult summer has been blasted away by a team whose desire to prove a point has brought them six from their first two matches.\n\nThey played chests-out football at Upton Park and this victory over West Ham United owed as much to their quality in attack as it did to their defensive resolve and togetherness. Shinji Okazaki and Riyad Mahrez scored the goals in the first half, while Wes Morgan and Robert Huth stood firm in the heart of Leicester’s defence when West Ham woke up in the second half and threatened to steal an undeserved point.\n\nRelegation? If Leicester continue to perform with this much cohesion, spirit and belief, they will challenge for a place in the top half.\n\nRanieri, though, refused to get carried away. First appearances can be deceiving.\n\nJust look at West Ham. Hailed after last Sunday’s win at Arsenal, here was a reminder that they remain a work in progress under Slaven Bilic. Asked to seize the initiative and take the game to Leicester, Bilic’s players were worryingly short of ideas and West Ham would be kidding themselves if they think that they do not need to sign another striker and add more incision to their midfield.\n\nThey were too reliant on Dimitri Payet, allowing Leicester to focus on snuffing out the Frenchman’s threat, and ended the game with 10 men when Adrián was sent off in stoppage time for a reckless foul on Jamie Vardy. The West Ham goalkeeper could have no complaints after poleaxing the Leicester striker.\n\n“In the first half we were not good,” Bilic said. “They were more aggressive, they were more aware. Without winning the second ball, there is no chance of winning the game.”\n\nThe early signs were promising for West Ham when Kasper Schmeichel flapped at Payet’s free-kick and was relieved to see Reece Oxford’s header clip the top of the bar in the second minute.\n\nYet West Ham’s fast start created a false impression. They were narrow and one-paced, while it was not entirely surprising that Oxford struggled to replicate his performance against Arsenal. Pedro Obiang replaced the 16-year-old at half-time.\n\nWest Ham played in front of Leicester and the congestion in the middle meant that Payet was suffocated behind Diafra Sakho and the lightweight Mauro Zárate. When Sakho did beat the offside trap just before half-time, he was frustrated by Anthony Taylor’s refusal to award a penalty for what West Ham argued was a clear denial of a goalscoring opportunity by Schmeichel.\n\nLeicester were far more balanced in attack. Vardy’s non-stop hustle earned him a booking for an early foul on Adrián, but it was an effective complement to Okazaki’s nimble movement and it was not a surprise when the latter gave Leicester the lead in the 27th minute.\n\nVardy, who was disciplined by Leicester last week for abusing a fellow gambler in a casino, broke down the left and although Adrián showed wonderful reactions to save from Okazaki, the ball looped into the air and the Japanese striker helped himself to his first goal in English football with the simplest of headers from a yard out.\n\nOkazaki scored 29 goals in 70 games for Mainz. “Shinji smells his way around the box,” Ranieri commented later.\n\nLeicester were rampant, West Ham were ragged. Okazaki and Vardy ripped them apart on the left again 11 minutes later and Mahrez scored his third goal of the season, thumping the ball past Adrián with his left foot.\n\n“First half, we played well,” Ranieri said. “We surprised West Ham. Then I watched my players suffer and fight together.”\n\nThe manager added: “I want to maintain a low profile. We can’t think we are top of the league. We have six points, that is important for us.”\n\nRussell Martin strike sets Norwich on path to crushing win at Sunderland Read more\n\nObiang’s introduction steadied West Ham’s midfield and Payet pulled a goal back in the 55th minute. Cheikhou Kouyaté found him and he swept a wicked shot high to Schmeichel’s right.\n\nThe volume rose and Leicester wobbled. Sakho headed straight at Schmeichel from close range.\n\nSensing that defensive reinforcements were needed, Ranieri took off Okazaki and bolstered his midfield by sending on N’Golo Kanté. West Ham were also targeting Ritchie De Laet and Ranieri replaced the right-back with Yohan Benalouane.\n\nApart from a late chance for Sakho, whose snapshot was saved by Schmeichel, Leicester were comfortable.

"report": "Louis van Gaal has spoken about how away victories can be the cornerstone of Manchester United’s success this season, after so many points were dropped on the road last term, and this was a promising start, if not a wholly convincing performance, as Adnan Januzaj came in from the cold to score the only goal of the game – albeit one that may not be enough to keep him at Old Trafford.\n\nMaking his first club start in more than six months, Januzaj ended a goal drought going back to April 2014 on a night when United extended their extraordinary sequence of results at Villa Park and dampened some of the optimism in these parts after a summer of rebuilding.\n\nUnited have now gone 20 matches without losing in the league at Villa – increasing what was already the longest unbeaten away run in any fixture in top-flight history – and the truth is that Tim Sherwood’s new-look side never threatened to deliver a result to put that dreadful statistic to bed.\n\nAston Villa v Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened Read more\n\nSergio Romero could have taken the night off along with David de Gea, whose future remains shrouded in doubt, as Villa huffed and puffed without success against a United team that played within themselves for long periods. It was a workmanlike performance from the visitors, with little cohesion or fluency to their play, and Van Gaal bemoaned the number of occasions that his players squandered possession.\n\nThe game will certainly not live long in the memory for Wayne Rooney. The United captain has scored more goals against Villa than any other club but he looked strangely out of sorts here. Leading the line, Rooney’s touch let him down at times and he was way off the pace. The fact that he failed to touch the ball in the penalty area until the 93rd minute said it all.\n\nBy that point, however, Januzaj had made his mark and United were well on their way to winning their opening two league matches for the first time since 2011. With two clean sheets also recorded, Van Gaal is entitled to be pleased with United’s start to the season – he made the point that this was a better display than the one against Tottenham Hotspur on the opening day, yet the Dutchman is under no illusions that there is plenty of room for improvement. “We had too many unnecessary ball losses, that was not only Adnan Januzaj, also Memphis Depay and also Wayne Rooney, So we have to improve that,” he said.\n\nVan Gaal had decided beforehand that Januzaj, a surprise inclusion in place of Ashley Young, would only play 60 minutes, but the United manager gave the impression that he was not overly enthused with what he had seen from the Belgium international, who has been linked with a loan move to Sunderland. “It was a wonderful goal Adnan could score, but you have to do more than just score a goal,” Van Gaal said. He also refused to give any assurances that Januzaj would remain a United player. “You will have to wait and see until we close the transfer period,” added Van Gaal.\n\nIt was difficult to pick out a standout performer in such a humdrum game but Juan Mata, deployed on the right to accommodate Januzaj in the No10 role, delivered the best two passes of the night. The first, after a nice exchange on the left involving Depay and Januzaj, led to the opening goal. Another majestic through ball from the Spaniard should have ended with Depay adding a second later in the game but the Dutchman curled wide with only Brad Guzan to beat.\n\nWhile United have maximum points on the board, the real test will be when they come up against a better calibre of opponent. Villa are very much a club in transition and it is clearly going to take time for Sherwood to mould together so many new signings. “They’re still getting acclimatised to England, let alone Premier League football,” the Villa manager said.\n\nVilla’s manager admitted that his team “didn’t carry enough attacking threat” in a match when Romero did not had a shot to save. The only stop of note that the United goalkeeper made was when Gabriel Agbonlahor headed straight at him in the 54th minute.\n\nSherwood highlighted the fact that Carles Gil, Jack Grealish and Amada Traoré, three of his most creative players, were missing – the latter was paraded on the pitch beforehand after completing his move from Barcelona – but he also acknowledged that the second-half introduction of Rudy Gestede had led to his team becoming too direct. “I think when Rudy came on we got a bit obsessed with lumping the ball up to him,” Sherwood said.\n\nThe only real possible moment of concern for United was late in the first half, when Matteo Darmian, the Italian right-back, tangled with Micah Richards in the area following a Villa corner. Darmian had his arms all over Richards and on another day Mike Dean, the referee, could have pointed to the spot. “Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don’t,” Sherwood said. “I’m not going to be sticking pins in the referee tonight.”\n\nJanuzaj’s goal came after the best passage of play in the game. Mata drifted out to the left to deliver the perfectly weighted pass that carved open the Villa defence and picked out Januzaj’s darting run. Richards saw the danger and raced across but failed to apply the brakes and Januzaj, showing some dexterous footwork, checked inside, sitting the Villa captain on his backside in the process, before stroking a right-footed shot that deflected off Ciaran Clark and went in off the far upright."}, {"date": "10/08/2015", "arena": "The Hawthorns", "attendance": 24564, "home_team": {"name": "West

caution attached given we are only in the embryonic stages of the Premier League season. Too much can be read into one match, the warning goes, but it was still a thrilling way to start. City already look better than last season and it is certainly going to be fun finding out if they can continue to play with so much vibrancy.\n\nWhen they pass the ball with this kind of expertise they certainly make it tempting to believe they must have an outstanding chance of taking the title back from Chelsea and the frightening thing, perhaps, for their rivals is that Sergio Agüero played only a peripheral role in this victory.\n\nAgüero was restricted to a substitute’s place because of his lack of match fitness but, even without their goal-scorer extraordinaire, City delivered a performance that was utterly compelling.\n\nThey were two ahead inside the first 24 minutes and, if anything, it was probably just a surprise there were no more goals once Vincent Kompany added the third just before the hour. David Silva was exhilarating and there was the hard evidence here why City were so determined Yaya Touré should not be cut free when the Ivorian’s agent was noisily speculating about a transfer last season.\n\nHis second goal was a beauty and when Touré plays with this almost nonchalant brilliance it makes it feel slightly bizarre his involvement was ever in doubt. Touré looked jaded at times last season, a legacy of back-to-back tournaments in the World Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations but he appears to have been rejuvenated by a lengthy summer break.\n\nSilva tormented his opponents even when Tony Pulis brought on Claudio Yacob in the second half to man-mark him and, presumably, the Premier League’s dubious goals panel will award him the opening goal. Touré strolled around imperiously, making everything look so preposterously easy, and the only minor disappointment for City, perhaps, was that Raheem Sterling could not mark his debut with a goal. The most expensive Englishman in the league ran clear at the end of the first half only for Boaz Myhill to deny him with a fine one-handed save. Ultimately, though, it did not matter a great deal.\n\nSterling played his part and no one should be left in the slightest doubt he has had a summer upgrade. He and Jesús Navas flitted in dangerously from the wings, stretching the play with their width and speed. Aleksandar Kolarov and Bacary Sagna pushed forward from the full-back positions and Pulis must have been startled how straightforward it was for City during those passages of play when the statistics showed the away side had 80% of possession. West Brom were demoralised by the superiority of their opponents and it must have been a sobering evening for Salomón Rondón, watching from the stand after completing his £12m transfer from Zenit St Petersburg earlier in the day.\n\nThe breakthrough came after nine minutes when Navas cut the ball back into Touré’s path and the Ivorian’s shot flicked off two players before trundling past Myhill almost in slow motion. The public announcer was too quick to declare Touré as the scorer. Silva had applied the subtlest of touches as the shot flew under his foot and that little nick took the ball through Craig Dawson’s legs, with the second deflection wrong-footing Myhill.\n\nTouré was substituted before the end because of a slight twinge in his groin but Pellegrini did not seem too concerned it might prevent his midfielder from playing against Chelsea on Sunday. José Mourinho’s team will provide much more robust opponents than West Brom but, on this evidence, the champions may need to put on one of their defensive masterclasses.\n\nIt was too much, plainly, for West Brom and Pulis blamed himself for operating with a 4-4-2 formation, in his desire to partner Saido Berahino with Rickie Lambert, rather than having an extra man in midfield.\n\n“It was the wrong choice and sometimes, as manager, you have to accept the responsibility,” he said. “If anyone is criticised, it has to be me.”\n\nHis system certainly played into City’s hands and Touré had far too much space for his goal as he advanced into the kind of range, 20 yards from goal, where he can be so lethal on his right foot. Touré’s clever little pass, with the outside of his boot, to set up the one-two with Wilfried Bony, was played perfectly.\n\nHis shot was curled into the top corner and even at that early stage, just past the midway point of the first half, it felt like the match had already become an exercise in damage limitation for West Brom. Kompany’s goal came from a Silva corner, going in off the captain’s shoulder, and City looked like a team in a hurry to get their title back."}, {"date": "09/08/2015", "arena": "Emirates Stadium",

of Croatia and there was a bloke with a brolly in front of the opposition dugout. That victory has been freeze-framed on to the minds of England fans and the same will be true of this one for those who follow West Ham.\n\nStoke City 0-1 Liverpool | Premier League match report Read more\n\nBilic’s managerial stint at the east London club is up and running and in fine style after this cool and calculated triumph over an Arsenal team who laboured to turn possession into penetration and conceded a couple of horribly soft goals. Sound familiar?\n\nCheikhou Kouyaté and Mauro Zárate were the scorers but it was impossible not to focus on the misery that Petr Cech endured on his Arsenal debut. The goalkeeper had been plucked from Chelsea in order to cure Arsenal’s neurosis at the back but it was he who looked like the wreck. Cech was at the heart of the collective breakdown on the first goal, when Arsenal took up a high defensive line on Dimitri Payet’s free-kick.\n\nNacho Monreal appeared to be assigned to Kouyaté – this Arsenal team is not blessed with much height on set-pieces – and allowed him to dart unchallenged towards goal. By that time, though, Cech had made the decision to race the significant distance from his line and never looked like getting to the ball first. When Kouyaté did, he had the simple task of heading into the empty net.\n\nThe second was similarly grim for Cech although, once again, he was not alone in the list of the culpable. Aaron Cresswell ought to have been stopped before he entered the area and when Arsenal looked as though they had belatedly snuffed out the danger, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain took a heavy touch and Zárate took over possession. The forward spun and belted in a low shot from outside the area, and time seemed to stand still as Cech failed to read the shot. Perhaps his view was obscured by Laurent Koscielny, and when he did get down and across it was too late. The roar from the visiting enclosure exploded like a firecracker.\n\nBilic was at the Emirates Stadium with Besiktas at the beginning of last season, for the Champions League play-off, when he suffered a narrow defeat and since that famous night at Wembley with Croatia, he had played four away games in England – with Croatia and Besiktas – and not tasted success. It was worth the wait. Bilic got his tactics spot on, with Reece Oxford belying his tender years to produce an assured display at the base of a central midfield three. The 16-year-old’s best position will probably prove to be centre-half but here he helped to nullify Mesut Özil.\n\nWest Ham had a clutch of top-level performances, including one from the new signing at the back, Angelo Ogbonna, but it was the other new boy, Payet, who was the star. The winger was pacy and threatening, and always happy to take responsibility on the ball. West Ham had hardly travelled with optimism, after the Europa League exit against Astra Giurgiu on Thursday night while they had drawn one and lost six of their previous seven visits to this ground. The post-Astra angst was transformed into delight and hope.\n\nNewcastle United 2-2 Southampton | Premier League match report Read more\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain had been quick and direct at the outset – Ogbonna was booked for a foul on him; one of three first-half bookings for West Ham – but Arsenal pockmarked their football with loose passes and, for all their possession, they did not create many clearcut chances. They were largely restricted to shots from distance, with Aaron Ramsey’s deflected effort on 31 minutes looping up and hitting the crossbar, and when they did get into the box Ogbonna and his colleagues stood tall. The Italy international made one important tackle on Olivier Giroud while James Tomkins made another on Özil in first-half injury time.\n\nGiroud remains a frustration for many Arsenal fans, although he almost equalised with a deflected shot after Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cut-back. Adrián, the West Ham goalkeeper, adjusted and made a fine reaction save. Arsène Wenger had started Giroud ahead of Theo Walcott but this was one of those performances that highlighted the club’s need for a world-class centre-forward. Every Arsenal supporter continues to hope they will make a firm move for Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema – in whom Wenger is interested – but the manager was quick, as ever, to say that solutions to a disappointment like this had to come from within the club.\n\nWenger brought on Walcott and Alexis Sánchez in wide areas, and switched Oxlade-Chamberlain to right-back in search of goals.

The politely understated way in which Newcastle United supporters clapped him and his players back reflected a mood of cautious optimism.\n\nThe odd caveat remains but on this very early evidence, Newcastle promise to be infinitely more attractive to watch than last season, with Georginio Wijnaldum and Chancel Mbemba looking very good signings. Less positively, Fabricio Coloccini was, not for the first time, far from convincing, while Aleksander Mitrovic appears to be a young man potentially in need of Alan Pardew’s old anger management counsellor.\n\nSport picture of the day: Chancel Mbemba arrives for dinner Read more\n\nOnly seconds after stepping off the substitutes’ bench, the £13m Serbia striker launched himself into a bloodcurdling challenge on Matt Targett and was lucky to be merely booked. Then, a little later, a player McClaren concedes is possessed by “a little bit of the devil” escaped unpunished after appearing to elbow Maya Yoshida.\n\nMore constructively, Newcastle’s passing was some of the most intelligent seen in months at St James’ Park. For the majority of the game a side building fluently from the back and pressing slightly higher up the pitch seemed in control but during the final 15 minutes tiredness set in as Southampton showed off superior fitness acquired courtesy of their Europa League involvement.\n\nAfterwards McClaren pronounced himself “absolutely delighted” by his first return to a Premier League dugout since swapping Middlesbrough for England nine years ago. “For 75 minutes we were excellent,” he said. “We didn’t play smart after that; I think fatigue had a lot to do with it. Can we get better? Most definitely.”\n\nGraziano Pellè had barely had a touch before he headed Southampton into a slightly undeserved lead from their first serious attempt on goal. Connecting with Cédric Soares’s cross, Pellè showed off immense skill in guiding a glancing header beyond Tim Krul and into the bottom corner.\n\nAlmost immediately McClaren swapped his executive-box seat alongside Mike Ashley for the technical area. If, initially, the new pitch-level view seemed a little depressing, the outlook had brightened appreciably by half-time.\n\nGranted, the otherwise impressive Mbemba at times found himself bullied by Pellè in the air but, generally, Southampton’s was the defence being stretched to the limit.\n\nIt finally snapped when Massadio Haïdara’s cross took a deflection off Sadio Mané and, with Maarten Stekelenburg thoroughly wrong-footed, Papiss Cissé chested in the close-range equaliser.\n\nThe second half had barely begun before Cissé’s chip picked out Gabriel Obertan, who accelerated down the right before providing the onrushing Wijnaldum with an excellent looping cross.\n\nThe £14.5m signing from PSV Eindhoven read it well, evading Stekelenburg’s reach, thanks to his careful placement of a header into the top corner. It was the sort of finish entirely in keeping with Wijnaldum’s influential debut. If his set-piece delivery was not exactly top-notch, the Dutchman’s change of pace as he burst out of midfield persistently discomfited Southampton.\n\nOver to his right Moussa Sissoko’s powerful advances were also provoking problems but a rather more surprising feature of the afternoon was Obertan’s effectiveness in a generally left-sided role that offered Haïdara the security to launch regular attacks from left-back.\n\nArsenal 0-2 West Ham | Premier League match report Read more\n\nDaryl Janmaat, Newcastle’s right-back, is generally stronger defensively but when he permitted Shane Long to meet Dusan Tadic’s cross with an excellent scoring header, McClaren’s hopes of a first victory evaporated.\n\nJohn Carver’s successor was subsequently relieved to see not only Jack Colback’s splendid block prevent the dangerous Mané registering what seemed a certain winner – but also Mitrovic’s avoidance of a red card.\n\nThe former Anderlecht forward’s challenge on Targett could be politely described as scything but, thankfully for the full-back, it resulted in, at most, minimal contact. “I don’t think Mitrovic touched him but if he had, then Matthew was in hospital,” said Erwin Koeman, Southampton’s assistant manager, in temporary charge while his brother Ronald recovers from achilles tendon surgery.\n\n“We were quite fortunate he didn’t get a red, there were would have been no complaints,” said McClaren, who affected ignorance of the subsequent suspected elbow incident. “Mitrovic certainly doesn’t hold back.”\n\nMan of the match Georginio Wijnaldum (Newcastle United)"},

and, for Liverpool, a goal which should have therapeutic effects bearing in mind that the last time they played at this ground Brendan Rodgers had set off for the tunnel at the final whistle looking like a man on his way to the guillotine.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho’s brilliantly taken winner, struck from fully 30 yards, will not expel the memories of that 6-1 drubbing when Steven Gerrard’s final match for the club turned into the kind of harrowing ordeal a man with his history could scarcely have thought plausible.\n\nYet it does help the process of recovery. When Coutinho took aim, four minutes from the end of a hitherto bland and directionless match, the game had been plodding aimlessly towards a point when the Liverpool supporters behind Jack Butland’s goal could have been forgiven for feeling startled by their team’s lack of refinement.\n\nStoke 0-1 Liverpool: five talking points from the Britannia Stadium | Andy Hunter Read more\n\nCoutinho had clearly tired of all the mediocrity and when he collected the ball in the middle of the pitch and suddenly changed speed, driving forward and putting himself within his favourite range, it was the first burst of real penetration and attacking intent there had been in the entire match.\n\nHis accuracy from distance is a formidable weapon for Liverpool, particularly when he is moving slightly infield, left to right and aiming for the top corner, and the shot was struck with a wonderful mix of power and precision. It was the arc of the ball, starting high and then taking a sudden dip, that took it past Butland, even though Stoke’s goalkeeper managed to get his fingertips to the ball. Coutinho had always been the most likely player to bring some light to a grey match and that was the moment when the entire mood surrounding Liverpool shifted and some of the pressure on Rodgers was released.\n\nAt the same time, it should not entirely disguise the fact that the football from both sides had been numbing until that point. Liverpool are still, on this evidence, an awfully long way short of where they were a couple of seasons ago, and for long spells it was not entirely easy to see how they are planning to close the gap on the top four.\n\nThey are still working out how to play to Christian Benteke’s strengths and Adam Lallana cannot expect to keep his place when he operates with so little effect. Jordon Ibe flickered only sporadically and Benteke will need better service from the wide positions if he is to flourish. As it is, the Belgium international looks oddly suited for a team that predominantly likes to come through the middle.\n\nRodgers can be encouraged, though, by the way his side withheld Stoke’s early pressure and gradually showed themselves to be the better team in the second half, even if it was indisputable that his players, in keeping with those of their opponents, ought to have taken much better care of the ball.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brendan Rodgers hails Liverpool’s win at Stoke.\n\nJames Milner had a reasonable debut in the centre of midfield and Nathaniel Clyne showed why he should also be a fine acquisition. Just as pleasingly for Rodgers, Dejan Lovren justified his place in the team with one of his better displays. Lovren was fortunate not to be sent off after rattling Mame Diouf’s jaw with his elbow in the second half, escaping with only a yellow card despite it being in full view of the referee, Anthony Taylor, but it was an improved performance otherwise. Lovren became a symbol of Liverpool’s excesses last season but the £20m signing from Southampton at least offered hope here that he can be the player Rodgers hoped he might be.\n\nStoke will reflect on Glen Johnson’s chance in the first half, when the former Liverpool full-back could not control his shot and put the ball over the crossbar after Clyne had blocked Ibrahim Afellay’s first effort. Mark Hughes was entitled to complain about Lovren’s elbowing offence but the most disappointing aspect for Stoke’s manager must be their inability to cause more problems in the final third of the pitch.\n\nTheir tactic early on was to build on the right, no doubt targeting the 18-year-old debutant in Liverpool’s left-back position. Joe Gomez looked what he was at times: young, inexperienced and still acclimatising to the higher level. Overall, though, the former Charlton Athletic player acquitted himself well. Roy Hodgson, the England manager, was in the crowd and will no doubt see him as one for the future.\n\nAfellay showed some neat touches and Marco van Ginkel, the loan signing from Chelsea, was predominantly involved during the spells in the first half when Stoke did push their opponents back. Yet the home side seldom showed the ingenuity to get behind their opponents. When the two sides played here 77 days earlier Stoke had racked up a 5-0 lead by half-time, the first time that had happened to Liverpool since 1976, but this time Hughes’s attackers had no delicacy around the penalty area.\n\nEverything was rushed and that meant Liverpool’s goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, was rarely troubled and Rodgers could set off down the touchline at the end in a very different frame of mind than the last time he made that walk.\n\nMan of the match Dejan Lovren (Liverpool)"}, {"date": "08/08/2015", "arena": "Old Trafford", "attendance": 75261, "home_team": {"name":

birthday and briefly threatened to break into a few lines from When I’m Sixty-Four, the relevant Beatles song. “When you hear what they are singing,” he said, “all my wishes have been fulfilled.”\n\nLouis van Gaal’s Manchester United show promise but still have work to do | Paul Wilson Read more\n\nWell, not quite. Van Gaal might have liked to see his team zip the ball around with greater panache and knowhow. They are still some way short of the quick, pass-them-to-death tempo that was the hallmark of Sir Alex Ferguson’s great teams and, plainly, it remains a work in progress.\n\n“We were lucky today,” the United manager said. All the same, it was still preferable to what happened a year ago against Swansea City, and a relatively satisfying introduction to the season for a team going through all sorts of drama in their goalkeeping department.\n\nVan Gaal should certainly be encouraged, for all the imperfections, by the way his side ultimately made it an afternoon when Sergio Romero, deputising for David de Gea, was only fleetingly troubled. Van Gaal was less impressed that Michel Vorm was involved so infrequently in the opposite goal, but his team did control long passages of play after Kyle Walker had inadvertently put the ball into his own net midway through the first half and, apart from a late flurry, Tottenham’s response to the goal smacked of a team who are undermined by their fragile nerves.\n\nSpurs did have spells when they looked dangerous, but there were long periods when they were obliging opponents, whereas a better side would surely have made more of the fact that United had a new-look defence, a relative stranger in goal and a distinct lack of options in the attacking positions.\n\nMauricio Pochettino’s team wilted in a way that does not say a great deal for their competitive courage and, having dominated the opening 20 minutes, it was startling to see how passive they became until that late spell of pressure when it seemed to dawn on them again, belatedly, that this United side are nowhere near as formidable as previous versions.\n\nSpurs had started well, but it took them so long to shake their heads clear after going behind that it was not entirely easy to imagine how they plan to narrow the gap to the top four this season.\n\nInstead, United had more of the ball without delivering a performance that was ever more than six out of 10. Ashley Young continued where he left off last season and, on the opposite side, Juan Mata was an elusive and difficult opponent. Memphis Depay showed in little flashes why he was Van Gaal’s first summer signing, but Matteo Darmian was probably the pick of United’s new acquisitions, easing himself in as the team’s new right-back.\n\nLous van Gaal says David de Gea may play for Manchester United again Read more\n\nUnited are still lacking the old stardust, and the tempo can feel bland compared to the pinball speed that once bewitched Old Trafford, but their debutants should all be better for the experience and perhaps it was inevitable that, with four new players in their starting lineup – and Bastian Schweinsteiger coming on in the second half – it would not be an entirely cohesive performance. Van Gaal talked afterwards about the new arrivals being too eager to impress and he was almost certainly referring to Morgan Schneiderlin, at the base of their midfield, and Depay, who was operating just behind Wayne Rooney but might be better on the wing. Too often, they could be seen rushing passes.\n\nSpurs were entitled to feel their luck was out, at least to some degree, but more than anything they should regard it as a wasted opportunity. Here was a United side with De Gea sitting in the stand and Spurs really ought to have done more to examine Romero’s credentials, especially in those moments early on when the Argentinian was misplacing passes and looked like he might be suffering a touch of stage fright. Romero had not played a league fixture since Sampdoria against Udinese in Serie A last December but, after an erratic start, he settled down and made a key save in the final exchanges to turn away Christian Eriksen’s drive.\n\nEriksen will also reflect on Tottenham’s most inviting chance of the opening half, running on to Harry Kane’s clever little up-and-under, and a player of his refinement should probably have applied the right amount of weight to his lobbed attempt rather than landing it on the roof of the net. Otherwise, it was an error-strewn performance from both sides and probably appropriate that the game’s decisive moment stemmed from a moment of carelessness.\n\nSpurs were in danger as soon as Nabil Bentaleb presented the ball straight to Mata and, defensively, they could not get back into position in time. Mata’s pass released Young, criss-crossing to the right, and his low centre picked out Rooney, unmarked on the spot and with enough space to take a touch and steady himself for a shot. The striker was pulling his foot back when Walker, sprinting back, jutted out his foot and diverted the ball into the bottom corner."}, {"date": "08/08/2015", "arena": "Vitality Stadium",

stalked them at every turn and they have wondered whether the locks would be thrown over the gates of the Goldsands Stadium for good, so it was not difficult for them to keep this defeat to Aston Villa in perspective. When you have waited 126 years for your first taste of English football’s top division, you can afford to be patient in the search for your first point.\n\nEverton 2-2 Watford | Premier League match report Read more\n\nIt was deflating rather than devastating for Eddie Howe’s side and their supporters applauded them off the pitch. In the end the difference between the sides was Villa’s greater cutting edge in the cut-throat world of the Premier League and what a source of pride that was for Tim Sherwood after the blow of losing Christian Benteke to Liverpool. Villa’s winner was scored by Benteke’s replacement, Rudy Gestede, in the 72nd minute and judging by the way the travelling fans serenaded the Benin striker at the end, signing him for £6m from Blackburn Rovers could turn out to be a masterstroke.\n\nGestede’s aerial ability will terrify defences and Sherwood’s satisfaction was immense given that he has also had to contend with the sale of his captain, Fabian Delph, to Manchester City.\n\nVilla’s players took their cue from Sherwood’s touchline attire and rolled their sleeves up. The man who wore the armband was Micah Richards and the former Manchester City player was outstanding alongside Ciaran Clark in the centre of Villa’s defence.\n\nBournemouth were full of hope at the start of the day and the din when the teams emerged made it hard to believe that only 11,115 people were crammed inside this tiny ground. This date had been circled in red and black ink ever since Bournemouth sealed promotion in April and the pot was rattling and clattering so furiously that it came as a minor relief when Mark Clattenburg lifted the lid on some of that bubbling nervous energy with his opening whistle. The club who began the 2008-09 season on minus 17 points in League Two were determined to enjoy their day in the sun.\n\nThis was the first test of Bournemouth’s savviness at this level. Their greatest weakness over the course of the season could be their lack of experience; out of their starting 11, only Artur Boruc, Dan Gosling and Andrew Surman had played in the Premier League before. Joshua King was the only one of Bournemouth’s summer signings who started.\n\n“First half we were outstanding,” Howe said. “I was very pleased with the display. We got hit with a sucker punch. We learnt today what the Premier League is all about.”\n\nVilla’s initial plan was to douse Bournemouth’s fire with stifling tactics. There have been significant changes to the side that finished 17th last season and Sherwood gave starts to five of his new signings: Richards, Jordan Amavi, Jordan Veretout, Jordan Ayew and Idrissa Gueye. Amavi did well on the left of Villa’s defence, keeping the dangerous Matt Ritchie quiet. Villa’s secret weapon, Gestede, was biding his time on the bench.\n\nHowever Villa’s quality was poor in the first half. Gabby Agbonlahor fed off scraps up front, Ayew saw little of the ball on the right and the game passed Gueye by in midfield.\n\nBournemouth dominated with the brisk, snappy football that has become their trademark under Howe, although they were restricted to hopeful efforts from long range at first.\n\nGaps appeared towards the end of the first half. Gosling scooped over from eight yards out. Callum Wilson broke and drilled a shot against Brad Guzan’s feet, before the Villa goalkeeper beat away a shot from Marc Pugh.\n\nNorwich City 1-3 Crystal Palace | Premier League match report Read more\n\nVilla had to come out of their shell after the break and Boruc had to save from Gueye. The visitors were on top for the first time and Howe reacted by replacing King, whose end product behind Wilson was disappointing on his debut, with one of Bournemouth’s heroes of last season, Yann Kermorgant.\n\nGestede, who scored 22 goals in the Championship last season, replaced Ayew and soon volleyed just wide in the 68th minute.\n\nFour minutes later, Villa won a corner on the right. Ashley Westwood drove the ball into the Bournemouth area and Gestede exploded, bouncing into the air like a kangaroo wearing a jetpack and battering a header past Boruc. It would have taken a brave man to stop him.

One cost them the Championship crown on the final day of last season. Another, bookending the summer with further disappointment, deprived them of two Premier League points. Silverware was not at stake this time, but the verdict may be that Arouna Koné’s strike was a more damaging leveller, even if the early evidence is that, unlike their predecessors, this Watford team may not beat an immediate and ignominious return to the second tier.\n\nChelsea 2-2 Swansea City | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThey were five minutes from a victory that would have been extraordinary. Not so much because of their history at Goodison Park, which consisted purely of defeats, but because of the scale of the overhaul at Vicarage Road. The division’s busiest buyers have made 10 signings. Their fifth manager in a year, Quique Flores, chose six to start, including three of the back four and both defensive midfielders. The team contained 11 different nationalities, the matchday squad 16.\n\n“So many nationalities, so many players who had not played before,” mused Roberto Martínez. “But Quique Flores is a very good manager and he structures a team very well.”\n\nSo it proved. Watford played with a level of cohesion that scarcely indicated they were strangers weeks ago. The only surprise, given their ruthlessness in looking to upgrade wherever possible, was that both of their goals came from survivors of their promotion-winning campaign.\n\nEach was a strike to savour. Miguel Layún was making only his 15th Watford start but, considering the context, qualifies as one of the old-stagers. He opened his account for the club with their first top-flight goal since 2007. After Troy Deeney had a shot blocked, the debutant José Manuel Jurado crossed from the left, Phil Jagielka botched his attempt to clear and Layún drilled his shot past Tim Howard.\n\nFor an hour, the Mexican appeared the probable match-winner. Then that mantle passed to a colleague. After Ross Barkley levelled, Odion Ighalo had the cheek to dummy his way past John Stones, twisting and turning before defeating Howard. It was the Nigerian’s 18th goal in 20 league games but, after the summer influx and a switch in system, he had been demoted from the starting 11. “He didn’t train during the week,” Flores said. “He was injured.”\n\nEverton have altogether more serious injury concerns. Leighton Baines had ankle surgery in May and could require another operation after he was hurt blocking a shot in training. “That has been a real disaster,” Martínez said. “He was devastated. It was a big knock. It is not going to be two or three weeks. It is going to be longer than that.” Baines is set to miss England’s Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Switzerland but, although the Everton manager wants three more signings, he has ruled out looking for another left-back.\n\nNewcomers have been in short supply at Goodison Park. While Flores confirmed that the Italy international Alessandro Diamanti will become Watford’s 11th recruit, Everton were only able to unveil one arrival, the free transfer Tom Cleverley. Yet paragons of change were pegged back by a club with unwanted continuity. Certainly there were similarities to last season in the febrile mood. Everton were booed off at half-time and applauded an hour later. It was a soundtrack that summed up seesawing emotions.\n\nManchester United 1-0 Tottenham: Premier League match report Read more\n\nBut there is scope for improvement within Goodison. It was highlighted by their scorers, who each have a point to prove. Barkley mustered only two league goals last season but unleashed an unstoppable long-range shot. “Ross Barkley scores a goal that only he can score with that technique and that class, but with the maturity of a new Ross Barkley,” Martínez said.\n\nKoné had struck only once before in his two-year Everton career until the substitute latched on to Romelu Lukaku’s pass and defeated Heurelho Gomes. One of Martínez’s former Wigan charges, he has not been a popular figure with the Goodison crowd. This, his mentor, hopes, will be a turning point. “When he arrived it was like a black cat crossed the road,” Martínez rued. “He got an injury and he never had any momentum or luck. Today he had to win the crowd over and I was delighted.”\n\nHe added: “We showed a performance in the second half that could be an incredible platform to become very good.” As eight of their next nine

I showed the players the mistakes and they are more receptive now when they win.”\n\nAs Ranieri looked on, it was obvious the players had been receptive to what he had said to them prior to kick-off as well. Having survived an early bout of Sunderland pressure when Kasper Schmeichel was forced into making three quick saves from players in red and white, Leicester took a firm grip of proceedings, pressing their opponents into errors right across the pitch and attacking with pace and precision.\n\nVardy opened the scoring on 11 minutes after directing Marc Albrighton’s left-sided free-kick into the far corner before Mahrez made it 2-0 shortly after with a header from another Albrighton cross. The same player then got the third from a penalty he won after being brought down just inside the Sunderland area by, who else, Lee Cattermole.\n\nIt was stunning stuff, a rout inside 25 minutes, and as a raucous crowd chanted “we are top of the league,” Ranieri remained a picture of calm. Inside he must have been ecstatic, however, and in particular as his decision to ditch the three-centre-back formation that had served Pearson so well at the end of the previous campaign and revert to a 4-4-1-1 formation was paying off. Leicester were stretching their opponents out wide while in the centre of the pitch, Danny Drinkwater and Andy King played key roles in the hosts’ high-energy pressing. In front of them, the Japan international Shinji Okazaki was also impressive on his debut for the club, playing just behind Vardy.\n\nThe Tinkerman’s tinkering had done the trick in what was his first match in charge of an English side since being sacked by Chelsea 11 years ago, and it was obvious he was glad to be back. “In my opinion the Premier League is the best league in the world,” said Ranieri. “Today the crowd was amazing. I would like to thank them.”\n\nIt is, of course, too early to hail Ranieri as a success and he was the first to admit that keeping Leicester in the Premier League for a second season in a row will prove challenging. But after a summer of upheaval they have the perfect start, something that cannot be said of Sunderland, who have now gone six consecutive seasons without winning their opening day fixture.\n\nEverton 2-2 Watford | Premier League match report Read more\n\nDick Advocaat claimed afterwards that his team’s performance “scared him” and at times during the first half the 3,000 travelling supporters at the far corner of this ground could have been forgiven for watching proceedings through their fingers. The visitors lacked spirit, urgency and nous going forward while defensively they allowed Leicester to run right through them over and over again, bringing back memories of their 8-0 thrashing at Southampton last season.\n\nThis could partly be put down to Sebastián Coates and Younès Kaboul playing as a centre-back pairing for the first time in a competitive fixture. In truth, however, the whole team was off the pace, and no one more so than Cattermole, who was replaced by Steven Fletcher after just 30 minutes having been utterly bypassed as a deep-lying midfielder. Goals from Jermain Defoe and Fletcher either side of Albrighton’s low finish restored some late pride for the visitors but ultimately they were well beaten.

talk around Carrow Road had been of using Crystal Palace as a benchmark for top-flight consolidation and Norwich City were given a tough lesson in the margins they will have to negotiate if they are to emulate the success of Alan Pardew’s team.\n\nSome of them will lie outside their control. Norwich could have defended better when Wilfried Zaha acrobatically volleyed Palace ahead and their marking was abysmal when Damien Delaney doubled the lead four minutes after the restart, but they were left aggrieved by Simon Hooper’s decision to disallow a Cameron Jerome effort that would have completed a turnaround for 2-2.\n\nEverton 2-2 Watford | Premier League match report Read more\n\nThe referee judged that Jerome’s overhead kick past Alex McCarthy constituted dangerous play, even though the apparently sinned-against Joel Ward seemed to be looking away from the ball. Six minutes had elapsed since Nathan Redmond had pulled a goal back for Norwich and, with 15 to play, the momentum would have been with Alex Neil’s side had the goal stood.\n\n“When it affects the game and affects you getting a point, or maybe three points, then it’s extremely frustrating,” said Neil, whose players had also sought a late penalty for an apparent push by Connor Wickham on Sébastien Bassong.\n\n“If the lad was potentially going to be hurt by Cameron’s leg then it might have been called a foul but I don’t think that was the case. I don’t think his studs or foot are in any danger of hitting the lad and as far as I’m concerned it’s a perfectly good goal disallowed.”\n\nPardew agreed his side, who wrapped things up with a Yohan Cabaye goal on the counter, might have had a let-off.\n\n“In the penalty box, and an overhead kick from a striker going in, I’d be disappointed with that,” he said. “I understand Norwich’s frustration for sure.”\n\nNorwich had warmed to the task with the appetite expected of a promoted side, with Jonny Howson joining the right-back Steven Whittaker in exposing the Palace left-back Pape Souaré.\n\nIt was Whittaker whose centre Lewis Grabban jabbed against a post in front of an empty goal 10 minutes in and, although he was flagged offside, there was no obvious offence.\n\nGlenn Murray should have converted Palace’s first opportunity on the half-hour when, unattended six yards out, he was thwarted by John Ruddy.\n\nThe rebound spun awkwardly and Murray could only hit the outside of the post.\n\nBut the balance had tilted and, if Palace’s 39th-minute opener was not quite on the cards, their threat had been building. Jason Puncheon beat Bassong and chipped to the back post where Zaha squeezed a volley past the scrambling Ruddy.\n\nThe home team’s movement had lost its zip and by half-time they seemed to be exactly where Palace, with Zaha and Puncheon poised on the counter, wanted them.\n\nThe impression was confirmed within four minutes of the restart when Souaré, appearing at the end of a deep Puncheon corner, headed across and the centre-back Delaney scored unfussily. Norwich’s marking was of the kind that does not bode well for a long Premier League spell.\n\nLeicester City 4-2 Sunderland | Premier League match report Read more\n\n“We had more opportunities to score, dominated most of the ball and didn’t get our just rewards at times,” Neil said. “But we didn’t help ourselves at times – some of the goals we conceded were extremely sloppy.”\n\nThere was nearly an instant response when McCarthy blocked from Grabban and then Bradley Johnson’s headed rebound. They then received a lifeline when Redmond, on as a substitute, sent a low 25-yard shot into the bottom corner.\n\nNorwich thought Jerome had completed the turnaround and they came close again when Scott Dann cleared Whittaker’s volley. But their threat diminished and it was left to the understated Cabaye to sweep in a third goal from James McArthur’s pass.\n\n“Yohan needs to gain his power and strength back,” said Pardew. “He’s had nearly a year out of the game – the intensity of Ligue 1 isn’t like this and he didn’t get many games. Once he hardens up and gets six or seven games under his belt we’ll see the old Yohan.”"}, {"date": "08/08/2015", "arena": "Stamford Bridge", "attendance": 41232, "home_team": {"name": "Chelsea", "lineup": [{"name": "Thibaut Courtois", "yellows": [], "reds": [52], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Branislav Ivanovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gary Cahill", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Terry", "yellows": [54], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "César Azpilicueta", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Cesc Fàbregas", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [76]}, {"name": "Nemanja Matic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Willian", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [84]}, {"name": "Oscar", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [23], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [54]}, {"name": "Eden Hazard", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Diego Costa", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}], "subs": [{"name": "Asmir Begovic", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [54], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kurt Zouma", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [76], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ramires", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Falcao", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [84], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "John Mikel Obi", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Loïc Remy", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Victor Moses", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "away_team": {"name": "Swansea City", "lineup": [{"name": "Lukasz Fabianski", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Naughton", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Federico Fernandez", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [30], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Ashley Williams", "yellows": [90], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Neil Taylor", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jonjo Shelvey", "yellows": [18], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Sung-Yueng Ki", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [41]}, {"name": "André Ayew", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [29], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Gylfi Sigurdsson", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jefferson Montero", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [71]}, {"name": "Bafétimbi Gomis", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [55], "missed_pens": [], "sub_off": [79]}], "subs": [{"name": "Kristoffer Nordfeldt", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Franck Tabanou", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Wayne Routledge", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [71], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Eder", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [79], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Angel Rangel", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Jack Cork", "yellows": [45], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [41], "sub_off": []}, {"name": "Kyle Bartley", "yellows": [], "reds": [], "own_goals": [], "goals": [], "missed_pens": [], "sub_on": [], "sub_off": []}]}, "report": "José Mourinho was right. This is the real deal, what people want, what they can’t wait to devour. This was that edge-of-the-seat, don’t-dare-blink, full-pelt competitive heat of football that counts. Every point counts. And here, in quite intense fashion, Chelsea dropped two on game one of their title defence.\n\nJosé Mourinho unhappy with Chelsea medical staff over Eden Hazard episode Read more\n\nAn engrossing match twisted and turned, with both Chelsea and Swansea taking turns to swing their swords, charge on the offensive and retreat to catch their breath. In a topsy-turvy encounter the home team led twice and the visitors bounced back to equalise. It was all played out with a generous twist of drama. The most extraordinary moment denied Chelsea a winning start when Thibaut Courtois was sent off in a reckless attempt to stop Bafétimbi Gomis from advancing past him. Swansea’s powerhouse attacker maintained his composure to tuck away the penalty and earn Garry Monk’s team a proud result.\n\nMourinho had suggested his team would have to offer more to defend the title than to win it, and here was proof of the complexity of the challenge. There was a lot to digest. While Mourinho was at great pains to avoid getting tangled up in another conspiracy fandango so early in the season, in the wider analysis Chelsea sent out mixed messages here. At times they were dazzling, displaying the synchronicity and zest that a confident team of winners can ooze. At others they were frayed, as Swansea strutted their own stuff and exhibited a mix of power and panache to unsettle the best of defences. They also bristled with the desire to win even with 10 men.\n\nChelsea have €25m bid for Baba Rahman rejected by Augsburg Read more\n\nThere was so much to take in packed into the 90 minutes. The opening notes seemed to blend seamlessly from last season’s songbook. Within seconds Eden Hazard – the current Footballer of the Year – was gliding at speed through the Swansea half. Diego Costa, fit enough to reclaim the position he occupies in inimitable fashion, hassled a defender and nudged at the opposition goalkeeper just because he can’t resist it.\n\nOscar crafted the lead midway through the first half. When César Azpilicueta won a free-kick just a fraction outside the corner of the penalty area, the Brazilian delivered with whip and fizz. Both Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic tried to get a nick on the ball, but neither were needed as the ball curled past Lukasz Fabianski.\n\nSwansea, determined to avoid being overwhelmed as they were against Chelsea last season, recovered with character and wit. The sparkling Jefferson Montero stood up a wonderful cross for Gomis, who powered in a header that Courtois reacted to superbly to beat out. André Ayew picked up the rebound and steered in the equaliser, showing neat footwork to carve out space for the shot at the second attempt. The new boy from Marseille was overjoyed.\n\nIt was riveting stuff, and back came Chelsea to retrieve the lead within a minute as Willian’s effort spun off Federico Fernández’s foot and looped over the helpless Fabianski. The game was finely poised. Yet despite moments of excellence from Chelsea, Swansea sensed there were goals to be plundered themselves. And when another one came, it was fuelled by high drama.\n\nChelsea were stunned when Jonjo Shelvey’s delightful chipped pass sent Gomis marauding goalwards. He was met by Courtois, whose attempted tackle caught the Frenchman at thigh level on the edge of the penalty area. The result was a penalty for Swansea and a red card for Courtois. The delay as Asmir Begovic prepared himself to come on and face the spot kick had no ill effect on Gomis. He was coolness personified as he slotted in for 2-2.\n\nMonk felt it was entirely merited. “The message to the team is we can take anyone on,” he said. “I wanted the team to showcase what we can do on the front foot and to come to a place like this, after the goals we conceded last season, we wanted to put that right. It’s just one game, one point, but to come and do it here where we suffered last season should give us confidence.”\n\nMourinho chose not to talk about the red card other than to suggest it “changed everything”. Despite that, both teams had a whiff of winning the game.\n\nManchester United 1-0 Tottenham: Premier League match report Read more\n\nMontero was on a mission to unpick Chelsea at will. Defenders of Ivanovic’s ilk don’t often experience the kind of chasing he endured trying to keep pace with the Ecuadorian’s wizardry.\n\nEven with reduced numbers, Chelsea were able to press and probe, but with wariness of what might befall them at the other end. Could they somehow seize victory from the jaws of difficulty and disappointment? Hazard, who after a bright start had been peripheral by his standards, roused himself to dart into the box and drive an angled shot which hit Fabianski. Hazard began to bewitch Swansea, dominating the momentum almost single-handedly. On came Radamel Falcao to see if he could make the difference.\n\nWhen the stakes overheated, Ashley Williams took a yellow card for hoiking down the increasingly determined Hazard mid-dribble in stoppage time.\n\nAt the end of it all, both teams looked wrung out and exhausted. The fun and games have only just begun."}]
